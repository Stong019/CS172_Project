I talked to my therapist (who I was seeing because husband had me believing I had emotional regulation & communication problems), came armed with research and concrete examples of his manipulative, controlling and demeaning patterns. She was supportive but firm, recommended I reach out to my local DV organization to help me work out a safe exit plan and get legal aid regarding the divorce. She said sooner rather than later. And I trust her. But\u2026\n\nI am stunned. I feel like my whole entire world is upside down. I keep flipping back and forth between \u201cthank god other people can see this too, I\u2019m not crazy and it is that bad\u201d and \u201che\u2019s my best friend, I\u2019m heartbroken and he\u2019s the only one there for me, he needs me and I could never leave him.\u201d\n\nI know I should leave but I don\u2019t know what to do. I just want to talk to him and work it out and this will all just be one big misunderstanding, right? I\u2019m heartbroken. I can\u2019t have kids here, but if I leave I\u2019ll be alone and also probably won\u2019t have kids. And I\u2019ll be broken and ashamed. All those conversations. He\u2019s going to want me back or want an explanation.\n\nI really think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hung up on the most. He has so little emotional awareness that I KNOW he won\u2019t have any idea what I\u2019m talking about. I know he\u2019ll think I\u2019m crazy. I want him to know what he\u2019s done but he just\u2026 he\u2019s not going to. He might not ever understand. \n\nWe\u2019re so happy so much of the time, I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\n\nAnyways, hi, worst update. But you all were right. \n\nFor anyone in a similar situation, Lundy Bancroft\u2019s \u201cWhy Does He Do That?\u201d was very eye opening and described him in ways I couldn\u2019t articulate on my own. He fits the profile of the Water Torturer perfectly.\n\nAdditionally, very very helpful these past few days: The Hotline (looks like I can\u2019t link, but you can search.) They have a text or chat service, and for anyone out there like me, it\u2019s not \u201cjust\u201d emotional/verbal abuse, it\u2019s abuse and they are there to help and support. I spent a few hours over a few days just talking through things with people who really understood and it was exactly what I needed. Please reach out if it\u2019s something you need.\n\nTL;DR My husband isn\u2019t mean, he\u2019s verbally abusive. Don\u2019t know what\u2019s next.",

            "I completely understand why you want him to accept and understand and admit what he\u2019s doing, but he almost certainly won\u2019t. You don\u2019t need him to validate it to know what\u2019s going on, because YOU know.   \n\nYou will be ok. But you need to leave.",
            "I saw your original post and tbh, this is the best thing you're doing for yourself.\n\nNever mind the age gap, it's so clear that he spent 10 years breaking you down and tearing apart your confidence that you think at 31 years old, you'll be broken and alone. You won't be. No matter what he says, you are deserving of love and kindness, and not whatever this man was doing to you. You don't deserve a man who treats you like that. You deserve someone who you know you can have kids with without asking to stop behaving in a blatantly harmful way.\n\nYou will find someone! You will be okay!",

            "In your other thread, in response to a comment you justified yourself by saying \n\n> But it\u2019s me, not a child. I\u2019m a full grown adult who got herself in this spot. He didn\u2019t say those to a child, and if he had it would be different. \n\nI just wanted to let you know that you need to let yourself off the hook for a bit. You were **indeed** a child (well, a teenager) when this grown-ass 30 year-old walked into your life, dazzled you and made you feel special in ways only someone with much more life experience can, and didn't even give you emotional room to grow into a person who could see that was he had been doing all along was indeed abuse.\n\nYou're 31 now. Take a look at 20 year-olds today. Do you feel you have anything in common with them? Can you picture attempting to get into any sort of romantic relationship with a 20 year-old boy? Do you feel that'd be fair, that you'd be in any way equal, that he'd have any chance of knowing what was going on at the time?\n\nThis is what your husband did to you. And he did it to you because no woman his own age would have taken his \"lol joking\" bullshit.\n\nI know you've had a **rough** week during which a relationship you thought was \"mostly fine, most of the time\" got revealed to be something much more grim for your future and expectation of happiness. I don't intend to pile onto that. You'll need a bit of time to assimilate all of this, to heal, and eventually, to rebuild your life. \n\nI just want to help you shut down that part of your mind that's still going \"but he's my best friend! The poor guy surely doesn't even know that what he's been doing is wrong!\". There is no excuse. Everyone has to find their own way in life; it's his responsibility as a grown-ass adult to choose to better himself if he finds himself having trouble relating to mature women. You bear no responsibily for this. I understand you're afraid, because, very unfairly, he witheld your chance to experience adulthood as a single woman.\n\nTake care.",
            "I just wanted to say that the belief that if you leave you will be alone and not have children is a false belief. I divorced when I was 33, had no kids. I felt exactly like that. A year after I was in a stable, loving, great relationship with a new man and got pregnant. We now have a son and are thinking about trying for another one. I\u2019m 37 now. It\u2019s not too late. This relationship is so much better and more loving than my marriage and I would never have known that this was possible if I stayed married. \n\nMy ex husband wasn\u2019t emotionally abusive but very emotionally closed off. It helped me to think that he acted like he did because he didn\u2019t have the capacity to do it any other way. I could not fix him or just use the right words and then he would understand and act differently. He didn\u2019t have the capacity. I could not provide that capacity for him. It was on him.",
            "The comments pointing out the difference in your age gap are spot on. I guarantee that when you leave, your hopefully-soon-to-be ex will start dating young women in their early 20's. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause young adults are vulnerable. They're trying to finish growing up but lack life experience. They're easy to manipulate and train into an abuser's desired behaviors, just the way puppies and young dogs are. \n\n\"You can't teach old dogs new tricks\" is a saying not because old dogs can't learn, but because it takes so much longer to convince them to change their behaviors. But.\n\nYou aren't a dog. You're a human being--with agency.\n\nAge gaps don't necessarily mean a problem. My dad was 36 when he married my 22-yo mom. I grew up in a loving, supportive home, with a tight-knit sibling group. When my dad developed Alzheimer's disease, the one person he never forgot he loved (even if he couldn't always say her name) was his wife. He was the kindest, gentlest man I've ever known, and my brother is the same.\n\nBut in your case, it put you at the mercy of a manipulator.\n\nAs far as having kids? My mom was 40 when she had my youngest sibling. One of my older sister's friends had an oops baby at 56 because she thought she was done with menopause.\n\nAt 31, you're just entering the age when your generation is having children. There's no need to despair. My dear friends' daughters had their babies closer to 40 than 30.\n\nIn my case, the older I got the less I wanted to go through pregnancy or childbirth--I say \"less,\" but I never actually *wanted* to be pregnant or give birth It was just what people did. \n\nI never really wanted to be a parent, ever. I knew just how much work it would be and I didn't want it. I learned, about myself, that I just am not a caretaker. I can do it in short bursts, but not over a decades-long haul.\n\nLeaving my abusive relationship at 29 and spending time living alone helped me figure out my own strengths and weaknesses, what I wanted *my* life to consist of. I started applying higher standards to the people I let into my life, and tried to live up to them myself.\n\nI am happily retired, childfree, and single. I share an adult family of choice with a sibling, their partner and another close friend. None of us wanted or have children at all. My AFoC also includes siblings and a network of friends who lasted through the decades.\n\nYou may feel like you're running out of time. But if you leave this relationship, you'll find you have all the time you need to find out what *you* really want out of life.\n\n*Hugs* and good luck to you!",

            "> He\u2019s going to want me back or want an explanation.  \n\n...and you can just say no. His demands for an explanation are a continuation of the abuse, a continuation of the efforts to control you. It's a way of saying, you're not allowed to make decisions for yourself unless you justify to *him*, to *his* satisfaction, that you have an argument that *he* thinks is good enough.  \n\nBut the reality is, you can - and should - just say \"no\" to his demands, and that is enough. He's not entitled to an explanation, and when he demands one, you're absolutely in your rights to just say \"no.",

If your husband said to you \u201cyou do x thing and it hurts me, could you please stop?\u201d You would try your absolute hardest to stop it, because you care about him and love him and don\u2019t want to hurt him. This isn\u2019t an emotional intelligence problem, you are spelling it out for him yet he continues to do it KNOWING it upsets you. He is hurting you intentionally because he thinks it\u2019s funny. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. \n\nI really feel for you OP, Its so hard leaving someone after so long as we feel like we\u2019ve invested so much into a relationship (the sunk cost fallacy) and sometimes it feels easier to stay, although There\u2019s no point continuing to build a house on foundations that are already broken.\n\nThe fact you\u2019re saying that \u201cI won\u2019t have kids here, but if I leave I\u2019ll be alone and also probably won\u2019t have kids\u201d just goes to show how broken your self esteem is. You are still so young!! Your life isn\u2019t over and you still have time for children with someone much better for you than this guy. \n\nThings feel awful now, and it will be rough, but it\u2019ll be short term pain for long term gain. Once the rose tinted glasses come off and you meet someone who treats you like royalty, you\u2019ll wonder how you never saw him for what he really is.",
            "So 31 is not old!! I kept reading your post and was thinking of someone who was pushing 40, because that's how old you were making yourself out to be. Then I realized, youre only two years older than me! I haven't even finished college yet! There's time to find a better man and have a kid. My mom had me at 41.\n\nThe thing is, if you don't get out now you're just gonna waste even more years on him. The best time to leave him was years ago, the second best time is right now!\n\nAlso, I want you to realize that you have worth. I read your comments in the old post and you kept making excuses for him. Like it was ok for him to say those things to you because youre not a child. No, its not ok. You have the same worth as a child. Remember that you dont deserve to be spoken to like that.\n\nAlso, he's totally gonna pretend to not understand why you're leaving him. He knows damn well what he's done, it's just a manipulation technique to play ignorant. Don't fall for it. Just leave him, he'll know why",
            "i'm so proud of you for realising the situation you're in, i read your first thread and was worried for you. i have had to get out of a couple of abusive relationships before, they all tend to follow almost the exact same playbook so there is a lot of information out there in regards to leaving. i know you want him to know what he's done and how he's hurt you and it's a tough pill to swallow but he's already shown how little he cares about hurting you by actively making the choice to continually do it, he isn't going to start now. he will probably try his hardest to keep control of you and make big promises about changing and try to manipulate you into staying and you have to be strong and not fall for the bullshit, because it is bullshit. you don't even owe him an explanation as to why you are leaving so he can try and twist it into a negotiation, you're allowed to just leave. plenty of women are having children later on, my mum didn't start until she was in her late 30s so don't add that extra stress on yourself at the moment. you're doing all the right things by going to therapy and the support line and reading up and educating yourself on these kinds of relationships, you're going to be ok! it's going to be difficult but the immense relief once you are finally out will be so worth it. you can take your time to get your ducks in a row and make a solid plan. i think it's a big headfuck when you're a normal and caring person to conceptualise how someone could be approaching their relationships in such a wildly different way to you, good on you for taking the first steps toward freedom",
            "Hey there! I know it's hard right now, incredibly hard. But being alone isn't as scary as you might think. You will have the chance to find yourself again and to work on who you want to be. You can go and have fun without having to compromise with a partner. And you won't have to tolerate any treatment by your partner, just because you love them. \n\nYou say you can't have children if you leave now. But you can't have children now either, not when your husband abuses you and would absolutely abuse his own children as well. If you have children with him, he will abuse them and you could never cut contact to him fully because of the children. \n\nMy parents met when they were about your age, and they clicked and had me four years later at 35. You still have time to find someone good for you to have children with. And if you don't find someone before your biological clock ticks out, you can look into fostering and adoption. You could even get pregnant on your own if you have the resources. You don't NEED this abusive person of a husband to fulfill your dream of being a mother. And he would not give you what you want. Any day you stay with him is a day where he can abuse you and break you down further. \n\nAbout the divorce and divorce talks: talk to a lawyer and get your affairs in order before you tell him. Think about money (do you have a separate account, do you have an income, what would you need to find another place to live), important documents, items you don't want to lose. You don't OWE him a lot of talks about this. Chances are, he won't understand what he is doing. He would've changed his behavior if he knew and cared, but he most likely just doesn't care and doesn't WANT to care because it means effort and guilt for him. \n\nIf you can, talk to friends and family about his behavior and that you need a place to stay for sometime until you get on your feet. \n\nYou can try to explain to your husband why you're divorcing him. (don't make it a debate. He will think he can sway you into not divorcing, but if you don't divorce, you WILL be stuck with this abuse forever. He's not going to change.) You should however be ready to leave in case he escalates. Tell someone you trust when you're doing the confrontation, and tell them that they should come over if you haven't told them that you're safe within the next three or four hours. \n\nI'm so sorry that you're going through this. \nThe rest of your marriage might have been happy, but deal breakers exist for a reason. And abuse should definitely be a reason to break the deal of marriage. He broke his vows first by abusing you. \n\nGet help in your support system (friends, family) and talk to them. You don't have to do this all on your own.",

If you don't want to watch the comedy stuff, fast forward to 31.24 I think is a good start!",
            "The Water Torturer\u2019s driving belief is that as long as he remains calm then nothing he does can be called abuse. He does not raise his voice or his fists. He may occasionally use low level physical abuse such as blocking a doorway to prevent escape or following his partner around the house. He usually will not cross the line into hitting, kicking, slapping, etc.\n\nA Water Torturer will be incredibly cruel without ever losing control. He proves that abuse is not born from anger or losing control.\n\nThe Water Torturer, like Mr. Right, is an expert at twisting his partner\u2019s words or taking them out of context. His goal is to make her (and anyone else witnessing the event) feel like she is the abuser. His relentless sarcasm, derision, mimicking, laughing at her, and other emotional assaults push all the right buttons to make her lose her cool.\n\nThe Water Torturer genuinely believes that there is nothing wrong with his behavior. Since he subscribes to the idea that abuse has to include raised voices and physical assaults he thinks his actions are normal and acceptable. This makes him especially dangerous to the emotional health of his partner, because there is no way for her to communicate her pain to him in a way he will listen.\n\nWhen the Water Torturers friends, family, and even children see him remain calm while his partner is yelling or crying they come to believe his assertions that she is the problem and he is innocent. He is especially dangerous in custody situations where it is easy for him to find plenty of witnesses, often even his own children, that will attest to the fact that he never loses his temper, but mom is always angry and out of control.\nThe Partner of the Water Torturer\n\nIt often takes years for the Water Torturer\u2019s partner to figure out what is going on. A woman living in this type of relationship tends to blame herself. After all she was the one who \u201clost her temper\u201d or refused to continue the conversation.\n\nAfter a conversation with the Water Torturer his partner is left feeling agitated and confused. What went wrong? Why can\u2019t she just control her emotions? Why is it so dang hard to explain to anyone why she is so hurt? What exactly is going wrong here!?\n\nOften the partner of the Water Torturer will apologize for their part of the argument expecting reconciliation. Instead she will just receive a further emotional beating as her abuser rubs in just how wrong she was and may demand even more of an apology or refuse the one she gave.\n\nWhen the partner of a Water Torturer leaves the relationship she may experience delayed anger and rage. As she gets out from under the fog of his verbal assaults she is able to identify the abuse more clearly. The anger that wasn\u2019t safe to show while in the relationship can bubble over. She may experience this anger coming out sideways at people who don\u2019t deserve it.",
            "I'm so glad you recognized this before you had kids. It's not really widely recognized that emotional and verbal abuse is domestic violence. \n\nPart of the abusive cycle is the belief that you aren't worthy or loveable by anyone else. And under that is ultimately his own fear that he isn't good enough for you, or someone else whose self-esteem hasn't been destroyed by years of abuse.\n\nEnding the cycle is good for him as well. Whether he is able to realize that and grow is up to him.",
            "My heart goes out to you.  From the point you're at, to done, I gotta warn you, it's a long haul.   \n I still feel like he's not \"done\" with me and we finalized the divorce in 2009!\n\nBooks help, and I'm glad you found one that resonates so well with you.  It's crazy to have reality be revealed and come to realize how brainwashed we were.  Crazy to see how text book the abuse is.  Classic, predictable - to anyone who's been through it before, but not to those smack in the middle of it all.  Damn.  You seem to be handling that part well.\n\nNext thing to do is get those ducks in a row.  Study the law of your state.  Study the lawyers.  Get one familiar with abuse (they lie, so do extra work finding the right lawyer).  Go to an accountant.  There exists ones that specialize in divorce (protect assets).  \n\nIf he hasn't declared it yet, this will be all-out war.  Mine told me that he was going to F with me for the rest of my life.  He reiterated that to my father.  He held true to that one promise.\n\nWrong promise, dude.\n\nBut anyway, he continued to alienate me from my kids.  In 2020, I even moved 800 miles away to start a new life (last kid went to college).  He still managed to f with me even up until last summer - he found who I was dating and made contact to push his negative agenda about me upon him.\n\nI am finally safe and secure, but I gotta say, I have personal safety methods in place in case I'm ambushed.\n\nYes, I divorced him and I'm gone, but he will forever influence my actions as long as he remains on the same planet as me.\n\nGet your support people prepped, educated and at the ready.  They will help with the hard stuff, and when all the little things overwhelm.\n\nYou can do this.  Go!  Fly and be free.  It's tough, but imagine your life if you stay.  I can't.\n\nBest wishes.",
            "Congrats on coming to this conclusion! I'm stuck in an emotionally abusive relationship myself, and this gives me so much hope you don't even know. I keep telling myself: over and over and over: \"It is better to be alone than to be with someone who doesn't respect you.\" My partner has moved to another country and I feel so much lighter. I can just put them on Do Not Disturb. Working on getting out. I'll get there. You can too. You're only 31. You can still raise children either alone or with someone who treats you with respect.

At 31 you have your whole life ahead of you; wouldn't it be a waste to spend it on someone who doesn't value you?\n\nFor what it's worth, I think you should reexamine the \"I'm a sensitive person\" statement in your original post. Very often I've seen it brought up by women who were either *told* they were like this, or who use it to wrongly describe perfectly normal reactions. You aren't \"sensitive\" when you ask to be treated with respect, nor are you \"sensitive\" when you get upset that your husband is bringing you down.\n\nTake as long as you need to bounce back from this. I know you feel like you're running out of time to have kids, but you owe it to yourself first and foremost to build your confidence back up.",

            "He gets tremendous benefit by pretending to be stupid and 'not understanding' the impact of his words. He knows, but he has you convinced that he doesn't, and he will never admit that he does. If you understood that he knew all along, there's no chance you'd stay.",
            "Hi OP, I don't know if you'll see this but I want to give the perspective of someone who is in a relationship where \"mean\" jokes are our form of banter and what that might look like when it doesn't come from an abuser.\n\nFirst of all, it's a back and forth. We both make those kinds of jokes to each other. \n\nSecond, it's never about anything real that the other person might actually be insecure about. I've gained about 35 lbs in the 6 years of our relationship and he would never joke about it. I would never poke at his insecurities about impostor syndrome. There are some topics that are borderline and are only joked about occasionally and with a clear, over the top indication that it's a joke. We would never make mean spirited comments about each other's appearance. Why in the world would I bring up his acne if there's literally nothing he can do about it? Why would he tell me he thinks I look frumpy in an outfit if I like it and feel good in it?\n\nAnd finally, the jokes are never a get-out-of-jail-free card for hurting the other person's feelings. If we joke about one of those borderline topics or a fresh topic, we'll immediately say \"too far?\" to gauge if the joke did hurt. Even unprompted, the recipient can always tell the other that the joke was too far or too mean and it results in an apology. There's none of the \"it was just a joke\" nonsense. Joke or not, we don't want to hurt each others feelings and will apologize if we do. There was even a period of time when he was working through some things in therapy and was especially not OK with jokes. He asked me to limit those jokes and I dialed it down several notches for a while.\n\nIn short, we don't use the jokes as a way to hide genuinely mean feelings or comments. And we don't use them as a shield against hurt feelings.\n\nAll this is just to add another piece of confirmation that he isn't just making mean jokes, he's abusive.\n\nAnd in regards to leaving: I know you know this but there's no amount of talking that'll make this better. You said it yourself, he will have no clue what you're talking about. And how is he ever going to change if he is fundamentally incapable of even seeing the problem? It's like asking a color-blind person to erase green marks on a red wall. You've told him before that it hurts you and he's chosen not to even try to do anything about it. You shouldn't need urgency or a helpless child to convince someone to not engage in actions that hurt others. If you even want to try to give him an explanation, don't talk about the comments themselves, talk about your reactions. Talk about how you repeatedly told him he had hurt your feelings. Whether he thinks it's from you being \"too insecure\" or \"unable to properly emotionally regulate\" his response should never have been to just be ok with continuing to hurt your feelings.\n\nBest of luck to you, I hope you're able to leave soon and find a partner that you want to have children with. 31 isn't old. You still have plenty of chance.",

For the past 10 years he's treated you like dirt with his words and has no inclination to change. I just read your other post and along with the mean teasing behavior the fact that he's witholding intimacy from you is a HYUGE red flag. That is NOT someone you want to have children with. I hope you gain the strength to put yourself first.",
            "Wow I read the Original post and I've never read someone make so many excuses for their partner on why their behavior is acceptable yet they had a problem with it. OP had no problem with their situation until they thought about what if it was their child. I think this empathy excercise is good, \"if my spouse treated my friend or loved ones the same way as me, would I think it's fine\"? \n\nI want to preface that it's no fault of someone to be in an abusive relationship and not know it. Just pointing out this is a really good way to see the OP pov of how tolerable all of his actions are. \n\nIf I were to take the justifications of his actions at face value and he really was a great supportive husband then couples therapy with individual therapy might have worked. But it sounds like they got into a relationship where OP never get to know themselves as an individual yet and grow a shiny talons and claws to throw it right back at him and see how he likes it haha. If it's a joke to him then it's fair game joke right back at him.",
            "I was reading through some of your comments and just wanted to respond to your specific point about how \"it's been 3 days and he hasn't said anything mean in that time\" - I honestly think that's because you have made yourself so small around him. What would happen if you just acted like your true self, whoever that may be? I'm guessing he would ridicule you back into being the shell of yourself.

Know how you feel is different than what you know, and what you have to do. When I was in this situation, the Hotline was incredibly validating, but it did take time for me to not feel so overwhelmed and act.

That *too old* thing is probably him inside your head, it\u2019s insidious how abusers are able do that but once you get away for a few months you\u2019ll see how utterly ridiculous everything he says was. \n\nMost of the parents at my bougie preschool started having kids in their late 30\u2019s / early 40s. You know what this has meant? They can afford the extras. Nannies. Extra help. The good wine. \n\nThink back a few generations to your great grandmother\u2019s era, how old was she when she was still having children? I will bet it\u2019s her 40\u2019s. Mine gave birth to her youngest at 49. \n\nNow remember the unbelievable gift you are giving your child by not saddling them or their mother with a torturer. No child can watch a parent be emotionally abused and grow up happy with that. The simple truth is that your husband is not part of a happy family. Good for you for recognizing that before he had a child to mistreat as well.",

I got out of that relationship, but I was 47. Am 49 now. \n\nI never got to have kids and raise them in a loving committed marriage. But you are so young! You have time.

Stay strong. \n\nAfter the first month, you will start to see how much better you feel without having to walk on eggshells. Wondering what little thing will set him off. Wondering how to have a real conversation about tough subjects without setting him off. You will still think about him every day...but you will also be seeing improvements in your life.\n\nThen one day, maybe 2 months in, you'll wake up one day and think \"Oh gosh. I didn't think about (ex) once yesterday! That's a first!\" And eventually it'll be 2 or 3 days...and you'll be on your way. You can do this!\n\nAlso, my ex was my 'person'.

BUT I couldn't bring children into that environment. Never having children is the single biggest regret of my life. I think about it every single day. Eventually my anger and resentment for not having kids destroyed my love for him. I couldn't even look at him any more, and found myself 'living' at my office, working 70 hour weeks, coming home only to sleep. I didn't end up with the guy or kids. Ymmv.

Many abusive people will not do this because they don\u2019t want to do the work to change.

            "One of the hardest things to do is to accept that the analysis your mind is outputting isn't trustworthy. You can look at a situation from any number of angles and keep coming to the same conclusion. You'll think, \"I'm being logical about this, so I should trust that\". There can be multiple reasons why your mind is doing this; for the moment though, they are less important. What is important is it sounds like you've accurately conveyed the situation to someone you trust (your therapist), and are being told things are not as they seem. You have to squash/ignore/sideline the instinct to disagree with that person's analysis and just follow it. Go on autopilot. You will feel weird, dumb, angry, and confused. Look at it this way though; you've already trained yourself to think that the current situation is acceptable. This happened over some period of time. You're just doing the same process in reverse, so naturally, it will take time as well.",
            "I'm 31. I just had a baby, and honestly I'm planning on this being the best decade of my life- I'm much more mentally sure, emotionally stable, aware of what I want and how to get what I want. I dunno if I'll have any more biological kids, but I may be a surrogate for a close friend in a couple years. Another very close friend had her first kid at 34 amd is about to have her second (tomorrow!!) at 38. Nothing is stopping you from having kids besides an abusive spouse who would be a bad father. I know you think he'd be fun and sweet with kids, but allowing children to see how he treats you is abusive. They'd either think it's ok to be treated that way, or to treat people that way. Either is unacceptable. \n\nMy husband is my teammate, partner, primary support and he feels terrible if I bring something up that hurt my feelings that he did. I'm sure you're like I was- before meeting my husband, I never had a supportive relationship. I know my exes loved me, truly- but love IS NOT ENOUGH. You now how people say relationships are hard? They don't mean the relationship is actually hard. Its easy to be with the right person- it just means you need to keep trying, keep being thoughtful, not take them for granted. It doesn't mean you have to deal with constantly being put down. It doesn't mean you have to fix your flaws before demanding that unacceptable behavior be fixed. My best friend finally told me months into dating my now husband Hey, stop waiting for the other shoe to drop. Maybe it really is that easy, maybe he really is that kind. And she was right. \n\nIf a therapist is telling you to get out, GET OUT. I know you think you owe him an explanation, but you don't. You've given him the explanation a bunch of times, you've told him how you feel, he has *chosen not to listen*. You can tell him,  if you'd like, hey, I asked you for a decade to be kinder to me. You never changed it. Even if you fixed it 100% and changed it tomorrow, it'd be too late, you've hurt me so badly that I don't have appropriate boundaries anymore, my self esteem is trashed, and I wouldn't be able to trust you soon enough to have children with you. I hope you fix it for whoever you date in the future , but it won't be me.\n\nReach out and tell your support people- family. Friends. Whoever. Tell them the details so they don't let you stay with him or go back to him. It's nothing to be ashamed of- love does crazy things to our brains and you've adapted. Your brain has worked around things for years so that you could emotionally survive where you are because that's how you were living. You don't have to do that anymore. You don't have to be embarrassed about the fact that you loved so deeply that you overlooked flaws. You're a kind and loving person. The only thing to do now is extend that same kindness to yourself. It will hurt. Breakups are legit one of the most painful things you could ever go through as a human. It will get better though. In 10 years when you look back, probably with children and a kinder partner, you'll be shocked at how happy you can be. I'm rooting for you OP. Keep reading Why Does He Do That, remind yourself that you're deserving of kindness and love just like anyone else no matter what, and go live your life.",

My dad was verbally abusive to my mom. Not physical, just little rude comments here and there. Her hair didn't look good, her cooking sucks, she spends too much on grocery shopping... she couldn't do anything right. And it really affected me as a child. It hurts to see your mom not be respected.\n\nThere were also times when I would be rude to my mom because I emulated my dad's treatment of her. I told her her makeup doesn't look good when I was feeling salty. I feel really terrible about that now. Luckily we have a fantastic relationship now because I'm obsessed with her, but it could have gone in a different direction where I chose to be verbally abusive to people around me because, hey, I thought that's just how people treat each other. She eventually left him after wasting 20 years with him. It's good that you are seeing your worth earlier than she did. Also as a side note, my mom had my brother at 40 and then me at almost 43, so you still have PLENTY of time to find a respectful, kind partner and have kids.\n\nWhen you find somebody who is kind, loving, and compliments how cute you look in your top instead of laughing at you, you're going to look back and wonder how you ever stayed married to this garbage person. I say WHEN, not IF you find somebody, because the dating pool is always way bigger than you think, and you will absolutely have your happily ever after.",

The lessons I've learned:\n\n1) There is nothing more valuable than your own peace. When you are so used to constant verbal abuse, a room to sit in quiet at night is bliss.\n2) Being alone is so, SO much better than being with someone who disrupts your heart and mind. \n3) Never ask, beg, or look for love in someone. If it was there, you wouldn't have to. \n4) When you find the heart meant to love you, it will be fierce. It will be chemistry on fire, and your safe place all at once. Real love won't make you question yourself or make you feel badly, but constantly remind you how amazing you are and make you a better version of yourself. Don't settle - I promise being alone is way better than what you're doing now, and better than anything that is less than a love you deserve. You have plenty of time for children.

            "I don\u2019t know, I find on Reddit that responders almost always react with OMG, you must leave him now!!! It has become a tiresome clich\u00e9. I\u2019ve also found that female therapists often do the same. There are levels of flaws that people have and some are tolerable and changeable and some are not. The examples you gave are passive aggressive jokes, and are not acceptable, but not to the level of becoming hysterical about it. You don\u2019t have to run out the door as if he is about to murder you. I no longer see female therapists, because three out of four of them are over-reactive. And it never fails that when you ask them, they admit that they are never married or recently divorced.  And they seem to want you to join their club. \n\nMy current boyfriend made similar passive aggressive jokes, and I got to where I confronted him every time he did it. He eventually got the message and stopped. It was a bad habit that he developed because basically he was frightened of saying what he wanted. So he would say it sideways with these indirect \u201cjokes.\u201d I urged him to just tell me outright what he wanted. And I resolved not to \u201chear\u201d any message that was delivered via these \u201cjokes.\u201d If he doesn\u2019t tell me directly what he wants, I do not hear it.\n\nI\u2019m actually more concerned about the fact that you said that you never had sex and that you went to a counselor because he had convinced you that you were the problem. That is much worse in my opinion. \n\nLeaving your longtime lover is a big decision and does not need to be taken suddenly just because people on Reddit have suggested it, OR because a counselor (who may have an agenda herself) has urged it.",

            "My ex would be mean to me and do things he knew I found annoying because he got a kick out of it whenever I'd finally snap. He literally told me as much. When I finally dumped him he had NO UNDERSTANDING of the pain he'd caused me. He ranted to everyone we knew about how terrible and wrong I was. He started hating all women in general and became pretty mysoginistic. He stalked me for a while and then he eventually reached out to apologize and blew up at me for not accepting his apology. Why? Because he wasn't apologizing for my sake, he was apologizing to soothe his own conscience. He *still* didn't care about how he'd fucked me up, even when he was apologizing to me for doing it.\n\nYou might want your husband to understand the pain he's caused, but the fact is that he either never will, or he does and he doesn't care because it's been entertaining for him.

            "I was in a 22 year marriage with a man exactly like this. He would make cruel comments and little digs then when I reacted he would berate me for \"not being able to take a joke\" or \"being too sensitive.\"  It took me writing an article about abused women to finally realize I was one of the women I was writing about. No, he never laid a hand on me but after two plus decades of living with this verbal abuse (and make no mistake, that's what this is) I realized I had come to accept this behavior as deserved and normal somehow.\n\nIt was a light bulb moment.  I divorced him and never looked back.  But my children did suffer from this abuse as well, and my entire life was consumed in protecting them from his comments.  Which, ultimately, I never really could.\n\nDon't be me. Leave before you have kids.  It's beyond heartbreaking to watch your child be torn down by a parent who is supposed to love and support them and  being told they are too sensitive when they are hurt by his comments.",
            "Your posts resonate with me because I have similar issues with my wife though probably not exactly the same. We have been together 20 years and while we generally get along she has a tendency towards sarcasm and snarky jokes, often at my expense. These are sometimes funny, sometimes not, and sometimes hurtful. In situations where she has hurt my feelings with some comment or joke, what has really shocked me is that she shows no remorse or compassion in fact will often double down on whatever she said. It is a little bit like the dynamic that two siblings may have constantly ribbing each other. But it is also a little bit how a bully will keep poking and prodding you until they finally find something that \"works\" and then double down on that. This is something that she considers normal and enjoys but really doesn't work for me at all.\n\nWe went through couples therapy (not specifically for this) and we talked about this at some length. Like I think you said about your husband she says \"this is just how I express myself\" or \"this is how people from New York talk\" (she's from New York and proud of it; however I know a lot of other people from that area and they aren't like this). In essence she's saying \"this is just how I am\". When I express how what she says makes me feel her attitude is \"you can't tell me what I'm allowed to say\" and \"just deal with it\".\n\nWe went back and forth on this in therapy. Something else that came out is that this is essentially a defense mechanism for her, a way of either deflecting comments or controlling the situation. She grew up in a complex broken family situation which had its own abuse and this was likely a coping mechanism. It is also a way to avoid talking about serious topics, something else that she has a problem with. These habits had become so ingrained that could not see what affect they had on me.\n\nHowever after months of this I think she did, finally, gradually, start to understand what she was doing and how it affected me and started to change this behavior. I would not call therapy perfect or awesome or quick, and this issue is not completely resolved, but in this case it did help.\n\nWhat I think helped was for us each to see the other's perspective and to understand some of the things behind the behavior, and that is on both sides. Your husband has reasons why he says what he says, and he might not completely realize them. And you have reasons why the things that he says upsets you, things he may say to someone else and they would not be bothered at all.",

And this is a woman who was beautiful, smart and a very nice person.  \n\nHe was a lawyer with a secondary degree too and what he did(and it was easier to do back then) was manage to hide his assets and threatened to take the kids away so he barely paid any form of child support.  He didn't give a damn about his kids except when he took them on fancy vacations and spent time trying to turn them against their mother.  The mom worked hard but she couldn't afford things like that.\n\nHe fucked up my friend in a lot of ways and fucked up her brother.

The rough circumstances of these jobs hardens us as men and we learn to reach for an even more brash sense of humor to cope; almost as if the cleaner jokes are like soft drugs vs hard drugs. We joke rather than complain because joking our problems into oblivion beats getting mopy and falling apart.\n\nAnyways, this gets built into our character and we become desensitized to this.

            "I left an abusive relationship in February 2019 and at the time I felt just like you do right now. We had been talking about kids, but at the same time I had come to the realization that neither me or any future children would be safe with this person. To address a couple of the things you brought up:\n\n\\- \"He's my best friend\" I thought this as well at one point. Then I realized no one in my life had ever treated me worse. When I look back at the relationship with a clear mind (because it is very hard to see things clearly when you are still in it) I realize the things I was hanging onto that made me want to stay were in the most part small glimpse of happy moments that were very much overshadowed by the unhappy ones. If you look more into the cycle of abuse you can see that those moments were in reality love bombing, designed to make you question your decision to leave the relationship.\n\nI just want to tell you that while you feel like your life has been turned upside-down right now and you aren't sure that you can do this, you absolutely can! And yes, it will be completely awful for a while as you navigate your life free from your abuser and it is definitely hard. It took me over a year of therapy, breakdowns and healing to process all the trauma that I had been through and get back to being myself again. But now that I am free, divorced and in no contact with my abuser at all, I would never go back. My abuser treated me so bad I questioned my own sanity and became a shell of myself. Now, I am in a healthy relationship where I can truly be myself and be accepted as that person. I never have to fear my partner, my partner is my greatest support and never gave me any reasons not to trust them. I know that when I have children, they will always be treated with respect. My performance at work improved exponentially, my relationships with my family and friends are thriving again and most importantly, I am happy. You deserve that too, we all do. Don't give any more of your life to someone who doesn't deserve it. There is someone out there who will treat you like the unique and wonderful individual that you are, someone worthy of having children with. And know that you are not alone, there are so many women out there with similar stories of abuse and success after leaving relationships. I know I am just a stranger but I believe you can do it too! Use the services your therapist recommends, lean on your family and friends for additional support and always remember you are not alone, even if you feel like it. If I had stayed with my ex I am sure I wouldn't be here today, leaving was the best decision I ever made.",
            "OP, I'm so incredibly proud of you for realizing what's going on, and taking steps, no matter how small or scary. You're doing the hardest thing, but also the best thing for you (and your future children). \n\nI read your previous post as well, and it resonates so, so much. I went through almost an exact replica of your situation for around 2.5 years and finally got out just a month ago. I can completely relate to your feelings of him being your best friend and you being happy most of the time. I felt exactly the same way about my boyfriend, but I had to realize that friendship and good times are just not enough. There has to be fundamental trust and respect, and that just wasn't there. My boyfriend pushed/ignored my boundaries and seemed to have no interest in working on that, despite me asking and pleading literally dozens of times over the years. Leaving him was the hardest thing I've ever done, but so desperately needed. \n\nYou deserve someone who values and respects your needs, no matter how \"big\" or \"small\" they may be. A good, compassionate partner will not see boundaries as you being demanding. They'll see it as a part of you that they want to embrace.",

My emotional blindness, need to be right all the time, and very darkly negative sense of humor (which stemmed from many insecurities as well as a family where that kind of teasing was a way to talk about things without talking about things) really made her bitter and angry towards me and there is no way to put humpty dumpty back together again.\n\nI'm sorry I don't have any advice on how to make your husband change.

            ">husband had me believing I had emotional regulation & communication problems\n\nThis is called *gaslighting*. This is one of many ways in which abusers exert control over their victims. They undermine their core to make them more easily controllable.\n\nYou are in an abuse relationship. This won't ever be a good starting point to raise children. They will end up being either narcissistic abuser like him or broken husks of people like hopefully you are not yet.\n\n>if I leave I\u2019ll be alone and also probably won\u2019t have kids.

The only one with power here is you.\n\nBest of luck and stay safe.\n\nEdit: Look for a book called ***The Gift of Fear***.

            "I married someone who did that, and dismissed it too. He was fun! We had fun! They were \"jokes\" and it was hard to explain that I felt bad without people (and him) thinking I was crazy.\n\nHe made them to my friends and family. They got uncomfortable and stopped coming around. They had \"no sense of humor\". He never made them to his friends and family. Ta-da...I'm isolated.\n\nWe had children. He made them to my son who proceeded to develop anxiety, depression, and low self-confidence as a child. It was a worsening slow-burn until we divorced eventually, but my son still has these issues as an adult and hurts every day because of his relationship with his father.\n\nLike you, both I and my son went to therapy for problems my husband convinced us we had due to our trouble dealing with him.\n\nEarly into the relationship I read an article that described this mean teasing (along with other low-key controlling behaviors he had) as emotional abuse. It rang true and I was shocked. Then dismissed it for the same reasons you are tempted to. *Please. Do not dismiss this. This is your chance to avert something terrible.*",
            "I first read disarming the narcissist, it was informative, but I didn\u2019t want to live the rest of my life that way. Becoming the narcissists nightmare by shahida arabi was an excellent book. I was married for 16 years at that point. I was being treated for borderline personality because the trauma mimics that disorder. After our separation, I was rediagnosed showing I don\u2019t have borderline personality disorder! I was so mad at myself and had to forgive myself. If you suspect he is a narcissist, never tell him this!! He could use that against you, and would never admit to it anyway. The sad thing is they are usually broken people that are unable to get better. I feel sorry for him. But you can\u2019t put yourself through a no win situation. Getting out is the win. Good luck whatever you decide. Like I said , it took many years before I even figured out what he was doing. I thought it was me. I realized it was normal to me because my father has that issue as well. You can survive and thrive! I\u2019m so much happier now! It\u2019s amazing!",
            "Posting, recognizing, and leaving takes a lot of bravery, I hope you can see that and feel good about these steps.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me was you wavering between knowing you need to leave and feeling like he's your best friend and the only one there for you. That isolation and dependence on him is something an abuser often fosters intentionally, sometimes gradually. This is one reason why survivors return so often to their abusive partner.\n\nBut another reason is because a survivor's love for their partner is real. But what's *more* important is for you to see and know and feel that you are worth feeling whole, and your partner should be someone who supports and contributes to that. I'm not saying you or anyone should be dependent on anyone for validation or happiness, nor am I saying that a relationship will always be perfect. Just that you should keep your cup filled, and no one should take that away from you. (I mean, our cup gets drained by regular life stuff, but I hope you get what I mean.) \n\nTake care of yourself!",
            "I used to make mean/sarcastic jokes, and my partner originally was attracted to me because of it. However, about 2 years into my relationship he said it was an issue when I made said jokes about him...\n\nSo I stopped... Full stop told him to call me on it immediately if I crossed the line.\n\nWe've been together for over 15 years now. I think the important thing to note here is 1. I was called on my crap and 2. I don't want to hurt my partner so I make an active attempt not to. It took time, and a lot of \"oops\" moments that he did call me on, openly and publicly in the beginning. This left (well deserved) embarrassment and blame on ME and NOT on him. It did take time, but I quickly stopped.\n\nYour partner needs to acknowledge it's an issue and actively attempt not to do the thing's that hurt you. If they don't then it's time to GTFO - they are not only abusive but unwilling to change. Good relationships are worth working for, if your partner isn't willing to put in any work then the relationship not worth your time. This is coming from someone who was abusive and did change.",

            "In my last relationship, it wasn't until I left that my ex was able to see how their behaviors hurt me and drove us apart. We broke up numerous times before this and they always seemed like they turned over a new leaf and finally understood how their actions were effecting me and I took them back each time because I was hopeful. I loved the life we'd built together and I was scared to be alone. The good times were great after all and they seemed remorseful. They also weren't all bad, they had good qualities that I really appreciated. But It never took long for things to regress back to where we were before the break ups. This went on for years. It wasn't until the last break up that I knew they finally got it. And this wasn't even immediately after the break up, it wasn't until months had past that I finally felt like they truly understood. And it was only because they knew this break up was final. They're now in therapy, we talk about things that happened in our relationship and they're actually able to see and acknowledge the toxic behavior. I had to lose them and give up on our relationship for them to get there but some people are just THAT stubborn. I'm older than you and I'm terrified to be alone too but at least my mental health isn't suffering.\n\nMy point is, you can hope and wish they'll see the light but sometimes it takes hitting rock bottom before they do. He needs a wake up call. He has been able to disrespect you for a decade now and get away with it. At this point I worry the only way he'll understand is if he hits rock bottom too.

For example: I have a engineering diploma( I believe an associate's degree equivalent in the u.s) and have just gotten a assistant engineer job offer fresh out of school.

            "I've read your husband jokes examples, which were the problem (\"you gonna tear this place apart\", etc) and I must present you the view alternative to the general consensus - and I find it important for you to check out.\n\nWell, if I've understood the context through the text correctly, my father in law [55M] has this exact dynamic with my MiL [57F]. They are together for 26 years, they have two beautiful daughters. And I thought they are cuties because MiL is the type of a woman to take those punches well and often reply with a double punch back! It is a style of humor between them, making a bit of fun of each other, being goofy. Mostly embraced by father in law, but most importantly: held easily and replied back by MiL.\n\nFrom my point of view, I do not sense an ounce of hatred or aggressiveness or mean spirit in those jokes by either of them. I see smiles, they laugh, they try to get a defeated reaction out of each other (basically) but it never comes. And I guess this is the key.\n\nMy wife (their daughter) and wife's sister adopted this style, and FiL regularly gets payback from his girls. They are quick on the trigger and a blast to be around when together. Basically I think I'm attending a comedy show when they all have a family breakfast together. And of course I'm in front row so I'm getting roasted too.\n\nThey are doing it only to their loved/close ones in a playful manner. For example, wife sometimes tries this dynamic with me. I find it funny and am adopting it. Father in law tries to roast me like that sometimes. However wife's sister doesn't roast me, because we have more of a measured/distanced bond. She's an expert in roasting FiL though, and she roasts her husband as well.\n\n(The girls do not roast each other for some reason, or at least I do not recall it. They do it with the boys)\n\nIs it the same for your husband? Like, is he doing it to his loved ones, or people he mentors? (My FiL is from military) How much meaning do you think he puts in those comments, are they exaggerated badly to get a reaction out of you?\n\nIf yes, than good news: he loves you.\n\nBad news: he sees this as humor and you won't be able to stop him. You can only \"survive\" by detecting the roast, being easy on yourself and him, and roast back.\n\nFor me it was easier to understand because I had a blueprint: how MiL and the girls roast FiL back. He just smiles or answers some gibberish and often goes away \"defeated\" by the wits of his girls. I find it funny. :)\n\nIf this is correct how I understood your dynamic based on your post examples (?), then I find people who write your husband off - to be very over the top and destructive in their comments.",

I was broke from supporting him, which made things harder. But I was determined to get out. My tactic for the break up convo was to just keep repeating \"I don't care what you say, I want a divorce.\" I repeated that for hours while he let me have it.

I have added some extra details at the beginning to better explain what happened. Things took some M. Night Shyamalan twists.\n\n**Details**\n\nShelly and I were not close friends. We were simply roommates with our own separate bedrooms and a connecting kitchen/living space. I have only known her since last December when we originally signed our leases. We have hung out, but the only real connection we had is that she likes anime/Japan and I am Asian.\n\nThe CraigsList ad that Shelly posted didn't have a photo. It turns out that she had used a generic photo of the two of us in an ad on our college's FaceBook page, but Shelly took it down before I got a chance to take a screenshot.\n\n---\n\n**Actual Update**\n\n\nAfter I made my Reddit post, Shelly was locked in her room for three hours. I tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't come out of the room. She left her room to get food, and just walked past me as if I didn't exist. Everyone who I called told me that until Pete actually showed up, no crime was being commited so I couldn't report it until then. I just sat by the door and window watching for Pete's car. This continued until early Saturday morning when Shelly woke up for her morning jog. I was still on lookout for Pete's car (I stayed up all night on the couch).\n\nShelly tried to sneak out past me, but I woke up and blocked the door. I needed an explanation for why I was being forced to stay up all night waiting to call the police on Pete when she knew that I had a restraining order against him. Shelly's explanation was that the restraining order doesn't matter to her, that she has dealt with 'unreasonable people' like me before, and that she has never listened to any restraining order before now, so why should she just for me? The more I listened, the sicker I felt. *Shelly basically admitted to me that she is a cunt.*\n\nI told Shelly that she was a real piece of work and that I was going to maintain my watch for Pete and that I would contemplate taking legal action. She told me that whether I liked it or not, she was done looking for subletters and that it was my problem. I told her to get out and go for her jog and she left and came back a bit later and locked herself in her room again.\n\nSometime around noon, I had accidentally fallen asleep becaue I had been awake 36+ hours at that point. I woke up and saw Pete helping Shelly move her stuff into her car. I didn't see him in the apartment, but he was helping her in the parking lot. I immediately locked them both out and called the police. Shelly and Pete came to the door again and when Pete saw it was locked and when he saw me watching from the window, he blew up at Shelly. He started to ask her why I was in the apartment and why Shelly didn't tell him that I was the roommate. He demanded his money back and I could hear them screaming at each other through the door.\n\nThe cops showed up, handcuffed Pete and Shelly. I told them my story and Pete said he had text messages and emails to back himself up. The cops checked his phone, saw texts from Shelly saying along the lines that her roommate wouldn't care about x,y,z because *he* was a chill *guy*. Pete had posted his own ad looking for a male roommate. That's right, Shelly is a liar too. The cops released Pete because he had proof that he didn't know it was me (I'm okay with this because I saw the emails/texts too). Shelly was charged with disorderly conduct and her mom came to get her.\n\nSunday evening, Shelly and her Mom come back to the apartment to finish packing for her study abroad. Shelly made some snide remarks about me 'definitely going roommate hunting' to find her a subletter as I said I would. I ignored her. Shelly left for her plane this morning.\n\nYou know the good thing about separate leases? I am only liable for my rent, not hers. So I'm going to sit on my butt for the rest of the summer while she gets evicted for lack of rent payment. :)\n\n---   \n**tl;dr:** Pete had no clue it was me, Shelly got arrested. She thinks I'll find a subletter, but I'm going to let her get evicted. ",

            "> You know the good thing about separate leases? I am only liable for my rent, not hers. So I'm going to sit on my butt for the rest of the summer while she gets evicted for lack of rent payment. :)\n\nWow, you're lucky you've got that.\n\nStill I figure this means your landlord can move in a new roommate once it's clear Shelly has moved out and isn't paying anymore.  Not your problem to find someone but you might have to accept who your landlord finds.\n\nI'm kinda hoping Shelly gets sued by all three of you: by Pete for defrauding her for the lease money, by your landlord for not paying rent, and by you for harassment.  I simply cannot believe that she just happened to defraud the one person in the whole world you have a restraining order against into almost moving into your apartment, other than to intentionally cause you emotional distress.\n\nStill, it's probably not worth your time to sue her.

            "\"...and that she has never listened to any restraining order before now, so why should she just for me?\"\n\nUm what now? So has she had a restraining order before and didn't listen? Or have other people had restraining orders against others and she didn't care (like in your situation)??? What does that even mean? This chick is crazy. \n\nI'm glad it all worked out. From the first post I thought the dude was still trying to stalk you (because the pic was supposedly you two) but I'm glad to know that's not the case. Dude could've gotten into a lot more trouble.",
            "I mean, what did she think was gonna happen..?  On top of the shameless assholery, Shelly sounds like she's missing a few marbles.",
            "Sounds like a crappy situation all around, but it also sounds like Pete didn't know, and now that he does, will not be back to bother you. Since you are on separate leases, you should hopefully not have anything to worry about legally or financially. Let Shelly deal with those issues herself, she brought them on herself.\n\nA quick question, if she does fail to pay, could you in any way get kicked out? Or are you pretty much in the clear?\n\nEither way, good luck, your roomate is immature and deserves the consequences of whatever happens to her in this situation.",
            "I've been waiting for this update for days. Not disappointed at all. \n\nYes, roommate is a cunt, and I wish you could charge her with more than disorderly conduct - she put you at very serious risk!! I mean, how does she think she was going to get away with all of the crap she was pulling, even with Pete? It's a small comfort that he was surprised and unhappy with the situation. \n\nNow the problem of you not looking for a subletter - is there anything in writing stating that you would? Are you in a state that enforces verbal contracts? Can she come back at you and sue for damages? Make sure to cover your ass with both hands there. Even if a verbal contract can be enforced, you can argue that it was conditional - you'd seek someone else on the condition that she cancel her agreement with Paul AND is unable to find someone else before her departure.\n\nI wonder if Paul could have her charged with fraud, too? She knowingly took his money for a place where he was legally forbidden to live. If she didn't return his money, theft on top of that (grand theft depending on the amount).\n\nWhatever the outcome, I'm glad you're safe. Thank you for the update.",
            "Please take pictures of your room and the common areas when you move out. Hell, go take pictures today, now that Shelly has left, and take pictures again when you move out. \n\nI'd bring the landlord over and have them inspect things, but I'm paranoid. I can picture Shelly coming back and sabotaging a lot of things and trying to pin it on you.",
            "I have a really weird reaction to this update.\n\n1. My opinion of Pete is higher because he didn't know it was you. At least he's that much less of a creeper than we thought, which is always good.\n\n2. Shelly is a massive...cunt. Yep, I'll go that far. She was deliberately trying to scam BOTH of you, even knowing about the potential legal repercussions.\n(2a. Can you possibly talk to the university about possible punishments because of her behavior? Surely she's broken all kinds of university-student ethics codes from this stunt.)\n\n3. I wish I could see the look on her face when she realizes she's been evicted for not paying her part of the rent. Good on you for getting on a separate lease than having a shared one!\n\nI'm so glad it worked out for you in the end. Great update!

I would suggest not finding her a subletter as she clearly doesn't give a shit about you or your well being. It's her problem and she does not sound like the type that should be responsible for determining who lives in the apartment, ESPECIALLY while she's away. \n\nWhat a fuck wit. Enjoy her being abroad and hope she doesn't return. ",

            "So did Shelley give Pete the money back on the spot? Did the police make her? I assume she must have since she was mouthing off about how you have to find a sublettor for her. If Pete already paid her and she already paid the landlord, none of these parties really have incentive to give Pete his money back until he takes her to small claims court. If shelley hadn't lied and said OP was a guy I don't think he'd even be able to do that. Pete is the one with restrictions on his head and I think its viewed as Pete's responsibility to make sure his legal requirements don't conflict with any contracts he enters into. Shelley could reasonably claim that she shouldn't have to check on these things for Pete and she'd have no reason to. If she hadn't lied about OP's gender she might even be able to get away with his money, but thanks to that she totally misled Pete on the deal.",

            "How exactly did Shelly think that she could possibly get away with this? First of all, you explicitly tell her you have a restraining order against this guy. Second of all, her solution to the problem is to tell Pete you're a guy. Thirdly (and I'm not defending him, he's still a douche for stalking you), Shelly gets Pete into hot water with the legal system because she lied about you being a guy. This was some serious shit. I'm glad she got arrested and you're safe!",
            "I think it's really telling she's expecting you to find a subletter for her lease, especially since you're not on the hook for her rent. A friend of mine had to wake up at weird hours to skype call someone on exchange (at the time) in Italy to get a summer subletter and they scanned and emailed one another all the appropriate documents, then scanned and emailed the documents to her landlord because my friend had gone home for the summer by that point. She had to pay like 3 weeks worth of rent, but she made a huge effort to find a subletter because the person she initially sublet to ended up backing out at the last minute. \n\nSo you can find a subletter when you're not in the city. That she's expecting you to do all the work is so telling. She's going to have a bad reputation among two groups of people - anyone Pete knows who he mentions this to, and many of your friends. If she'd been nice to you, and called Pete up and let him know it wasn't going to work out, you'd have probably found her a subletter because you sound like a decent person. Instead she was a grade A bitch and now she's going to lose 3 months worth of rent money, and possibly risk angering your landlord, which will make finding a new place that hard because her reference will be shit. So she'll have to sublet, which usually means not keeping your own furniture. \n\nLike, hopefully she realizes how much she screwed herself over and mommy and daddy aren't able to fix most of it for her. It might teach her a lesson she really needs to know about actions having consequences. \n\nEven if the cops let her off the charge, it might go on her record when people do police checks in future. So if she gets dinged for disorderly conduct again, it's going to show this isn't the first time it happened and even if she's crying it will be more likely that she has to follow through with the charges.",

I told them my story and Pete said he had text messages and emails to back himself up. The cops checked his phone, saw texts from Shelly saying along the lines that her roommate wouldn't care about x,y,z because he was a chill guy. Pete had posted his own ad looking for a male roommate. That's right, Shelly is a liar too. The cops released Pete because he had proof that he didn't know it was me (I'm okay with this because I saw the emails/texts too).

People are fast to jump to the conclusion that others are either stupid or malicious or both. That's the default explanation for behavior that makes people mad.\n\n2. People's behavior is *almost* **never** actually stupid or malicious, when you get the full story from both sides. Most of the time it's a misunderstanding or misaligned values or priorities that are understandable on both sides.\n\nThat's true so very often, that when I hear a story about someone being stupid or malicious, I almost automatically don't believe it--actually, to be more precise, I automatically think there's more to the story that would make everything make sense.\n\nIn this case, I don't see how that's possible. This girl deliberately was going to stick you with a room mate against whom you had a restraining order because of sexual assault (malicious), and she thought she could get away with it by lying to the dude until... what? He moved in, not noticing you, and she just like ran away to another country and let you figure it out?

        "selftext": "So I am a single mom of 2 twin boys that well call Luther and Donovan (3). My husband died of cancer 4 months after they were born after being diagnosed for 48 hours. It was obviously a huge shock but luckily I have amazing family and friends that all rallied together and took care of me and my boys. I still see a therapist but the years are passing and can feel the pain fading more and more with each year. \n\nMy husband and i were very smart with our money and waited about 10 years before trying for our boys and when he died I received a considerable sum of money in the form of life insurance and such. I also am a trained RN and went back to work about a year after he died and I felt like I could be away from Luther and Donovan. However, going back to work meant placing them into a daycare program. At first it was great but then it wasn't. To spare the details I had one of my boys come home with a cut lip and black eye and magically no one saw how it happened. Granted boys can be boys but that's a fairly large injury for no one to see happen. \n\nSo I decided to hire a nanny. I went through a nanny service in my city and was paired with a couple but never really felt the \"click\" with anyone till I met Tabitha (24). Tabitha and I were instant connection from the moment we met. What's even more is the cnnection she instantly had with my twins, even Luther who is EXTREMELY shy. They all just instantly fell in love and I was so beyond grateful. I come home to a clean house, happy kids, and dinner. I more then make up in compensation to Tabitha in hopes that she'll stay with us for the years to come. \n\nBut now my problem is this. Tabitha is stunningly beautiful. I mean the first moment I met her my jaw almost touched the ground. She is the kind of natural beauty that is almost sickening because it's just so unfair that a human can look that good without even trying. Her beauty was obviously never an issue for me at all since she also happens to be an amazing person and nanny for my family.\n\nMy husband and I moved into our neighborhood about our 5th year of marriage so these are all families I know very well. Some of them actually were a huge support during the time of his death. Most of the families are young husbands and wives and a few them have nannies as well. They schedule play dates on an app called Meetup and go to parks and fun activities with all the kids. I told Tabitha about it right away and she was extremely excited to be out and about with other adults and to let the twins socialize with other kids. So the first event came and went and I of course asked Tabitha how it went. She seemed a little.... Guarded as she told, \"Fine.\" And didn't go into many more details. I just shrugged it off and honestly didn't think much about it. \n\nAbout a week later I got a notification for another meetup and told Tabitha about it. She got really really nervous and asked if she had to go. I said of course not but what was the problem? She burst into tears and said that the last play date she went to was awful. She said that the moms refused to even look at her or talk to her and when she asked a simple question of them snapped at her and said, \"obviously there's no brains in that pretty body, huh?\"  She was stunned and decided to take the boys to the park playground since she obviously wasn't welcomed. I guess that the husband of one of these moms chased her down as she was leaving and told her that it was just petty jealously and that he would talk to these women for her since they obviously did not know her and any friend of our family was welcome in the neighborhood. Then he asked for her phone number to schedule more up coming play dates that would be without the drama. Tabitha said that he was really being nice and did not pick up a creepy vibe at all. \n\nThen I guess the texts started. I know this father personally as they are next door neighbors and I just can't believe that he would do this but Tabitha even showed me her phone and it was....sickening to say the least. There's texts asking for nudes, texts saying that he watches her from his wondows, texts that say he's falling in love with her, even a text saying he would pay her $1000 just to smell her hair?!?! What the actual fuck???? \nNot only that but hen she started recieving texts from other phone numbers, numbers I don't even have in my phone claiming to be from other fathers in the neighborhood that are \"secret admirers\" and saying lewd and disgusting things to her. \n\nI literally have no idea what to do. I am not about to give up the nanny that has been nothing short of amazing with my children, that much I know. I know I could probably go to the police for the messages but what can they do? She's not a minor and they never acted upon anything but some of these messages are really unnerving. Should I raise hell in my neighborhood and risk getting blacklisted? Not that I obviously want friends like that any way but I know it will cause a huge up roar. Or should i even consider moving? I just don't know what to do\n \n\ntl;dr: My wonderful nanny has been getting creeped on by my neighbors and I don't know what to do.\n\nReally quick update: on the phone with realtor who is going to come tomorrow to get the selling process started.

            "Here are my suggestions:\n1.) Get Tabitha another phone #. Keep the old number and transfer it to a basic phone that gets texts and calls. Keep the phone so that you have a record of the harassment, but poor Tabitha doesn't have to experience it.\n2.) I'm not sure if snotty mom is married to stalker guy, but either way, talk to them separately. To the stalker, say something like this: \"Tabitha showed me the harassing text messages you sent her. We are keeping a record of them. If you do not stop immediately or if you ever come onto my property or approach Tabitha or my children, we will not this keep a secret and will go to the police.\" End of discussion.\n3.) For the snotty moms: I'm not sure if it was one mom or a group, but I would send her/them an email basically saying:\n\"Tabitha was very upset after the meetup the other day. After I asked repeatedly, she told me that one of you had said, \"X\" when she asked a question. I want you to know how very much this has hurt me and her. With husband being gone, I am entrusting Tabitha to care for my children, and consider her part of our family. I consider you to be great friends, and I'm shocked that you could do something so rude to someone I care so much about. Would you have spoken to me like that? Tabitha is a wonderful person who does not deserve to be treated that way.\"\n4.) Start looking for a new place to live, these people honestly sound terrible.\n5.)

            "So this happened to me ...I started nannying for one family when I was twelve that I met through my mom (coworkers ) and ended up taking jobs or play dates with the other families in the court . When I turned 17 I had grown up, lost weight, was athletic and modeling and suddenly a dad who I used to see as harmless started harassing me. He made it so uncomfortable I was afraid all the time, because he was always in the court or at playdates, he had my number and would call the house I was sitting when he saw my car. The child didn't understand , and eventually I told my mom who told the parents.  I'll never forget what they did. The dad went over and called him out, in front of everyone and then walked me to my car every night, no matter what . The mom called everyone in the court and called him out and warned them. Turns out I wasn't the only nanny being harrased, just the first who spoke up. His wife left him and he eventually left, but the family never made me feel guilty, or scared, they protected and supported me , so all I would say is call him out, shame that son of a bitch who messed with your sweet innocent nany, and then defend and protect her ",
            "She should get a new number... And you should total rat out the husband.",
            "here's what i'd do:\n\n1) take a day off work and go to a play date with tabitha. introduce her to the other moms like nothing happened. talk to the other moms about how she's been such a god send during you're terrible and difficult time. i bet they'll come around if you nurse it along. they probably just caught their husbands looking and got knee-jerk jealous. if they're ok then i'd try to get them alone with tabitha. ask them if they'll bring their kids over during the day for a made-up reason. this kinda classic mean-girls shtick is dependent on a group setting, and if a couple of them hang out with tabitha 1 on 1 then i bet the dynamic will improve. \n\n2) tell the dads directly to knock it off. be blunt. get them aside and say \"hey cut the shit with the texts to tabitha. what're you doing? i know you're a good guy and this is a temporary lapse in judgement so i haven't told wifey, but you need to get your head in the game and clean it up. no more. she doesn't like it and she's willing to forgive you if you knock it off\". then walk away. don't debate it. \n\ni think this is totally manageable, you just need to be on your game. ",
            "I used to nanny and I'm sad to say this is common. If it's primarily a mom group they often act like total bitches to nannies. To you she's part of the family, to them she's just \"the help\".

I'd also suggest that he tell the other perverts in the neighborhood to back off, too, or else. \n\nIf you're on speaking terms with these women, try talking with them about your nanny.

She probably doesn't enjoy her job as much as she used to, and I am sure that pains you.\n\n\nMaybe a paying lawyer sending a discreet certified letter will allow everyone to save face. I don't like confrontation, either, so everyone telling you to have the face to face \"My nanny and I don't appreciate your behaviors\" isn't for everyone, and don't feel bad if you're nervous about it.\n\nAnd I understand that you don't want to leave the home you and your family shared when you were together.\n\nI really think a vaguely threatening letter on fancy paper from a lawyer might horrify him into better behavior.\n\na coworker of mine had an obsessed furniture store owner start writing her disturbing letters after picking out new furniture for her new apartment.

Also it was always a battle of who would stay home with sick kids, the least fun thing on earth...\nAnyways fast forward to #3 (I give them numbers now, we are on 6 currently) 3 was not the smartest, she drove a car with a cloud of coolant coming out of the hood until it seized, but she was amazing with the kids.\nAnyhow, 3 was from sweden, a solid 9.5/10 face with about an 11 body. Lucky for me her brains certainly made her unattractive to me, but it would be embarrassing to travel with her, with overweight mommies cowling at me as the dirty old man, the middle aged dad's continously asking me how awesome it was to have her for a side piece...\n\nIt got annoying for her around mid year when we started a home addition project, 80% of the contractors who came on site asked her out within a few hours of seeing her. At first she played it off and told us she was used to blowing guys off, but eventually I started getting the late night and weekend texts asking me if I could hook them up with 3. I was playing general contractor, so I had to play nice with these guys to get them to finish in time for the birth of my twins so it was a bit if a delicate situation. \nI had to sit down with every single one, and tell them that we would not be tolerating anymore if this behavior. If they were just an employee of some larger firm I informed them that I'd be showing their bosses the texts. If they were self employed I told them I would go to the people who referred me to them, and their other references about their behavior.\nFor you I'd advise keeping a record of their communications and then privately inform each person you will go to the boss (wife) and show them everything.\nYou'll probably need to find some other play friends though, as I have found the stay at home mommy crowd is pretty vicious, we usually have better luck going to parks farthe away from our house.",

Also can you by security cameras and make a big show of putting them up out front? It will make you and your nanny safer and any normal person would get the hint then.

Second, it'll give you/her something to show the wives to demonstrate the unsolicited texts coming from their husbands. \n\n2.) Contact the authorities when a few of them inevitably text her anyway. That's harassment, and they'll be fucked with the hard evidence. Unfortunately, they can argue that it was either their kid or their wives sending out these texts, or \"I lost my phone!\" but the law may put the responsibility in the hands of the account holder. \n\n3.) Contact the authorities now anyway. I believe harassment in general requires someone must request that someone says \"please stop\" first, however, sexual harassment doesn't always carry this requirement. I think it depends on the state, but I'm totally unsure. Either way, as long as she never flirted back via text (have her pull her phone records from the phone company). \n\nMake sure she's okay with all this. There might be a legal fight, and of course, someone might accuse her of \"flirting\" and \"wanting it\" and \"leading them on.\" If this is a concern for her, it might be best that she looks for work elsewhere because she should enjoy her job, not dread it.

        "selftext": " So long story short... \n\nMy fianc\u00e9\u2019s best man (we\u2019ll call him Liam) recently told my fianc\u00e9 that he hates me. Liam hasn\u2019t said much about why he doesn\u2019t like me other than the fact that i\u2019m supposedly holding a grudge over him, treat him like shit and don\u2019t talk to him. For me personally i have loved this guy! I thought he was a great best friend to my fianc\u00e9, we\u2019ve all been on trips together, he was super excited for us to get married and even posted on social media and privately expressed to us how proud he was to be apart of our wedding when my fianc\u00e9 asked him to be his best man. It honestly came as a shock to me and my fianc\u00e9 to find out Liam can\u2019t stand me, it was very out of the blue... Liam told my fianc\u00e9 he would still come to the wedding if that\u2019s what my fianc\u00e9 wanted but made it very clear he would only be there for him and not us. There has been no incidents that i\u2019m aware of that could cause this to happen. I\u2019m honestly torn up and have been feeling an all time low. It sucks to find out that someone i love and care about has secretly hated me. \n\nOh and not to mention , our wedding is a month out! What do i do? \nI know for sure i want him there because no matter what i still have love for the guy, but i don\u2019t want to make liam feel awkward and be apart of something he supposedly doesn\u2019t care about...\n\nTL;DR : My fianc\u00e9\u2019s best man said he hated me out of the blue and i have no idea what to do\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting a lot of...\n1. How does my fianc\u00e9 feel? \n2. I\u2019m withholding information\n3. That this is a the similar\u201cLove Actually\u201d (Never seen the movie, will definitely be checking it out now) \n4. We\u2019re  too young and this is high school drama \n5. Lack of info about Liams status in personal relationship and where my fianc\u00e9 stands in the friend group. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is crushed. He feels that if Liam was able to do secretly hide this , what else could he have been lying about and or if he really believes Liam when he said this stuff. He is crushed for me as well because he knows how close me and best man were. \n\nThe information i was given about this convo was very reliable. This conversation happened via text between the two of them and i have read the whole conversation. I know texting can be very misleading , if just having trouble knowing that he was saying such and such about me and we have no idea why. \n\nYes, we are young. I know this and so does my Fianc\u00e9. We\u2019ve been together since i was 16 , almost 17 and have never questioned one another when it came to our feelings for one another. We have had the support of each other\u2019s families and friends through this whole relationship, including Liam , which is why this was a shock. Regarding this being a drama situation due to us being young, this has been the first hiccup, a shocking one which is why we didn\u2019t know how to handle it. This happened two days ago and my fianc\u00e9 messaged him yesterday about meeting up and talking in person and he got no response, my fianc\u00e9 took it as Liam maybe needed time or that Liam might\u2019ve have realized what he said was out of the blue and doesn\u2019t know what to say now. \n\nLiam is single, had been for a long time. No actual serious relationships. My fianc\u00e9 is the first one in the friend group to be getting married so i found the advice about that maybe being and issue to be very helpful. \n\nTo wrap it up, I have not yet contacted Liam because he won\u2019t even reach back out my fianc\u00e9. I feel hurt and i feel awful for my fianc\u00e9. I agree, something does seem fishy and i\u2019m wondering what it could be, so wanting to have answers is definitely heavy on my mind. Thank you to everyone who have reached out so far and given there advice, we both very much appreciate it.",

            "Kind of a different take\u2026 \n\nThey say not to air your dirty laundry. Is Liam the person your fianc\u00e9 goes to when things are tough between you? After a fight or argument? It\u2019s easy for us to vent (even about minor things) to our best friends, and it sounds like Liam could be this person for your fianc\u00e9. If this is the case, Liam could have a skewed perception of you based on fianc\u00e9\u2019s comments. Your first move should be talking to fianc\u00e9 to get his take on why Liam could possibly feel the way he does. The problem could be there. Regardless, also ho straight to the source and chat with Liam.",
            "...and what does your fiance think about all of this?",
            "Is your fiance the first of his friend group to get married? This happens a lot when the guy and his friends freshly out of college. Liam's probably just freaking out that you guys really are growing into adults, and the \"fun and freedom of college\" is gone now. You guys are getting more adult jobs, dating starts becoming more serious and a lot of couples start trying for kids after marriage. If Liam hasn't had great luck in relationships, academic achievement or is having a hard time job wise this would make total sense. He's insecure, immature, and scared. This is the time in your life where those school friendships just fizzle out, and he's lashing out because to him none of this would be happening if he wasn't marrying you. \n\n\nOr he's just a douchebag. Either way, the best thing to do would be sit him down with your fiance and tell him your feelings. That you value him as a friend and him saying these things really hurt",
            "I'm going to disagree with others on Liam being gay, and it rubs me the wrong way that so many people are jumping to that conclusion without any evidence. Sometimes men don't like women and they can hate a particular woman without being gay. He could, as some others have suggested, simply be jealous (still straight) and worried that his friend getting married means a radical change in their friendship. Maybe he is really feeling apprehension and isn't putting the right word to it. \n\nThat being said, how do you know this isn't just a misunderstanding? Sometimes people just have such radically different personalities that behavior that one person might consider endearing or affectionate, another might consider as obnoxious. If it were me personally, I'd reach out to Liam myself and try to clear the air and let him know that you really liked him and finding this out was upsetting to you. Not to blame him, but just maybe to find out whether there wasn't some kind of misunderstanding. \n\nIf he genuinely hates you and has been lying to your face this whole time, tbh is it really appropriate for him to attend your wedding? I wouldn't feel comfortable with him there if I were in your position, because I may be preoccupied with him rather than focusing on the important occasion",
            "The thing that bugs me most about this is that\u2014assuming you got engaged a while ago\u2014he only brings this up a MONTH before your wedding? Like why not say something when your fianc\u00e9 originally proposed, or when he was asked to be the best man? Something\u2019s definitely going on but no idea what. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d talk to your fianc\u00e9 about it. Ask him what he thinks this is about. Then either you and Liam try to talk, or the three of you try to talk about it. Something\u2019s fishy about him all of the sudden \u201chating you so much\u201d that he wants to drop out of the wedding.",
            "This post is a red flag for me. People don\u2019t typically just bail on weddings without good reason and they also don\u2019t just decide to secretly hate someone. The lack of details in the post reminds me a lot of an article I read about how abusive estranged parents post on forums: they seem to lack any and all details and default to \u201cI have no idea! Everything was fine and then they stormed out and left.\u201d Compared to the adult child\u2019s recall which is extremely detailed and involves many stories to recap the entire situation. So when someone brings up issues like op here, in a very casual \u201cI have no idea, I thought everything was great\u201d manner paired with describing the other persons actions as so severe (dropping out of a wedding, cutting off contact, etc) I see this as a major red flag. If your fianc\u00e9\u2019s friend hates you, there\u2019s likely a situation or two that you need to be honest with yourself about. We aren\u2019t getting the full story here. It\u2019s not just the lack of details but also the seemingly lack of pursuit to find the reason. If Liam told your fianc\u00e9 this, he definitely had examples. If your fianc\u00e9 told you what Liam said and didn\u2019t provide examples or specifics, I would be very involved in trying to find out how I upset this person and what I could do to make it right, if it was valid. So the fact that you haven\u2019t done any of that is also a bit off. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t mean to attack you at all, but sometimes we need honestly and reality. Based off of this, it looks manipulative on your part to get validation from outsiders instead of real advice about a situation.",
            "He's either projecting something or you're not self-aware to spot what you did wrong. I don't know the full story so just talk to your fiance about this.",
            "Sounds like a Liam issue tbh.\n\nThere were no major incidents, he was friendly, he \"hates\" you because now you're going to get married and that's serious serious. So it might be the marriage that he hates, not you personally.  Why? Gotta ask him.",
            "Weddings can have a really weird effect on people. \n\nI'm less inclined to believe that this is a crush thing, either on you or your partner, and is probably more of him struggling to adjust to this change.\n\nIt's possible that your wedding is causing Liam to reflect on his own life and his choices. Perhaps seeing a friend move on in life makes him feel inadequate in some way, or makes him feel under pressure to find someone and get married when he doesn't want to. Instead of handling that the mature way with self reflection, he's pushing it on to you. \n\nI think your Fianc\u00e9 hasn't handled this as well as he could have. Really he should have had it out with Liam first and decided what to do, not dumped it on you. \n\nFor your own peace of mind, perhaps you want to have a sit down chat with Liam and your Fianc\u00e9 to get to the bottom of these issues. Of course, you can't guarantee that you'll get what you want out of that. \n\nThere might be nothing you can do, unfortunately. My husband and I experienced a friend ghosting us after our wedding - we have no idea why to this day. Other couples I have know in real life have experienced this too, either ghosting or friends falling out with them for no real reason. You are not the first person I've seen talking about this on Reddit either.",
            "Are you sure that Liam said this and that your fianc\u00e9 isn't just saying this because he possibly has cold feet and is looking to make you uncomfortable and question you guys getting married?\n\nThat's a weird thing for Liam to tell your fiance randomly with no reasoning behind it.\n\nWhat was your fianc\u00e9 response to Liam when Liam expressed his feelings about you?\n\nCould Liam be dealing with any mental health or emotional issues right now and feels like his friend isn't gonna be there and is sorta lashing out?\n\nTalk to Liam directly and stop the guessing game.",
            "I\u2019m surprised so many people are saying he must have a crush on the husband to be. I think it\u2019s just as likely he\u2019s got a crush on OP and isn\u2019t handling it well as their wedding approaches, and he\u2019s convinced himself he doesn\u2019t even like her as a kind of self-preservation. Maybe he feels like he\u2019s losing his friend with your upcoming marriage. Either way, OP, he may be your fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend, but you shouldn\u2019t have people standing up for you who aren\u2019t there to celebrate your marriage. Talk to your fianc\u00e9 and see if you can get to the bottom of what\u2019s causing this. Maybe it\u2019s a misunderstanding that he\u2019s been stewing over, and you can sort it, but if not\u2026do you really want to look over as you say your vows and see him watching you, knowing his feelings? Do you trust him to give a kind and supportive speech? Will he encourage your fianc\u00e9 to cheat at the bachelor party or be suggesting he not go ahead with the wedding? This has the potential to get really messy.",
            "We're not getting the whole story. Nobody ends a conversation like that. If they're close friends, he would've asked what was causing the best man to feel this way. And if this conversation happened during an event where they couldn't keep discussing it, the fiance shouldn't have said anything to OP until he had a chance to hash things out with his best man first.",
            "As others have said maybe Liam is gay and has feelings for your fiance. Or it could be jealousy, in that Liam can't stand the thought that your fiance is getting married because that means a change in priorities. And those priorities would be you and the family unit that you and your fiance build.\n\nIn regards to Liam I am curious with a few things:\n\n. Is he currently in a relationship?\n\n. What is the relationship dynamic between him and your fiance? Do they hang out a lot?\n\n. Does Liam have a focus in his life? Like a job or hobbies that don't involve your fiance?\n\nMy gut feeling is telling me that Liam is jealous. That now fiance is marrying you it means less time for Liam. \n\nI've seen something similar with a friend of a friend who was getting married and his best friend was not happy, would badmouth his future wife and started mocking his best friend calling him \"whipped\" and would say stuff like enjoy a life of misery. Turns out best friend couldn't stand that his friend was growing up and changing priorities where as best friend wanted things to continue as is, with boys nights, drinking and playing video games at all hours and having his friend drop everything he was doing to cater to him. Basically best friend couldn't stand not being number one priority in his friend's life. Mind you friend who got married made adequate time to hang out with friends it just wasn't as much as douche-bag best friend wanted. \n\nPoint being sometimes a friend group has that one friend who refuses to grow up and can't stand to see their friends grow up, change priorities and going forward with their lives. That could be the case with Liam. \n\nIf i was you I would arrange to talk to Liam with both you and your fiance present to get to the bottom of why he is badmouthing you.",
            "I think you should talk to him personally and find out what\u2019s going on. Nothing ever gets resolved by talking through a go between.",
            "[removed]",
            "Two things come to mind.\n\nThe first is what everyone else has suggested and that is Liam is after your man.  I would say it's also possible that he's not gay but is making trouble out of jealousy for other reasons.  Sometimes friendships turn sour when a best-friend feels neglected and it pushes them to make trouble.  Either way, its probably the most likely option.\n\nThe second option is that your fiance has been, perhaps inadvertently, trash talking you behind your back.  You know, the whole 'ball and chain' thing to win sympathy or bro points.  It might not even be intentional or even all that exaggerated.  If we use one particular friend as a shoulder to cry on about relationship issues, or if too much is said about private business in general, often the friend/s gain a biased view of the relationship.  From there, it's natural for a friend to want to speak up.\n\nTo figure out if it's either option, or something else completely, you need to start talking to both your fiance and a sympathetic mutual friend.  If there is a friend of his that is likely to give you an honest second opinion, talk to them.  I would talk with your fiance first, though.\n\nSit your fiance down when you're both relaxed and in a good mood.  Ask him if he's having any doubts about the relationship.  Ask if he feels pressured into marriage.  Then say Liam spoke to you recently and explain what he said.  See what he says.  Perhaps ask him more generally how much he's disclosed to Liam about your relationship and the general tone.  Edit:  Since I misread and your fiance is aware of what Liam said, perhaps just verify you're on the same page and if Liam may have taken anything out of context.\n\nThen talk to a neutral mutual friend, preferably soon after speaking with your fiance.  Tell them that you're a little shook up because Liam said some surprising things.  Explain that he said to your fiance he is having doubts and feels like the relationship isn't right.  Say you're shocked and were completely flabbergasted to hear this, especially something about a grudge, because you thought everything was great.  Be honest but clueless.  Admit that you're hoping they will tell you if this is true because you want to make things right with your fiance.  Stress that you don't want him to feel pressured to marry you.  See what they tell you and if it's different to what Liam said and possibly why.\n\nOnce you have both conversations, you'll have a better idea of how to proceed.  If it's an issue with Liam, and he's a false friend, then perhaps your fiance should end the friendship.  If it's an issue with too much complaining, then perhaps ask your fiance to limit this.  Maybe ask if there are any relationship issues that he hasn't felt comfortable bringing up.  You might even suggest couples counseling to learn better communication techniques and have a neutral party to help discuss things.\n\nTo be honest, you need to proceed carefully.  Something isn't right.  Don't be afraid to post pone the wedding.  It's a logistic pain and you probably will lose money but it's less stress and financial loss than a divorce.",
            "I feel like we need a little more information. \"He suddenly hates me and I have no idea why!\", just doesn't seem like enough",
            "Did your fianc\u00e9 ask him specifically what the issue was? You say there\u2019s a grudge. Over what? It sounds like all three of you should sit down and have an in-person conversation as soon as possible to clear the air. Then you can decide what to do from there.",
            "Sometimes people get very protective of their friendships and when someone new comes in and changes the dynamic it throws them for a loop. He might have been fine with you early on because he thought the relationship wouldn't last and he'd eventually get his bf back. As others have pointed out, it's his problem. He's a grown man and he should be aware that this is what grown ups do. They meet someone they love and they settle down. He either comes to the wedding or he doesn't. Enjoy your day and focus on spending the rest of your life with the man you love. Everything else will sort itself out in it's own time.",
            "You need to arrange to speak with Liam one on one. Tell him what you have said here, that you care deeply and love him and want to know if you've done something wrong as he is an important person to you. Look for ways to rectify it within reason, people don't usually just turn like that for no reason.",
            "My husband\u2019s best friend\u2019s wife is not who we would have chosen to be with him.  She can be very selfish, insecure, rude, and it\u2019s always been abundantly clear that if he didn\u2019t come from money she wouldn\u2019t have ever dated him. His friend on the other hand loves her to the moon and back.  \n\nJust prior to the wedding my husband was overwhelmed with the need to tell his friend that he thought she was not in the relationship for the right reasons.\n\nI told him that it was too late to speak up.  This girl wanted to marry someone wealthy, that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t love him.  She just has different priorities than we do.  In the end, regardless of how she\u2019s treated us in the past, he loves her and ultimately she will make him happy. She isn\u2019t a terrible partner for him, she just isn\u2019t someone we particularly like.  \n\nI think his friend, whatever the reasons he doesn\u2019t like you, didn\u2019t have someone to set him straight.  Your relationship isn\u2019t about him and he needs to get his head out of his ass because if he really loves your fianc\u00e9 as a friend then he should have shut his mouth.  It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s genuinely worried for your fianc\u00e9 that if he marries you that his life will fall apart.  It sounds like he thinks his happiness is more important than your fianc\u00e9\u2019s and yours.  \n\nWhat your fianc\u00e9 needs to do if he values the friendship is sit him down and explain that his feelings don\u2019t play into this relationship and if he wants yo be friends in the future he\u2019s going to need to work on a way to patch this up to the degree that he can be civil towards you.  \n\nOf course he shouldn\u2019t be the best man, but he also shouldn\u2019t be at the wedding anymore because he\u2019s officially made it all about him and having him there will make it difficult for you to focus on your own good time.

For his sake, since he said he didn't really wanna do it anymore, only as a favor to your fiancee (which is disrespectful and sucks for you, and if I was your fiancee I wouldn't want that, at all.), and 2. because it would make things really awkward and you'd feel bad constantly and it could potentially ruin your wedding or at the very least cloud something that's supposed to be one of the most important and beautiful days of your life.

BUT you should be honest with him, becauce i think a marriage can only be strong if both are honest. So if you feel bad about the friend as best man than you should tell him, what your feelings are.\n\nI think your fiance should now talk with him serios, what happend. What really is up.\n\nI think there is think there is something behind that and he is not honest with you and your fiance. for me it seems, his behavior is a \"bad\" solution for something we all can only speculate with out any knowlage. Any speculationg will will not help, and may be leeds to decisions whitch make the situation more bad as they now are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what i would do now:\n\nI would ask your fiance to have a serios talk to the bestman. And he should tell him, that he dont belive what the best man said, and that he should be honest and open up and tell him what really is the matter, so they can get it out of they way...because you like the bestman and allways have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck :)",

            "This sounds like the my husbands brother when my husband and I got married. My husbands brother's personality really shifted the day of the wedding. He was pretty weird with me when we were dating, but got worse once we got married. I have to attribute it to either jealousy or the brother is very concerned that my husbands focus is not going to be on him anymore, but on me instead. It was just the two of them growing up when they were little and they spent a lot of time together until my husband and I started getting serious. Some people just aren't good with accepting change and shifts in relationships. I know it sucks, but you have to do whats best for you and your partner. \n\nMy advice would be to try and talk with your husband's best man. Try and get to the root of what is bothering him. I know that I felt shame when my husband's brother told him that I was a burden(in his eyes ugh) and that being married must be hard. I'd hate to see that happen to you. Talking it out will at least get some feelings out.\n\nIf he doesn't want to talk then you might have to reconsider having him at the wedding.

Like . . . yeah, I can see why that hurts, but also? If he has always treated you kindly he's probably not really *feeling* this way, he's just being a drama queen to make a point. You taking his random-ass words at face value and as such a crisis is understandable at your age, but it also will make marriage harder on you in general.\n\nIs there any way to delay the wedding?

            "Your fianc\u00e9 needs to ask for clarification from his friend. Weddings are about LOVE and nobody that hates you should be there, regardless of his friendship with one party involved. His hatred excludes him from participation in the event. That would be the only reasonable outcome to me, if I were the bride here. Nobody deserves to have someone present who is hating them on their wedding day.",
            "One really important thing to keep in mind is that Liam is your fiance's best friend and not yours. There's a good chance that when you and your fiance argue or when there's something he's not happy about then Liam is his shoulder to cry on. In addition, there may have been times over the years where Liam felt excluded or that he had less access to his friend because of you and while that may not be the reality it's his perception. I'm also going to say that often our friends see things that we can't or don't want to about our partners and yes some of our friends truly hate our partners. Perhaps they feel we can do better or perhaps they see our partners do something to us that they feel is unforgivable.\n\nMy advice is to first ask your fiance if he knows why Liam hates you. If he doesn't then do the adult thing and talk to Liam. If you guys can't resolve this then it's not he end of the world nor does it mean that your fiance has to choose between you and Liam. Marriage doesn't mean that you two become one person, you can still have separate friends and Liam may be one of those. As long as he's not rude to you or actively working to undermine your relationship, how he feels about you is largely irrelevant.",

It goes back to when the best man was literally a witness to the marriage and vouched for the honor of the parties.\n\nYour fiance needs to sit down with his friend and try to iron things out.  If you like him as much as you say you do, then this is a misunderstanding and should be clarified.  If offering an apology for something that he took offense to, even if you didn't think you were offending him, would soothe his feelings, then go out of your way to do it.",
            "My first thought was to wonder why your fiance shared this information; that's very revealing. Either you are missing all the signs, or something has been kept from you. People don't start \"hating\" someone out of the blue... so I think your fiance has some explaining to do! This is not your problem; he has made it your problem. If you can rise above this pettiness, please do so. It's up to your fiance to decide who he wants as his best man, and if the best man has issues with the bride, it's up to *him* to deal with it. Not your problem to solve, even though it has been dumped in your lap.",

Letting some friends and even family go is part of it if they try to pull you apart and YES, this guy is trying to pull your relationship apart.

However you said you two are close. If I had to guess he's jealous and fantasizes of being with you. If he doesn't respond just drop him and uninvite him to the wedding.

            "I agree with other comments of best man maybe being gay and crushing in bf. But maybe I read too many romcoms. Ask fiance to have a conversation and coax friend into telling what exactly is the reason for him to hate you. Ask him if it's because of a specific incident. It could very well be that someone lied to him about you at some point and he wants to protect his best friend? If he's open to having you during the convo tell him how you really feel about him and tell him if you ever unintentionally made him feel the way he does at some point that you are very sorry. Sometimes it's best to apologize if we value the relationship. If he admits to being gay and having a crush on husband then that is unacceptable behavior and you should treat him like you would treat a girl best friend of husband having a crush on him. If this happens to be the case and he doesn't talk about it, he could very well manipulate fiance into breaking up but that's the worst case scenario.

            "I\u2019m surprised no one thought that maybe Liam actually likes OP.",
            "Doesn\u2019t matter, your not marrying Liam, so he can go fly a kite.",
            "You don't need everyone to like you.\nHe's there for your fiance and that should be enough.",
            "Didn't read other replies so this has probably been said already but I would just be upfront. Either you or fiance should pull Liam for a chat and ask \n1. What motivated him to share that information? \n2. If there is anything that he has been uneasy about with y'all and/or \n3. Why after x amount of friendship, he felt the month prior to the wedding was the right time to share this for the first time. \n\nI think that is more than reasonable to clear the air before the wedding and also get Liam to reflect on his timing and statements. Totally fine if he doesn't like you but the falseness has gotta stop. Also I would be so pissed if I were in your position. Like biiiitch, why are your feelings now centered in my wedding?!? And those feelings are ABOUT ME god-damn you shouldn't have agreed to be in the wedding then. Like you are young adults but y'all are adults. He made a decision, apparently one he may resent, and is now making it y'all's problem.",
            "Does Liam secretly like your fianc\u00e9?? I'm gettin those kinda vibes from this...",
            "So, you guys are young. That's fine. Your fianc\u00e9's best friend is also young. Possibly jealous of you \"taking\" away his best friend. \n\nI would leave it alone unless it begins to personally affect your marriage/relationship. Honestly, your guy's friends are his friends.....and as long as they are RESPECTFUL towards you as his partner, I would not sweat it. Now if Liam oversteps boundaries and begins insulting you, then the onus is on your partner to put his foot down and tell the friend to shut it or fuck off.\n\nIt is absolutely fine for you or your partner to have friends, even friends who aren't always going to get along with you. As long as they are adults and try to get along with you or are polite and not disrespectful, there is nothing to worry about.\n\nI know it sounds heartbreaking, but the most important relationship is the one between you and your future spouse. They come first, period. \n\nTLDR; Leave his friend alone for now.  Maybe he will resurface. It is not uncommon to lose \"friends\" as you move through major life changes. I lost some as I graduated college and moved away, more when I changed jobs, entered my own serious relationship and marriage, kids also change things.. You also, will gain new friends.",
            "Liam probably isn't gay or in love with either one of them. Seems more likely that he's jealous. Either jealous at the change in their friendship or jealous that he doesn't have what they have.",
            "I secretly feel like this is between you fianc\u00e9 and Liam. It\u2019s their communication issues (he only vents to Liam about you, therefore Liam had a bad impression about you; Liam is not entirely honest with his \u201cbest friend\u201d...ect) more than it\u2019s a problem between you and Liam.\nBecause at the end of the day, it\u2019s your fianc\u00e9\u2019s best friend...it would be a different story if y\u2019all are friends as individuals not as someone\u2019s SO.",
            "I also feel like... Liam needs to NOT be at your wedding unless you all clear the air. To say he's going for your fiance but not to support your union is grounds to make sure his ass isn't there to eat your food, drink and have fun all the while knowing how he truly feels about you. That's stressful!",
            "Maybe you suck, i was the best man for my friend and I just didn't go, told him it was a huge mistake and..... 2 years later and divorced with custody battles and a never ending nightmare he says you were right",
            "Liam's soulmate might just be a man, and he's mad that the one he thought was his is walking down the aisle with a woman and not him.",
            "This sometime happens when guys start to lose their best friends in relationships and it is hard for their significant other to see. You have to be fair and honest, not say things you think I want to hear. \n\nI have a couple questions:\n\nHas his alone time with him been reduced significantly?\n\nWhen he talks to his best friend, does he always check with you before he goes out and does something or is he at liberty to do what he wants as he pleases?\n\nWhen bestfriends start saying \"we\" instead of \"I\" in conversation over the phone, has he started doing that?\n\nThere are actually studies on this, men losing their bestfriends once they get married. \n\nIf you take up too much of his time or want to be with him \"While\" he is hanging out with his best friend, that will be very challenging because you cannot have the same type of quality conversations.",
            "Is it possible that Liam has feelings for OP? If things seemed great before and he hasn't been in any serious relationships, he might not have had the emotional maturity to separate his feelings of friendship for you, his happiness for his friend, and his envy of you two.\n\nHe could be lashing out to distance himself from you two if he feels like he can't handle what he thinks his feelings are.",
            "I'm not saying this is the most LIKELY scenario, but it is one I'd want to rule out: is it possible someone is using his phone and posing as him? If they wouldn't reply to a request to meet on person, I would be a little suspicious of this. Try to find a way for your fianc\u00e9 to talk to him directly, even over the phone, just to rule out that it's not an imposter.",
            "It's possible that Liam has feelings for you or your fiance. You mentioned that everything was great before, you all hung out and got along well and were good friends. And he's never had a serious relationship.\n\nHe was supportive at first because he couldn't admit to his friend that he likes their partner. Maybe he thought that his feelings would go away eventually and they didn't. You two getting married in a month. \nHe's overwhelmed and can't deal with the fact that the person he likes is getting married to his friend. And he's the best man. That might explain him doing this over text and then going No Contact.\nHe's probably planning to eventually drift away from you two once the wedding is over so that he can move on."

I went out with my friends, got pretty drunk, and came home with the spins. my dad had his friends over and right away noticed I was drunk.\n\nI sat in a chair and felt sick and sort of passed out slowly but was still pretty concious. I heard my dad and his friends laughing at how drunk I seemed, instead of like, you know, worrying about me being sick. I heard my dad say \"shes always been a drunk, could never handle her liquor\" (interesting, considering ive never drank in front of my dad). He also said \"since she broke up with her boyfriend she put on a ton of weight, i suppose it always happens to women around her age, cant control what they eat\". Which is also interesting, considering I only gained about 20 pounds in total (I am 5'11, 20 lbs is nothing). He then went on this sort of like, sexist rant about how modern kids turn into awful people in their 20s, using my 'recent behavior' as an example. He said \"her apartment is fucked up because she did something stupid, so she just runs to her mom for help instead of helping herself\" not even mentioning to them that my apartment caught on fire as the result of a fire in the NEXT apartment over. He said I was sensitive, sheltered, lazy etc. He said \"I thought I raised her right, never thought she would be such a fucking failure, I mean look at her right now, jesus christ\". I literally earn more money than him at my job right now, but he has the audacity to call me a failure?\n\nWhile I was drunk enough that I was basically slumped over with my eyes closed, at a certain point I could have gotten up but I was scared for some reason to let them know I could hear everything. So I just stayed there pretending I was asleep.\n\nI am just so disgusted at my dad right now. I am actually genuinely astounded at the things he said about me, one, because most of it was just straight up lies, and two the fact that he would shit talk me in front of his friends that way?? What the fuck?\n\nI honest to god thought my dad was a great guy but this just changes my entire opinion of him. Why would he do this to me? To brag to his friends? To make it seem like I am such a burden on his life? I have this horrible feeling in my stomach about him that I don't think will ever go away. He has always been such a great father to me and this just changes everything, I don't think I will ever forget those hurtful words he said. I honestly want to dead him, and never see him, ever again, but then I would be homeless until my apartment is fixed, and... well I just feel like he was such an amazing father before this moment. I have such conflicted feelings right now. How do I confront him about this? \n\ntl;dr: While I was passed out drunk, I heard my dad talk shit about me to his friends.",

            "If it were me, I'd find him in a quiet moment and say, \"Remember when I came home drunk the other night and wasn't feeling well and your friends were over? Well, I heard what you said to them about me and it really, really hurt.\" You could say more, or ask questions, but when I've confronted people over serious hurt like this in the past, keeping it short and strong has worked well. \n\nDon't rush to fill the silence or negotiate with yourself--just state the hurt. His response will teach you a lot and maybe answer some of your questions about how to proceed. He might apologize, or blow it off, or double down. \n\nEither way, this may change the way you feel about him forever, and that is fair. I'm so sorry you heard such a hurtful thing. No one deserves that.",
            "Well...now you know who he really is. He's a Bro who will undercut the women in his life to amuse his friends and to make himself feel better about his own insufficiencies.\n\nI'm sorry, OP. \n\nHow to confront him...what about printing out your post and handing it to him and standing there while he reads it? ",
            "I experienced a similar betrayal a few years ago. My dad was hanging out with my boyfriend (now ex) without me and essentially told him I'm a crazy bitch and he shouldn't put up with my shit and dump me.\n\nI ended up confronting my dad andi telling my mom so that she could give him a piece of her mind. He apologized and was like, \"hey, I was just trying to be cool and it was a fucked up thing to do.\" \n\nSo, confront your dad and then decide what comes next based on his reaction.\n\nMy dad has made sacrifices for me, he's there for me when I need him and shows interest in my life. So I forgave him. But, I permanently lost a lot of respect for him, lost trust in him and gained the knowledge that he does not respect me. I imagine you feel the same. Don't worry, though, it gets easier to accept. Especially as you get older and more accomplished... You'll probably just pity him. I'm sorry this happened to you, but you'll be ok.\n\n",
            "My gut feeling is that he wants to feel like a big man by belittling his daughter in front of his friends. It's unbelievably petty and small of him and his friends sound like assholes too if that's the sort of thing that impresses them. This goes beyond the \"oh he's just of a certain era\" nitpicking (which is still not cool). He's actively talking hateful shit about his daughter while he thinks her back is turned.\n\nI think you might have to tough it out until you can get back on your feet. Try to fly under his radar, keep interactions to a bare minimum and channel the anger into working on a plan to get out of there. Only once you're safe and secure should you let him know that you heard everything he said when he thought you were unconscious and you think a lot less of him because of it.",
            "I'd make plans to stay elsewhere, leave, then just shoot him a text. \" I was awake when you said all those things to your friends about me being a fat failure who fucked up her apartment by letting her neighbor burn it down.

            "Well, now you know what your dad truly thinks of you. My sincerest apologies. My mother used to air her grievances when she thought I was asleep on the couch while I was visiting. I don't visit anymore. That's not what ended our relationship, but it's just one of many fractures throughout the years. \n\nYou're 24 years old. You can go out when you want.

            "Firstly, I\u2019m really sorry this happened to you. There is no excuse for what he\u2019s said. I have had a similar experience overhearing my father say, \u201cyou know, she\u2019d be really pretty if she just lost weight\u201d. Even though he was right, it felt really awful to hear it from my dad\n\nThere seems to be a huge disconnect/war between his generation and millennials. It\u2019s really frustrating to be called a failure when you\u2019re busting your butt for years through college, and then through the rest of your life, barely making ends meet (it sounds like you\u2019re doing really well) \n\nI don\u2019t know how you get past this without talking to him about it. You have every right to be angry and upset. He was a jerk. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering what the hell else he is saying when you\u2019re not around. It\u2019s despicable.  I\u2019m really sorry you heard all of that and they he said it in the first place. ",
            ">I literally earn more money than him at my job right now, but he has the audacity to call me a failure?\n\nGiven your Dad's sexist attitudes, I bet he loves that his DAUGHTER, who's half his age, makes more money. \n\nI'm sorry he failed you like this. Can you talk about it with a close relative? If he's otherwise been a great dad, there may be some underlying mental health change or other explanation. ",

Wouldn't impress them enough and would truly reveal what an insecure asshole he is. \n\nI'd seriously confront your father about this. And make sure mom knows too. Honestly, I'd tell him either you both work on your relationship or it's effectively over. You can waltz out of his life without being a burden or a \"fuck up.\" \n\nA grown man talking about his own daughter this way is just plain pathetic.",

If you have health insurance, see a therapist.\n\n\nAnd when you're ready to move out, then decide how you want to handle him:\n\n- tell him to his face\n\n- tell relatives what he said, and that this is why you're no longer talking to him.  So he can't lie to them. (Or do an FB post for the relatives).\n\n- or write him a letter, saying you know how he feels, and this is why you're no longer talking to him. \n\n\nYour choice.",
            "I had a moment like this with my dad. We were having a disagreement. He said something shockingly cruel, and I'd never heard him say something like that before, and I started crying in disbelief and hurt and he:\n\nStarted laughing at me\n\nTold me he assumed I was crying because I was on my period\n\nTold me he was laughing at me crying because he thought it was funny that my feelings would be hurt. \n\nIt changed out relationship forever. I tried to have a follow up conversation with him but he never apologized and just tried to explain where he was coming from. I still love him, I still acknowledge the things he did right, but I also started seeing more and more misogynistic things he did in the past and patterns of things he did with my mom. I am very careful what topic I introduce to the conversation, because it makes me so sad to hear him be a bully. \n\nHe is a bully. He is also insecure, has isolated himself, has no desire to grow as a person or in his relationship if it means any discomfort whatsoever. It's hard because I can't love him enough to do the work of two people in a relationship. I can't believe in the good parts of him to override him not caring. I wish I could just remember the good parts of him. \n\nBut if he asks me pointedly why I don't talk to him about blank thing, for example, or why I don't visit him more, I tell him the truth. He's pretty passive aggressive though, so it rarely comes up.",
            "Seems like the perfect time to cut that piece of shit out of your life.",
            "There's gonna be a moment in his life when he's too old to care for himself. And he could move in with you, or you could just say fuck it and put him in a home. He's made this decision really really easy for you",
            "I've been in the \"wow I can hear my family verbally eviscerating me and I feel so helpless and disrespected and kind of unloved\" place before. It's so hard to think of why someone who loves you would be so cruel. Honestly, I still don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is that I confronted them about it within the month, told them what I heard and how it made me feel. I wasnt argumentative or accusatory, I tried to just be honest and calm. I didn't get the apology I wanted, they denied it and that pissed me off. So I took time to myself, I didn't hang out with them and I found other places to stay. \n\nI considered, like you are, cutting then off forever. It really stung for a while. I didn't feel secure in my relationships to the most important people in my life. But eventually, after about a year, I was ready to forgive and accept that whether or not I got an apology and whether or not they had meant what they said, I wanted my family in my life. So we all worked on how we treat each other and it's ok now.\n\nSo based on that experience, I'd say bring it up with him after you take some time to settle your feelings. Tell him what you heard and how you felt, and expect an apology and an explanation (because you deserve one). Go from there. If he apologizes, let it go as quickly as you can. If not, do what you need to to feel loved and secure. Either way, evaluate his position in your life and make an honest call about what relationship you want with him and whether you feel he can do that. I think people are mean to each other sometimes, but it's good to forgive and let people grow.\n",

            "I'm so sorry, OP. My best friend growing up had a father like this; he'd put down his kids in front of other people to make himself look cool, and even as a pretty young child, I remember being repulsed by it. The older I got and the better I understood the psychological toll his behavior took on my friend, the more contemptable and pathetic I found him. When he passed away a few years ago, I genuinely had trouble saying the right things to my friend at the funeral because I could only think about how much better off her mental health would be without his toxic influence.\n\nYou can never unlearn what you learned about your father that night, and the stuff he's made of. He's willing to denigrate his own daughter to score some meager points with his shitty friends (and lie to do it). If you want a relationship going forward with him, I think you need to confront him and express exactly how this affected you and why it's unacceptable, and to tell him what you told us, that what you overheard has changed how you see him, caused irrevocable damage to your relationship, and caused you to lose respect for him. If you think this conversation may jeopardize your housing situation, wait to talk about it until you're leaving. If you have trouble standing up to your parents, or if you typically have trouble expressing yourself clearly during confrontations, consider writing a letter. (Your post here is honestly a perfectly summarized account of the situation and your grievances.)\n\nI'm wishing you the best, and I know you'll get through this stronger and with a better understanding of who in your life is deserving of your trust.

What your dad said though has NOTHING to do with you, and everything to do with him. Parents being so critical of a child is merely a reflection of what they truly think of themselves, not of the child. \n     Based on what you stated, your dad doesn\u2019t know you that well, and has a lot of self loathing he should work through.  Your dad damaged the relationship he had with you, and you can either tell him that, or not. I would strongly suggest speaking to a therapist or counselor to process these feelings in a healthy manner so you don\u2019t internalize them. \n\n\nWhat does your mom say or think of these statements?

Going forward, DO NOT share any negative aspects about your life with him, and do not show weakness. Keep as much distance and control of information from him.

            "Your dad sounds like a fucking loser whose been trying to make up for his small penis that he\u2019s still going to extremes lengths at the age of 55 to do so. \n\nI\u2019m stubborn and get pretty intense when people piss me off, so I\u2019d definitely send the link of this post to him and let his confidence get shredded to shit, or to more shit since he clearly barely has any already and then I\u2019d tell him to fuck off. Of course, do all of this AFTER you\u2019ve used his house to accommodate yourself and your current situation, then once he\u2019s useless and you don\u2019t have to be around him, light him up. ",
            "It really hurts when someone you trust exposes themselves to be someone you cannot trust.  The only thing I can think may have been his motivation is that he\u2019s just a guy.  Here he is with his buddies, and his daughter is drunk.  Maybe embarrassment mixed with worry and a big dose of testosterone poisoning to cause him to act way out of character.  I would rather believe that than accept he is a totally different person than you have believed all your life.  Also, remember, you were impaired.  You may be remembering this as worse than it was because of the alcohol impairing your judgement.  I just say all this to play the devil\u2019s advocate and give you alternate points of view.  I personally share what 99% of these comments claim - you have every right to be hurt and upset.  He was cruel and totally wrong in what he said.  He may be an asshole who had hid his true self from you for years.  Or he may be the amazing father you thought you knew.  Or probably somewhere in between (we tend to glorify those we love, and ignore their faults, until they hurt us badly enough for our eyes to clear for a moment).  But I believe he should have the opportunity to explain himself and understand how badly he hurt you.  Please don\u2019t walk away from the relationship before you know for sure.  Clear the air, confront him, and find out.  Then base your actions appropriately.  If he truly feels for you the way these comments reflect, it will be obvious, and you can remove him from your life.  Hopefully he just screwed up royally.  ",

            "He seems like the type of guy who ties to make himself seem better by putting other people down. Next time you see him and his friends together, casually throw something out like, \n\n\"Hey dad, I just wanted to thank you for letting me stay with you and mom during my apartment difficulties. It would really make me feel better if you'd let me pay you something in rent for that time. I know you don't make a ton of money, and since I have more income than you I would just feel better if I could return the favor in some way.\"\n",

            "This is \"guy talk\". Lots of men (not all) do this when they're with other men, and generally the talk is about women, and generally it's disgusting, and generally it is a way for them to feel \"cool\", though I still don't really understand how trash talking other people makes anyone feel \"cool\" or superior. I truly never expected to hear about a man doing this to one of his own children, though. TIL and I'm a sadder person for it.",
            "Have you ever heard of the Latin phrase \"In vino veritas\" before? It means \"in wine, truth\" -- that people will often reveal their true thoughts and feelings, without inhibitions, if they're drunk enough. \n\n\nPerhaps it's that. Or your father is trying to start conversation and to make himself seem more...though? Insightful? To his friends.\n\n\n____________\n\n\nSince you feel that your father has been a great dad besides this, I do think it's worth confronting him over. Tell him the things he said, point out that most of them were either outright lies of exaggerations. Tell him how this has damaged the way you view him and your relationship...and see where it goes from there? either way, I'd keep my distance.\n\n\nalso worth talking to your mom, if you're close enough to her.

            "Wow. This really struck me, and don't have much to offer by way of useful advice but I really want to offer you some support, even if it's just a well-meaning comment from a reddit stranger. That must have been really painful, and I can't imagine how you're feeling right now. To have someone you love and trust completely switch on you like that would be heartbreaking, and you're right to be hurt and you deserve to take some time to breathe and process this. I hope you can surround yourself (even virtually, or by phone) with good people who you trust to give you some positive reinforcement that you're NOT that person and that you do have people who genuinely support you and would never say or think those things about you.\nI would write a letter to your dad (if you're anything like me, saying things out loud in person can be tougher than writing it down) expressing how you're feeling. That could give you the chance to get it out of in the open so he's not confused when you detach yourself from him emotionally, and would also give you an opportunity to defend yourself and set the record straight. Hopefully you'll get some kind of explanation (if there can be any?) and a sincere apology.\nAgain, I'm so sorry that this happened and I hope you know that your identity has nothing to do with his perception of you. People can be seriously wrong, even if they are your parent. ",
            "I'm scared to think my dad does this. I already don't trust him, but i know for a fact he probably talks shit about me to his friends. I'm sorry that you had to hear it first hand, OP. I hope you know that you are better than what he said.",
            "I am so sorry your dad spoke about you this way! I lost my dad about a month ago and there\u2019s no way he would ever, ever have spoken to me or about me like this. I would definitely confront him about it and see what he has to say for himself. It\u2019s truly disgusting and again I am so sorry. I hope you can move passed this hurt and pain.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. This must hurt horribly. It\u2019s possible his own level of drunkenness was affecting his judgment. I know I have been a piece of crap and said things I didn\u2019t mean when I was drunk. But that doesn\u2019t negate what he said or how much it hurt you. I don\u2019t know how he will react if you bring it up to him, but that will also display his character. Reactions could range from shocked horror at himself to denial and accusing you of making it up to anything in between, so be prepared. Again, I am sorry.",

            "Really sorry this happened to you, OP. I agree with the other commenters that say to print out your post and have him read it, or list out everything that you overheard him say about you and give it to him. I hope that that the outcome is positive for you.",

            "Maybe you can also talk to your mom about it. See if she has experienced this attitude as well from him, or if he has mentioned anything hateful about you like with his friends. If she backs up him, you should still try to take to your dad about it. If she backs up you, then you should still confront him alone(so he won't feel attacked), but use any information she has given you. Hopefully he apologizes instead of making excuses. ",

            "Despite the comments about confronting your dad about his behavior, which is an emotional cliff you don't want to push, and not the least because you might be standing in the street at the end of it.  Don't do this, its not worth it to be petty too.   \n\nI suggest you move out of there, as you say you make more money than he does; Be an adult, not a dependent.  And then set some boundaries, a moat, whatever it takes.   \n\nWhen you are safe, secure and not at someone else' mercy, then if you must bring this up and clear the air do so.

            "I think your dad was embarrassed that you came home that drunk in front of his friends. It wasn\u2019t right that he said any of that. But think from his perspective. He was most likely humiliated and wanted to make it seem like his upbringing had nothing to do with your actions. \n\nAs for cutting him out of your life forever, that may be a bit drastic. Talk to him, tell him you were awake, and tell him how it made you feel. ",

Are you paying rent and helping while living there?\n\nI think your dad was definitely a disrespectful jerk showing off for his buddies. That is no excuse for the things he said. A group of us go out sometimes and may end up ranting about the kids, but never to this extent, and we always temper it with good things, too.\n\nI just feel like there had to be more to it. Maybe because you've been out of the house already, it's hard to adjust to having a semi-permanent guest for your dad.

            "I feel like most of the comments here are like \"now you know who he is,\" which I understand, but maybe are a younger person's perspective. You've seen a shitty side of your Dad, and it's something you'll have to reconcile with him--or really he'll have to reconcile with you--but people aren't just one thing. He can be a good Dad and a shithead at the same time. This doesn't invalidate him being a good Dad your whole life--he wasn't pretending the whole time. It just means there's a side of him you weren't aware of, which is true of most people. \n\nI've been on the receiving side of hearing good friends talk horrible shit about me behind my back, and I've had to resolve that with them. But take a moment and think about the bitching you've done about your Dad or friends or whoever behind their backs. Maybe you're a better person than most, but most people are capable of this type of thing, although this is definitely a particularly grievous example. \n\nI would recommend confronting him with what you heard. If you're honest about that, and how it made you feel, it may spark some surprising future growth in your relationship, and some future growth with him in terms of becoming less shitheady.",
