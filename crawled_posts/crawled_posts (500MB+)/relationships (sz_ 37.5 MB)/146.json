In my everyday life, I am the problem solver, the fixer, so I was looking at this entire situation as a problem that I needed to solve. I knew if I asked you guys what to do, you would all see it from a prospective that I was just to close to see.Thank you all for showing me that not only was any of this my problem, but also that it was NOT my responsibility to do anything at all in this situation.\n\nClearly, I have shit that need to work on and keep working on. My husband has helped me over the 11 yrs we have been together. I used to be like a field mouse and absolutely terrified to say no to people, sometimes even crying over it. Thanks to the people on here who suggested it, I'm actually going to start practicing saying, standing up for myself and letting No be a complete sentence. My husband said I can practice on him whenever I need to and we will start working g on it today.\n\nOkay so- The Update!\nSunday night I called my Mom and told her everything. I pointed out that we will be gone on the weekend Lea was wanting to get married on and said that for once, I would be putting my foot down. We WILL be going on the trip. My mom laughed and said not to worry and that Lea has lost her damn mind if she thinks any of us will pay for anything. I told her to call my Dad before my sister had a chance to lie to him. My Dad said the same thing as Mom and decided to call Lea's Dad to find out what was going on.\n\nLea's Dad said he told Lea that since he just bought her a car and his business is getting ready to shut down for winter, he could not afford a wedding for her this year. He told her to put the wedding off till around May of next year and that would be enough time. Lea lost her shit. Her Dad said after a lot of screaming, she finally yelled \"I'll pay for it myself!!\". And apparently in Lea's mind, that meant getting all of us to pay for it. My Dad said he needed to tell Lea that not a single  one of us will ever pay for her to get married, ever and if she just absolutely has to, she can do it at the courthouse.\n\nLater that night Lea's Dad called my Dad back and said he sat Lea down and demanded to know WHY she was pushing for a wedding g so soon. Turns out, her boyfriend is joining the Navy and they thought it'd be a good idea to get married. Her Dad told her that none of us are paying anything for her wedding and she would have to go to the courthouse if she had to but there will be no wedding this year. After an hour of yelling, Lea said fine and she will just move the wedding to next year but honestly, if her boyfriend is going away, I can totally see her finding a new guy while he is gone and this whole wedding thing going a way. \n\nSo thank you all so much for helping me. \n\nTL;DR; Lea's got finally got through to her that no one will be paying for her wedding and she agreed to put it off. I'm going to work on myself and have an awesome trip.",

I don't know if any statistics back it up, but it seems like there's a lot of stories about people who rushed to get married because one of them was joining the military and then things end badly because they were too young and hadn't known each other long enough to realize they weren't right for each other. Yeesh. I really hope they don't get married, at least not yet. ",

It is nearly impossible on someone who is at an age where they are going to go through so many changes.\n\nI only have two friends who are my age and divorced (both got divorced at 22).. both of them married some guy in the military that they were hardly with any substantial amount of time. Obviously, this isn't the case for all military marriages, but it certainly seems to be the case that many young people in the military marry people at an extremely young age for the benefits/because they will be apart.\n\nShe'll be glad her parents did this when she realizes she isn't a 22 year old divorcee.",

(in the mental department, pretty common nowadays, doesn't have to mean she's running down the street naked or in a straight jacket).. I hope for your family's sake it's something that passes or can be treated. IF it's the >worst case< scenario then I'd simply try to avoid her but still be polite.. but firm!! and CONFIDENT.. I'm not saying you're not naturally, I don't know you but you said you're a 'yes' person and I know what that's like and have obviously come across other people who ..say yes lol. There are different reasons why we say yes and also make offers to help people. If there's no agenda behind it then I'd say you need to try to set some higher standards, if somebody calls you a bitch then.. who cares really? I think when you get older you tend to care less (unless a person knows you well, is being fair and speaks some truth).. I think generally, different cultures seem to have different ways of disciplining if at all.. I think western culture from what I've noticed fails kids in a way and teaches them to feel entitled and that they can do no wrong.. not everybody but many, at least where I live in Australia.. A lot of mothers will defend their child even when the child is wrong. When me or my sibling were naughty, our mum didn't defend us.. she gave us the smack!!! and then we had to apologise to whoever we offended and my mum would apologise to the parents of the child/teacher or whatever.. We did run around looking like street kids but we were happy that way to play outside and when we received things we were grateful, we never had the surf brands or whatever was cool.. I think I received a Tamagotchi (showing my age).. once it was out of fashion.. Mind you we were lucky to have a roof over our heads.. Nowadays kids are getting neck strain from looking at their friggin tablets!! I don't have a damn tablet!! They don't play outside much anymore, it's sad.. I'm glad that Lea's parents or at least father stood up to her..  I hope there's hope for your niece and wish you all the best in keeping your new stand going!! All the best :)"

        "selftext": "I'm an absolute wreck. Countless consultations, too many tests to counts, FIVE rounds of IVF, months of crying myself to sleep. And now the only source of happiness in my life is gone.\n\nThe past year has been really difficult to me. Last July, my mother passed away and it had been her dream to see me, her only daughter, ripe with children and I'm devastated that she didn't get to experience that. To add to that, in November I was laid off and now the consequences of that have been coming to a head because husband and I can no longer afford another round of IVF, we can barely afford my appointments. My husband and I had been dreaming of the good life: two kids, a dog, and a pretty little house in the country. All of that came crashing down two days ago.\n\nHe had just arrived home from work and I greeted him with a smile and came towards him with the expectation of a kiss, and he walked right past me. When I turned around and ask him what was wrong, he looked at be somberly and told me to sit down. As I sat, I could feel my heart sinking in my chest, although I didn't know why. \n\nHe placed a couple piece of paper on the table and slid them towards me and buried his head into his hands and let out what sounded like a quiet sob. I looked down, shaking, and saw that he was serving me divorce papers. Everything after that is a blur. I have memories of him telling me that he loved me and he was so sorry, but that he had been miserable and if I wasn't able to have a child, he couldn't stay with me. He told me that *he* was the monster and that he couldn't shake his \"biological imperative\" anymore. We'd both agreed early on that if we couldn't have children, we wouldn't adopt because we wanted biological children (please don't judge us). He used to hold me at night and tell me that he would never leave me, no matter what; that being childless was okay and I was worth it. I now know that is all a lie. I can't blame him though, because it was me who was hindering the relationship; I am the broken one. \n\nHis sister and best friend came over yesterday to help him pack up his things and I just laid in my bed and sobbed the entire time. He has rented an apartment on the other side of town and has agreed to pay for our home for the next 4 months until I can find another job and we can sell the house. \n\nI'm devastated. I've not left my bed since the night he left. I haven't eaten anything. I feel like I've already died. What do I do, reddit? I haven't had the courage to tell any of my friends or family yet because I am already shamed by them for being infertile. How could he do this to me? My life is over. \n\n___\n\ntl;dr - my husband of 10 years is divorcing me because I am unable to produce a child for him. All my dreams are crushed and my life feels like it's over. ",

            "**This is the most important thing**\n\nDo nothing with regards to the house, the money, your job, ANYTHING without talking to a lawyer. You need a lawyer yesterday. I am not going to beat this dead horse, but there might be reasons you wouldn't want a job, shouldn't leave the house, etc. You need legal advice before you make any changes whatsoever. \n\n**On to the sensitive stuff**\n\nFirst, as cruel and hard as this is....what can I say? Would you rather he stayed only to resent you? This is one of those situations where there are no good solutions. I know people are going to bandwagon that he's a dick, and he IS a dick, but I don't know that either of you have a lot of options here. He can't stay if he's going to be miserable. I am sorry and I know that's hard to hear right now, but it serves neither of you. This is the hell you have to walk through to get to the other side. And there IS another side.\n \nLife ISN'T over, but this one is. This man, this house, this fantasy...it is over. And you are grieving and you MUST grieve. Something very precious died. And there's nothing I can say or do to make it better for you because there's no making it better. There's just a lot of crying on the kitchen floor, eating ice cream, numbing yourself with boring television and projects and work. That's what comes next. You cry and you shower and you cry and you check your email and you cry some more. You'll hate him and miss him and hate him with every fiber of your being. And you cry. And you make dinner, check the mail, throw away all your ugly clothes, read, cry, and get up the next morning. And that's what it will be. \n\nBut not forever. \n\nSomeday, this will heal. It will heal. You will continue to travel through life and meet people and have experiences and one day you won't remember the last time you had a good cry about this. Life isn't over. Life has barely started. You're in the middle of the novel, the ending is of yet unwritten. I hope desperately you have biological children, and maybe you will. But if not, there's a whole world of other options...and I am NOT talking about adoption, though that's in the mix too. I am talking about a rich, happy, fulfilling life. You are not the first person to hit a brick wall. You are not the first person to have plans A, B, and C not work out. And I will not give you that 'everything happens for a reason' bullshit because that's not true. Sometimes life just shits on you. But sometimes the bad shit puts us on the path to find people, experiences, and desires we'd have never considered. Sometimes plan Q is a winner. \n\nYou must show loyalty to the hard times. They are always going to come. What you do with them, how you let them shape you and gild you....that's what ultimately makes you who you are. They are different for everyone, they are always terrible, but they spit you out as something better and harder at the end of the day. You will be okay. It will be okay. \n\n",
            "I am so incredibly sorry to read this. I cannot even imagine the devastation you are going through. \n\nI wish there were magic words that could help you feel better. If there are, I don't know them. All I can tell you is that you are more than your ability to reproduce. And you are more than your relationship with your husband. You are still you. Sometimes the hopes and dreams we have in life don't pan out. And when that happens, it hurts. A lot. And it's ok to mourn to loss of those dreams. But it's also important not to lose sight of the fact that you are still on this rock and have a life with many other opportunities for happiness in front of you. Please remember that while this piece of your life may be coming to an end, there are still many roads ahead of you with new wonderful opportunities and people. When you are ready, don't be afraid to start traveling down them. \n\nIn the meantime, consider seeking some help from a professional psychologist or counselor to discuss your feelings and help you work through them.

If his sperm is fine, there are other ways for him to have bio kids with you without necessarily needing your eggs. \n\nI feel terribly for you, but if he stayed with you in the marriage it probably would have made him resentful eventually. We all have our selfish needs in a relationship, and his was a particularly big one.",
            "Your life isn't over, but this chapter is.  The good news is you have a world of possibilities open to you now if you're willing to look for them.  Do you have an inkling of how many men are out there that do not want kids?  There are loads that don't have that \"biological imperative\".  You thought you were headed for that so-called dream life of the white picket fence and two kids, but now who knows?  You could end up traveling to a foreign country and meeting a man who wants you for you and not your reproductive ability.  You could find a career path that you can work 80 hours a week towards and find yourself at the top of your field.  You could start your own business.  There are all sorts of options open to you now that would not be realistic with that so-called dream you two shared.  \nTen years is a long time, and you probably won't be able to see any kind of bright side for at least a month.  There is a bright side though, and it's up to you to make sure you take path that makes you look back on this moment in your life and think \"Well I guess everything happens for a reason.\"  ",
            "Exis007 has the most helpful comment.  It's better that he's telling you the truth and ending this sooner than later than staying with you and being miserable while cheating or whatever else.  I'd also like to add that you should **start** talking to your friends/family.  Not telling anyone anything is making this even more hard since you're dealing w/ everything yourself and have no one to talk to.  There's nothing to be ashamed about. Shit happens to a lot of people in all walks of life.  It sucks but we need to move on, there's plenty of people that would gladly be with a woman and NOT want children, not saying that that's the other route, there's many routes, much more experiences, people to see/meet, places to travel in this life.  Don't let the past define you or the approval of one person define you.  Find as many things as possible as you enjoy in life and keep surrounding those things around you.  Best of luck and you and always message me if you need anyone else to talk to! ",

He is dating someone who is great and they are even moving to another state soon for her job.  \n\nYou will find someone else and you can have a family (think about adoption, there are a lot of children in this world who would love to have you as a mother).

            "I'm in a very different situation. I'm a divorced man with two young kids. Most women in their thirties fall into one of two categories: those who are desperate to reproduce immediately, and those who wish to continue living a carefree, childless lifestyle. Once you've had some time to recover, you'll be incredibly popular among single fathers who have few other dating options. You mention that you hadn't been interested in adoption, but you might find step-parenting rewarding.",
            "First of all I am so sorry. This is one of the saddest posts that I've read in a long time. However, I strongly suggest that you call a therapist. Today. You are understandably sinking into a depression and need a professional to talk to. Your husband is absolutely heartless. You can have biological children through a surrogate, but in the long run I think you will be happy to see you did not stay with someone who couldn't love you through the most difficult time of your life. I truly wish you the best of luck OP. ",
            "I would urgently suggest that you lawyer up, ASAP. Don't do anything else until you do.!",
            "Man here. After 7 years of no kids, my wife and I decided to skip IVF and go straight to adoption. I understand it isn't for everyone. Still, if my wife hadn't agreed that we could adopt it would have been devastating. That being said...I married her for the woman she is, not as a babymaker. I hope you are able to come to the realization that he clearly isn't the man you thought he was. Also, lawyer up pronto. He abandoned you and should have to deal with the consequences of that. I've seen people go through divorces and they change...don't trust him. Don't let him stick you with the expenses he owes. Half of the rent/mortgage, utilities, etc. are his responsibilities whether he lives in the home right now or not...until the divorce is final.\n\nBest of luck, I know this feels like the worst thing that could happen.",
            "I am so very sorry. Infertility is such an ugly road at times and it strains even the most solid relationships. But what he did and how he did it was pretty shitty. You are not shamed, he is.\n \nWhat if you found out you had cancer, or a heart condition that would prevent you from ever having kids? That's technically not infertility but it's the same effect. Would he have left you then, when you're sick and need a partner the most? Probably, and it would've been just as shitty. What if roles were reversed and you left him for the same reason? That's where the shame and heartlessness should be. On the partner who couldn't match the challenge of being a supportive spouse.\n \nBut here's the thing. You can rebuild and find someone who loves you for you. Put in perspective, the way he did this, it appears he loved you for your ovaries. I don't want that comment to hurt you, I want you to see how crappy he is being. You are not old or shamed. You can find someone to share the rest of your life with and have many adventures with (even if you don't want to adopt and you decide to be childless). It's about being with someone till the end and that means weathering these kinds of hardships.  You found out now that your husband is not the man to do that with. Do not give up hope just because he turned out to be an ass.\n \nAnd I know you wanted bio kids, I'm not going to judge as everyone has their rules. But consider 1/2 bio kids (with a future, better partner). A good friend of the family married a woman almost 15 years older than him; they are still very much in love after 14 years of marriage. They tried about $100,000 worth of IVF that didn't work. So they then did IVF with his sperm and with donor eggs. It worked, they have beautiful twin girls who are now almost teenagers. They are all very happy. And you wouldn't know to look at them that the girls are not genetically related to their mom. And she is most definitely their mom.  And if she couldn't carry the pregnancy, I'm pretty sure they would've used a surrogate. They had their rules and they found a way to meet them together.  And still if it didn't work, they would've found a way to be together. You deserve that kind of love and partnership. In a way you dodged a bullet because you could've been stuck with this faithless ass for decades until he showed his true colors.",

I hope you see that I am actually trying to help make you feel better by pointing out that it might not be as simple as you think, and that it could be issues you can work on for your next relationship to be successful. \n\nI have suffered from depression and anxiety my whole life and it is extremely hard for my partners to deal with me when I am in my extreme lows. It is very draining to be with someone who cannot create their own happiness and who cannot dig themselves out of those ruts. It is important to have support, but when someone is endlessly supporting another person with no resolution in sight, it is far too much. \n\nPlease consider therapy because this is a lot to deal with. \n\nEdited to add that I think your husband was an asshole to serve papers without discussing it first or trying counselling as a couple.

But the thing is, my deep desire to have children in no way trumps the love I have for my husband, and I know for a fact that he feels the same way. It's really funny how people get married and expect that little fantasy of a white picket fence, a couple of kids, and a dog to happen with the snap of a finger. This is what naivety gets you people.

During that conversation, my husband stood firm that we would not be splitting up because of this and if we couldn't have children, then that was okay because we had each other. We went through this \"infertility\" (miscarriages in my case) with each other. Your husband, for his reasons, has decided not to do that. Great.

He thinks he's got another babymaker on lockdown right now and needs you out of the way so that his potential children with his new partner won't be bastards. Don't go out and get a job, **don't sell the house**. I hate giving out such typical Reddit advice but GET A LAWYER and consider getting a private investigator too.

I can't even imagine all the pain you're experiencing here, and I can only hope you can find some peace with time.  Please know this is NOT your fault.  Those feelings you have that you are responsible for what is happening here, that you did something to deserve this?  Know this is NOT TRUE! You have every reason to feel betrayed and NO reason to feel you have done ANYTHING wrong! \n\nNow, here's why your story makes me so angry I'm almost seeing spots: your husband was a fucking coward.  I am so sorry.   \n\nServing someone divorce papers, unannounced, is what you do to someone who has wronged you beyond repair.  We see plenty of problems in this sub that might warrant this kind of treatment: abuse, infidelity, deceit.  He blindsided you with something that, if it were really the only recourse (more on that later), he should have AT LEAST discussed with you before shoving the papers in your face.  He couldn't even use his own goddamn words.  He made you read it off a legal document.\n\nYou understand his reasoning, sure, and maybe, ultimately, this is still the thing that would have ended your relationship.  But unless theres a big chunk missing from your story, your relationship came to a difficult crossroads (rethink the whole biological thing, or live childfree, or go to counseling), and instead of staying the path \"in sickness and in health\" like he promised, he took the most cowardly option, turned around, and fled.  Maybe after time you could have come to the decision together that the relationship could not go on... but he threw in the towel before the match even started.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, OP.  Nothing.  You are NOT broken.  He is.",

After years of awful and mysterious pain my doctors started telling me that I would never be able to have children. I'm 25 years old. I feel broken too sometimes. \n\nYour husband can leave you and maybe he will have biological children. But you know what? A 35-year-old man who can abandon his beloved wife because she is infertile may be able to be a sperm donor but I doubt he will ever be a real *father.* This is the kind of human being he is when life becomes difficult. You may or may not be able to carry your biological children. No matter what happens you can find a way to care for someone the way that a loving parent should. \n\nI hope that you will be able to conceive a child. I know it feels as if you've died and your dreams of motherhood are gone forever. They don't have to be.\n\nThere's nothing I can possibly say to make this less painful for you. But somehow you will get better. Loving people who choose to do the right thing even in the face of tragedy can always find a way to be parents. Maybe you'll be a mother to your friends, to a cause, to a project you love, to a child you adopt or to your biological child. But you'll be a mother. ",

            "I DO NOT understand why people wont just adopt. Sure its really hard not to have your own child, but who cares? I mean really WHO CARES? Its still a child that needs love and a home. Why wont people just give them a chance instead of spending so much money on something that just isnt going to happen? Its like saying I want a pure breed only and NOT getting a dog even though the shelters are over flowing with really good dogs that need a chance to. And I do understand people are going to rip me a new one for saying this, but really people, it needs to be said and said more often!\n\nThat aside, your husband will have his karma in the end. My ex's aunt was served papers in her hospital bed after giving birth to their 5th daughter and he wanted a son. He got married 2 more times, had his son (poor child may he rest in peace) and that boy died at 9 years old. Karma is a serious bitch sometimes. I dont wish that on your a-hole ex, but I do hope that karma kicks his ass over something SO stupid. SO STUPID! JUST ADOPT GOD DAMN IT!!",

Unless you have bill gates level intelligence or lebron James level physical gifts your genes are NOT special.\n\nYou and your husband could have had the tens of thousands of dollars from treatment and an adopted child that would have been so happy to have a home and someone to care for them.\n\nWill never understand decisions like this.",
            "Don't get down on yourself. None of it's your fault. Your husband is a horrible person, and you are better-off in the long run without him.\n\nI knew a guy whose wife turned out to be infertile. They had done the whole routine of sex at prescribed times and fertility drugs for almost a year.\n\nShe had wanted to stop trying because it had just worn her down. But he just berated her into keeping going. It had to be his biological kid. No other options, and they had to have a kid.They had run-up $100,000 dollars in debt that he insisted on borrowing after they had drained their savings, by the time they finally found out there was no way it was going to happen.\n\nHe then convinced her to talk her sister into donating an egg, which her sister finally gave-in and did.\n\nSix months after their daughter was born he started an affair and carried it on for two years before it all blew-up in his face. Two families ruined, the woman he was cheating with dumped him and went back to her husband. (But there's no way that one's ever going to be the same.) His wife divorced him, and now he sees his daughter every other weekend.\n\nThere's no guarantees that it would have lasted. Your husband's a disingenuous liar. Even if you had never had a problem, and had kids, you still would have been married to the same guy you're seeing him to be now. He didn't change because you're infertile. He's always been this person. Even if you had had children, it would have just been a matter of time before you found out some other way.",

            "Oh wow, I am so sorry for everything you have gone and are going through. My husband and I are both infertile and although it has added extra complications to getting pregnant it has been so much easier to grieve the process as a team. IVF is brutal and so hard on a relationship as it drains every emotional, physical and financial reserve you have. I only done 2 fresh cycles and 2 frozen but every negative (and now an early miscarriage) hurts more than the last. \n\nYou are not even close to an old maid at 32 (at least I hope not as an infertile 31  year old!). I will not tell you that you can still adopt and that will fix everything as I know how difficult adoption actually is and how much of a personal decision. I can say though that (eventually) you will get through this and that life has so many amazing things to offer. I haven't figured out what I will do if kids never become a reality but I know travel and adventure will fit in there somewhere. Most of all I will just say that this sucks, I can't imagine the pain you are going through with a divorce on top of infertility hell.

Circumstances, situations and feelings change. Maybe he didn't understand his own feelings about it, or maybe he genuinely meant what he said at the time. His feelings on it may have changed, however. I don't believe that is his fault. Maybe he realized that having children meant more to him that he initially understood.\n\nWith this in mind, I don't think it's entirely fair to say that he lied to you. I don't think he intentionally or maliciously deceived you. But he changed, his feelings changed. So maybe the promise was a somewhat foolish and reckless one, and I also think the hurt it gave you is understandable, but I'm not sure if he's a liar.\n\nI don't know if it's a meaningless distinction, but I just wanted to mention it. The top responses in this thread echo most of my other thoughts. I'm sorry for all that you've had to go through and I wish you the very best!",

            "The person divorcing you is not allowed to serve you, OP. (At least in my state, NY, you can't). That said, *he* got a lawyer, so you definitely need one for yourself. This is the worst part of breaking up, right now (been there, it's truly awful). You don't have to feel ashamed about not having kids. You need to think of the closest person and call them and tell them exactly what happened. This, for me, is what saved my life in those early days and weeks. The people who loved me circled the wagons. A close relative who I had been estranged from made it her business to stop by every day and check on me to make sure I was up and out the door to work. Work was *my* sanctuary, so I'd suggest you get out there as soon as you're up to it and pick up a job, anywhere, just to have a routine to stick to while you get used to your new life. His reasons for going are so beyond shitty, that I can't even with this guy. May his dick never work the rest of his life (that's an old Italian curse, but my Italian is rusty, so it's in English). I have a close friend who went through round after round of IVF and she was able to get one pregnancy out of it; but she says it did a number on her body, all of that hormone injecting and such. Maybe the universe, in a strange way, is giving you a break from all of this stress and setting you up for something better. It sure showed you how Mr. I'll-Never-Leave-You was full of crap. Move your focus to your own well-being, mental and physical, OP. First, get a lawyer, find out your rights. NO - *tell your family and friends*, then call a lawyer (I got a reference by calling my state bar association-they gave me a wonderful lawyer, she was a real cracker jack). That saying \"one day at a time\" was tailor-made for anyone going through a divorce. If you think down the road too much, you will drive yourself crazy.

Probably the only negative is having no medical history, but that is overshadowed by all the love my parents have given me as if I'm their own because I am their daughter.\r\rI am not judging you for choosing not to adopt and I'm incredibly sorry you are going through all this pain. I simply wanted to give you the perspective of a child of adopted parents who would never ask for a different life.

But that\u2019s not a reason to stay with someone. \n\noriginal post [here](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cnfse9/i_30f_still_cant_decide_if_i_want_to_end_my_12/)\n\nSo, I did it. I left him. After really considering what everyone had to say, and talking to my therapist, friends, family, him, an extremely kind redditor who has spent many many hours listening to me and giving me advice, (even still to this day), and yes, even my crush... I just realized that I couldn't spend any more time questioning things, wondering what else was out there. I had to give myself a chance to have the life I really want.\n\n\nIt's been about 2 months now. We are still living together because we own the home, though I am only sleeping here 3 or so nights per week. We are completely civil with each other. He will be buying me out of the house, for less than I'd get if we sold it, but I don't want to go through the hassle of selling/make him have to uproot his life as well. I'm interviewing for some jobs so I can increase my income and afford to purchase a condo on my own, eventually. There's no time table for when I have to leave, I can take my time since I also own this house. I've been staying in the guest room the nights I am here.\n\n\nI have also been dating my crush, and honestly it is going so well. He's more than a crush at this point, I feel incredibly guilty saying this but I am happier then I have been in a very very long time. Being with someone my own age is really different, and being with someone who really wants to experience life in the same way that I do is blissful. He is so outgoing and social, and just everything we do together is so much fun. I have done more with him in the past 2 months than I have done in the past 10 years, in all honesty. We have gone to a wine tasting, a beer festival, some town events, a few restaurants, gone on hikes with and without my dog, watched the sunset by the river, many many bars with and without friends, bbqs, birthday parties, gone out shopping, danced together in his living room, had a fire in the backyard while drinking wine, and the list goes on. This weekend we are going out of town to visit one of my friends and her boyfriend - a double date night. He bought us tickets to a concert for one of my favorite bands in November and we are making a weekend of it. We cook together, he cooks for me, I cook for him, we go to the gym together (I had never really gone before but he is really into fitness so he's been training me)... And on top of all of that, the sex is fucking mind blowing. We want the same things for our futures, and he encourages me that I can make more of myself than what I have so far. We just have such a great time together.\n\n\nI have also been spending time reconnecting with friends of my own, and it feels amazing to have female friendships again. I literally didn't have that for over a decade. I went out of state one weekend with one friend, and we just talked the whole time about everything you could imagine. We laughed, we cried, we gave each other advice, we shared things with each other. It was just really fulfilling! I can't believe everything I have been missing out on... even just friendships like this. I was so isolated.\n\n\nI feel like an awful person still for leaving such a long relationship, especially since it took another man to open my eyes to how unhappy I really was. But looking back, I was so unhappy for so long, and I just didn't understand why. And now it's much more clear. My ex is a good person and I still don't know how I feel about the age difference, but I do know that it broke my heart to break his. It really did. I still cry about it sometimes, not because I question my choice... but because I don't. I'm excited to move out, I'm excited to get my own place and focus on my career and myself, the way I should have done years ago... And that really rips me up. Spend 12 years with someone and suddenly you just want to go. He didn't deserve this. It's very difficult for me to be around him because I just feel so terrible, even though he tells me it's ok and he has made his peace with it.\n\n\nI just thought I'd update. There's still a long road ahead in all of this, but I feel like I'm on the right path. Life is exciting and unpredictable again. For so long, every day was the same, and what I wanted was irrelevant.\n\n\nTL;DR - I left him. I am incredibly happy, and while I do feel really guilty about that, I am not wavering in my choice. Thanks to everyone who told me to put myself first for a change.",

I'm not saying leaving your other relationship was the wrong idea, but I'm cautioning against comparing that one and this one as a predictor of how successful your new relationship will be. At this point it's simply new, and that brings with it a certain excitement and stimulation. At some point it may become routine as well and fall into a pattern, it's when that happens that you'll be able to test if it has legs. Part of that will be how YOU behave differently than in you did in your former relationship, not necessarily what your new partner does (although that's important too).\n\nI'm in my 40's dating someone who's more than a decade younger. While it's scary to think what would happen if she left me it wouldn't be the end of the world. I'm my own person, I'll survive. Hopefully your ex will find that for himself as well. We have to learn how to be whole people alone. We have to have separate interests and experiences and have our joint interests and experiences be a bonus not a requirement.",
            "I also jumped into a serious, long term relationship when I was 19 with someone 9 years older than me. Not identical to your situation, but similar. The only thing in my teenage mind was wanting to be in a serious relationship, instead of stupid, immature crushes. And I thought I got what I wanted. \n\nWhat ended up happening was the exact same thing as yourself. 8 years goes by, and you\u2019re stuck. You have lost all sense of self, because there wasn\u2019t much self to begin with. I was terrified to break up because I didn\u2019t know life without him in it. But being single isn\u2019t scary, it\u2019s liberating! I grew more as a person in 6 months than in the 8 years we were together. I traveled, went out to various events every weekend, and reconnected with friends I thought I lost. I called it my late twenties renaissance period. \n\nI congratulate you on your enlightenment period. Enjoy your time with your new man, but remember to focus on yourself this time around. In the end, this is your life, and you should be living it the way you want to be.",
            "Happy you are happy but talking about your future with this guy so soon is tricky. Take your time. Im not saying break it up. But try to be ALONE for a while, don\u2019t move in with him or something like that. Jumping from one relationship to another can backfire.\n\nHope u are good and everything goes well in the end.",
            "As far as your ex is concerned, 45 is not old at all. He can work on himself like you worked on yourself to find what makes you happy and be in a position to pursue those things. You shouldn't feel guilty. He's responsible for himself.",

And then he was saying all those manipulative things when you told him you weren\u2019t happy after 12 years of ignoring what you want so you could be the person he wanted? You 100% made the right call by leaving.",

            "I have a thousand things to say on this, but truly, he was an incredible piece of shit for pursuing you in the first place.\nTrue love means wanting the very best for the person you love. Going after someone 15 years younger and only 18 yrs old, no less, he KNEW you deserved someone your age/your stage of life, etc., but he went after you bc it was the best scenario for HIM. Incredibly selfish, and I'm glad you got out.",

They are just bitter, pathetic, useless cowards. You did the right thing.",
            "So happy I got a chance to read both of your post! I\u2019m in a VERY similar situation. I\u2019m (30F) married to a (38M). We have 3 kids in total (1 bonus from him, 2 for he and I), married for 3 years, together for 6 1/2.. these last two years have been tough on me. After a period of finding out he cheated on me prior to marriage and I believe during and then after I reciprocated the action, we tried to make it work, but I haven\u2019t been able to find myself back in a space where I am happy. I thrive in a continuous rolling relationship, I enjoy going out and being active, I feel boring and old when I\u2019m cooped up. I feel like I\u2019ve sacrificed so much of my life in my 20s I lost myself. Needless to say, I want to leave. My therapist told me I sounded miserable in the past but I had to choose between continuing school or working through a divorce. I chose to finish school at the moment.. now that\u2019s that done and I\u2019m back at square one, feeling complacent. \n\nI connected with someone and he\u2019s really nice, but I won\u2019t allow myself to get caught up in it, I\u2019ll get frustrated. Unfortunately, connecting with someone has made me realize even more that I\u2019m unfulfilled. My husband isn\u2019t a horrible guy. He\u2019s a great dad and he tries. I just have my hang ups.. he has been guilty of lying about serious things for attention and some things that require attention, he very passive about. I don\u2019t feel the security I would like to feel from a man. I don\u2019t feel stable and I\u2019m always feeling like I have to get the job done. \n\nI don\u2019t want to sacrifice my happiness anymore.",
            "I'm glad you are doing so well. Although it is often difficult, people get through divorce all the time and live to tell the tale - I am sure he will do so.\n\nFrankly I think someone in their 30s should have known the risks of pursuing an 18-year-old kid whose brain wasn't even fully developed when the relationship began. But ultimately I hope everyone in this situation ends up happy and healthy and learns from their experiences.",

I feel some redditors expect people to marry between the ages of 18 - 25 and remain the exact same person, compatible with their partner, for the next 60 years. That\u2019s a fairytale. Life does not work that way. \n\nYou\u2019re still very young and it appears you missed out on a lot of experiences people your age already have had. You still have your whole life ahead of you. You have to put yourself first. \n\nSometimes a person will come along in our lives who will change our perspective on everything we thought we knew.

            "I was in a similar position myself when I left my girlfriend of 6 years (I did not have a crush though).  My current girlfriend was in EXACTLY the same situation you described in your original post.  We started dating pretty quickly after she left her ex and honestly we haven\u2019t looked back since- it\u2019s been amazing.  We\u2019re about to celebrate our two-year anniversary soon and couldn\u2019t be happier.  \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s important to remember that you and your boyfriend/crush will need to do a LOT of open communicating about a whole shit ton of stuff so you both can fully process how this relationship started.  People are going to judge this relationship because of how it started and you will likely get a majority of it.  Figuring out how to navigate and deal with as a couple that is important- you need to establish yourselves as a team.",
            "Good for you! It isn't easy to do what you did, but you did it anyway. I feel kind of lost myself, at the moment, so reading your story gives me hope.",
            "I'm so, so happy for you. You're not an awful person for wanting to live your life. Your spouse may not be a bad person but he was clearly very bad *for you*. You already gave him so much of your time, never feel bad for not continuing to make the same mistakes.",
            "(1)\n\nI'm really happy for you.\n\n(2)\n\nAll that stuff other people have said about being cautious with any potential beliefs about where this will go or about how things could turn out with the new guy. But your statement in a comment that, even if he'd stopped being an option early on, the contrast would have planted a seed anyway, is very encouraging. You didn't want to leave \"for\" somebody else. You wanted to leave because somebody else had broadened your awareness to some pivotal information about what you want in life.\n\n(3) \n\nKeep in mind that you're both much older and much younger, emotionally, than the majority of your same-age peers. You're older because you understand twelve years of marriage, and you spent those years experiencing a long amount of time of a sort of domesticity that is still in their future, or which they have only just begun.\n\nYou're younger because who you were at eighteen has been, in some ways, locked in for those twelve years while you had to stagnate in order to stay a suitable match for your husband. Your husband who you've now outgrown. You're young because he's all you've known, and you simply haven't collected the experiences many others have collected at your age. \n\nI don't in any way mean to be condescending, but -- from my perspective as someone who's about your age -- you write of your marriage and of your current, new relationship in a way that sounds about... 22ish. Like someone much younger. And how could you be any other way? Your marriage has been utterly dependent on you stopping yourself from outgrowing the person you were when you were with your spouse. \n\nYou are now experiencing something most people experience far younger, based on your description of how it's been so far with this man. It's an amazing feeling. I'm so glad you're getting it. And you describe it exactly the way young people describe it. Pretty fucking great, yeah? \n\nAnd then if it ends, which it probably will since statistically most relationships do, you'll learn about being a single adult. And then when you date someone else, you'll learn that you can experience that rush several times, and the loss of the person with whom you first experienced such bliss does not in any way mean you won't find that same level of bliss again. And then one day you'll date someone, and experience that bliss, and then realize the quality *lasts*. And that's the person you'll seriously commit to. And you two won't outgrow each other. You'll instead grow together.\n\nYour emotional growth is going to *explode* forward now. It's going to explode forward the way every shock-to-the-system life change spurs growth. You're going to be emotionally 30 in the relationship department soon enough. \n\nI'm really happy for you.\n\nPS: I don't inherently judge age gaps. But yeah, 18yo's who date far older people inevitably outgrow them. With a 30yo who starts dating a 45yo my main concern for them is mainly practical: how will medical stuff go, what about how their ages might affect stuff related to parenting, etc etc. 18 and 33, the concerns are about emotional matters. \n\nIf I were you, I'd also try to figure out why, at eighteen, I even wanted a 33yo. For me, at eighteen, I also wanted that. It was because I'd never really been parented, and older people provided some sense of what a loving parent might be like. For you it might have been something different. But you **need** to figure out whatever it was. Don't just read and learn about romantic relationships; also reflect on what you craved back then, what your parents were like, and whatever your childhood denied you that you were looking for in your husband. If you don't consider those things it will come back to bite you in the ass. Again.\n\nI am so happy for you, and I wish you all the best.",
            "Yeah age differences that big stifle growth because usually the younger person is subconsciously with the older person for support. Whether that is finance, emotional or codependency type of thing, so the younger person doesn\u2019t grow to their full potential. Happy you are finding yourself!",
            "There\u2019s such a difference in your new post. You sound like you\u2019re flourishing wonderfully now instead of being stifled and stuck in that grey socialist dead relationship.",

            "Idk why you were/are getting hate for this, you were obviously unhappy in that relationship. You didn't just decide on a whim that you were done, you'd been contemplating it for awhile and you've obviously made the right choice for yourself. And there is nothing wrong with that! Staying with someone just because is one of the most toxic things you can do for yourself imo. If you're not happy, leaving them is better than being miserable and possibly doing something you'll regret like cheating or develop resentment towards them. So, good for you OP! Go enjoy your best life.",
            "Regardless of what's right and what's wrong, the heart wants what the heart wants and nothing will change that. You went where your heart led you. There's nothing wrong with that. It'll either work out, or it won't but at least you won't regret never trying.",

I agree you should leave your ex, but you should be alone for a while and figuring things out, not jumping another relationship with another man especially a dude whom you had emotional affair with and played a lil bit part of you leaving your ex.\n\nbut hey, look at the bright side, if someday your new man fall in love with another woman while still with you and leaving you cause of it, at least you can't complain. you know falling in love with a human while you still have a relationship with another human is much much fun, the thrills.\n\nyour ex is no saint, but you're no victim in this story.",

But Haters gon a hate no matter what.\n\nEither way. I did what you just did at 25, dated the person I fell for. 18 months later, we are going strong.\n\nAll the best",
            "Hey, people here say that you should be wary of the new relationship, so I just wanted to provide a positive example. I, too, left my husband and dived headfirst into a new relationship. I immediately felt that it was the right person: caring and supportive, someone willing to work as a team and solve problems. I remarried four months after my divorce, we have been married for two years and are currently planning a pregnancy.\n\nMy divorce helped me realize that there are too many gray areas in life. For outsiders my sudden decision to leave my husband and move on looked shitty, and there are still some people who dislike me for it, but for me it was the best option, because even though we had no visible issues in our marriage, there were few positive moments either. I knew that if I stayed, I would be unhappy.\n\nThe pangs of guilt will go away with time, trust me. When your ex-husband moves on, you will discover that this decision was beneficial for both of you. Everything well be ok. It just takes time.\n\nDo whatever makes you happy!",

I hope that you not only learn to enjoy life, but enjoy being on your own too. Being alone/single/not totally tied down is so freeing.

It will all turn to shit for him when you step out of that house.\nThe reasons you specified about him too, From that perspective it just means you left him cause he's a little introverted and cause he's not a \"performer\" and the funny thing is you stayed for 12 years eventhough you knew. So what I'm saying is, when this man is almost fed up cause he's alone, maybe he'll do something to himself and maybe he'll never find happiness again.\nIf you're always happy in this new relationship maybe it's the right one for you but after some time don't you dare interfere with this guy, cause you have no right.

It actually helped me emotionally, and lead to catching the perpetrator! And yeah, confronting them would have been an idiotic idea (we found knives and they have gang connections, read OP) so thank you guys getting that idea out of my head.\n\n\n\nSo a few people advised I look at pawn shops and trading sites. I took the advice and set up notifications for every post in to the local Facebook trading pages. When through hundreds...but then I saw my stuff! It was just a bag and a few dresses. I logged on to my boyfriend's Facebook account and removed my family from his friends list so the thief doesn't connect him back to us. I sent the person (she used a fake profile) a message and started a conversation about the bag, pretending I was interested. Mum called the police and they turn up to our house as I still talking to the suspect. Once I knew I had her, I asked for the address. Boom. It was the house we had suspected. The police move in immediately. It was kind of exciting! I had set up a sting, thanks to you guys!\n\n\n\nWe get updated later that day that they retrieved some of our stuff from three different houses?!? Turns out there were at least 5 people who had come through our house, which is absolutely terrifying. But that does explain how they managed to wipe so much stuff. There is one adult going to court, and the girl is getting referred to a youth justice Family Group Conference.\n\n\nThey didn't have our more valuable items any more. So the TVs, bike, and a chandelier (they even took the lightbulb). I am still keeping an eye out but we are most likely going to have to replace them, which means saving up a couple thousand dollars just because some people decided to be cunts. Ugh. We can seek financial reparation but the officer said these people are of a low socio-economic status so it could just be $10 a week. Bye, Christmas travel.\n\n\n\nThank you guys so much for your support. I will update if anything else happens but I think this is the end. I am still angry and hurt, but I'm starting to accept what has happened. I've cleaned up most the mess they left and the house is feeling like home again.

I really didn't expect my post to get much attention so I appreciate all the time people put in to offering me solutions to this issue.\n\nAfter reading everything everyone said, and taking a few days to sleep on it, I finally decided to talk to Stephanie about the situation. A lot of people recommended that I straight up tell her she's overweight and she's not this thin person she thinks she is, but after really thinking about it, I felt that it wouldn't be beneficial to her mental health, no matter if she has BD or not, for me to do that. I felt it would be more appropriate for me to emphasize the parts of whatever is going on with her mental health that are negatively impacting our relationship and continue to push her to get help.\n\nSo that's what I did. I sat down with her Friday night and I told her that the issues she's struggling with mentally have become a barrier in our relationship. I explained to her that I felt that she sometimes stood behind her mental health problems as an excuse to not be a good partner, or to justify bad behavior that hurt me and our relationship. She wouldn't really acknowledge this at first but she eventually conceded that it's not fair to blame her behavior on any mental health issues and that she knows she uses it as a crutch because she gets embarrassed of the way she behaves. \n\nThen I talked to her about the BD. I explained to her that it feels to me like she is letting it define her as a person, and she lets her life revolve around it, and I don't feel that it's empowering her or helping her and I want her to get help. She told me that she feels her forum and personal research is help but I told her that this has been going on to some degree for our entire relationship and that just because she feels that she has discovered what is \"wrong\" with her doesn't mean she has fixed it. I told her that if she seriously feels that there is something wrong within her that is keeping her from being the person she wants to be, she needs to get help. \n\nNow, a lot of commenters felt that she didn't have BD (I'm still undecided) and that I needed to tell her she is just overweight. I was definitely not comfortable doing that. I don't think I am qualified to make a diagnosis and regardless of whether it is BD or it isn't, there is something wrong here and I am not capable of fixing it myself. \n\nSo anyway. I told her all of that and we both cried. She told me she feels horrible for the way she has acted at times and she knows that it's not her, and this is why she brings up the BD in fights, because she doesn't want me to feel that the person she can be when we fight is who she truly is. I told her I know she isn't that person, but that since she isn't able to control herself when she gets that upset, she needs to talk to someone who can give her coping mechanisms.\n\nWe ended up looking into our county health resources for indigent people with no healthcare (her income qualifies her as indigent) and found two potential places in the area that offer low-cost mental health services to qualifying people. Stephanie texted me this morning (I'm at work) and told me she left a message for one of the facilities and she scheduled an intake appointment at another one of the facilities. The intake is free and then they discuss cost, payment plans, etc. when they make their \"treatment plan\". This suggestion from a commenter really saved our relationship, so thank you so much to everyone who suggested it.\n\nI feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I feel horrible that I came across in my post that there was nothing good about Stephanie or that I didn't respect or love her - I love her tremendously, and she is a great person who struggles with mental health issues, as many of us have in our lives. I believe she is committed to making a change, and I guess at the end of the day, whether or not she has BD isn't the biggest issue here, and making my post made me realize that. The biggest issue is that something is unwell with her mentally and she needs the proper treatment to feel better, and in turn be a better partner.\n\nTL;DR We had a long talk and Stephanie agreed to get help. She made an appointment this morning for an intake appointment with a county resource for low-income people with no healthcare, and is going to pursue treatment. ",

            "Halfway through this post I was not expecting a good outcome, I am happy I was wrong :) I have an extremely low tolerance for people who blame everything wrong with their lives on imaginary problems and what not; this post made me think that some may be using it to deal with deeper problems, and that sometimes one should think twice before saying something.\n\n",
            "As someone with mental health issues myself, you've handled this like a champ. You're a great partner and it sounds like you have a mature relationship and a great girl (who just needs a bit of help!)",

            "This is a really healthy way of handling a bad situation. I hope that everything works out and that this post gets attention. You did really good. I hope that your girlfriend is able to commit and get the help she needs.",

            "I'm so happy you talked about this to her in a respectful way, and that it seems like she's really taking steps to improve the situation. I agree with you that just telling her she's overweight would never have done anything other than hurt her to no productive end, and that neither you nor anyone here is qualified to determine whether or not she has BD or an eating disorder.\n\nGood luck to both of you in the future!",
            "Glad to hear this good update. Let us know how the treatment goes.",
            "You've handled this with great sense and sensitivity. Wishing you both the best. ",

            "You did the right thing.\n\n>She told me that she feels her forum and personal research is help\n\nIt's not help, it's positive reinforcement. She needs help from someone impartial. That's definitely the right thing for her.",
            "This is a truly great outcome - as a fat woman, I was cringing at the thought of you blatantly saying 'you don't have BD, you're just overweight', and I think realising that sort of diagnosis is above your pay grade and supporting her with getting help was the best solution, both for her mental health and the health of your relationship. Well done!",
            "Awesome.\n\nGood for both of you OP. What a great partner you are. I'm glad she's seeking treatment. \nThis is great to hear. \n",

            "Good job! You handled this super well. You were totally right to not bluntly assert your opinion on her health status: that really should be handled by a doctor.\n\nI'm very happy this has ended with her seeking professional help. It's always good to be familiar with your local health care options and feel comfortable using them. ",
            "She suffers from food addiction more than 'mental health problems that make her behave like an asshole'. Hiding wrappers in the car is like an alcoholic hiding bottles in the toilet cistern. Total addict behaviour. \n\nI hope it all works out for you but she obviously isn't enjoying being obese (markering out her clothing sizes) and both her mental and physical health would improve if she lost the weight. /r/loseit will have some moral support for her if you ever feel ready to bring it up. ",
            "Please make sure that she actually goes through with treatment and doesn't just say that she's going to \"pursue\" or \"look into\" it.",
            ">she doesn't want me to feel that the person she can be when we fight is who she truly is. I told her I know she isn't that person\n\nYes it is. If she got upset and beat you would it be ok because that's \"not who she really is\"? People are multifaceted, all of their actions are part of who they are.",
            "Think about if you ever have kids? what happens if you want to start a family some day and she ends up dying of weight related issues when your children are still toddlers. You need to get her to lose weight or leave her. Its not healthy and she will die from it. Do you want to be apart of that?",
            "Congratulations on communicating! Also your last post you didn't need to out right say you love her, you care so much about her you were seeking help from strangers! That shows so much how you love and care for her. \n\nGood luck going forward! It won't be easy but it will be rewarding in the end. ",
            "That's awesome. You sound like a real good dude, and it sounds like she's hurting, but will get the help she needs, thanks to YOU. A lot of people would have let it slide or just left, but whatever happens for you two, know that you've really changed her life for the better. ",
