        "selftext": "My husband and I met in college. His family were nice whilst we were dating but did a 180 when they found out my husband was planning to propose. They tried to convince him not to and threatened to disinherit him/financially cut him off (they never went through with the latter) if he did. He\u2019d warned me that his family were elitist when we met, so I wasn\u2019t that shocked by their reaction. In the end, he proposed and cut them off completely.\n\nThey tried apologising before our wedding, but my husband refused to talk to them and wouldn\u2019t invite them.\n\nFast forward to now we\u2019ve been married for over two years and his sister reached out to me over Facebook. She said she\u2019d been trying to contact my husband for a week, but he wouldn\u2019t respond to her or any of their family and she didn\u2019t want to deliver the news in a message. She asked me to ask him to call her. I mentioned it to my husband, and he said he wasn\u2019t going to do it, and that this was another one of their games to try and get him to contact them. I relayed the message to my SIL, and she ended up telling me that their grandfather was very sick, and he was desperate to see my husband again. Their family is worried he isn\u2019t going to make it.\n\nI tried to tell my husband this but he\u2019s adamant that they\u2019re lying despite his sister having sent me pictures as proof (he refuses to look at them). His parents have both called me to apologise for how they behaved again and are begging me to convince my husband to see reason.\n\nMy husband\u2019s grandfather is the person he was closest to and I know if he passes away without them making up, my husband won\u2019t be able to live with himself. I know he\u2019s still hurt by how his family reacted, but I think he\u2019s letting that cloud his judgement. How do I make him see that they\u2019re not lying when he\u2019s in so much denial?\n\nTL;DR \u2013 My husband\u2019s family were unhappy about him proposing to me and tried to force him not to. He ended up cutting them off and he\u2019s continued to stay NC despite them apologising and reaching out several times over the years. Now his grandfather is sick, and he thinks they\u2019re lying despite sending us proof and is adamant about continuing to ignore them.",

            "You can't force your husband to get back in touch with his family, and if you try it's likely to cause problems between the two of you as well. \n\nYou can say, once, \"I know you're still hurt by the way they treated you and us, but I worry that you're going to regret it if you don't see your grandfather before he passes away and I don't want to see you hurt even more by this. I totally support whatever you decide to do, but this is the evidence that he's sick, and I believe your sister when she says that he probably doesn't have much time left. Please think about it, and let me know if you need to talk.\"\n\nThen leave him alone. He knows his family better than you, it's possible that they really are using this crisis to try to bring him back in, where the control tactics and manipulation will start again. Trust your husband to know what he needs.",
            "> I mentioned it to my husband, and he said he wasn\u2019t going to do it, and that this was another one of their games to try and get him to contact them. \n\nThis is not the kind of thing a person says after *one* transgression. I get the strong feeling that your husband has been putting up with bullshit from his family for a very, very long time. Their objections to your marriage were just the final straw. \n\nYour husband knows his relationship with his grandfather better than you do. As hard as it may be, I think you need to back off and let him handle his family how he sees fit. He\u2019s not unaware of his previous closeness to his grandfather. He\u2019s *choosing* to stay away anyway. If you think your husband is a fundamentally reasonable person, then trust him to know how to handle his family - even if it makes you uncomfortable. He may make different choices than you would under the same circumstances, but that doesn\u2019t make him wrong.",
            "It is likely that them trying to stop marriage was the last straw in larger history of controlling behavior. You treat it is singular exceptional event, by but he likely see it as part of larger pattern. \n\nI think it is not just about him feeling hurt. Cutting parents off is hard emotionally. Even if those parents are narcistic or abusive. He might be refusing to trust then now for that reason - contact might re-open emotional can of worms. If they are the kind of people who could plausibly lie about this, if he is not paranoid, contact is risky. \n\nHow much do you two talk about his childhood? Maybe it would be worth asking him about.",
            "His insistence in maintaining NC makes me think that his issues go far beyond threats of disowning or disinheritance.  Maybe they were abusive when he was younger and he hasn't been able to discuss it with you yet, maybe they said unforgivable things about you and he never told you to spare your feelings.  As much as I agree with you, I think the most important thing here is to support your husband regardless of what he decides.",
            "Do NOT go behind his back and contact them. Don't badger him into reconnecting with them. He went no contact for a good reason. He can make the choice to communicate with them or not. They only came to you because he won't answer them. \n\nI sincerely doubt they've changed their views or behavior.  They want to weasel their way back into his life, and try to control him. What you heard about them not wanting him to marry you? Probably  not even the tip of the iceberg. There was probably plenty of behind- the-scenes shittiness you didn't get to hear about.\n\nIn any case, please don't force your husband to contact them, and don't contact them. Let him decide how he wants to approach this.",
            "[deleted]",
            "It\u2019s his family. He grew up with them. It\u2019s extremely unlikely that there was just one thing that made him go NC. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to see them. Please don\u2019t push it.",
            "I'm sorry but I think you are handling this wrong. My husband is also no contact with his family and my number one policy is that I am in his corner. I support him no matter what he decides. That means that anytime his family reach out to me I tell him and ask him how he would like me to proceed. If he wants me to ignore it, I do, no questions asked. If he wants me to respond, I do, no questions asked. \n\nIt is okay to tell him what his sister said and talk to him about concerns you have about him being hurt, but beyond that your roll is to support his decision. You should 100% tell his family that and then proceed however he wants you to. If his parents or sister reach out to you again tell them \" this is husbands decision to make and I completely support him no matter what he decides. Please stop contacting me.\" They are using you to try to manipulate him and that it not okay and will also destroy your marriage long term. \n\nMy husbands family does not even try to contact me anymore because they know that they cannot go through me to get contact to him. He knows more about his family then you do, and you need to trust his judgement on this. You may have a great relationship with your family, but that is not the case for everyone and you cannot force it to be.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the the gold kind redditor!  I'm really blown away this comment resonated with so many people. Big hugs to those of you who have had to cut off or go low contact with family. It is always hard, but stick to your boundaries. It is okay to put your own mental health first!",
            "He must have had issues with his family before you even came along. Otherwise he would have accepted their apology before the wedding. Or talked to them at any point in your marriage. He must not care about pop-pop that much or he would go and check on him, even if he thought it could be a lie. \n\nIn  any case, I'd let it go. Can't force him to do anything. And after the way they treated you, they shouldn't feel so comfortable trying to go through you to get to him.",

            "Don\u2019t get involved. I cut off my Grandparents and my wife tried a few times with the whole \u201cthey are your family\u201d crap and saying I\u2019ll feel guilty. Guess what? When they died I didn\u2019t feel anything, not guilt or happiness. Nothing, because I didn\u2019t like them.",
            "I feel like people who didn't grow up with manipulative family don't  understand how it completely upends the normal, ideal conception of what a \"family\" is. No,  family is not inherently trustworthy and does not inherently want the best for you or for you to be happy. You will not lock eyes and shed a plaintive tear and instantly understand and forgive each other. That's some Hollywood shit, and your family will use that conception against you until the day you cut them off. They might have tried to manipulate him like this before.\n\nYou say his grandpa was who he was closest to right? Where was he when his family cut him off? Maybe that betrayal hurt more than anything and he doesn't want to see his grandpa even if he is dying.",
            "Plenty of great comments here, would just like to add that your husband refusing to even look at the pictures since he thinks it's a ploy... LISTEN TO HIM. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong but your reaction was automatic \"They must be telling the truth, no one would lie about that,\" right? His wasn't. \n\nYou've only seen the tip of the iceberg, and the tip of the iceberg was threats and trying to kick you out of his life. \n\nThat's one hell of a tip. \n\n>Now his grandfather is sick, and he thinks they\u2019re lying \n\nHave you considered that maybe he's right, that **you think his grandfather is sick** and they're lying? Or that he might be sick but after talking to your husband would have a \"miraculous recovery?\" in the style of certain leaders of nations. \n\nI mean, what are you basing your judgment on? Getting \"proof\" sounds fishy to begin with .",
            "Stop thinking you know your husband better than he does:\n\n>I know if he passes away without them making up, my husband won\u2019t be able to live with himself. I know he\u2019s still hurt by how his family reacted, but I think he\u2019s letting that cloud his judgement.\n\n**Your husband knows what's at stake and is proceeding with his course of action anyway.**\n\nI cut off my dad three years ago. I know there may come a day where I will find out he has died, and any chance for reconciliation is lost for ever. **I know this. I am still choosing to remain no-contact with him anyway.** Cutting off family is *hard*, even when they are terrible to you. Even when you know it's the right course of action, it is NOT taken lightly. You indicating your husband made this incredibly difficult and personal decision (that he has remembered every single day in his life) as a rash emotional response is incredibly dismissive. \n\nBased on your description, you really do sound like you've been manipulated into acting as a flying monkey on your husband's family's behalf. \"My husband's sister reached out to me because he won't talk to her. She asked me to ask him to call her. She asked me to tell him the news. She asked me to show him the photos. His parents are begging me to change his mind. Now **I** am pushing him to make peace with his family, because of things the family he cut off has told me.\"\n\nThe relationship between your husband and his family is between your husband and his family: the very fact they are asking you to intervene on their behalf is making me inclined that this is just another manipulative game they're playing. Regardless of whether the grandfather is sick or not, or how desperate they are for a reconciliation, their behaviour (\"no, he HAS to get back in touch with us! You MUST push him to get back in touch with us! It will be SO upsetting if he doesn't, and time is running out!\"), indicates they have not changed. Trust your husband to know how to handle this - if he doesn't want a bar of it, then that's the course of action you are both to take.",
            "Don't insert yourself into your husband's relationship with his family. Don't keep being a messenger, don't push him to do things one way or another. It is his relationship with his family, it is not your job to manage it. Instead encourage your husband to talk about his feelings and be supportive however he feels.",
            "I guess I would ask him... if they are not lying, would it make a difference to him? If I were in his shoes, I am not sure it would. G'pa is dying. Family has manipulated to maintain contact. This is the consequence of being an asshole family member. Dying with unresolved issues and regret. Do you REALLY know what he could or could not live with? Any chance of projection here?",
            "This is your husband's decision to make and his family is being inappropriate by involving you in this.  He's an adult and he gets to make his own decisions even if they will hurt him later.  Allow him to regulate his own relationships.",

            "I was asked to see my NC father on his deathbed and chose not to. It was my choice alone and I understood the consequences. What I needed from my family was their unquestioning support for my decision.\n\nInterestingly enough, that was years ago and I'm aware that he is still alive.",
            "My wife tried NC with her family, but they would use the saddest news to guilt her. For many years - they said they were dying and my wife had a heart of stone (my wife is the most caring person BTW). \n\nAll these years later they are all still alive, but some of them have some moderate medical issues they didn\u2019t have before. They have since stopped saying - they are \u201cdying\u201d ... only because it might happen sooner than they thought now. Disinformation is a tactic in many families and your husband may have been lied to too many time before to care. \n\nOver these years, my wife\u2019s family has done some really messed up things - that my wife wished she didn\u2019t have those memories of their craziness. Your husband might not want to make more memories of/with them - so the better times stay fresher. \n\nKeep in mind that he loves you enough to flush them down the toilet. Stand by his side with his decision because he has taken your side these past few years.",
            "Support him and his decision. You can't force him to do something he doesnt want to, and it's his family and relationships in the end. I'm sure he has thought about it carefully, and he made his decision. He probably made it the day you both married.",
            "No advice, just sending some love to your husband. My grandmother is very old and I haven't been able to bring myself to forgive her. I'm confused, and angry, and hurt, and it's very confusing. I'm afraid she'll die before we make up but I'm just not able to get to a point where I can even talk to her through email.\n\nI'm sorry he's in this position and that his family hurt him to the point that he has to make this choice.

            "I feel if the grandfather wanted to speak with OPs husband, HE would have found a way. Yeah, he's 80/90, but lots of seniors find a way to make a call. Maybe if the grandfather reached out directly, OPs husband would \"come around.\" I suggest OP make ONE last appeal, but if he says \"no\" then OP needs to accept that. Or, risk a rift in her relationship with her husband.",

            "You cannot force him to talk to his relatives, and it could irreparably damage your marriage if you try.",
            "Honestly, I think you need to disregard the rest of his family on this one. Make sure your husband has all the information and resources he needs to make a sound judgement on seeing his grandfather or not. This means something along the lines of: making the message available to him to review (use your discretion), giving him time, not pressing the issue, and letting him sleep on it.\n\nTell him you trust his judgement, that his happiness is your priority in all of this, and that you're there for him.\n\nAlso, INFO: is there a distance/travel issue? Work concerns? Pandemic safety concerns? Young children at home? There could be a lot more at play here.",
            "He's a rockstar tbh. But in the end it's his choice. Sometimes you just have to cut the lines of toxic people out of your life, and family tend to use their status as people who share relation with you in order to find their ways into one's life. With that said, I'd put some thought behind it and speak to him one last time and just leave the issue for him to settle. \n\nSometimes we make choices we later regret, but you cannot always prevent people from doing so.",
            "I'm sorry, but you can't force him into this. You aren't privy to his childhood with these people and any long lasting effects it may have had. Going no contact with a whole family is not a decision made lightly and is not one people often want to break, particularly with narcissistic or controlling parents. It isn't fair for you to impose what *you* believe is right under the guise he'd feel guilty forever if he didn't hear an apology. He will grieve whether he sees his grandfather or not - he doesn't have to open up his world to these people again if he doesn't want to.",
            "I know this post has blown up, but I wanted to add a little nuance to the general trend of responses. \n\nBefore you talk to your husband, check in with yourself. How are YOU feeling about this matter?\n\nIf I was in your shoes, I would feel somewhat guilty about how him & his family fractured. You did not create their opinions, but your engagement was the catalyst to these events. If I was in your shoes, at some point I would have felt responsible for the falling out. This current 'emergency' looks like a good opportunity to turn things around. \n\nSo, I don't blame you for wanting to take part in mending his wounds. It seems like the right thing to do, if working on instinct & good faith.\n\nYou may be far more emotionally grounded than I. Hopefully, you understand that what him & his family disagreed on was their values, not your presence. \n\nSo, what about your husband? It's obvious that he's putting out a great amount of strength to say he won't even look at the pictures. If he speaks of his grandfather often, there must be a reason why he's fighting so hard against those longing feelings. \n\nI would agree with the majority here that it takes such immense amount of energy to deny his own family that there must be something bigger than what is implied with what we are given, especially if his childhood was positive.\n\nHis family is not physically abusive. That's a good start. His family is elitist. That implies that they believe that a person must fit certain criteria for them to be accepted. Maybe your husband finds that belief so contrary to his way of life that the situation is irreconcilable. Possible.\n\nWhat if... that elitism goes further than family? What if they're classist, or racist, or just have an anti-social way of life, and your husband knows through personal experience how harmful that can be? \n\nMaybe it's not just the wedding. What if they call you horrible things when you're not around? They were fine with you when you were temporary. Actually being a part of their lives meant something very different. They're apologizing only after he followed through with his intention to disconnect. Maybe they thought he was bluffing, but maybe... they're not actually sorry?\n\nA lot of people here are assuming they were always abusive. I would say that I've read a lot of people's sorrow when they describe cutting off their family because they adopted truly disgusting beliefs during the world's increasing political tension. Maybe that happened.\n\nOverall, reddit's opinion is clear: this is not your problem to fix. It is one situation of many when a loved one is in a place of hurt & all we can do is watch, hug, and give our support. Anything more than that might harm him more than help. We are all people, and sometimes our decisions have unanticipated consequences. I personally believe that your husband saw this coming.",

            "I understand that it's difficult, but you really should be telling the sister and the family that it is really inappropriate to be contacting you as a means to getting to your husband. He is an adult and free to make his own choices (whether it is what you would decide or not). As suggested, now that you have the information, you can tell him that you support him no matter what and drop it.\n\nOne of my closest friends is NC with her family. Her mum has contacted me on various occasions asking for updates, photos, and intel on my friend. She said that it could be done in secret so that my friend wouldn't be upset with me. She used every excuse in the book (her elderly mother misses my friend and is sick and dying, she is dying of heartache, she has no idea why my friend won't answer any of her calls). It's textbook manipulation. I have since blocked her but before I did I told her just how inappropriate it was to be contacting me and I'm sure if my friend wanted to contact her, she will find a way. That's when the mums true character came out, she started calling me names, threatening to find where I live and contacting my friends and family to say what a terrible person I was and harass them also. All the \"valid\" reasons she wanted to contact my friend melted away revealing that all she wanted was control.\n\nThe above is all to say, you are probably wrong. Your husband understands the family dynamic better than you and he needs your support. If I hadn't been in my friends corner, I would've have lost her as a friend and she is amazing. More importantly, she would've had to add another person to the list that she couldn't trust. Don't become another person on your husbands list.",

Let her know your husband is currently uncomfortable with the idea but that you will make sure he has the photos and info available to him in case he changes his mind. Thank her for letting you know. Do not give any other personal information about the two of you if she tries to get conversational. If she lashes out and says nasty stuff to you because you won't do any more, you'll know their true colors.\n\nBTW- Your husband's decision to go NC likely has more to do with his experience giving them chances and being manipulated.

You\u2019ve told him. You\u2019ve passed the message. That\u2019s all you can do. It really is. You have to let it go.",
            "Man.... props to your husband for seeing thru their manipulation. You see \u201cnot getting over it,\u201d I see a family who\u2019s reaping the consequences of their actions.\n\n**YOU** are his family. Follow his lead on this. Be a soundboard - a sound board doesn\u2019t push the person in any general direction either way. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for his family. But did they think he won\u2019t have conviction? That must have been a tough decision on him and for him to make that call, well.... makes me wonder what combination of other things in his life that added up, contributing to his decision to cut them off. \n\nYou say you know he won\u2019t be able to live with himself, but sounds like he could. If you\u2019re right, grandfather does pass away & husband regrets not making up with him, grief therapy is an option. \u201cWhy let it get that far?\u201d That\u2019s a valid point. Grief therapy option is available to anyone regardless of their closeness to the deceased or not (except those who are in it for drama - that\u2019s fucked up). It was so helpful for me when my grandmother I was very close to passed away and we were in very loving terms. I miss her everyday. \n\nI wish, I wish they\u2019re going to make up if husband gets in touch with his family and it\u2019s so romantic to think that way. Reality sucks, though. It\u2019s up to the individual and that\u2019s husband\u2019s own journey to figure it out. And right now he doesn\u2019t want to.",
            "You should let him stay no contact. You have no idea how is life was before and it really belittles and disrespects his feelings",
            "My \"family\" did the same thing. Told my Mom someone was sick but I have already moved to NC. Not a single regret other than not getting their behavior on camera so people wouldn't think I was losing my mind for the first year or so. Trying to make him speak to them will only get him upset with you.",
            "It sound like them not approving of your marriage isn't the only reason he cut contact with them. He did say they were elitist, and this was all another mind game. It could be they have been manipulative and lied to him a lot in the past. Anyway, you can't make him contact them. If he feels bad about it after his Grandfather dies, he'll have to deal with that.",
            "Your husband knows his family and how they operate, and they haven\u2019t given any real reason to suspect they\u2019ve changed, including that there are now multiple family members harassing you, the one they cut him off over, in order to manipulate him. Your job as his wife is to respect his position on being in contact with them.",
            "1. Trust and respect your husband on this issue.  It's ok to encourage him if you think it's in his best effort but what you described sounds exactly like a scenario that often plays out in similar families.\n\n2. Ask him he'd be upset if his grandfather did pass away without him seeing him. Ask him if he'd be open to talking to him if none of the other family knew or were involved. Let those answers guide you.\n\n3. I cut off my mother. When she had terminal cancer she wanted desperately to see me.  I didn't see her and honestly I have absolutely zero regrets. My mother wasn't mean spirited but she was an addict. There were hard boundaries I drew. They weren't always fair but they were made to protect me. If I was stronger, more emotionally weathered, perhaps I could have bent more but I wasn't.... Those were the lines in the sand drawn based on where I was in my life. There was nothing to be done to change that. And so she died without seeing me but that was because of a lifetime of her choices. Yet still, it was the right decision.  So, back to #1, trust and respect while allowing for room for growth.",
            "You\u2019ve only seen one side of his family and the side you\u2019ve seen wasn\u2019t a good one. \n\nMy ex husband refused to believe me when I told him my family was abusive and horrible. He had to see it for himself. He let me cut contact but forced me to talk to them when something similar was happening in my family. A death. \n\nWhen you\u2019ve made up your mind to cut out toxic people it\u2019s done. My family has tried since many tactics to get me to talk. Only so that they can continue the control and the manipulation over me. I won\u2019t let them. I know myself. I\u2019ll get suckered in, miss them. They\u2019ll be nice. We will reminisce and then it\u2019s back to the abuse. \n\nYour husband cut them off for good reason. Trust me a lot of things look like pride but when it comes to shit like this that ain\u2019t pride. That\u2019s willpower and that shit can easily shatter. \n\nDon\u2019t force your husband like my ex did with me. It made me hate him and resent him. Because he just couldn\u2019t trust me. Trust my instincts. In his eyes I looked like a monster for not wanting to see my sick relative. He had a good relationship with his family. So he couldn\u2019t understand. You won\u2019t understand your husbands reasons. You just gotta trust him.",
            "I am in same situation, but in your husbands shoes. The best thing to do is support and respect your husbands decision. I guarantee his decision to cut them off isn't solely because they didn't support your engagement. It goes way deeper than that. To be honest if I found out my husband was talking to my sister behind my back and relaying messages to me I would be infuriated.",
            "When I first met my husband, he told me how uninterested he was in cultivating a relationship with his family. He didn\u2019t have a close relationship with them growing up, and didn\u2019t even tell any of them where he lived when he moved away from home. I come from a very close family, so this did not make sense to me. I\u2019ll be honest, I flat out didn\u2019t believe him.  So I pushed for a relationship with his family, and two years later things are worse than they been if I had just followed my husband\u2019s lead and not pushed for a relationship. \nIf your husband is not interested, there is a reason. He is deeply hurt. You have done your job and tried your best. I know you don\u2019t want him to regret it, but you also don\u2019t want this to cause more hurt for anyone. \nBest to leave this one up to him and follow his lead. \nGood luck.",
            "if he doesn't want to talk to HIS own family, whom he cut off because of YOU, i don't think you should advocate for them... he's a grown man, who knows what he went through with them? their attitude towards you was likely the last straw.\n\nsome families are awful and they're not entitled to demanding contact. stop being insensitive.",
            "i think you should trust your husband\u2019s judgement",
            "he clearly doesn\u2019t want to be in touch with them and doesn\u2019t care and just because an old man is going to die is not something that needs to change his mind about not wanting to be in touch with them at all. he doesn\u2019t want to talk to them, so stop responding to them and stop bothering him about this. mentioning once as you already did that they tried to contact about this was enough, that was the only information he needed and the only time he needed to be reminded. they were probably abusive and shitty and narcissistic for him for years/his entire life and it culminated in him finding a partner (you) and being able to move on completely from them and start his own family and he finally was able to cut them off and be completely done with them- and all of that has probably been hugely freeing to him- and he doesn\u2019t want to threaten any of that now that just because an old man is gonna die, who he\u2019s probably been expecting to die for a while now, and given that he knew when cutting that side of the family off that he would miss deaths and other things in people\u2019s lives, and he *still* decided he wanted to go no contact, then that should just be respected. he obviously put up with a lot of shit from them in his life and wants nothing to do with them, good for him, too many people allow themselves to continually be manipulated and let shitty family ruin their entire lives.\n\nalso why are you so convinced that he thinks they\u2019re \u201clying\u201d about all this when you\u2019ve shown him the proof that they\u2019re not lying? if you showed him proof and he\u2019s actually still denying it then he\u2019s straight up delusional and you have a bigger issue on your hands, but most likely if you showed proof then clearly he knows that the grandpa is actually dying and he\u2019s still choosing not to go see them.",
            "I take the other side from most comments here - you guys are both young, and your husband may have only a small window to speak with his grandfather and make peace with that relationship. The worst that happens if he is being duped by the family is that he has contact without a good reason for it - on the other hand, if his grandfather is dying, he will never be able to unmake the mistake of not contacting him. Reddit tends to advocate cutting out family, and other severe punishments for misbehavior. Sometimes it really is necessary. A lot of times a limited relationship can be built. Whenever possible, relationship with family is better than no relationship. It gives us context for who we are, it helps us grow into adulthood and leave the past behind, it helps us feel a sense of rootedness in the world and of our own history. Unless the family is consistently toxic and abusive, your husband is an adult, and can set the terms of the relationship to whatever level that suits him. \n\nThere isn't a lot you can do about his unwillingness, however. I think other comments have given you a good script for how to lay this out and then let the issue lie. Unfortunately, you can't protect him from himself. Just support him but also make it clear you think he may be making a serious error.\n\nI will say - and I imagine this may not go over here in this reddit community - a partner who is so willing to unilaterally sever all relationship with his own family, and completely unwilling to reconcile, would be a little concerning to me. What would *you* have to do to be cut off? Would he believe a word you said as you attempted to reconcile? What is his family supposed to do, if apologies and space and a sincere desire to repair the relationship is not enough? Setting boundaries is hard. But so is forgiveness, and being willing to understand that people are flawed but still worthy of second chances. Repair is a natural part of any close relationship.",
            "Tell your husband he's being a fking idiot. Holding onto something like that is dark.\nMen shouldn't be this way.",
            "Nomoffense but your husband sucks and is stubborn for no reason. They apologized, they admitted they were wrong. What more does he want?",
            "This will probably get buried, but I would try to convince your husband to get back into touch with his family. Regardless of the state of his relationship with his family, at the end of the day it's his grandfather, and he may pass whether your husband makes amends or not. He will never get another grandfather again. And the worst thing is sitting there one day and thinking that I wished I said goodbye to my grandfather before he passed. So I say to tell your husband to put his pride aside for what's important right now.",
            "Grandpas dying and he won\u2019t get over his stubbornness? He\u2019ll forever regret it",
            "He will live to regret this decision...mark my words.",
            "If he's willing to discuss it with you, I'd suggest that you ask him to tell you more about his feelings on the topic. \n\nHis family said terrible things about you, but they also showed that they didn't trust him to make good decisions. That is very hurtful. Oftentimes in elitist families like this, they tend to be very insular and treat each other well, while treating outsiders poorly. He was suddenly on the outside after years of being protected and loved.\n\nPerhaps the two of you can lay out some options. For example:\n\n* If grandpa is sick, visit him and only him.\n* If this is a trick, reissue no-contact and put a firm barrier that not even death will break NC.\n* For him to reunite with his family, it would take them doing X, Y, and Z.",

I\u2019m in a similar position with my family and it\u2019s further ruined any thin ties I had with my family all because they refuse to acknowledge my grandma\u2019s racist bullshit.

            "If his grandfather\u2019s health is the real reason, then his sister should have no problem telling you were grandpa is. Is he in a hospital? Hospice? Then your husband can choose to only visit grandpa. The family doesn\u2019t need to know when and they certainly don\u2019t need to be there either.

When my grandmother was towards the end the NC family member came to say his goodbye to her. Maybe ask if everyone could not be there so your husband can have his alone time with his grandfather and then he can do what he wants after that. Not saying goodbye to someone you love will hurt him for a long time and it\u2019s something that he would probably regret. I didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to someone else that I loved I still get upset about it almost 5 years later and still regret not being able to say I love you one last time in person.",

They may be lying, but he could be right too (or unwilling to admit aloud he literally does not care if they're being truthful). You've done it all, you need to respect his wishes now-- or even if you're right, circumventing his wishes and boundaries will end your relationship (I can tell from his past resolve regarding people who don't respect his choices).",
            "I'm sorry you're in this position, but it can't be forced and he's the one that will have to live with it when all is said and done. \n\nIf he's in the hospital, you could try to get a number for him to call there so he can have an unbiased confirmation on a number he can see is the hospitals, get in writing that he will have the room to himself and not be bombarded by family while he's there. He probably won't believe that they won't, but if he can get confirmation about his grandpa, that might not matter as much. \n\nI hope he comes to his senses before it's too late.",

            "Oh no, grandad can go ahead and die a bigot. Nothing of value will be lost.\n\nWe shouldn't make concessions to bigots because it violates their world view. \n\nI made my ex's family super pissed off at times.

It took me many years to realize that just because they are family does not mean I have to keep them in my life. \n\nThem trying to talk him out if marrying you was probably the straw that broke the camels back. You can tell him how you feel but don't push it. My mother pushes me all the time to talk to my grandparents and it puts a strain on our relationship because she can't seem to see how much they hurt me.

Regret is stronger than anything else at the end of ones life.  I\u2019ve had issues with my in laws and I wish we never did.  We successfully have my FIL back in our lives and they are no longer toxic.  We are trying to do the same with husbands brother but unfortunately they are too young and immature to recognize.

It was that I hadn't been communicating well about money.\n\nI approached her when all of the kids were asleep/busy/etc. It wasn't the type of discussion that I wanted to get interrupted. I, as directly as I could, told her about my concerns and worries about everything with money, her feeling afraid, what everything looked like from my side and apologized that I hadn't been direct enough in telling her.\n\nShe admitted that it did bother her that she didn't know how much I was making which left her blind as to what was okay/what wasn't. She also shared with me that when we were at a small get together for my family that a family member of mine (cousin, not parents or siblings) made a few snarky comments about how one of her friends was a SAHM and then her husband left her with nothing, got bitter about it, what does she do all day, yada yada. A bunch of bullshit. I guess she had also made a few comments about how a lot of men got their wife expensive gifts when they were cheating.\n\nThis cousin is nothing but a raging mess who can't keep a friend or a boyfriend around for more than 3 weeks at a time. So she can go fuck herself. I don't have a big connection to her anyway. So its not like it'll cause a bunch of drama for me to block her everywhere. So we did that.\n\nI offered to let her go through my computer/phone/etc. I didn't know what else to do there to prove that I'm not cheating. Keep in mind \\- she was NOT aggressively insisting it. She didn't really, actually, truly think I was cheating. The comments just made her insecure because she (her words) has baby weight to lose. My wife assured me that she didn't want to go through any of my stuff and that she trusts me. I'm still slightly fuming about any family causing drama, but thankfully I only have to see her once every few years.\n\nI figured (after I thought about it) that a serious family discussion didn't need to happen in a FA's office. At least not immediately. I did re\\-give her his number and she can go see him whenever she wants if she needs assurance or something else. We sat down and talked about my income each year, how much of that was going into what, and how much was left over for \"fun\" money. Guilt started bubbling and she felt bad which is when I did whip out the prices of nannies, cleaning ladies, etc. Thanks for that suggestion. My wife (as precious as she is) made me cut down the maids portion in half because we do still have someone come in sometimes. Either way \\- it was still a large amount.\n\nWe talked for a few hours and I asked her if she wanted to see the FA. So we have that scheduled to go there soon.\n\nIt was a long discussion that got interrupted despite our best efforts. I asked if she wanted to go therapy and she said yes. So she made me take off how much it would be to get someone to regularly come in each week off of the babysitting column of my \"this is how much money you save us\" list. So shes going to start therapy in 2 weeks.\n\nI love my wife. We talked for a long time about retirement, the kids future, money in general, how she felt about it, etc.\n\nSorry I don't have any super exciting news or drama to report. I just wanted to tell anyone (who was curious) how it went.\n\nI know we probably still have some communication issues to work through. Her making me cut down and edit the \"list of services\" shows me that she still does have some old issues surrounding money (which she did admit to). But as long as we're going forward we'll get there.\n\nP.S She did go and buy her regular non\\-cheap skincare stuff.\n\nTL;DR We had a really long talk about everything and how we would handle money going from then. A cousin had made her even more insecure that I was buying her nice things cause I was cheating (but she was already nervous before that). We talked about money and shes going to go therapy to work through issues rooting back to taking care of everyone else for years.\n\nEDIT: I can't reply to everyone, but thank you so much for your wonderful comments and messages. I hope you all find someone who makes you very happy :) ",

            "> Sorry I don\u2019t have any super exciting news or drama to report.\n\nDude, I believe I speak for most of us when I say that the best outcome for posts that appear in /r/relationships is that the involved parties sat down, talked to each other sincerely and found a new equilibrium they can live with. In other posts it\u2019s obviously not possible, but don\u2019t apologize for being able to deal with your issues like an adult person.",
            "This is such a good, heart warming update and it\u2019s truly touching to see how much you value, care, support and love your wife. You\u2019re lucky to have each other.",
            "I saw that you broke down the expenses of what she does around the house and what the income would be, and it sounds like that helped. But I wanted to add something else that I heard once and that has always stuck with me regarding relationships where one of the partners stays at home! \n\nSo, I think the stay at home spouse often feels that they are \u201cprivileged\u201d to be able to do this because not all couples can do this even if they wanted to unfortunately. And a lot of times we feel guilt for this. Or feel bad for the working spouse. But one thing that is easily forgotten is that not only is it a privilege for her to stay at home, but it is a privilege for you (the other spouse) as well!! This thought was eye opening to me! It is a privilege for both spouses to have this kind of arrangement. For example, it is a privilege that you always have someone to watch your children when is sick and needs to stay home from school. It is a privilege that you don\u2019t have to try to have your shift covered when a child is sent home from daycare or school sick. It is a privilege that you do not have to worry about your career in these circumstances and that is thanks to her! :) \n\nExplain to her that her staying home is a privilege. But not just for her, but for you too!! I hope that helps! And that it is okay for the both of you to enjoy this privilege! Neither of you need to feel guilty!",
            "I\u2019d also suggest checking her goals and if she wants to work (part time or full time). Especially if she grew up poor and has anxiety over money, it\u2019s hard to basically put yourself at the mercy of someone else. The cousin was right in that unfortunately many women are screwed over if they were SAHM\u2019s in the event of an affair or divorce. It\u2019s good that she doesn\u2019t have to worry about that with you, but for her own peace of mind it might be good to open the conversation about how she\u2019s feeling about all of that and start making a plan with her for getting back into a career or further education at some point. It may make her feel better to have a plan in place, even if it\u2019s for a few years down the road.",
            "This is great, but you also need to come up with an emergency plan for what she would need to do if something happened to you *right now*. Does she know where all your accounts are and how to access them (locations, passwords)? Would she be able to step in and start paying all the bills if you were suddenly unable to? Do you have a savings account set aside for emergencies that she could immediately access? If not, this needs to be remedied immediately. It's uncomfortable to think about the worst happening, but the alternative is her being unable to keep on top everything in the event of a catastrophe.",

I did re-give her his number and she can go see him whenever she wants if she needs assurance or something else. \n\nIn case no one has mentioned it, please make sure there's a term life insurance police out on your wife so in case (god forbid) anything happens to her, you'll have funds to pay someone to cover the work she does.   Also make sure there's life insurance and disability insurance on you.  \n\nGlad things are looking up for you guys :)  And please help encourage your wife to find a therapist that's a good fit.

It\u2019d make sense for her to not know what you\u2019re making if your income was so variable that not even you yourself knew how much you were making. But if you have a salaried job she should know. But anyway you already a few steps ahead of that and communicated very well so I\u2019m glad it\u2019s working out for ya. ",

And for your children, it\u2019s an awesome example to set for them. \n\nGo you two! Effective communication is a must for a robust marriage with children, especially because you are constantly interrupted and tired.  My hubby and I some days just acknowledge our communication has been crap, and just that can be enough to ease tension and kickstart a conversation. ",

I\u2019m sure there are great nannies out there and great number of people who turn out to be good humans even without the involvement of parents during growing up phase but I just can\u2019t have a stranger take care of my kids !! The reason my mother wanted to be a SAHM is because her own mother(though a good human) was a complete workaholic and my mother had to grow up with two brothers because of which she always missed a feminine touch in her life and she didn\u2019t want her daughter(my sister) to go through the same feeling but my sister being engrained by the feminist agenda doesn\u2019t really appreciate it that much. I\u2019m telling you this because there will always be some woman trying to belittle a SAHM  and you have to tell your wife not to pay attention to them because there are always people who will understand what a great thing it is to be a SAHM ( like me in my mother\u2019s case)!! \nHope that makes sense...",

Nobody likes to think about what happens when you\u2019re gone, but I would encourage you to set that up as soon as possible, so your kids can enjoy the benefits you had of a financially secure future. Don\u2019t forget to name backup guardians for your kids in case something happens to your first choice, and don\u2019t forget to name temporary guardians who live close to you in case your long term choice can\u2019t immediately be reached (so they never have to spend a night in a foster home).

I'm positioned in a different specific life configuration, but it is also a position of a class gap in a loving relationship and I am on the side your wife is on.  Struggles around how to handle that ... this is a space that has been and remains pretty difficult for me to really really comprehend. \n\nMoney is such a very visible and concrete usable resource in the systems we live in, you know? It is (or can be) so hard to shift perspective to even begin to understand that it isn't the only way to contribute value. And even when people in this system try to make this shift, it's usually in a shallow way toward things like doing housework to compensate. Which is important, but what I'm talking about, and what it seems to me you're referring to, goes much deeper than that.\n\nSo yeah, it's hard. Hard to see below that surface and even slightly begin to accept that there is some value beyond what is objectively visible and concretely usable in a very visible way.\n\nI can say this: I've been able to make some part of this shift, in a small way at least. And in doing so, I found a perspective that showed a pathway that we as a couple have taken in ways I never would have imagined/thought about.\n\nBut reading your posts, and writing this comment here, i have to acknowledge that this is still a big struggle for me. \n\n> I hope you all find someone who makes you very happy :) \n\nI have and these posts are very nourishing for me to read right now.

As someone whose parents had intermittent, untreated depression while I was growing up, I can't say enough about how much nicer and better it is for everyone when parents are happy, and that kind of gift to your family is something that can't be broken down into cost-saving measures. Add to that the fact that she'll have the time, flexibility, and mental energy to get further mental health help, and this is seriously an invaluable choice for her and you!",

        "selftext": "Tl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?\n\nMy boyfriend (36M) and I (33F) bought an older house four years ago near a town where we moved. We're from 2 different countries, and we're living in another one. When we have visitors, they have to stay a while because it takes a while and a bit of money to get here. \n\nI'm running into a recurring problem when we have older visitors coming, from both our families.\n\nThe house we bought is not perfect and needs some work, but it\u2019s perfectly liveable. We know we have some large expensive chuncks of renovation that will need to be done (new roof, better isolation) and we've been saving up for these. There are other problems that are small or more cosmetic that would cost some money to fix, but we chose to set these aside while saving up for the rest.\n\nMy issue is that when older visitors come (and it's only older people), they decide to go off and fix my house even when I ask them not to.\n\nExample 1: Boyfriend's parents come over for a visit. There was some ivy growing on a wall outside that would need a trim within a couple month. However, our ladder is broken, and my boyfriend knows he can get a ladder from his work in a couple weeks. My father in law decides he's going to trim the ivy, and I explain to him that we don't have a safe ladder to do so, and I'll get to it in a couple weeks. I leave him alone a few minutes to take a shower, and come back outside to find him having built a completely unsafe table to stand on to reach the top of the ivy (like, even less safe than he broken ladder) and trim it. I asked him five times to come down because I could see the structure wobbling and I was terrified he'd fall and get hurt. He ignored me, and when he eventually came down smiled and said \"see, nothing happened\". I was furious. I told him I was angry at him, and even that didn't get through to him.\n\nExample 2: My dad visits with my aunt and uncle. One of the small issues with the house is that the water pressure isn't great. I know the cause, and I know it will take a plumber to have it fixed - we need to replace some pipes that are placed in a way that we need a professional. It's actually not a big bother - just don't do the dishes at the same time someone takes a shower and no one even notices the problem. my dad and uncle decide that they want to fix it anyway. I tells them not to - and explain why I know it will take a professional. Same as with my FIL - I go do something else and before I know it, they've cut the main water to fix the pipes. I go tell them to stop and they don't. Short of me physically pushing them away, I try everything to stop them, no luck. Exactly as I had planned, though, the problem can only be fixed by a professional, and long story short, they mess things enough that we have to cut the water to the whole house until a plumber can be called. It's Sunday night, so I only got someone coming around the next morning. I had to dip into the structural changes savings fund to pay the plumber, and the long term issue with the pressure is still there - we still have to replace the pipes some day. Again, I was furious at my dad and uncle, and they didn't even apologize.\n\nExample 3: my mom is over this week. She was making food in a very nice iron pan we have that we have been seasoning for over a year. This means the bottom of the pan is blackened. If this was a teflon pan, it would be a sign it's unusable, but for an iron pan, it means it's just right. I told that to my mom multiple times, but would not believe me and tried to scrub off the seasoning behind my back, causing small specks to go in the food. Again, these are not dangerous, but we do need to redo the seasoning on the pan now. She nearly destroyed the pan and would not believe me until I made her read the manufacturer's website. \n\nI am a very conflict-avoiding person. It's already taking a lot of going against my nature to stand up to all these people and say \"no, don't do that\", but I do it every time. I'm sure there's an element of sexism here (this only happens when my boyfriend isn't home). I want to figure out how to make myself more assertive, and for all these people to just listen to me in my own home. I'm tried of getting steamrolled, and I am coming to dread those visits.\n\nTl;dr Visitors to my home keep ignoring my specific instructions to not do things, is this just how older people visiting are, or how can I be more assertive?",

            "I think this is bad enough that you can stop letting them stay with you. This isn't like \"they keep forgetting to take their shoes off,\" or \"they put the dishes away wrong\" - your dad and your uncle did serious structural damage to your house! Your boyfriend's father could have seriously injured himself on your property! Your mom's thing didn't risk life and limb, but it's still really frustrating!\n\nIf you don't feel like you can turn them away, then I think you need to have A Talk with your relatives, preferably at a time when they're not at your house, and there are no visits scheduled in the immediate future (also, your boyfriend should be in on this too!). The plumbing incident is a good excuse - it was expensive, and sometimes people who won't listen to, \"this hurts me,\" *will* listen to, \"this costs me money.\" \n\nThat said, it's worth remembering that the only people who are seeing this as a pattern are you and your boyfriend - when your mom determinedly scrubs the seasoning off your pan, she's not thinking of herself as the latest person to ignore you and damage something in your home, she's thinking, \"Oh, I'll helpfully fix this thing (that isn't broken).\" \n\nThat does **not** mean you have to let it keep happening! But it means that when you talk to each of them, you have to *explain* that there's a pattern - I think you can use the plumbing thing as a jumping-off point, to say something like, \"it made us realize that we've been giving in on things that are actually causing problems for us, and if you can't commit to respecting our wishes in our own home, then you can't stay with us.\"",

What's the worst they can do - refuse to stay with you again?\n\nWarn people that if they don't follow your rules then in future they will have to stay in a hotel and follow through.\n\nAlso, stop giving them reasons for why the tasks haven't been completed yet. It just gives them an opportunity to think your reason isn't valid and undermine it. Just say \"that is being taken care of. I don't need your help with it and don't touch it.\"",
            "Stop inviting them over. If they ask to come, decline.\n\nWhen they ask why you stopped inviting them over. Tell them in plain and clear English that it's because they are incapable of following your very simple instructions about not doing shit you told them not to.\n\nWhen they get pissy about that, and say \"why's this such a big deal, who cares? You're making something out of nothing\", turn that around on them. \"If it's not a big deal then why were you so insistent on ignoring my requests?\"\n\nI don't invite my mom into my place anymore.

            "My husband and I have parents and family in their 60's and 70's and they absolutely do these sorts of things. I am in no way saying their behavior is okay, just that you're not alone and it does seem to have a generational component. \n\nOne of the incidents I am still the most angry about was when my dad was visiting me in an apartment I rented while at school and decided to repair my kitchen drawer while I was in class...using a $300 chef knife I received as a gift to cut the wood. I could have been in big trouble with the landlord, had a very nice possession ruined, and I had told him not to touch it. But he couldn't stand it because the drawer squeaked when it opened. \n\nI have a name for when people do this now. I call it \"violating my sovereignty\". Just because someone is older, thinks they know better, or is your parent doesn't give them the right to disrespect your wishes and put anyone or your property in danger. Especially in your own home. \n\nI used to not know how to react to these instances so I would complain to the violator, but it was like they didn't hear me/didn't care. I would often not even get an apology and nothing would change. Now I waste no time and mince no words telling them they have messed up, why it's unacceptable and lay out immediate consequences (such as paying for damages and necessary repairs) and making it clear they are not welcome to stay in, visit, or come to my home unless they respect my husband's and my wishes.

It is definitely not all old people who would do this. I wouldnt.

            "I'm going to disagree with what most people are saying. I don't think they're disrespecting you. I think there are multiple factors here: 1) They want to help (not because you're incapable, but because they've spent their whole lives supporting you and they want to continue). 2) They want to pay you back for hosting them. 3) They're bored.\n\nThe solution to all of those things is to redirect them into something more helpful, but they all reach that point in different ways:\n\n1. Realise it's normal that they want to help. They're traveling to another country to visit their children's new home, and they see all this stuff that they could fix for you! Of course they want to do it for you. They're your parents! They want to help no matter what you say to them. So, you should stop telling them to do NOTHING. If they're there, in your house, and wanting to help ... give them something they can do. When they wanted to pull down the ivy, a better response would've been \"Oh, yeah, we're going to do that later because of the ladder. If you're wanting to do some gardening, we could use some help clearing out this space so we can turn it into vegetable garden.\"\n2. Let them know how much you appreciate them visiting. A lot of people (especially older people) feel like when they visit somewhere, they should gift the hosts something. Your family seems to want to gift you through their time and effort helping out around the house, and if you reject that outright it's a rejection of them. I think a better approach is, again, to redirect them into things that are actually helpful, or to say something like \"You've already done enough! Come and sit down!\" (But keep in mind they may ignore that because of number 1)\n3. Also, they might just be bored. Visiting you is surely wonderful, but sitting around doing nothing when they've spent 20+ years running their own households must be difficult for them. Again, think of some things they can do. Visitors need to be entertained when you're hosting them (less so if they're family, but if you don't want them wandering around finding their own things to do, you still need to give them something). If you don't want them trying to \"help\", plan a board game night, or a trip to a tourist attraction, or a shopping trip... Make sure they have something else they can be doing instead. If they're used to working all the time, they might not like sitting around doing nothing, so getting them out of the house will be key. If they're at home they will likely have their own ideas about how they should be using their time (e.g. \"helping\"). You can probably also give them some general chores (vacuuming, etc) they can do to help out while they're at home if they're the type that need to be kept busy at all times.\n\nOverall, I think you should stop seeing your family as being invasive or rude when they try to help you. They're frustrating and they don't listen properly but they seem to want to help you, so you should channel that and see their visits as an opportunity to have some extra help to get things done. That way they'll stop doing things that you DON'T need.\n\nGood luck OP :)",

When visit with their friends they always trade chores like my mom will help her friend with a big weeding job or my dad will help with fixing a fence or whatever. It's just a thing they like to do.  It's a way of sharing the load as they know homeownership can be a big task. They're very much the DIY types and will only hire professionals for jobs way out of their range. The way they went about \"helping\" you was certainly  disrespectful but I think its born of this don't be idle/pay your way mentality.\n\nWhile I definitely  agree you need to find a way to be more assertive than you have been and set firm boundaries, I think there's a way you could both win. Before they come, think of some doable chores/tasks about the house you want to get done. So once they start meddling you can redirect them to the tasks you actually know they can handle/won't cause you upset if they go wrong.

They were grooming you to spend your entire adult life being the caregiver for not one but two products of your dad's affairs. Even if they were your full siblings simply being born un-handicapped does not mean you have to sacrifice your life. They clearly spelled out that this was just the tip of the iceberg regarding what they planned on pawning off on you. I have great sympathy for the disabled, but you have made the best decision.",

No one is doing Ariel any favors by babying her, and even if you were full sisters, you have no obligation to be her caretaker (I say this as someone with a disabled sibling). I think it was perfect that you provided contact information for the college's disability services to your dad, because that is what they are there for! I'm sorry you have to deal with manipulative family.

If you felt differently about the half sister then this would probably be a completely different story, but I'm happy that you managed to dodge the bullet. \n\nAlso as an added bonus, since they seem to be cutting contact with you then hopefully there is minimal chance that you'll have to drive her around and help her out should she still end up attending your university.

Claudette and Ariel are both narcissistic assholes, they see you as the only thing blocking them from what they want. When in fact they could just do it themselves.

However, I've never been in your situation before.\n\nHonestly it baffles me that your parents have this perspective. Plenty of people in wheelchairs live normal lives. In fact this one guy who works at my local hardware store is in a wheelchair, and whenever I come in he plays with my dog and does the heavy lifting for me -- so when I'm there he's showing more physical capability than I do. \n\nCouldn't your half sister, you know, adapt to a normal lifestyle rather than feel sorry for herself because she can't walk? She'd be a lot happier and successful if she did, and if your parents stopped feeling so sorry for her. It's really pathetic how they're acting. IMO she should get a job, like everybody else, use that to get her own place or find roommates, and use her disability check to hire people to help her when she needs. She could have a part time assistant who comes a few hours a day (like my brother has). Even still, unless her health problems are much worse than just being in a wheelchair, she probably doesn't even need that. \n\nI dunno. What a shitty situation. It sucks they're putting on you, but what sucks even more is that your family is basically ruining her life by feeling sorry for her and treating her like a helpless baby. ",

            "So, I'm disabled and although my problem is purely visual, I have know people in the past who have trouble walking.  First off, it is not your responsibility to care for your step-sister.  In our state, people with disabilities that need an aid to go to college are provided that aid by the government and I'm pretty sure there are at least similar services in other states if it isn't a federal regulation.  It's a very taxing job and would require a lot from a person, which is why people train to become aids.  Arielle doesn't need to live with you if she wants to live on her own and I'm pretty sure if they would call the disability center at the school, they would give them all the right information.  Honestly, I think Arielle's trapped and doesn't know how to get out of a bad situation she might be having with Claudette.  For one thing, Claudette sounds like she's trying to guilt trip you into doing a job that she should be finding another person to do.  She seems very manipulative, so do your best to avoid her.  As for Arielle, try to reach out to her and see if she wants to go to the disability services.  She sounds a bit desperate and inmature so if she really starts pushing the issue of living with you, tell her the truth and then let her know that it isn't a possibility.  If it gets pushed further, stop talking with her.  \n\nA lot of people I know who have disabilities are kind of immature in the way that they do not know how to take care of some basic life skills.  Parents and teachers feel bad and maybe don't directly do things to hurt their feelings, but do tend to do a lot of things for them in order to \"help\".  Don't be her aid, but do realize that she might need some help getting to her feet and may need a bit of extra support getting there because she's been dealing with a few extra obstacles in her life and it doesn't sound like her mom is going about it the right way.  I wish the best of luck to you.",

I'm not saying you're wrong or that you *need* to be nice, or that it's something you have to do, and I get that taking care of your sister would suck and you shouldn't have to do it. But I can understand their response. Idk, I'm sure my family dynamic is much different than yours, but deity the fact that we don't get along, what keeps us together is empathy.\n\nIdk man. It seems to me like you're both being a little childish. They're not right, but no need to freeze people out for reaching out to you for help. I'm inclined to think that their immature and selfish reactions might be brought on by the fact that they don't have many ways to turn to give Ariel a normal life. Again you don't owe them your help, but I think you could at least try to understand, which I'm assuming is where your dad is coming from.",

            "To be fair,  as much as I understand Aries yearning for independence... She didn't go about it the right way and should not have expected op to accept with open arms. That said it's not nice to say the parents can't \"dump Ariel\"  on someone.  She didn't choose to be disabled,  but her attitude is something she has control of.",

Not many people have the balls to stand up to family when there is so much history and emotion attached.\n\nThe fact is, if your sister wasn't handicapped it sounds like you still would definitely not want to live with her. If she wants to be treated normally, then she and her mom should realize that sometimes people just aren't too fond of you, and don't want to be a helper to you, regardless of your abled/disabled status.

Ended up sending me to the ER and she was arrested. She is concerned about what I need to do to correct her predicament when she was the one that threw the blows.\n\nToday was one of the pretrial court hearings. She was upset all night last night, saying it was my fault that she was in this situation of a felony for assaulting me and that her stress was all of my fault. She scoffed at the deal that the state was offering saying it was a death sentence for her career and our marriage. It was my understanding that a NC order would be in place while classes are being completed but would be lifted after. She was under the impression that it would last through her probation.\n\nThe night prior she was upset that I was doing research on marriage counseling, saying I was thinking we were to far gone even when we talked about finding a counselor a few days before. Late nights/early morning she gets more paranoid as her medication wears off(effexor) and I try to bear her verbal assaults trying to calm her down. Having a feeling a split was imminent I packed my clothes and belongings from the place she was staying at during her NC order period while she was finishing up at court. When she got out we had another argument about what she said I needed to do to fix her situation, saying I need to spend more money on two apartments so she isn't stuck with her friend.\n\nTo put her jealousy into perspective, she was uncomfortable with me having the default female google assistant that she demanded I change it to a male voice. Also she says I have wandering eyes, accusing me of checking out any woman that is anywhere and constantly questioning me if I am cheating on her. She has no respect for the privacy of my phone and searches through it, deleting so past evidence of her jealousy (breaking my glasses) and refuses me to search through her own phone trying to point out the onesidedness of her actions.\n\nWhen I called her out on her jealousy of the default google voice she demanded that I leave, that I had no respect for her friends house and that I had no place to argue there. After I decided to put out feelers for a divorce attorney and have started organizing my notes/evidence of her financial, physical, and emotional abuse over the course of our marriage.\n\nI have a therapist I have been seeing about some of this going on and have another appointment tomorrow.\n\nIt's depressing that someone that I love would say/do things to hurt me just because of a paranoia or unhealthy jealousy. I've tried getting her the mental health help that she needs but she refuses to take the steps and initiative after getting her the information. My mom recommended me going no contact after my talking with her today and after she mentioned that my wife called her the other day, ranting about me and my faults as a husband.\n\nI have no friends locally and I feel like with the internet that the anonymity and the disconnect with personal relationship provides a cathartic relief for my situation.\n\nTLDR: Called abusive wife out on unhealthy jealousy and she told me to leave and I left.\n\nedit:  Thank you everyone for your support.  It means a lot to me since I generally feel unnoticed or cared about by anyone.",

When she started beating me again I tried dialing 911 but wasn't able to get through due to an automated prompt and her trying to strangle me in a headlock. When I got out of it she followed me to the hallway. Yelled some more and took my wedding band she had earlier and flushed it down the toilet.

She's not paranoid, or jealous.  She's abusive.  She hurts you because she wants to and is allowed to.  The only way she will ever stop hurting you is if you leave.",

            "So reading this, it seems as though you feel like you have an obligation to fix the marriage because you have done something to deserve the way you are being treated. You haven't.\n\nYour cannot fix your marriage, unfortunately and that is because you cannot fix your wife. Nor is it your responsibility to her. It's her responsibility to work on herself and take accountability for her actions.\n\nThis isn't about you and things you have done. This isn't normal behavior. Your wife has a very deep insecurity that manifests as abuse and you are the unfortunate recipient of that abuse.\n\nI know it's hard and you feel alone and it must be so scary to have to think about leaving the anchor of your life. But rather than being an anchor of stability, your wife is an anchor that is weighing you down. You will likely find it so much easier to make friends and begin to have a social life if you are able to break free because you won't have to explain yourself or face the firing squad every time you have a conversation with someone.\n\nYou don't have to endure this. You don't have to keep working at it. You're not failing if you leave. You are saving yourself.",
            "In alle honesty, if she is afraid of (pardon me) a fucking voice on your device, she has serious problems (which you probably already knew). Also, I'm not in your situation, but if my boyfriend started touching me in a bad way (hitting or anything of the sort), it would be over IMMEDIATELY. You don't deserve to be treated like this.",
            "sounds like she is undermedicated or incorrectly diagnosed.  i take Effexor for anxiety/ depression, works very well but there is no \"wearing off\" period between doses.  I'm fine unless I miss a day or two and I get physical withdrawal symptoms before my emotional state breaks down.   \n\nThat being said, you are not obligated to stay with someone because they have a mental illness.  If her emotional state is unstable and she refuses to get help or even admit that it's a problem for herself and the people she considers important than it's not your burden to bear.   I had a mental breakdown in the early 2000's and I was a total ass to everyone around me.  I lost more than a few friends. Fucked up a good job situation.  Maybe having you leave is what will be the trigger for her to get help.  Or not.   In any case, it's not up to you to make sure she is well. \n\nAnd it's not hard to make local friends.   When you are free from the stress of the relationship you will feel like you have the freedom to make plans with other people.",

Our brains cannot withstand this level of continuous abuse. Trauma can affect how you think, your memory, your decision making, it can give you physical and mental illnesses. \n\nAre there people who you can talk to outside of your therapist? Even distant family?  Is there a church group or a community organization you can reach out to?\n\nYou can start there. They can help with connecting you to supports available around you .",

No, no, no.  \n\nYou shouldn't be doing *any* of those things with her at this point. Your wife is no longer a lover, a friend, a family member. She is one thing and one thing only to you now: the counterparty in a contract negotiation. She is the opposing party in the negotiation to end your marriage contract and define the terms of your divorce contract. *That is all she should be to you at this point.* There should be no living with her, talking to her, trying to understand her, nothing. The only communication that you should be having with her is through lawyers to finalize your divorce. That is it. Talk to your friends and family about all the feelings.

            "Son, you need to build up your identity.\n\nIf you set healthy boundaries with anyone from the get go, things generally won't decay to this point. I speak from experience. Both the negative kind and the positive kind.\n\nTo keep yourself amused while you go through this divorce, when ever you think you want her back, instead sit down and make a list of the qualities of your ideal marriage. What does \"ideal partnership\" and \"healthy relationship\" mean to you? You need to figure all this out.\n\nNow, getting it on paper isn't really going to help you. You have to put it into practice. That means setting healthy boundaries based on your definition of healthy. I screwed this up so many times ... man ... I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed and I was so immature and over protected. It took a long time for me to realize when the relationship is getting out of balance, leaving that healthy middle ground that needs to exist between two people.\n\nBut I did learn through a string of \"HOLY CRAP\" relationships.\n\nSometimes when you give up the balance, the other won't let you have it back. Even if you push them back to the healthy middle, even if they agree it is healthier they still won't stay there. They need to keep pushing boundaries because they define being allowed to trample you as being loved by you. You have to walk away from those relationships.\n\nEventually you'll get strong enough within yourself to resist the button pressing that gets you into those situations and you'll be able to push back to middle ground whether or not your partner agrees. Then she will either run away, or begin to face her own demons.\n\nWhen you find the one that was attracted to your weakness, but loves your strength and desire for healthy wholeness, then you'll find a partner you can work with to create a healthy loving relationship.\n\nI managed it.\n\nOne last comment: trusting someone does not imply that you trust they won't abuse your boundaries. It means trusting them to listen, care, and respect your desires. People who define being trampled as proof of love must be corrected by the father in you. The trick is to do it without reaction and with compassion. If you can muster real love, then you are the master.\n\nI hope this rambling helps a little. Sorry I can't be more concise.

Run far away, and run fast.\n\nThe ONLY hope if she has BPD is DBT (dialectic behavioral therapy).  DBT usually takes 2 to 3 years with sessions for her at least twice a week.

I understand your hurt but you can only help people if they want help and you seem to have tried all that you could to fix the relationship but she appears to have more going on than you can handle. Physical abuse is a direct sign the relationship is over, take it from someone who has been physically abused in a relationship with someone they thought they could trust.

I have been in an abusive relationship and can resonate with a lot of what you're going through, and the way you tried to stick it out and make it work. \n\nI'm really glad that you are safe and seeking help. I feel separation is the beginning of a long process where your eyes are opened to the abuse. You begin to see the situation objectively, without the bias of love for your partner getting in the way. I am so sorry it is so hard and isolating right now, but day by day, week by week, month by month it will be come increasingly clear to you that you made the right decision when you walked away. \n\nAbuse is terrible and it takes a toll on you. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I am truly sorry if anyone has dismissed you because of your gender. I hope that if that happens, you realize those people are fucking idiots. What you went through was traumatic and you do not owe an ear to anyone who belittles it. \n\nReading through your posts, you really strike me as a grounded, reasonable, and articulate person. You strike me as kind, as well. Basically all the things your spouse could not be. That gives me faith that you'll get through this and much better things and relationships lie ahead for you. You have a great head on your shoulders and for what it's worth coming from a stranger on the internet, I am proud of you. \n\nWish you all the best and hope you find comfort and peace in the following days.",

            "I'm afraid she is very ill, but like many in states of psychosis, she believes that everyone around her is out to get her, and you being closest are bearing the brunt of that. It may be that her arrest forces her to get treatment - have you suggested that she should be subject to psychiatric evaluation? I'm assuming that these changes are recent, since surely you didn't marry her knowing that she was quite this delusional? Is it possible that she could have something else going on like a brain tumour? Sometimes physical issues are overlooked when there are longstanding mental health issues.",

            "This type of situation hits close to me when I was young with my first girlfriend. She had a lot of relationship worries, but she was especially paranoid about other girls. She had few friends and insisted we spend all of our time together. She explained how she didn't like me hanging out with girls alone, and I would think fair enough, and so I would stop. That soon evolved into her not wanting me to talk to other girls, and eventually how me being with my closest friends made her jealous. It was my first relationship and I was lovestruck, so I went along with it. Every compromise I made was in her favour, and I was slowly isolated from my friends and my family while her social circle grew.\n\nThere is a theory out there about how people who are the most adamantly against something are the most likely to do that thing. Well things all came together when I discovered that she had been cheating on me. A lot.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is that while I was in the situation I did not see the many, very apparent flags. It was crushing when I learned about what she had done, and it was very difficult to leave her, but I now fear to think of the type of person I would have become if I allowed her to pull me under with her. It is hard, but read what you have wrote and try to look at it from an outside perspective. What advice would you give me? What about your closest friend, or a son?\n\nPlease don't sacrifice yourself, your independence, your safety, your future, and the things that make you you for this woman. That's really all I've got for you. Good luck.",

            "Not to victim blame or anything, but didn\u2019t you notice any of this shit before you married her? Like while you were dating or while you were engaged? Which I assume was at least a couple years ago...? You say you\u2019ve only been married a few months. There\u2019s no way this JUST started happening now. \n\nAnyone who is jealous of the Google assistant\u2019s robotic female voice is not stable enough to be in any kind of relationship. Never mind the fact that she threatened to send nude pics to some guy and doesn\u2019t let you look through her phone. Sounds to me like she could be projecting her own cheating onto you, in addition to be mentally unbalanced. \n\nShe told you to leave. I would suggest you do so.",
            "She definitely needs to get further psychiatric help. I know everyone is different but Effexor was awful for me. I felt physically and mentally awful and unlike myself all the time. That is no excuse for the way she has been acting though, obviously. I think you are doing everything right given these horrendous circumstances. Good luck to you.",

            "\"...relief for my situation\"\nDon't betray your wife just because she obviously is either mentally unstable, has been mistreated or cheated on in the past or you really DO check out women all the time and either aren't admitting it or you don't realize you're doing it. Guys do it all the time & it's extremely disrespectful & humiliating to the woman they are with. \n\nLet me ask you, Who would want to put themselves through what she puts herself through for no reason? Why would she make up allegations like this? How would she benefit from this? Where's the logic behind all this? \n\n I feel we're only hearing one side of this story. You mention online activities that suggest you're willing to betray your wife as if that's an acceptable solution. It's not. Your married, you should get divorced immediately if you don't take your vows seriously. The fact you even mentioned that at all and as your only solution has lead me to suspect your wife's problem is not due to irrational thoughts but due to reality. No one unless they were insane, would attack someone for no reason. You oughtta stop checking out other females or get divorced rather than causing your wife more trouble and hurt.\n\nAnd what's with your \"woe is me, nobody loves me, I'm a victim\" comment at the end. You come across as manipulative and wanting to be pitied. \n\nI don't like it. My guess is you're hoping we all take your side & criticize your wife so you can show it to her and day \"see? It's not me, it's you\"\n\nI don't see you denying her claims anywhere in your post. Your comment about online cheating basically says something about your character. \nPerhaps you oughtta be single.",
