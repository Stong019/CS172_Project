I had taken a few pictures from my sister that night and emailed them those pictures as well. They were pissed off and angry at him and my mom for not standing up for us. They told me to stay upstairs and don't apologise and they will come over on Sunday morning. So we did that. My mom came to talk to us again on Saturday evening, insisted that we can go apologise and we can all forget that it happened, but we kept refusing until she gave up. Later that night my mom came back up to talk to me again and wanted me to end this \"rebellion\" as she put it, saying that it won't lead to anything good and it just makes things worse. I told her that I'm just protecting sister. She said \"it's my job not yours\". I said \"clearly you're not doing it well enough so I'm gonna have to do it\". She gave up again. \n\nSo grandparents came over on Sunday morning. Mom and step father were home as well. We were upstairs and couldn't hear what they were saying but I could hear that my grandparents were very angry. I don't know what happened but after a while my mom came up and asked us to come down. We went down and Stap-father apologised to my sister and said it won't happen again and that he will make it up to us. My grandfather told me to let him know ASAP if something like this happened again.\n\nAfter they left my mom looked very angry at me but didn't say anything.\n\nP.S. I didn't call the police in the end. I was afraid to make the situation worse and make a much larger mess. I though involving grandparents is enough and they know better whether to call the police or not.\n   \n**tl;dr**: I called grandparnets. They came over and talked to them. Step father apologised after that and said it won't happen again.",

            "Good job but I do warn, please be careful. It sounds like your step-father may have been just saying that to get the grandparents gone. I'm glad you are protecting your sister, though. You keep doing the right thing. ",

            "Sounds like you handled this perfectly and quite professionally.\n\nIn the UK it is (currently and a controversial matter) legal for people with parental responsibility to smack (I don't think a slap falls into this category), but step parents don't have parental responsibility unless it's been granted by a court.",
            "I'm proud of you, but please be careful from here.\n\nAlso, you and your grandparents rock!",
            "You made the right call, OP, and thank goodness your grandparents have your back!  You're very lucky to have them!\n\nIt seems like your stepfather's behavior has been escalating for the past 6 months (from grumpiness to yelling and then to physical violence) but now he knows that you and your sister aren't afraid to stand up for yourselves and that you have other family members in your corner who aren't going to tolerate his mistreatment of you.\n\nIt's just a shame your mother isn't willing to protect you.",
            "This was an excellent solution for him doing this once.\n\nLets see how you do if it happens again. Make a backup plan with your sister NOW.",
            "Your sister will always remember this.  She is really lucky to have someone who would protect her.  For those of us who didn't have someone to protect us even in this stalwart way, your story makes me feel that there is real justice in the world.",
            "KEEP THOSE PICTURES. And make a log of everything that happened with dates and times. Then hide it. Preferably off the premises. Any time this happens, photograph and log everything, so there's a trail of any abuse. And keep your grandparents in the loop. Good for you for standing up for your sister. ",
            "Thank god for family who actually has your best interests at heart. Nice job grandparents! You're a great brother and handled this perfectly. Its a relief to know someone is looking out for you if this ever happens again.",
            "After the first time my step-father hit me, I warned him- \"do it again, and I'll put a claw hammer into your skull as you sleep.\"  and that was that.\n\nI also called my mom out for being a selfish turd who couldn't properly finish the most important job of her life- raising her kids.  I'm sorry you have one of those moms too.\n\nStay close to that Grandfather- you're gonna need him.",
            "You're a really brave and wonderful brother. You and your sister handled this very well, and your refusal to accept this kind of treatment will serve you well in life. \n\nAnd - YAY for grandparents! ",

            "Good on you for getting your grandparents involved, and good to take photographic evidence. Now you need to make a safe backup of that data somewhere your stepdad can't access it.\n\nWhat worries me though is your mother defending him so vehemently. Is there any signs that he's been abusing your mother at all? This is something I would be concerned about especially if she was upset that you went and got help. \n\nShe either doesn't give a shit, or is also being abused by this man. You are going to have to be *very* careful form this point on though. Retaliation could still happen. If he slapped your sister once, what's going to stop him from doing it again, or taking it out on you or your mother instead? ",
            "Justice boner.  Grand dad HANDLED that shit.",

            "OP, talk to your sister.  You both should plan to take your mom out on a date.  Explain yourselves.  \n\nLet her know that you both are feeling increasingly unsafe with your stepfather's increasing anger.  Ask your mom if he is being abusive towards her.\n\nDon't judge her, but tell her that you love her.  But your safety is important.  I'd suggest apologizing to her for the situation, but not your actions - as they were a response to his actions.\n\nThen, go do something silly and fun together. \n\n",
            "I'm hoping it's an isolated incident, but domestic abuse is usually part of a pattern. Have a backup plan in case it happens again. It might be a good idea to ask your grandparents if they would let you guys live with them if it does.",
            "I bet anything that right now, your sister looks at you like you're 10 feet tall.\n\n> I though involving grandparents is enough and they know better whether to call the police or not.\n\nThis sentence in particular struck me as being wise and mature. Remarkably clear headed for being in such an emotionally charged situation.\n\nYou stood tall and did the right thing. Your character was put to the test, and you passed. Continue to be the awesome big brother that your sister no doubt deserves.\n\nAlso, when things have calmed down, talk with your grandparents and let them know how appreciative you and your sister are of their support. They deserve to hear that.",
            "As far as calling the cops, check your state laws - in many states, an open-handed slap across the face is considered an acceptable method of disciplining your child (or step children) and not considered child abuse, much like spanking.\n\nFurthermore, calling the cops could easily produce far more fallout than you realize - There would be a police investigation, possibly even an extensive and surely expensive medical examination to ensure there was no injury as a result of the strike, then there would be an investigation by whatever your state's child welfare agency is, which with an allegation of child abuse could even potentially result in you and your sister being temporarily removed from the home.\n\nI'm not saying that what he did was or was not abusive, but if it left no marks or bruises, it was likely not *legally* considered such.",
            "Anyone else feel that the mom is being abused as well?\n\nOr maybe being threatned with divorce or something?\n\nDefinitely seems strange that she is such a willing accomplice ",
            "Well thank goodness your grandparents are rational adults who care about you. Excellent course of action, OP.",
            "Wow... As a girl that grew up with older brothers that beat the shit out of me and parents that were negligent in stopping it, I have a ton of admiration for you. It was kind of healing for me to read your story, you are a good brother. ",
            "Glad there was some resolution. But it's clear that your mom would rather side with your step dad than her own children.",
            "Not many people have asked this question, but let me try again, is your mother safe?  Has her behavior changed in the last 6 months along with your stepfather?  Has she seemed to be walking on egg shells when he's around, trying to keep things as low key as possible?  Will she do anything in her power (including asking you and your sister to apologize to someone who laid hands on her) to keep him calm?  If so, she is being abused in one form or another, and *she needs help!*  If this is true, by asking you to make amends with that bastard, she *IS* trying to protect you and your sister.\n\nHowever, on the flip side of the coin, if she is at the same anger level of your stepfather, or shows no remorse in what happened, then it's time to think about exit strategies.  \n\nIt's my assumption that she is getting some type of abuse because she's trying to keep things from getting worse.  Try and keep your ear to the ground and see if she is getting it too, and try and get her the help she needs.\n\nGood luck, OP.",
            "You are awesome older brother. \n\nThat said, have a word with your step father  and mom when the emotions cool down. Tell them very respectfully not to do it again. That he need not make up for anything. Just to be more thoughtful when he is angry at her. She might be wrong but hitting her is not a proper solution. Use non escalating language.\n\nRepair the relationship a bit so as to make it easy living together when you eventually move out. Their ego might be hurt, so just placate it a bit but do not compromise on the safety of your sister.",
            "You're a good big brother, your sister is very lucky to have you. \n\nShame about your mother and step father, but i guess we have to do the best with the hand we are dealt.",

Let them know if they don't hear from you in some way for more than a couple of days that they need to be very, very worried and that it means you need help immediately.  Can you set up a daily time to check in with them just to let them know things are okay?  ",
            "Awesome everything turned out better than it should have.\n\nStill kind of surprised that your mom was still looking angry or pissed after getting talked to by your grandparents. You'd think that an outside perspective, family related or not, would make her see that she's defending the wrong cause here.",

            "Way to go. I still haven't forgiven my mom from taking her boyfriends side all the time when I was younger. I wish I would have done the same thing you did. If it ever happens again, call the cops. You'll be regretting it later in life if you don't. ",
            "OP - so glad things turned out okay. Please make sure, if and when you move out, to constantly check on your sister to make sure this doesn't escalate after you're no longer in the house to buffer these situations.\n\nCongratulations on being such a stand-up human being. I don't know if its weird for a stranger to be proud of you, but I am. ",
            "As someone who was abused by a stepfather and saw my step-sister abused as well, you handled this fantastically.  My mother also did not stand up for me. \n\nKeep standing up for what you know is right and protect your blood.  ",
            "Having been in a similar situation, I can say you did the right thing. \n\nYour mother and stepfather MUST know that you will defend your sister, however you are able. \n\nOtherwise, it could all too easily become a normal occurrence. \n\nShame on your mother for not immediately stepping in and defending you and your sister. She owes you just as much an apology as your step father does. \n\nThere's a very big difference between discipline and striking in anger. Your stepfather crossed the line",

            "Good job standing your ground. Don't let your mother manipulate you. Women in abusive relationships will sometimes do anything to defend their partner. Co-dependency is an ugly mental illness and it turns people selfish. She will do anything to protect herself from experiencing a failed relationship even if that means ruining the one she has with you. ",

My relatives knew some of what went on, but not everything, and he got away with his behavior.  By standing up to your mother and your stepfather and speaking up, you hopefully nipped this abusive stuff in the bud.  However, I fully expect that he will try something like this again.  Do not hesitate to go to your grandparents.  They've proven to be trustworthy with your best interests in mind and will follow through on their promises to intercede when necessary.

You did the absolute right things by not giving into your mom's request for an apology.\n\nLike others, I do wanna warn you that your step-dad might have been just saying it to appease your grandparents. My step-father did the same thing many times and didn't stop until I ran away. Be careful of that and absolutely call the police, as well as your grandparents, next time. Do not worry about making the situation worse, do it for your own/your sister's safety if necessary. ",
            "OP you handled that situation really well, but now you and your sister need to smooth everything over. Maybe wait a day or two, or do it when you get free time, but you need to talk with your step father. You said for the past 5 years he has been fine and left everything concerning you guys to your mother, but these past 6 months he's been tense and a little angry. I'm not excusing him whatsoever, but if you love your mother (because she clearly loves him) you need to smooth things over and from the looks of it he probably won't do it himself, so you're gonna have to \"man up\" and do it yourself. Sit down with him, just you and him, and ask him what's wrong. Let him know this isn't just about the slap, but you noticed he was acting different these past couple months and you wanted to know whats wrong. You don't have to apologize, just show or atleast feign some concern, because maybe he is going through some rough shit and took it out in a terrible way.\n\nAfter your talk with your step father, you and your sister need to take your mother out on a date. Explain to her why you guys did what you did, but don't do it in a confrontational way. Then try and ask from where she was coming from. Let her get her side of the story, even if you don't care, but let her get it off her chest. She is still your mother, she still loves you guys very much, and you guys still love her very much. You guys can't just sit on your hands and let this all fester, you guys are family.  \n\nAlso make sure to update your gran parents every time there is an update to the situation, better or worse. They are wonderful people and love you guys very much. They would love to hear a positive outcome come out of this just as much as you guys, and if the worst case scenario happens, they still have your backs. ",

Granted, that's no excuse to do what he did, and it's especially curious how uncharacteristic it was of him to mettle in your family quarrels and how he has never hit either of you before...\n\nThere is something definitely going on there. Maybe they are having marital problems? Do they argue often? Maybe it has something to do with his job, his health, or his finances? Maybe you should try talking to your mom and see what's up. You're 16 and your old enough to want to know and to want to ask if there is something wrong that is affecting your mom and could affect you and your sister.\n\nDon't file the police report.

It's possible she mouthed a swear word at step-dad and only he witnessed it. In some cases a smack to the mouth from a parent I don't believe would be uncalled for. I don't hit or generally even spank my children. Not to say they've never gotten their butt spanked because they have but it's rare. Anyway your grand parents happened to not be present and I think it's totally possible you may have missed something that happened. It's certainly possible you didn't miss anything either. I am a firm believer tho that parents should be able to raise their children without people nosing in. Of course there are plenty of abusive situations where outside help should step in and needs to. One smack to the mouth to a teenage girl I don't believe falls into that category. You both could be far worse off and you should probably be thankful a man who is not your father has chosen to raise and support you. As for your grand parents I totally feel it's a good thing they love and care so much for you but I also believe this situation being a first and only type event should be literally none of their business. They have raised their children and now it's your parents job to raise you, not your grand parents. I really and truly feel family affairs are for families to handle with the privacy anyone should expect and deserve in their own home. ",

Your sister was yelling at your mom and step dad and not accepting no as an answer, and being disrespectful.  Meanwhile, your mom and step-dad are dealing with stresses that you are likely barely aware of.  Keeping your life and home together and paid for, raising kids who grow into successful and respectful adults, protecting them from harms you, in your youthfulness, blow off as nothing to worry about.\n\nAs a parent, as someone who makes a very good living, my life is almost pure stress.  You have no idea the pressure of raising children and keeping it all together.  The *resentment* you can feel toward your children when they so easily escalate to yelling and insulting you over the stupidest shit that they think is so damn important.  The resentment over how self-centered and selfish they are, and how very infrequently they bother to think about *helping* the whole situation rather than just getting out of it everything they can.\n\nSo, yeah, go finish the job by you and your sister apologizing for your part, for escalating to yelling over being told no.

            "So, sister is a brat and disrespected mom. Step dad (obviously nothing more than a walking talking ATB at this point) steps in to support his wife (who took her on along with her ungrateful kids) and gets turned on by ungrateful kid #1. Then ungrateful kid #2 involves the grandparents and obvious threatening takes place. \n\n This is exactly why a man should avoid single mothers. No matter what he can't maintain order in his own home when mom drops the ball. This is everything I see that went wrong...\n\n1. Step dad blew his cool. He should have simply sent the girl out of the room or told the wife to deal with her daughter elsewhere. There's no reason he should have to flee any room in his own house. Furthermore, he's either under unknown stresses that kids aren't aware of and all they know is he's acting different. Alternately, they are being more disrespectful and he's under stress in his own home knowing he's powerless to affect it.  \n\n2. Mother should have taken the kid elsewhere to deal with the situation. \n\n3. Kid should have shut her mouth and been respectful towards her mother and step dad. \n\n4. Step dad didn't send the wife and kids packing to the grandparents. Nobody should walk into another man's castle to lay down the law. I know I wouldn't allow it. The way it should have been handled is the grandparents show up to invite the wife and her kids to leave the situation. That's the extent of their involvement in this blended family situation. ",
            "I really hope you have a back-up plan with grandparents because its starting to sound like your mother is comfortable in an emotional (and possibly physical) abusive relationship, regardless if you have \"seen it\" for yourself. Based on the words she used towards you and how she handled the situation from your perspective, such words as, \"rebellion\", \"forget that it happened\", \"it won't lead to anything good\", \"it just makes things worse\" (and possibly meaning worse for her) and, looking angry but not expressing her personal opinion. I really hope this is a one-off instance, but be prepared to move out, she has already chosen him over the both of you. Let me dispense this, some abusive relationship can take years to form before the first hit, they happen very gradually. He does need counselling to handle his anger, it may be work related it may be not, either way he is NOT handling his OWN emotions and seems to be taking it out on others. If he does not seek help now, it is more likely to occur again. ",

My husband told me not to worry about it and he would look after him. Once we were done at the doctor I went to go visit my sister for a little bit with my daughter. \n\nBoth our children are perfectly healthy, my daughter just had this cough that kept getting worse so I took her to the doctor. She's getting better now. But last night I got a E-Mail from a woman yesterday evening. I had just put the kids to bed and I was working. \n\nThe title read \"Concern over your son\" It caught my eye, because I was thinking who is this and why is she talking about my kid. This woman Ember [fake name] claimed to know my husband. Not only that she claimed to be sleeping with my husband and that they were in love. \n\nShe messaged me to tell me that she was over at my house last week. The day I took my daughter to the doctor, she even mentioned this in the Email. She told me my son was wondering around while my husband and I quote \"fucked my brains out in your bed\" She told me to take my son with me when I go out so they can have some privacy. The things I wanted to do to her when I read it, hell would reserve a special section just for me. \n\nI was furious and I asked my husband who was watching TV who is Ember. The look on his face said it all, you could just tell his heart sank and he was shitting himself. He was stuttering, and was telling me she's nobody. A long argument later he told me to \"go fuck myself and left\"\n\nHe called me and left a voice mail on our home phone told me he was leaving me and he hated being a father. He told me to keep the kids and keep his shit. He sent this again as a text for some reason.\n\nI don't know what to do next, I am still in shock, I'm angry, I need some guidance.

            "So, reading between the lines:\n\n* Your husband wasn't planning on leaving you anytime soon (or ever) as evidenced by his shock at your discovery of his affair, as well as his impromptu exit from the marriage (keep all my shit and the kids, plus fuck you). He's chosen the nuclear option - to blow up everything, even his family. While it's certainly possibly that he hates you and hates the kids, and that he's willing to forfeit everything he owns to get out, I suspect it's more about his inability to face you. It's possible that in a few months or a few years, when he calms down a bit, he's going to change his mind. He's going to want his belongings, or want contact, and you should be prepared for that. Talk it over with your lawyer.\n\n* Ember very likely surmised that telling you about their affair and providing some proof (your kid was sick) would result in your leaving him. She nailed it. That bitch did you a huge favor for all the wrong reasons.\n\n* I can't even imagine the pain of having your marriage (and possibly your husband's relationship with your children) destroyed in a single night and in such a brutal and cruel way (at the very least, you'd like to see remorse from your spouse), but you should be really proud of yourself that you are self-sufficient, that you are already thinking strategically, that you have family support to help you, that you can survive this. \n\n",

Make sure you have at least twp copies of emails text messages voicemails etc. Lawyer up and get a good one!! \n\nI'm not a psychiatrist but what you described about your husbands behaviour is identical to my husband's behaviour and he is diagnosed with a personality disorder (was court ordered).\nThis is not gonna help you if you have no court ordered evaluation done but it's helpful if your attorney asks for it and it's getting done. \n\nIf you are lucky he don't want anything to do with the kids because lots of ex like to just screw with the single parents mind through the kids. He already said he hates being a father.\n\nThe first steps are the hardest. I recommend you to not back down in anything you want for your kids and get everything you can from him. Your attorney should be your \"best friend\" in legal advice. Get an aggressive one who fights to the teeth for you. If you work good money he might even try to get money from you...ask attorney about it.\n\nDepending on your state you get a fast divorce if adultery is a reason.\n\nGet more support in a facebook group but use a fake account and make sure your husband has no passwords for your internet sites and email accounts and also bank accounts.\nTip...check his social media sites and collect evidence if he writes compromising stuff.\n\nLots of women advise to empty bank account before he does. Some leave half...honestly ask your attorney about it. But be fast. Most men will protect money right away (even if its shared they take it).\n\nThere's much more but I'm sure lots here will give you good advice also\n\n\nEdit...i forgot the most important tip...go to court and file for emergency temporary custody!!! Like yesterday!! That will ensure that he can't take your kids and hold them hostage because without this court order he has the same right to have the kids like you and no police no court will help you to get the kids back and technically whoever filed and got granted the temporary custody can keep the kids until the custody is settled through court which will take months!!! Whoever has the kids until then can basically do whatever he/she wants and not let the kids see the other parent until then.\nI know a few mothers that had a baby kidnapped by the father even they nursed and the baby didn't know the mother when they finally saw them again.

She has mental issues. Absolutely horrible what is going on with you OP. Incredible how people could put on such a front to others but be miserable on the inside.

I work 4AM-8PM Monday through Friday. I get paid for driving, so the 2 hour commute to and from work is included in those hours, not on top of them. I don\u2019t work for any school - my company is a contractor with many different schools. It is illegal to make employees work so many hours where I live, but most of the people who work here either don\u2019t care because the money is so good or they quit early on. I don\u2019t want to say what I do specifically because from there it would be easy to find out what company I work for which I imagine could get me in legal trouble.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to call my doctor yesterday because I was afraid to leave work and because I didn\u2019t want my coworkers or anyone at the school to hear what was going on. However, I ended up doing so because I noticed there was a teacher with my last name (which is also my dad\u2019s, and is quite rare unlike the girlfriend\u2019s common name) and I panicked a little. I excused myself to the bathroom and called my doctor, who advised me to come in, and then I told me coworkers I had to leave because of a medical emergency.\n\nI was not medicated before, but I have now started a new medication which will hopefully work. I have some mental exercises that I used the one other time I have had a really bad delusion like this (I thought my house was infested with fleas but they were really just on the dog) and they\u2019re helping to ground me. I think I am afraid of my dad trying to get back into my life (he does this every so often) which is why I jumped straight to thinking it was his ex stalking me, and my doctor agrees.\n\nI also have put in my two weeks notice at work. I have enough money to get by for the next few months if I can\u2019t get another job right away, and this job is destroying me physically and mentally.\n\nI did also buy a CO detector but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I also live with my fianc\u00e9 who is not having similar symptoms.\n\nThank you to everyone who replied to the original post. I\u2019m sorry I worried you.\n\ntl;dr I\u2019m not being stalked, I\u2019m just crazy ",

Maybe you and them can develop a checklist to help you understand when you\u2019re having an episode, vs. when the paranoia is legit - because you have a bad relationship with your father and his girlfriend, it\u2019s good to not dismiss your worries completely, but learn to adjust them to realistic levels, and your therapist can help you with this. Can you confide in your boyfriend when you\u2019re getting worried too, so he can help serve as a \u201csanity check\u201d (if you like the fun language like that) or a \u201csmell test\u201d (if you want to avoid using possibly stigmatizing language)?

            "Don\u2019t think of yourself as crazy. I went through a very difficult time a few years ago and someone told me this analogy, and it help a lot.\n\nImagine you broke your leg. Depending on the severity you may just need a cast for six weeks, or you may require multiple surgeries to set the bones and reconstruct the joints. Your brain is no different. If your broken leg never received treatment you will be disabled and in pain for the rest of your life. If you do get it treated but the treatment was not adequate, such a cast for six weeks instead of reconstructive surgery and years of physio therapy, you will continue to suffer. The longer the broken leg is left without the proper treatment, the worse the long term damage will be, sometimes to the point of being irreversible. Some people are born with congenital issues and it\u2019s essentially the same idea.\n\nNow use that same theory but instead of your leg, it\u2019s your brain. Either through the trauma you suffered, the way you were born, or a combination of both, your brain is injured and it needs time, patience, and a lot of hard work to make it well. You may never be \u201cnormal\u201d but you can be happy and enjoy life. \n\nIt\u2019s an extremely difficult thing to come to terms with having a mental illness.

        "selftext": "I'm kind of a moron sometimes when it comes to being aware of my wife's sensitivities. But I love her so much, and she loves me, so it's seriously bothering me that I screwed up. She is the best wife a man could ask for. We've been married for 4 years. She gave birth to our second child a few months ago. As you would expect we've been quite emotionally attached to one another during her pregnancy and after she gave me our second son, but when I offended her a week ago she has sulked and ignored me as much as possible.\n\nI rush home from work like I have been doing, eager to see my wife and our sons, but now she says \"you're dinner's on the table\" and she leaves me alone to eat while playing with our son and holding the baby. We've always had a ritual that has been extremely important to me: I get home from work and we make out for about 5 minutes, act all lovey-dovey, then we eat together with the boy(s). It's been devastating for her to abruptly change like this.\n\nSo here's the stupid thing I did. When we married she was very skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot). Since having the first child she has steadily gained weight and become a little plump. Her body definitely has changed and she's not looking skinny and petite. But she's still just as beautiful and this has never been something I've seen in a negative light. But this was apparently devastating to her self-esteem, to an extent that I wouldn't have imagined. I've always told her when we're intimate or she's getting changed near me that she's so beautiful. In fact as she's gained some weight I've said it more and I can sometimes barely keep my hands off her when we're alone and she's changing or something. Yet she's always responded to this by saying \"she's gotten so fat\", \"I'm hideous\", \"I'm sure not what you signed up for am I\", and all that crap. One night I said the wrong thing (though I didn't know it would be when I said it): I kissed her thighs and said \"your curves have gotten so amazing\" and she just flipped out and started crying, saying \"so now you're just acknowledging how fat I've gotten out loud\" and she's been seeming sulky ever since.\n\nWhen I told her that she's not \"fat\", that she's just as beautiful as before and actually more so, she just gets more upset. How do I fix this stupid mistake I made? I love my wife more than anything, and she's never gotten this upset or sulky before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl;dr My wife has gained some weight since having our 2 kids. I didn't realize how serious it was to her, and I commented about how \"sexy her curves have gotten\". She flipped out, cried, said that now I'm finally telling her \"how fat she's gotten while giving me 2 sons\". My life revolves around my wife, our daily affectionate rituals are gone, and she sulks a lot. I don't know how to fix it and make it up to her when she's so hurt and upset over this.**",

            "This is definitely a self esteem issue. You can't say or do anything to fix it because she is telling herself she is fat. All you did was say something that she was able to use to justify her self hate. You can tell her until you are blue in the face that she is beautiful and desirable, but if she doesn't believe it, she won't hear you. It could actually be a little bit of post partum depression. Have a real sit down chat with her. Ask her to sit down with you and discuss her body issues with you and tell her it concerns you that she is so hard on herself. If she exercised a lot before, she may have always had this complex and being pregnant took that control away from her. Counseling may be in order here. ",
            "Agree with everyone on how OP's wife might be depressed on how she looks and she might have a little post partum depression.  \nHowever, I disagree with the comments that OP should talk about he is \"okay\" with how she looks now, because that's admitting she is fat, as she thinks she is..  \nThe most non-invasive way to help this out is OP should help to his wife to recover to the person she was, and let her have a little time to breathe. Suggestions below:\n\n* Volunteer to take over some of the chores that Wife is currently doing, so she will have an hour free for herself.\n* Offer to look after the kids and the house on OP's off day so that Wife can take some time-off to hang out with her friends.\n* It might be a while since she pampered herself to a holiday, maybe take her on a short trip, or pay for a short trip she can go on her own.\n* Get some one to help with the kids and take Wife out on a date night, buy gifts and flowers for her, and pretend that you are dating again\n\nWith lots of love and attention hopefully Wife will return to her normal self again :) Try not to mention about her weight again.  \n",

            "Postpartum is a hard enough stage as it is for a new mother to go through, let alone a mom with TWO young kids, particularly one who (it sounds like, based on your description) gets no break from being mommy and wife to just be herself for an hour without anyone touching her or depending on her or needing affection from her.\n\nHer body has changed a TON in hundreds of little tiny ways within less than 5 years, ways that she\u2019s likely been aware of with a laser focus. This world is hell for women when it comes to our bodies, and a woman who\u2019s just average sized - but still *skinny* - and not even plus-sized will sometimes be treated as \u201cfat\u201d, just for not being a waif.\n\nIt sounds like she places a lot of value on her body being tiny and thin, and like she worked a lot to keep it that way - until kids came along, and what energy and time she had for exercising/dieting had to be given up for mom duties. \n\nSit down with her and tell her you\u2019re so sorry for hurting her with your carelessness.... but you\u2019re worried by her reaction and the way she talks about herself and her body. Tell her you love her, that you\u2019re there for her in any and every way. \n\nAsk her not what to do to fix this, but *how* she\u2019s feeling, what\u2019s she feeling, and then genuinely *listen*. Don\u2019t try to interrupt her and tell her how beautiful and sexy she is if she says that she thinks she\u2019s ugly and fat, and don\u2019t try to give her solutions for any of these issues. Sit, listen, and ask about how she feels when you want a makeout session the second you get home, or what the best parts of her day were along with the worst. \n\nTo be able to help her, you need to be able to understand everything that\u2019s affecting her, inside and out; and to do that, you need to be able to listen and take in all that she says without thinking about how her struggle with herself and her body affects you.",
            "I don\u2019t think the comment you made is terrible, but seeing how you described her as petite/skinny before her pregnancies could have a toll on her. Her body is changing in ways she may not like. Instead of saying \u201cno you\u2019re not fat\u201d I would just apologize for the comment you made and tell her you understand how that could have hurt her feelings. I would sit down with her and if she\u2019s comfortable, ask her to share her insecurities with you if she hasn\u2019t already and what you can do as a partner to help her. If she is deeply insecure, she is ultimately the only person who can fix those issues but as partner you can be supportive in ways like avoiding making comments about her curves or like encouraging and exhibiting healthy habits like exercise and a balanced diet. Many women\u2019s body change during pregnancies and there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about, but she may just have a hard time dealing with it since she is used to seeing herself as petite. ",
            "It could be post partum depression. The mental and physical changes to become a mom are drastic and takes sometime to adjust to. She maybe feels like she's lost her identity because the changes have been drastic. Have you asked her if she feels overwhelmed? Perhaps, she's displacing her frustrations into something she can actually control (i.e. her weight).\n\nYou mentioned she used to exercise before having kids. Does she still have time to exercise without having to worry about the kids? Getting her back into a workout routine could help her boost her mood and give her self confidence she needs to move past this. Or maybe, if yall have time after dinner, go on a walk with the kids as a family. If she's at home all day and you have the funds. \n\nOnce that happens, she may be more interested in being affectionate since she won't feel so cruddy about herself.\n\nIn situations when she is sulking, avoid making comments on her appearance, even if you're calling her beautiful. Non-appearance comments could be like, 'wow, you did a lot today with the kids, would you like a backrub?' or 'dinner smelled so good when I walked in the door, can't wait to sit-down and  hear about your day'.  Hopefully comments like this will lift her spirits without bringing up her weight.",
            "Is it possible she has post partum depression?  If so, she needs some help.  Being a stay at home mom is tough. Having two kids is even tougher. Best of luck. ",
            "I'm sure there is lots of good advice here about therapy, which would be good. But be aware that if you suggest that she may scoff and say she doesn't have time for therapy, since she doesn't have time for even things like going to the loo, getting a glass of water, having a shower, or fixing something healthy to eat. She may not have time to think, certainly not think very sensibly, as she may have been sleep deprived for years - since your first child was born. She may need more support with stuff than she is asking for so address that too.\n\nSource: have a baby and a 3 year old. Brain not work good much now. ",
            "I think it would be good to post this on a parenting subreddit. Not sure how many people giving advice have had their bodies change via pregnancy. I'm a mom of 2. My body changed a lot from pregnancy! Even as my weight gets closer to my original weight my shape is just different. I had a hard time with my new body at first, I thought it was hideous. (Granted, I never liked my body prior to pregnancy, anyway.) Things that are helping are 1) better fitting clothes (this is so hard to acquire as a new mom.. kid free time is needed to shop) 2) getting into better shape/working out/eating better 3) looking at other postpartum bodies (real ones, not celebs!) and realizing that many of them change 4) time. And the last one is actually that I have 2 daughters. I try to compliment how strong and capable and helpful they are, never mentioning \"pretty\" \"beautiful\", etc. I think about what I want them to value in themselves (looks is never it) and I try to provide an environment to facilitate that. Interestingly, this has helped me become less obsessed about my appearance. I'm brainwashing myself to value capability and kindness more than looks. \n\nSo, what can you do? Facilitate her having free time to go shopping (if she wants), to workout (if she wants), and to do some kid-free stuff (cuz breaks are lovely). Work on the compliments that you give to your kids and wife, include a lot of compliments that are *not* about appearance. Focus on how you appreciate the love and care she gives and how she's playful with the kids and how much you enjoy being together as a family. Make sure she knows that she's brilliant and funny and enjoyable (or whatever wonderful non-appearance based traits you appreciate). And do the same for your kids! Compliment effort! Talk about how great it is that they can do amazing things. Avoid talk of \"pretty!\" (Also don't say \"you're so smart\" to kids, a whole nother issue;)). \n\nGood luck! You sound like a super supportive spouse!!",
            ">it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot)\n\nSo skinny/petite *wasn't* her natural body type. It was something she put a lot of work into maintaining and was very important for her self image and self esteem. She probably feels not just monstrous, but invisible, and completely gone as a woman.\n\nShe needs a therapist. But also, are you able to make time for her in the day to go to a gym? Or is her life just looking after the babies? ",
            "\"skinny/petite, it was just her natural body type (and she exercised a lot)\"\n\nThat doesn't sound like it's her natural body type, then? Are you giving her time and space and support to be able to go to the gym? Without even delving into post-partum depression and exercise as a means of weight loss, exercise is essential for a lot of peoples' mental health and well-being.",
            "OP, you said something that was loving to you, but to her it was an acknowledgment of her worst horror: that she's no longer slim and thus feels like a monster. You love how she looks, but to her, not being slim means her world has crashed.  Having been there, all I can say is be patient.  She *isn't* as slim as she once was, but she cannot yet accept that that is perfectly alright, and you still find her desirable. All you can do is avoid saying anything that reflects her curves or body change, unless she directly asks if she has changed. \n\nA long time ago, my husband and I were watching a movie with Jennifer Lopez in it. When he smiled and commented that my butt was exactly like hers, I broke.   He was sure it was a compliment (and to him it was.) To me, it was the equivalent of saying the truth I \"knew\" all along and that was drilled in my head by my family: \"If you are not skinny and have curves, you are a filthy, disgusting monster who should not go out in public and you're worthless.\"\n\nI wept. He waited then finally said he was complimenting me and I realized if I wanted to change my physique I had to change my lifestyle (which I did).  Just be patient and let her cool off.  You sound like a kind and loving person and she sounds like a woman who has been terrorized about her physique.  ",
            "She's just had a baby. She's probably exhausted, and may well have a bit of postpartum depression as well. I felt awful a few months after giving birth, I felt like my body wasn't my own any more, I lost all sense of myself, my own identity. I had trouble finding any time for self care and just felt gross and fat and awful. The worst my self esteem had been for a long long time. Add to that the stress of looking after two at once, it's incredibly hard. \nYou have done nothing wrong by saying you liked her curves and you can't fix her self esteem with the right words. What you can do is support the hell out of her right now. Is there anything more you could be doing to help her out practically? Are you able to help her with the kids more so she can get a little bit of 'me time'? If she could get regular breaks and something just for her, little treats, even something as simple as a nice long bath on her own may help a lot. \nOn top of that just keep telling her you love her, she's a fantastic mum, point out specific things you appreciate, like 'oh thank you for cooking tonight, I know it's so hard with both kids, I really appreciate it' etc. If you point out specific things she'll know you have noticed. Sympathise and empathise with her situation. \nWith the right support her self esteem will recover. When you're feeling low you think horrible things about yourself (like I'm so fat) and then everything you hear from others gets filtered through that, so you say 'I love your curves' and she just hears corroboration of the mean things her inner voice are telling her. It'll take time to build her back up again. ",
            "As a husband, I've found dealing with my wife's body issues difficult too. I think our culture is terrible when it comes to setting unrealistic expectations for beauty. On one hand, I don't ever want to be dishonest with my wife. On the other hand, I don't ever want to say things that would hurt my wife's feelings.\n\nMy wife would constantly ask the question, \"Am I fat?\". And let me tell you, my wife is absolutely beautiful. Is she rail thin? No. Is she fat? No. But when I respond to that question with a \"No.\" she doesn't believe me because she believes she's fat. So I started responding with, \"I am never going to speak negatively about your body. When you ask me if you are fat, you are already putting a negative spin on the conversation, and that's not fair to me. I find you incredibly attractive. If you want to talk about weight goals, that's fine and positive, but I'm not going to engage in conversation that leads to devaluing your self image.\" And that's cut a lot of that out and turned the conversations to more positive and productive results.\n\nIf you tell her \"We need to talk.\" And reformat the above to something that sounds natural for you, you can likely turn this period of discomfort into something supportive and positive, because that's what both of you need.  She needs to be supported by her husband, and you need to be positively reinforced when speaking about your attraction to your wife.\n\nBest wishes.",
            "Is really scary for us women to see our body changing during pregnancy and after pregnancy, there's a baby inside you, your hormones go crazy, you gain weight, your boobs change, your body hurts, some women can't leave the bed or do normal activities while pregnant and they can get depressed because of the hormonal changes etc specially if they already had some problem with their body before pregnancy. The pressure women feel from society about their bodies is insane so it would be good if you didn't make any comment about her body, just tell her she is pretty and you love her that's enough , don't be specific because if you say \" I love how big your tights gotten \" she will think \" Was I not enough when I was skinny ? Is he calling me fat ? \"\n\nI remember I was 10 years old and feeling like i was not pretty enough and that I had to do something about my clothes and hair , meanwhile my 10 year old cousin was eating grass and worrying about cartoons. Is common for many girls to feel insecure unfortunately , an research showed that girls have a decrease in confidence around this age while boys only experience this later on at 14 . At the age 13 me and my friends were getting into crazy diets because of models on TV and unrealistic people on magazines, we didn't knew photoshop existed. I ate only tomatoes for one month lmao I fainted once and that's when I understood  that if i wanted to get the body i wanted i had to learn, compromise and be truly healthy not just skinny. ( I was always skinny but that's just how other people can affect the way you see yourself). \n\n I wrote my experience here just so you can understand a bit about how most girls feel about their bodies and how hard it is when compared to most males. (ofc everyone has insecurities but men don't go through pregnancy and there's not much expectations). If she wants to workout again and get in shape try to give her free time , she might be too busy with the baby so that's a possibility to why she is stressed and insecure for not being able to workout again . If she is unhappy about her body she needs to do something to change it , talk to her and tell that you will help her if she is feeling sad and insecure but that she is perfect no matter what .",
            "Hi pregnant with my 4th child (3rd in less than 5 years) and this could be something my husband posted. I wasn't skinny when we got married, more average, but have definitely seen a change in my body were losing 80 lbs I still will never look the same from a stretched out stomach. It messes with your head. Add on to post partum depression and anxiety(for me, there isn't enough info here to see if your wife has it) and my self esteem is zero even though my husband loves to compliment my body. In fact he's told me how much he loves my curvier butt and larger breasts and my only thought when he does? \"ok but I hate it.\" with therapy over gotten better since I developed an eating disorder between my second and third, but it's me. I know it's in my head and I try not to project on my husband when he tries to compliment me. But it's hard. I want to hear \"you look the same as when we got married\" because in my head that's where I looked the best. It's also a lie and will always be a lie in terms of certain body parts. It's like losing your hair for men over a course of a few months. I might like bald men, doesn't mean my husband likes it or misses how he used to look. Sit her down and express how hot and sexy you think she looks now but stress that if she isn't happy you'll help make her happy with anything she needs. Such as going out to the gym, or just getting her nails done. Date nights if you don't have them regularly need to start. Sometimes when you're home non stop with ugly clothes and no need to look better you give up on yourself. She needs to start focusing on herself and hopefully it helps her. Tell her you miss making out, that it was special, and that her body is the first thing you want to touch when you get home. Good luck! ",
            "It sounds like she is really struggling with how she views herself after having babies and them now being her focus instead of her body.  \n\nLook her in the eye and tell her she is the most beautiful woman in the world.

These issues were there before and are probably why she kept herself very slim and worked out a lot.\n\nYou can\u2019t fix this sadly, she has to do it. She will need lots of support and positive reinforcement but it really is something only she can fix. She may well need help to do it, as well. She may even have body dysmorphia.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to advise you here, clearly you need to talk to her, and hopefully restore physical contact and I think you need to go carefully, but I also think it would be worth educating yourself about poor body image in women and the huge psychological impact it can have, so you can support her more effectively and maybe help her to see how she regards her body isn\u2019t actually realistic.\n\nIf you have daughters it\u2019s essential this is dealt with because otherwise she will teach them to feel the same way - not deliberately, but because children pick everything up, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware.\n\nSorry I can\u2019t be more help.",

I\u2019m not sure how long ago she had your second child, but it takes about 6-12 months  after having a child for a woman\u2019s hormones to balance out. \n\nThat, mixed with the changes her body has gone through, can be devastating on a woman. Especially since you never had to endure any of that. Men don\u2019t have to deal with the hormonal or weight changes and get to carry on before and after a child is born like nothing ever happened (aside from the obvious changes a child brings into your life, which I\u2019m not downplaying). \n\nGive it time, she\u2019ll come around. In the meantime, continue to be supportive. ",

Your comment wasn't inappropriate or insulting. \n\nI get it- I am pregnant with my second child currently and it is really easy to get down on yourself when it comes to your body and comparing it to \"pre-baby life\". If your wife's day is focused 24/7 on your kids, she probably feels like she has no time to dedicate to herself or her self care. See if there is ways that you can take over for an hour or two so she can do whatever she wants for herself- be that working out, getting her nails done, or just sitting in a room on the peace and quiet. And people- going grocery shopping is NOT \"me time\". \n\nWhen she is able to dedicate time to herself and her self care, she might feel better. But keep loving her and complementing her, that will never hurt. ",
            "So, you would use (your version of a compliment) on her body, she would react negatively to show you she didn't find this comolimentary I.e. \"I'm hideous\" or \"I've gotten fat\" and be clearly put off by the comment, and then you moved it forward to a more intimate and sexy moment where there's more vulnerability and said it again, and are surprised by her reaction? \n\nWhat is a compliment to one person, isn't necessarily a compliment to everyone. Its important to watch our partners feelings and reactions and learn what is and isn't their jam. She sent clear messages before this that comments about her body made her insecure or reflect negatively on herself. Ideally then one would recognize that and not try again and again. \n\nI say this not to be cruel right now but maybe to provide some clarity on what happened and an opportunity for it to not happen again in the future.\n\nMy husband has a rule where he simply does not comment on my body. He also doesn't counter me if I am feeling negative about my body by expressing what he thinks and feels of my body because he doesn't want to negate my experience and my feelings. Instead he sticks to non specific blanket statements like \"you're so fucking sexy\" or \"you turn me on\" or \"you're looking great today!\" (<that one is to fully clothed me) and I see his admiration in just *how* he looks at me. All of those things have helped a TON. \n\nif I were you I'd apologize for not taking note that my compliments were triggering, remind her I really thought k was saying nice things, and reassure her I find her brilliantly sexy but don't want to negate how she feels about her body, and then just hold her. Hopefully then she can open up about what does work for her or what she needs from you at this point.",
            "I think there's two dimensions to this: 1) your wife assuming you think she's fat and less attractive (in spite of evidence to the contrary) and 2) your wife ***feeling fat an unattractive*** herself. Everyone, including your wife, is focusing on what you said and how your wife might feel insecure abiut your attraction to her now that her body has changed. I agree that you didn't do anything wrong, here (actually, as a woman whose body changed drastically after kids, I thought it was quite sweet.) However, her *own* feelings about her body are also important, and seem to be more likely what's driving her, here. \n\nIn terms of what you do next, I think you need to address both 1 and 2 with her. Once the kids are in bed and you have a chance to talk uninterrupted, I would suggest that you sit her down and have a seriosus talk. Tell her that you can see that she's struggling and you want to help. That your comment was meant to be an honest compliment - you love the way her body has changed and you're turned on by her new curves. Ask her to trust you enough to believe that you're telling her the truth, here, rather than doubting everything you say. Then ask her how she feels about her body - it's awesome that you find her sexier than ever, but if she doesn't feel sexy, that's a problem. If she expresses a desire to be thinner, ask her what she thinks is a reasonable goal, and a reasonable plan for achieving it. Ask what you can do to help  \n\nI would, as others have suggested, also suggest that she see a therapist or counselor to rule out any more serious mental health issues, and to have a place to talk about how she is feeling about herself. Suggest it, but also make clear what you can do to help make it happen - taking the kids on a special outing so she has time to go, etc.",
            "I don't think you did anything wrong. Actually, your wife is stressed and/or uncomfortable with having gained weight, which is understandable, and you triggered it inadvertently by trying to compliment her. Perhaps don't mention her weight gain at all, because it is clearly something she is having a hard time adjusting to after having children.\n\nThis is an unrelated question to OP's problem, but why are we so concerned with not calling someone \"fat?\" Isn't it just an adjective to describe a body size? In fact, these days people don't react well to being called too skinny either, since it is associated with lack of feminine curves. Yet we still perceive being called skinny as more favorable than being called fat.\n\n&#x200B;",
            "You dont have any idea what having babies does to your views on yourself. Your time, parts of your identity is stolen from you. You watch your body change and turn into something you dont recognize. It is A LOT to grapple with. Your wife had her second kid not that long ago. I remember it being hard to even look at myself in a mirror because I did not know who I was anymore. That person looking back at me COULD NOT be me. And I have a wonderfull husband who showered me with adoration, love and whatever affection I could take. What she is going through is not weird or odd. It is shockingly, sadly normal. We hang womens worth and value not just on their attractiveness but largely, their SIZE. What you are seing is a woman who lived in a world where her value and worth was hung on being thin as possible. Now, being as thin as possible is nearly impossible and likely something she doesnt want to do anymore...where does that leave her? These are the questions that run through your mind after having kids. This is not about you. It is about her. \n\nMake sure she has time to herself. That she can truly be ALONE if she needs it. Encourage her to do things that make her feel good, try new things, ect. Encourage she talk to a counselor. And stop being devastated she cant make out with you ffs. The woman is taking care of two tiny people all day. She is likely touched out and in light of the way she feels about herself, probably isnt feeling too sexy. ",
            "People are jumping all over the map here, and saying your wife has such and such issue.\n\nI think she may need to talk about this with you, in a way that allows her to be heard. Set up a sitter, or have a friend or family member watch the kids for a couple of hours. Then, sit down with her and tell her you're sorry. Tell her you dont like hearing her speak the way she is about herself, and that its concerning. You didn't mean to hurt her feelings, but it's obvious you did. Tell her that you love her, and ask her to explain what's going on.  Then, listen. It may be all she needs. If she seems open to it, you can make some of the suggestions offered here, but just letting her have the space to talk about her feelings can be incredibly validating and empowering.\n\nIt sounds like you and your wife have a great relationship. ",
            "This is totally fixable, don\u2019t despair. She had to exercise a lot before to maintain her slimness (it actually wasn\u2019t her \u2018natural body shape\u2019) and that was fine but it turns out that her entire self esteem was invested in it. Having babies, while a natural thing, is also bloody weird and takes over your whole body and messes you up sometimes. \n\nYour comment wasn\u2019t bad, it\u2019s just that maintaining a slim body was one of the things that defined her sense of herself and now it\u2019s not there, she\u2019s confused and upset. Also, hormones maybe playing a part.\n\nInsist that she sit with you without the bubbas one night and really talk. Remind her how much you love her and her body: remind her that she has done an awesome thing growing and giving birth to your mini humans. Then gently suggest regular sessions with a female therapist who is recommended by other mothers. Frame it as some regular \u2018me time\u2019 for her to just focus on herself and her own well-being.\n\nHang in there. You guys clearly have a great relationship, you\u2019ll get through this. ",
            "This makes me so sad. Someone has probably already offered this advice, but after having a conversation, something you could actually DO for her to help is offer to take the kids for a while by yourself on a regular basis so that she can have a work out / exercise routine in her life again. ",
            "Gaining weight for women is sooooo confronting. We are not used to being the sum of our parts but just parts that can be adored or desired. So when one or all of those parts start to change outside of what we are told is desirable our whole identity and worth is threatened. Ten pounds might as well be fifty in our eyes. We see loss of control, we see loss of safety, we see loss of worth. It\u2019s crazy but real. \nWe need help, through love and consistency, in seeing we are the totality of our parts. That our worry and desirability is the entirety of our energy and our minds and hearts and souls not just our physicality. When a woman is loved completely by a man she trusts and respects you change her entire perception of herself. \nSo keep going. Don\u2019t stop complimenting her. It seems like you do this in a genuine way. \nI would reflect gently back to her the language she uses to describe herself. It needs to be kinder. The issue is hers you cannot raise her self esteem for her but you can help her see herself the way you see her. \nWhen I started dating my man he did this for me. We can\u2019t see ourselves objectively very often. He saw things in me, reflected them back to me and suddenly they became conscious for me. It could be an aspect of my personality he found charming or adorable, something about my ways or my body it was a myriad of things that helped me see myself. \nThe power of love is amazing. \nEveryone has parts of their body they aren\u2019t in love with. When those parts are shown love and warmth it\u2019s amazing how we can accept them and love them. \nKeep telling her how sexy she is and how valued she is. All the things not just her body but keep up with that adoration too. If this doesn\u2019t help she may need some extra help. Therapy, self help books about image and self esteem.  ",
            "Poor self esteem is a vicious thing to contend with. \n\nI\u2019m going to take a shot in the dark and say you should make it known how hurt you are that she is behaving this way and tell her what you told reddit because honestly any partner would melt hearing what you have written here. I think deep down she knows you weren\u2019t saying anything mean or referring to her weight gain in any negative way. But she\u2019s too consumed with her insecurities to just let it go. Also acknowledge you\u2019ll never see what she sees in herself so you\u2019ll never fully understand  how she\u2019s feeling at the moment. But she has to understand the way she sees herself is not even comparable to what you truly see standing in front of you. Also acknowledge she\u2019s not only very unfair to herself but to you and you being punished just for enjoying her body. Again tell her what you told reddit it was amazing. But she needs help in letting you love herself it may be too touchy to bring up therapy but she does need to practise some self love. ",
            "Man, I was expecting something way worse with the way you built it up! \n\nListen, I don\u2019t have kids and have never experienced the changes that pregnancy brings to a woman\u2019s body. I\u2019ve always been a skinny size 2, to the point where people regularly asked me if I ate (I did, like a horse). \n\nThen I became ill and gained weight. I\u2019m not what people consider big, I wear a size 6, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m used to and even though the change was gradual over the course of a few years, I\u2019ve struggled with my newfound curves. \n\nA few years ago, a guy I was hooking up with referred to my curves in a comment he made to me, not unlike what you said to your wife. I didn\u2019t react in that moment but it\u2019s been something that has stuck with me since. Before that, I hadn\u2019t considered that I had acquired curves where there previously hadn\u2019t been any. I also suffer from low self esteem from time to time, and it\u2019s been a battle to love myself and my body. \n\nMy point is, it seems there are some self esteem issues that are affecting your wife. Changes to a woman\u2019s body is a very sensitive topic, pregnancy or not. You did nothing wrong by complimenting her and her body, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re attracted to her just the same, if not more. \nSometimes it seems that the world we live in tells us ladies to be a size 2 or we\u2019re not worth much. Even if we try to block that noise out, it will still find a way to affect us. It\u2019s wrong to think but going from a tiny size to a more normal size can be hard to deal with because of those messages society sends. Add post natal hormones to that and it\u2019s a disaster. \n\nThat being said, her reaction to this is extreme and passive aggressive. A person in a healthy mindset would communicate that the comment you made was hurtful to them and ideally you guys would talk it out, come up with a solution on how to best help her. I don\u2019t love the fact that she\u2019s icing you out. Other people are telling you to do all of these nice things for her, which are great ideas. But my advice is to approach her and have a talk about it. Reassure her that she is more beautiful and attractive than ever, but that this icing out business is hurting you and your relationship. If she is struggling with her self esteem then ask her how you can help. If she is displaying other symptoms of postpartum depression then convince her to seek a medical opinion, go with her to the doctor. \n\nI wish you both all the best. I truly hope your wife will start to feel better about herself. She literally grew and birthed two human beings! To me, that\u2019s a super power and she deserves to love what her body has given the two of you. ",
            "This is one of those instances where you need to call in a professional. She could be suffering from postpartum depression.\n\n\nAnd to be honest you sound so in love with her that you'd still think that she was beautiful and sexy even if she started growing tentacles (think Fri in Futurama).-  Thats a compliment btw\n\n\nShe may need to hear it from a neutral 3ed party. \n\nNote if a loved one does start growing tentacles seek medical attention immediately. ",
            "Wife, post partum 4 months, former endurance athlete here. I get your wife and her feelings on a deep level. This is for me, now, but every single time I start the negative thought train because my body has changed and doesn\u2019t look or feel like it did before, I remind myself of two things: I grew a human in 37.5 weeks and I have nourished him every single day since he was born. Me. No other body did that. And for me, that\u2019s power. It takes the sting out of the changes. \n\nTry a heartfelt apology. ",
            "It sounds like you were complimenting her when she took it the wrong way. Idk if women prefer to choose there words more carefully, or if guys are just less careful..regardless it sounds like your both in the wrong AND right. Give it some time, apologize, and everything will be alright ",
            "I put on 60lbs after my second child. I was always pretty petite, and I didn't recognize myself in the mirror. I had spiraled pretty far down into PPD/PPA, and absolutely HATED myself. Didn't matter what my husband said, he's very fit and athletic, and I just felt grossly huge. I thought that if I couldn't stand to look at myself naked, why would my hottie husband? So I had zero interest in sex, in him even seeing me naked. I closed myself off from him, in every way...we had sex like 3 times in the year after she was born. \n\nHe never confronted me about it, the way I really needed him to. I finally just hit a point where I needed to change, for me. I had a daughter, I didn't want her to model my self-hate. I started going to the gym in the morning, and switched to a new anxiety med (that didn't have to be nursing friendly). The more weight I lost, the better I felt about myself. My libido returned in full force, and my marriage got better (blissful, even). I'm very happy now, and it's not that I had to be skinny, I was just miserable in my own body. \n\nI resent him a little, though, for letting me go that far, for letting it happen for a year. For it being me to be the one to facilitate the change. But it's also given me a self-confidence I was lacking. I just wish he had sat me down and addressed it. Part of the problem was that he avoided talking about it because he didn't want to embarrass me, and so I felt he just wasn't interested, and why would he be? I was the heaviest i'd ever been, I looked like I ate the woman he married. But he was still interested, he just stayed away because I was giving strong \"hands off\" vibes...bad cycle that I finally broke, but by that point, I was doing it for me, and my kids. \n\nAnyway, my only advice is to sit her down and have a hard conversation about it. Be super supportive, be straight, tell her how much you love her but you want her to love herself, too. Tell her you want to do yoga at home with her, or make sure she has time alone to go to the gym. \n\nAnd your second child is still only a few months old, I'm betting her hormones are still all over the map, exacerbated by her body change. Be there for her, be extra supportive and extra reassuring (which it sounds like you are!) She's your wife, you are her husband, you have two kids, this is a hard time but you're in it with her, make sure she understands that. ",
            "Hey so with your little \u201critual\u201d after work, it might be that\u2019s she\u2019s super tired and stressed out and not in the mood to make out. I would maybe change it up to doing something like giving her a massage, something where she doesn\u2019t have to put in any effort for five minutes. Cause while it\u2019s great that you really want her like that, I think after taking care of a toddler and a baby all day I wouldn\u2019t be rip roaring to make out with someone immediately after they got home.",
            "What you said WAS a compliment, but her depression/very low self esteem twisted it into something it isn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve gained weight and would be so happy if I had an SO that said that to me instead of ignoring the topic of my weight gain all together. I hope you can find a way to get her to go to counseling and take care of herself. If she\u2019s been spending most of the time with the kids, it may be time to step in and set up something for her to do while your caring for the kids, preferably something that she\u2019ll get something out of.

            "Dude I was expecting what you said to be so much worse. You need to tell her in no uncertain terms that she is damaging your relationship with your children and it needs to stop right now. INSIST on both couples consoling and individual consoling. She needs to get a handle on her self esteem issues before she destroys your family.",
            "Sorry but \"curves\" could represent anything.  To someone else, they could be very happy you like their curves, and they are happy to have curves.\n\nSo this seems to be a comment that your wife responded to in her own negative way, but not the way you meant it.\n\nYou can help her but a lot of it will have to come from her.\n\n",
            "I like when my GF gains some weight and has curves.  She doesn't. I'm stupid in the same way you are. There's not much you can do.

Do your best to not make it seem like your idea cuz you'll just make it worse. ",
            "You didn't do anything wrong op, it is just that your wife is feeling very down about the changes in her body and can only think of the negative sides. Be patient, for the time being it would be better to  say 'you/your body' instead of addressing her curves directly. It's going to take a while to get her self esteem back on top.\nYou surely didn't 'sign up' only because of her looks! ",

Is there some imbalance here?  Just asking.  ",

Maybe she wants to get out and go to the gym. I don't think what you said was bad at all, as it was an affectionate acknowledgement of the facts -- she just had a baby and does not have the same body as she did pre-babies. Instead of telling her you like her new curves, try to help her get back to what she is comfortable with. Suggest hikes, gym, bike rides, joining a weight watching group.",
            "I\u2019ll be honest while I don\u2019t see anything wrong with what you said, because there isn\u2019t btw, she is clearly deeply struggling and just not fully verbalizing that to you. I\u2019ve got one kid and birth control messed me up so bad after him that I\u2019ve kept and gained weight that I cannot seem to lose. I\u2019m finally off the birth control but I\u2019m totally miserable. I hit the gym and train hard but because I was stuck for 2yrs like this it\u2019s really hard to stay motivated. There is always more pressure on women to lose weight and be more fit than there is on men. You can get a \u201cdad bod\u201d and nobody cares but she keeps the baby weight for more than a year and society says,\u201d Oh, you must be really damn lazy.\u201d There\u2019s no winning. \n\n\nJust sit her down and reassure her that it was not a comment on her weight but that you love her body every part of it and that this is absolutely what you signed up for when you got married and that every day is better than the last. Let her know that you acknowledge she\u2019s having a hard time right now with the weight gain and that while it really doesn\u2019t get any attention from you that you understand she likely feels those pressures and so if there\u2019s anything you can do to help or be more encouraging you\u2019d like to do this things. Then just listen because that\u2019s really all you can do. ",

Nowadays I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad, but maybe the toll of having another baby is not helping.  She should make an appointment with a doctor to talk about these issues that could be postpartum depression.

            "I'm guessing this is something she might have struggled with all her life, and her thinness was a big part of her identity in her own mind. Nothing you say or do really can change that. It might be worse right now because she's also temporarily losing other parts of her identity. Becoming a parent  times two really means giving up a lot of who you are, especially if you're staying at home (don't have work as a constant before and after kids). Top that off with hormonal changes. She might be having some post partum depression issues and this is how it's manifesting itself. I'd be honest with her that you're worried about how she sees herself and talks about herself. Try to get her some time to go talk w a couselor or, if she feels she wants to and it's part of her old routine, go do something active if it makes her feel better (not to lose weight necessarily), or go out with a friend. She needs to remember who she is, and give a way to move forward in her new life, however she physically looks. \n\nGood luck!",
            "Oh honey, you didn't do anything wrong. This isn't on you.\n\nI've had four kids, and my body has changed so so so much. I used to have a kick ass body, and now... yeah. Not so much. I gained a ton of weight, lost 50 of the 75 I gained, and even though I'm proud of it, when I look in the mirror, all I still see is sadness and ruin. I am amazed that anyone can find me attractive because I don't find myself attractive. I can look at other women who are heavier than me, or have the same body type, and think they are beautiful, but it doesn't apply to me. \n\nI'm telling you this to give you an idea of what might be in your wife's mind right now. Having babies changes us, and those changes can be physical and for some of us, seem devastating. \n\nMy suggestion is this- start in with how much you love her, all of her. Her mind, her body, her heart, her spirit. Praise her for her mothering, for her friendship, for her intellect. Tell her that you are more attracted to her than ever, but that you can tell she is deeply unhappy with her appearance. Ask her what she would like to do about it, if it is something that brings her such displeasure. Does she want to meet with a nutritionist? Hire a personal trainer for the gym? Join a running group? Let her know that you will support her in whatever she wants to do, but that her unhappiness with her appearance breaks your heart. Tell her you wish she could see herself through your eyes, and really feel how beautiful and sexy you find her.\n\nShe might not be ready to do what she needs to do to make physical changes, having small children that you care for majority time kinda sucks all your energy out of you. It might take awhile for her to be ready to make some changes. Just keep complimenting her and supporting her. \n\nYou sound like a really good husband, and she's a lucky lady.",
            "Oh Man, you are a good guy. She is a lucky lady.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn't do this to her, and she didn't do this to herself.  Yes she has self esteem issues-- but she didn't make them. Society taught her to love her body only when it fits within certain limits. Man that sucks. She probably feels so judged and commented upon that any comment about her body, even a seemingly positive one, stings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave you thought about addressing the above  issue by pointing  it out directly? Instead of addressing your feelings about her body?  By this I mean, \"I feel so angry and powerless sometimes. I think you are the most wonderful thing on this planet-- and it drives me crazy that we live in a world that is making you feel bad about yourself. You have a right to feel however you want to feel about your body, and do as you wish with it-- but it hurts me that, through no fault of your own, we live in a culture that makes you dislike where you're at now. I love you, and I love your body for many reasons: it's beautiful, it gave us our kids, and most importantly YOU live in it! It makes me sad you don't love your body too, but I will sit here and love it until you can! Can I help in any way?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you could try addressing it just through the pregnancy, more obliquely. Tell her how amazing her body is-- not in terms of aesthetics, but in terms of what it has done! \"I can't believe you are so strong that you went through all that to make our kid. Your body is metal AF.\"  If she was comparatively \"good at being pregnant\" (looked good, didn't have too many complaints, delivered quickly-- whatever) puff her up about it. This works post partum too:  Is she breastfeeding and is it FUCKING AMAZING her body is keeping your baby alive and giving him a kickass immune system? Does she walk around with the kids in her arms all day, and does that give you awe about how physically strong she is?  The trick is to avoid talking about her body in relation to your pleasure, and simply appreciate her body to her.  This is not to say theres ANYTHING wrong with talking about how her body pleases you-- it just might be too sensitive right now. You can gradually move back into comments about how her body pleases you naturally from here: is there something more \"womanly\" vs. the \"girl\" you married and that's really attractive to you? (Louis CK has a really good bit about this)  or perhaps you appreciate what the pregnancy boob fairy hath wrought? Just be really careful about working this back in, and make sure she has started relating positively to her body before you do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor insight, I have a medical condition that causes my weight to go up and down about 20 lbs every few years, even if I eat very little.  I have had boyfriends who cared, and boyfriends who didn't and were very supportive.  I felt the same no matter who I was with when I started this ride-- I hated myself all the time. I hated when they commented on what I ate (Do you really NEED that half an avocado?) but even more than that I hated when they told me they liked my heavier body.  I would convince myself the ones that tolerated me at my heaviest were \"chubby chasers\" even though I wasn't medically overweight. That's how deep the social scars go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I.e. if you would say \"your curves have gotten so amazing\" I would hear either: \"You have visibly gained weight.Its not in your head\" or even \" your curves weren't amazing before. All of our time together previously I thought you were shapeless and too skinny\". Ridiculous, I know, but would put a huge damper on how I felt about myself, my partner and sexuality in general.",

Does she have an hour to herself each night that she could use to exercise like she used to? I hear you saying a lot of flowery things about her and that's great, but she needs practical support as well. Also if she doesn't want to prioritize being thin that is totally fine too! But she needs to own it and not punish you for a totally innocuous comment. \n",
            "This is exactly what my man and I are going through. The first step is, truly, that she is realistic about the way her body has changed. I would sit down and talk with her to tell her what you just told us. How sexy you find her. How you were complementing her. Ask if there's anything you can do to help.\nYou guys could start doing yoga together. My bf and I try to when we can, and it can be really fun! Yoga is great for toning, for depression and postpartum exercise. Youtube tutorials to learn.\nThe important aspect of this- This isn't something you're suggesting she do alone. It's something you're suggesting yall try together. That way it's not like..You're fat, go do some yoga.\n\nIf she's anything like me..Going from being petite af to having all this fat that you've never had before is hard to accept. And even harder to talk about. You have feelings of shame and shallowness and just general confusion about wtf happened to your body. \nBut if she works towards being more confident, however that may be- She can learn to love her body again.\n\nCommunication, self- work, support and love will get yall over this hump. Yall will get through this!",
            "My advice would be to just keep telling her how much you love her and love her body.

I'm currently struggling with the way I look and my weight and my husband always tells me he will support me if I want to go to the gym or do different things. He said that we can start eating better and he will do it with me. He knows how important it is to me to feel good about myself so he is going to be my support through it all. ",

Sounds like the post pregnancy hormones are getting to her pretty good, did she struggle with them with the first child? As a mans prospective I dont think it was the worse thing you could've said but not the best.. but that's from and mans point of view. My wife and I just had our first child together a year ago and she gained 40 lbs during the pregnancy and has struggled with it. I've found that helped her the best is just being supportive and offering to be there and take the steps with her to losing the weight, I found my wife was really regretful with me doing that. Best of luck!",

            "I really speak from experience (40yo F, mother) when I say that this is NOT about you. She\u2019s so afraid that she\u2019s not good enough for you any more - but in reality she\u2019s not feeling good enough for herself and she\u2019s afraid you feel the same way. You didn\u2019t say anything wrong. Nothing. She\u2019s sounding stuck in some pretty strong and painful self dislike, and she\u2019s embarrassed by her body. I can relate. I recently lost 50 lbs by working out and eating really well. I found that I didn\u2019t love my body even at a healthy BMI - my weight wasn\u2019t the issue - my self image was. I accepted myself because it was hurting my marriage, my happiness, and setting a really poor example of self-acceptance for our daughter. My advice is to list apologize to her. Write her a letter if it\u2019s easier to tell her that you feel so badly for hurting her and reinforce everything you\u2019ve already said - but especially - that you can\u2019t resist the urge to touch her beautiful body now as much as ever. Ask her to just straight up trust you. She sounds like a loving and amazing woman who doesn\u2019t want to let you down and is damn scared of losing you because she isn\u2019t good enough any more. Good luck. I know you can find each other in this. \ud83d\udc97",

It took me time to come to terms with it but I love my body now.\n\nYour wife's body has totally changed and she's at the end of her 20's.

It sounds like she is equally as awesome, and you two are great together. I wonder if a guy like you exists in my city, but I digress. Anyhow, as her support and rock, you may need to help facilitate her addressing this medically with her obstetrician or other medical doctor.  Do sit down and talk to her, but if she isn\u2019t receptive, it may be the chemical imbalance speaking. If she isn\u2019t capable and willing to recognize that there is an issue, I would suggest reaching out to get help for her in whatever way you would want her to help you if the roles were reversed. I am sitting at 30+ pounds heavier than I was prior to having one child, and the problem with weight is that you get constant reminders every time you move or see yourself in a mirror. So she is tearing her sense of self apart thousands of times every day. It\u2019s heartbreaking, but it is very likely PPD or another chemical imbalance. ",

Have a heart to heart talk with her and say you meant no harm and you were complementing her, pointing out her beauty. And then tell her you will help her in any way possible. It sounds like she wants to become that petite woman again. I don\u2019t know if that is possible given her current life of having children, etc, but tell her you are there for whatever she wants to do. Support her. She will forgive you. ",

            "You didn't do anything wrong. She is clearly feeling insecure and has low self-esteem about her body. You seem to be doing everything you can to still make her feel beautiful but if she doesn't feel that way about herself, nothing you do is going to help. I'm not trying to say women should hate their bodies if they are not skinny and petite but if it bothers her that much, trying to lose the weight might make her happier. I know that I felt so much happier in life after I lost some weight and got back to where I wanted to be. Either that or she needs some sort of counseling to work through her issues. No one should feel that way normally about their own bodies. It's one thing to be unhappy with your body but she is lashing out at you because of it and that's when it gets emotionally abusive.",

She thought you were being sarcastic or making a veiled insult. I don't know how to convince her it was genuine or if it's better to just leave it and let her come round...if it's been going on for a week maybe she is waiting for you to cross the bridge.

My intention was to let you know that I find you, and everything about you, amazing. I was hoping my words would assure you that the views you've expressed about your body are not ones that I share with you. You may see the changes in your body as a negative because it's different than what your used to, but I see it as beauty. There has never been a time that I have looked at you with anything but love. If anything, I desire you more now than I ever did. I love you more than I ever did. I apologize if my words were hurtful to you, but I certainly didn't intend for that to happen. \n\nOr something along those lines. At least, that's the gist of what I'm reading in your post.

It\u2019s the fact that her whole body is different. Whether that\u2019s stretch marks, bigger hips or whatever changes her body went through after carrying two babies. I know because I\u2019ve been there. On top of body changes, she also has had an identity change. She\u2019s become a mom and that\u2019s HUGE. I was upset about my weight gain too. My husband would say all the\u201dright\u201d things but it was more of an internal struggle I was having. \n\nDefinitely make sure she has time to herself, take over watching the kids when you get home and tell her to go do whatever she would like. This does wonders for self-esteem and her realizing she\u2019s still the same person as she was before she had kids. ",
            "You could spend the next 5 years complimenting her body and it still would not impact the way she views herself. \nMy suggestion is tell her it makes you sad to see that she in unhappy with herself. Remind her that you adore her regardless but you want to help her find happiness. \n\nDoes she want to go to the gym? Great, you'll happily watch the kids and make dinner on those days. \n\nDoes she want to change her diet? Great, you'll help her find recipes that you all can enjoy. \n\nI personally think she needs to see a therapist as I know how it is to hate yourself and your body, remind her that you will be there for her for that as well. \n\nBasically, remind her that YOU ARE HER SUPPORT SYSTEM. \n\nI'm sorry you are going through this and I'm especially sorry that she feels this way.

We stare in the mirror for hours picking out every last flaw that most people either would never notice or never even think to be a flaw. I loooove when my mans compliments me on my curves, but I wasn't always happy w my body and could see how a long time ago somebody commenting on them could have made me shut down and self conscious. I remember how hard it was for me to accept compliments on my thighs and nips when those were things I was self conscious ab. There's really nothing you can do but help her shift towards positive self body image. My acceptance and confidence just took time. Now I LOVE flaunting my confidence and think it's one of my best qualities. Wish I could share some insight on how I accomplished this mindset, but everybody is different and it's all internal.

Honestly she's put on weight over the years, but she's just as attractive to me as ever, if not more so.\n\nHer issues with her body have caused trouble here and there , until I drunkenly stumbled out something to tune of \"I wish you could see what I see when I look at you. No just what I actually see, but the way I see it. You have no idea how pretty I think you are or how lucky I am to have you. There is just no way I can make you see that. It's a shame, you'd be really surprised. \"\n\nWith that I think I went to sleep. In t had been a long day/night of body issues , general bickering,  familial billshit, and heavy drinking. \n\nNext morning she was up before me (which never happens) cooking  eggs , handed me a cup of coffee, asked if I slept well and she hummed as she cooked. \n\nI'm smart enough to realize that her issues didnt resolve themselves in that 6 hrs span, however I do think she realized that I (SOMEONE) finds her attractive,  its probly a huge bonus that her husband likes the way she looks.  \n\nThese things are hard op.

If I was her I would have responded by saying something like \u201creally, I\u2019m feeling pretty unattractive these days but I\u2019m glad it floats your boat.\u201d It sounds like she needs some help from someone who\u2019s not physically intimate with her, preferably a doctor or mental health professional.

            "Wow OP, you did not say anything even remotely offensive! You actually complimented her and due to her self esteem issues, she took it the wrong way and is completely over-reacting, and punishing you for it. Idk if it will help, but you might point out that her curves could very well have taken a new shape and \"gotten amazing,\" in your words, without her having gained weight. Maybe she lost weight, maybe her weight shifted,  or maybe it's just that after becoming a mother of two has given her a georgous adult female figure that women only come into after bearing children? I suspect the latter to be true. I'm sorry your wife is having such problems with her self image and I hope she is able to see herself as beautiful as she truly is which is how you see her. Good luck OP.",
            "Problem is her, not you. You sound like a bit of a pushover and I think that needs to be addressed. Obviously be understanding and supportive about what she is going through, but also need to let her know how her behaviour is making you feel and you should be able to do so without that being a problem. Which I feel like it might be based on how you seem to be so afraid of just saying \"I don't think you're fat, please stop putting words in my mouth and overreacting.\" And to that point, ask her why that's happening and try to figure that out with her.",

It could be post-partum depression and it could be the massive swaying of hormones women go through for months after delivering a baby. Those are all things you should consider and seriously.\n\nCounseling is a good option..You can also (in addition) go to her, tell her you need to have a talk with her after the kids are down. It needs to be a serious discussion, not lax on the couch or between loads of laundry, erc... tell her she absolutely drives es you crazy, is beyond sexy and is as attractive as ever if not more TO YOU... but you also understand se is not comfortable in her own skin and how she feels about herself is important to you, as well, and that you want to help her in any way possible. Assure her what you said was not meant the way she took it (it's not bad at all). Also, tell her you've been hurt in how she's treating you... that those rituals are important to you and to relationships in general and you don't want to do anything that would jeopardize that.\n\nI hope all goes well... you sound like a good guy and her a fine woman... you can get past this!",

            "Responding with self-deprecating comments when your S/O compliments you usually comes from some place of insecurity. It sounds like she's already very insecure, so your innocuous comment would have upset her no matter what. Perhaps it might help her to get some therapy.",

She's gained about ten pounds, which...Lord almighty, keep me away or she's gonna be nekkid in two seconds. \n\nAnyway, about a week ago, she was in front of the mirror and grabbing at handfuls or her skin, and says, \"I've gained so much weight.\"\n\nAll the blood had left my brain by that point and I said, \"Nah, Babe. You got *thick*.\" I meant it as a compliment, but the look she gave me told me I'd royally fucked up. \n\nLet me just tell you this: she's not mad at you. She's mad at herself. I'd go all out and buy her flowers, take her out, worship her for a day. Then get serious and tell her she should seek help for her insecurities. You need to tell her that *you hate seeing her so upset because she's the love of your life*. ",

            "Pregnancy is super rough on the body and it takes a while to bounce back, if at all. At some point you just have to accept that things are... different. Not better or worse, but different. \n\nInstead of telling her you find her beautiful, which she won't believe because of her own perception of herself, thank her for everything she has done to bring your kids into the world and tell her you love her and that you always will. \n\nIt's natural to be insecure about your body after pregnancies. It's why things like mummy makeovers exist. Once she starts to bounce back, she will get her confidence back too. It could also be a hormonal reaction with PPD. Instead of focusing on her body, focus on all the non physical aspects that make you crazy about her and it will make her less fixated on her weight. ",
            "This is coming from some experience - I was always petite. I'm 5'2\" and until I was in a very abusive relationship, I was like 110lbs soaking wet. After pregnancy I ballooned up to 160 (I had a rough pregnancy with a ton of weight loss due to extreme morning sickness) I was nursing around the clock and between the food cravings from nursing, and everything that had happened to my body, I held on to every single extra calorie. I had never been that heavy.\n\nGrowing up I was very active in a sport that is known for fostering (and sometimes ENCOURAGING) anorexic/bulimic behaviours. I've struggled with weight and body image for as long as I can remember. Getting that heavy was brutal for me. I developed severe PPD and was so hard on myself.\n\nOP what you said wasn't even as bad as I was expecting. She is struggling with a changing body that, in some aspects, will never go back - pelvis has now permanently (most likely) widened, and those size 0 jeans won't ever fit her again because her hips are just wider than they were pre-babies. That sucks. \n\nMaybe it's time you and her sit down and have a very honest conversation. Ask her what is bothering her, if there's anything you can do to help. Maybe suggest she goes and talks with her doctor if you really suspect maybe something is up in terms of her mental health and maybe she has Post Partum Depression. See if there isn't something you can do to help with her struggles - offer to make it a routine to go for a nice long walk together - it will keep her active if that's something she misses and lets you guys be together. If she wants to hit the gym but doesn't have time or the ability to do so because the kiddos - offer to have some dedicated time with the boys, while she goes and hits the gym. ",

If this is the first time that she has given you the cold shoulder over a minor indiscretion, you should see it as a warning that she needs more support.

You need to address how she feels about herself. She may be more beautiful to you but if she doesn\u2019t feel that way it won\u2019t help, so help her feel better, ask her what she would like you to do (if anything) and do that.

            "My wife and I have an 18 month old and are about the same age, and it was only recently in therapy that she opened up to me that she\u2019s self conscious about her weight. I know many people struggle with it, even myself, but I never really knew how she felt since having our son. We talked about it and I reassured her I never even thought that was a big deal, we\u2019re all human after all. It\u2019s up to you, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to acknowledge that you said some things that may have upset her and it was not your intention and you\u2019re always there for her to just be the best person you can be. It\u2019s okay to say the wrong thing, sweeping it under the rug and holding onto it is not okay.  A small compliment or gesture can go a long way to boosting confidence, especially post-baby. (Men are included in that). ",
            "Aww, what you said was actually really sweet but I can understand how it upset her. Speaking as a woman who also has serious body image problems, I highly recommend that she consider going to therapy. It can help a lot and she is probably torturing herself with these thoughts instead of enjoying what should be a joyful time with a new baby.",
            "Like others have said, she may need some therapist time to have someone to vent to. Maybe postpartum depression, or maybe lower self-esteem issues after her body has changed, or both. Although it is definitely great to tell your wife how beautiful she is, she may be receiving the comments in an insecure way\u2014she\u2019s hearing, \u201cyou\u2019ve changed. You\u2019re not the skinny/fit person you used to be. You\u2019re now a chubby woman.\u201d Though you think she\u2019s beautiful, she doesn\u2019t feel that way. \n\nAnd women are often scared to show their insecurities with guys because we all hear about how men love confident women. Often you fall in love with that confident woman. But now she\u2019s not feeling so confident, and that may make her feel ashamed or overwhelmed. (I mean remember; there are tabloids everywhere saying: \u201chow this celebrity lost her baby weight in 2 months and looks better than ever!\u201d So society doesn\u2019t always help support that acceptance of gained weight either.\n\nShe may be holding her insecurities in, telling herself \u201cOh he won\u2019t understand. He\u2019ll just tell me again I\u2019m beautiful. Well I don\u2019t feel that way at all. And I\u2019m tired. And I don\u2019t even know if I want to go to the gym. I\u2019m trying to be the best mother and wife possible. But I\u2019m exhausted. And I don\u2019t feel great about the person I see in the mirror.\u201d ...it\u2019s hard for anyone to accept changes in body weight, just continue to support her.\n\nSo, I\u2019d say; sit down together. Have a calm chat. Say hey, I love you, I truly think you are beautiful. But I\u2019m worried my comments may have offended you. Are you okay? I know being a mother is extremely hard work. So I want to know how you\u2019re feeling so I can understand you better and support you.\u201d ",
            "Oof man, I feel for you.  You sound a lot like my boyfriend and your wife sounds a lot like me. I'm very into running and keeping fit but gained like 15 lbs a year or so ago.  My bf always has the best intentions and never would want me to feel bad but sometimes just drawing attention to it would make me feel self conscious and I would take it out on him.  It wasn't fair for me to do that, so just pandering to your wife right now isn't going to solve the problem.. talk about how you can help her solve the problem together.  Explain to her she has every right to be unhappy with her figure and if you can help give her time to work on it you will by watching the baby while she goes on a run or something.  It does wonders for depression and is so healthy I cant sell it enough. As far as you guys go I would suggest taking her out on a date and just trying to make her feel sexy.  Best of luck bud",

            "DUDE I'm gonna be one voice in hundreds, so I don't know how much this'll help or even be seen, but dude you gotta go to counseling. It's the most direct way to deal with the problem and the things that she's been struggling with. There is absolutely nothing wrong with getting some help from an outside source, especially if that help is a professionally trained one. I hope so much that you guys can move on from this problem in a very positive way and improve your lives for the better. She deserves it, you deserve it, dont be afraid of it. ",
            "Nah what you said isn't the problem (and isn't even a bad thing to say) ; the problem is her self-esteem. She was so used to being thin that she can't deal with the fact that she can't be thin anymore. It may not even be the weight issue, it might be the whole growing up/having kids/all the changes associated with that are stressing her out and she's lashing out under the cumulative stress.\n\nSo I would just sit down with her and try to figure out what's going on. \"Hey you know I don't think you're fat and I think you're beautiful, so what's really going on? What can I do to help with that?\" She might just need more help with the kids, or to talk to a therapist, or to get back into old routines pre-kids, etc. ",
            "I don't think that she's rightfully angry at you. She is self conscious about her changing body, and is uncomfortable. She's upset that she doesn't have the same body as before. The comment you made might have set her off because she doesn't like her own body. \nTalk to her and tell her that you love her no matter what, and that if she wants to work out with you or change something to where she is comfortable with her body again, that you will be accepting and encouraging towards her.

            "Something very similar happened to me and my boyfriend. I happened to be looking down and uh, when people look down they have a double chin right? He\u2019s looking at me and says \u201chaha, when you look down you kinda have a double chin, it\u2019s cute.\u201d My own self esteem had been suffering at That time and I had been desperately trying to lose weight even though I only weigh 109 lbs. I reacted In a similar fashion to your wife, becoming a little cold. Although he meant it as a compliment, we girls can misconstrued things and find a deeper meaning.\nThe reason I began to act cold was because my self esteem was lower and I was convinced he didn\u2019t want to look at me- so I stayed away.\nIf your wife has the same mentality as I do, believing she\u2019s not good enough for you, try as hard as you can to make her believe she\u2019s worth everything to you. Go past just a compliment, try a surprise dinner date or things like a massage. \n\nEDIT;  with most other comments saying \u201cshe\u2019ll get over it\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not your fault\u201d are only half true. It may not be your fault-  what\u2019s at fault is her self esteem. However- that\u2019s a very fragile thing. And leaving someone to deal with it by themselves is a risky game. In a normal everyday situation with a stranger you\u2019ve accidentally offended, you apologize and move on. But this is your wife. Someone who should be by your side through thick and thin. Although it may not be entirely\nYour fault, you should still support your wife and do as much as you can because you LOVE HER. Their personal life becomes yours and you should keep it in mind ",

I've been struggling myself and I often say things like this to my husband. I know it isn't fair to him. Like others have said there isn't anything you can do, but you should sit and talk with her. Maybe after you come home you could offer to watch the kids for her to hit the gym. ",
            "What you said wasn\u2019t even really offensive. This is definitely some self esteem she\u2019s going through and is clearly sensitive about it if you bring anything up related to it. \n\nI\u2019d apologize that she\u2019s feeling that way, you aren\u2019t calling her fat so don\u2019t blame yourself , and ask her what she needs and try to help her with it.

            "First of all I don't think you did anything wrong. This is coming from a mother of two kids, I gained a stone after mine. A stone isn't a lot, but I was very petite pre kids so it felt like a lot to me, and I was very very insecure about it. To the point I'd probably react the way she did. You paid her a compliment based on how she looks, but she is insecure and you acknowledged her weight gain which she sees as a negative thing so the compliment was lost. \n\nYou need to talk to her so this doesn't spiral into resentment. She's blanking you and obviously upset. Tell her you find her just as attractive as ever and you were trying to compliment her, you are sorry and maybe ask her to be honest with you about how she feels about her body. If she comes clean with feeling fat, (which she should do as she clearly does feel fat), offer to help somehow. Take the kids an hour a day so she can work out if she wants. Depending how old the kids are she may not be ready yet though. I only started working out again in April this year, I wanted to in Jan because someone I work with asked if I was pregnant again! (I was only a size 12 UK so I was shocked to be asked lol.) I had a knee injury at the time so had to wait until April to work out. My youngest was almost 3 at the time. Before that I just didn't want to do it. I wanted to spend my little free time relaxing. Now I love it though. \n\nGood luck, I hope you can sort things out.",
            "She could be struggling with post-partum depression which would explain a lot here. Even if it makes her mad at you, I would bring it up in a kind, gentle loving way and insist she call/see her doc. One supportive thing you could do is help her carve out time to get to the doc. Take a half day off and watch the kids while she goes. You should like a fantastic husband. I don't think you actually did anything wrong. Stay loving and remember that you can be her rock while she struggles. ",

Maybe a walk after dinner with the boys? Lots of gyms offer child minding and will watch your babies while you work out. I don't think therapy is needed. This is a conversation between you guys and her accepting changing body. She's a mom now and she did the most amazing thing in the world and gave up her body and needs to grow two other little people! Ask her what you can do to help her feel more comfortable or help her get closer to where she was. (Often as women we have this idea that we can or should be the size of people we see in the media and it's not feasible for most of us). Happiness is really key here. It's both of you learning to love her all over again, changes and all. I'm sure you'll get through this OP.

            "I\u2019m very sympathetic to your wife. I\u2019ve had three kids and my body will never be what it was like when I got married. It\u2019s a very hard thing to take  because all around me I see women who only had a tiny baby bump and looked like they\u2019d never been pregnant only a week or so after giving birth, but a lot of women are not built like that. I would also be concerned that your wife might have some PPD. Mine was worse after the birth of my second son- two kiddos is exponentially harder than just one and the toddler doesn\u2019t give a shit how tired she is so she has lots of pressure to it all. New moms also tend to put a lot of pressure on ourselves to be perfect and sail through motherhood. It\u2019s hard when we struggle and don\u2019t live up to our own expectations of what we think we should be- that includes the wife part. \n\nI think it\u2019s okay to acknowledge that yes her body has changed because of course it has- she grew a whole human and her body is amazing for accomplishing that. But that you think she still looks absolutely as stunning and beautiful as ever. However, if *she\u2019s* not comfortable with herself ask what you can do to help her. Would she like you to go for walks with her to ease back into exercise? What about a gym membership that has childcare? \n\nI also think she might want to look into counseling for some body image issues and maybe some PPD because she sounds like she\u2019s struggling and you don\u2019t want this to fester and hurt your marriage. Ask her what she thinks she needs fro\nYou and the best way you can support her so she remembers how beautiful you think she is. ",

I've struggled with eating disorders and similarly freaked out to an insane degree when an innocent comment was made about weight gain. It can feel absolutely devastating. What she needs is therapy before this develops into a serious issue and she endangers herself trying to lose weight. You are absolutely doing the right things, this is something she needs to deal with in therapy. ",

            "I would agree with people who say it\u2019s a self-esteem deal, and I\u2019ll add that what your wife has gone through has fucked with her hormones. She\u2019s going to have emotional reactions that are more extreme for a while, and as long as you can appreciate where they come from and that they don\u2019t reflect on you things will be fine. Pregnancy/childbirth/breastfeeding really impacts a woman\u2019s body and going through physical changes which you can\u2019t control is upsetting. It\u2019s part of why we were all such miserable, cranky things in adolescence.\n\nSo your wife\u2019s issue isn\u2019t about whether you like her body, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t like her body and how little she can do to change it.\n\nSolution: \n\nFirst, tell her how amazing you think it is that she\u2019s brought two little people into this world, say things like you\u2019re in awe of the fact that she did that.\n\nWhat this does is subtlety help her to reconsider the issue of her body not as something lost, but as something well-sacrificed because it gave her those sons of yours.\n\nNext, and wait a couple days for her to think that over, confront her about what she\u2019s feeling. Get her to share her feelings about her body with you, and be supportive of what she feels. Then tell her you think she\u2019s really fucking hot. She\u2019ll feel heard and validated but also understand that just because she doesn\u2019t like her body it doesn\u2019t mean that you do too.",

            "I agree she likely needs some help. It sounds like she is suffering.  I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. What you said was actually very sweet; you just unknowingly mentioned size & shape to a woman who is likely consumed with self-hatred over her size and shape. I imagine she has no desire to get comfortable being curvy; but will always want to feel as though you find her attractive.  If she\u2019s spinning out with self-hated, you may not be able to give her what she needs. She\u2019s probably got to right her own train.\n\nThere is also a lot of advice on here that says to keep on loving her and telling her she\u2019s beautiful.  I don\u2019t disagree with that, except how do you do that when someone is stonewalling you??  ??  And how long do you carry on while they are actively punishing you?\n\nBeing stonewalled from your family is pretty painful.\n\nI think for your own well-being (and hers), you have to raise the bar on the interaction instead of trying to walk more lightly on the egg-shells.\n\nI think we enact emotional punishments like stonewalling because we don\u2019t know any better - but they are not fair to our partners or ourselves.  If she\u2019s suffering, she needs to find a way to understand her emotions herself and let you help her, instead of shutting you out (from the family!! Not cool for the kids either) or at least tell you respectfully that she needs space. \n\n1) get grounded in the solution (as opposed to getting bunged up in the problem).  Take a few minutes for yourself and imagine what it looks like if it all works out (e.g., imagine you and your wife at your best). Really play with this until you feel good about you two.\n\n2) with that grounded loving energy, interrupt the current dynamic: Tell her the way things are is not ok; that you know she\u2019s angry and hurt, and that you guys are going to \u201cadult\u201d this thing together, because tanking or suffering are no longer an option.\n\n3) help her get her needs met: start a convo about what she needs for immediate and on-going support and to feel whole with so many demands on her body/mind/heart.  You guys can move a lot of resources around to make sure that everyone\u2019s needs get met. She may be beating herself up for not being able to do it all as well.\n\n4) elevate the relationship: tell her that you want to grow as a couple and learn how to communicate better through tough times, because stonewalling and punishing each other when conflict arises is not ok with you (if it is indeed not ok).  (You can google the effects of stonewalling on a relationship - it\u2019s quite costly).\n\n******\n\nAnyhew - all easier said than done.  And plenty of people accept the cold shoulder as just \u201cthe wife is mad, I\u2019m in the dog house\u201d. And they stay married for years.  You just seam like a really sensitive and committed husband, and she must be really lovely too, to be the other half of the rituals and family you two have created.  I think with such a beautiful foundation, there are a lot of places you two can go together that you both would enjoy tremendously.\n\nI love your afterwork ritual.  I hope you two can keep that alive. It sounds very special.\n\nAll the best energy coming your way for you both.",
            "My wife has gained 20lbs and I love it. I swear every ounce went to her ass and boobs. But she wants to lose weight. Fine. If that's what she wants. Anyway your comment was not insensitive. You will, however, need to work through this together. Again, this is not about your comment, this is about how she feels. She feels fat. She either is or isn't. But it only matters how she feels.",
            "I completely understand this. I haven\u2019t had a child but put on some weight due to a variety of reasons. I used to be a twig and now I\u2019m on the curvier end. When you\u2019re used to looking a certain way suddenly changing can take a huge hit in you mentally. My boyfriend loves me no matter what I look like, but for a while I didn\u2019t love myself. My biggest advice would be to just give her time to figure out herself and what her new normal looks like. I\u2019ve been going to workout classes and that has been a huge confident boost. Knowing you can push your body and that you\u2019re strong even if you\u2019re not the size you once were is totally empowering (plus all the happy workout endorphins!) \n\nI promise this is 100% not about anything you said. Just keep on supporting and loving your wife for who she is in that moment. ",
            "Honestly, the words you said aren't that hurtful on face value. You were being honest in saying that you love her. However, what you said isn't quite what she's hearing. It sounds like she's got some self esteem issues going on. Have you talked to the doctor about some post-partum stuff? I also agree that if she were able to have some time to work out again, it might help her, too. \n\nKeep reassuring her that you love her and find her sexy.",
            "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong at all. I think your wife is being a diva. You sound like a great husband. I\u2019m thick and curvy and my boyfriend tells me often that he thinks I\u2019m sexy and that he loves my body type. He never ever calls me fat but he will be like \u201cyou have a huge ass. Damn that\u2019s a sexy ass.\u201d Lol and it\u2019s him hitting on me and I love it. As a woman, it\u2019s so empowering to have a man see me for who I am and love it. \n\nI\u2019ve had 2 children. I understand going from being tiny and petite to curvy and thicker. You can be sexy at any size but it can be difficult to adjust at first. But this is something she needs to work out in herself. Right now though- she\u2019s punishing you OP for how she feels about herself. You can jump through as many hoops as you want OP but until she heals what is going on inside herself, this will continue and it\u2019s not a good path for the relationship to be on. ",

            "Dude, it's not 'your' mistake.\n\nShe hated herself long before she married you. Remember, she exercised and starved herself to be skinny way way before she met you because she has always suffered from low self image. \n\nYou are just an outlet for her personal pain. \n\nUnderstand there is nothing you can do, and that she has to see a counselor to accept who she is inside and out. Otherwise, it will rip her apart as a person, and she will take you along for the ride.",
            "I am more concerned that you felt the need to let us know that she doesn\u2019t make out with you for five solid minutes and that she was skinny/petite and she worked out a ton but is no longer skinny/petite after she preformed the miracle of making a life from two microscopic things. Oh. And she performed a SECOND miracle of life from microscopic things. \n\nWhy did you bring up how much she used to work out to be petite?",
            "Tell her you miss the ways you used to reconnect when you come home. Tell her you miss making out with her after work,  and then eating dinner together.  Ask her what can you do to help bring it back.  And do it. \n\nHer insecurities are hers. You can't work on them- it's on her. But you can give and ask for the affection that you used to share. \n\nPersonally- i think there is nothing wrong with saying * your curves have gotten amazing*",
            " Yes she gained weight and yes you think she looks sexy. You would think your verbal and physical affirmations would be taken as a compliment.\n\nI'm guessing she feels guilty for getting bigger, and her negative self body image can't accept it, nor does she need to accept it. She can lose weight. Will she be motivated to lose weight is another question.\n\nBe gentle about it but let her know complaining about weight gain won't make it go away, but instead you will support her in making healthy life style changes with diet, and if she wants to join a gym you will support her. But she can just as easily work out at home with cardio vids. And support her either way in if she wants to change habits or not. Because like you said you like her body either way.\n\n",
            "This is not a complete answer, but you can at times get slightly indignant when she gets so self-critical, I.e. ' That's my wife you're talking about. Please don't speak in such harsh terms about the woman I love with all my heart. I have promised to give my life to her. I love her and I love her body more every day, and I will not hear her described in such terms.'\n\nNeedless to say, ya gotta live up to this,but it sounds like you do. I don't read this as a mistake you made as much as your wife just looking for an excuse to criticize herself. Try to convince her to speak to herself as a loving friend, not a harsh critic.",
            "Unfortunately it sounds like she grew up to the ideals of the damn near dead anorexic is the girl with the great figure. Just tell her while you\u2019ll never know what its like to be a woman you understand. Tell her understand its not easy and societal judgment as a whole affects every little girl, which eventually becomes a woman. As for the 5-minute make out sessions you\u2019ve got bigger problems man. If she was broken so easily you need to help her get to the root of why it hurt her because it wasn\u2019t you and help her build her confidence. Otherwise you\u2019re just going to be living in a dead house with a couple kids.",
            "It sounds like you\u2019ve done everything right, even your comment would\u2019ve been harmless if she wasn\u2019t dealing with such deep body issues. \n\nI struggled with an eating disorder years ago and gained 20 pounds, enough to make me feel disgusted in my own skin. At my peak weight I got together with my (now ex) boyfriend who had been a long time friend, and he helped a lot. \n\nIt was something I needed to mostly work on myself. I finally bought myself new, comfortable clothes that actually fit and were flattering instead of trying to squeeze into my old clothes. It was tough to admit to myself I needed to buy a size up, but as soon as I got home with my new clothes and got to wear them it made an unbelievable difference. I wore a lot of yoga pants for a while but not having a waist band tight around my midsection that would make me aware of my weight was such a relief. \n\nThings that a partner could do that personally would have and do still make me feel good about myself:\n- being touchy feely, I loved when my ex would feel me up and come on strongly or give my butt a good smack lol\n- looking me straight in the eyes while touching my cheek or brushing my hair out of my face to tell me I look beautiful\n- complimenting how I look in clothes (ex. I was always very proud of my big butt and loved when he\u2019d say it looked really good in certain bottoms)\n- telling me I was sexy\n- being understanding and respectful of how I almost always wanted to keep my shirt on while we had sex and never wanted my belly touched, not even an accidental brushing of the hand \n\nFor damage control, you could maybe write her a little love note, leave a rose on top and maybe a little something else, like a candle or even a spa day certificate. Groupon is great for that btw. I say the note because then she can actually read it and really absorb what you\u2019re saying to her, without having to face you and the embarrassment she felt after what happened and it keeps her from using the reflex of deflecting any compliments. I would say something along the lines of:\n\n\u201cTo my beloved and beautiful wife,\n\n[Tell a brief version of the story of how you fell in love with her, like with the way she laughs at dad jokes or how caring she is for others, etc.] I am so sorry to have hurt your feelings, and I would do anything to take that back. I only wanted to express my attraction to you but I did not realize how my wording would affect you. I want nothing more than for you to feel about yourself exactly how I do, which is sexy and gorgeous and amazing. I do not in any way think you are \u2018fat\u2019 and it breaks my heart that you feel that way about yourself. You and your body did the most incredible thing by carrying and giving birth to two wonderful children, and every time I look at you that is what I see. An incredible mom whose body went through some changes to give life. I know you don\u2019t look the same as when we first got together, but you would be just as breathtaking no matter what size you may ever be. \n\nIf you feel like you want to get into better shape in order to feel more confident, I am 100% supportive of that. I just want you to understand that in no way do I think that you need to or that I would find you any more gorgeous than I already do right now. But I will do whatever I can to help you get to where you feel confident in your own skin. If you\u2019d like to work on improving our diets to be more nutritious, I will help research, go grocery shopping, and cook with you. If you want to start exercising or join a gym, I\u2019m happy to watch the kids while you do or even find a sitter if you\u2019d let me tag along. If you want to seek some guidance from a mental health professional on how to tackle this from the inside out, I will help in any way I can. Whatever you need from me is yours. If there are certain things you\u2019d like me to do differently that effect your self esteem, please communicate them to me so I can work on them for you. \n\nYou mean the world to me and I want you to feel happy with yourself and beautiful. I hope you can forgive me. \n\nAll my love, \nHusband\u201d\n\nYour wording is really important, so if anyone has constructive criticism or suggested edits for OP please feel free. I hope this helps \n\nEdit: I have read more of the other comments and I am disgusted by what some of these people are saying. If you have never felt what it is like to suffer with body image issues or an eating disorder, you can\u2019t give advice on this. She can\u2019t just \u201cget over it\u201d and she\u2019s not being immature or a \u201cprude\u201d, this poor woman has looked the same way her whole life and now suddenly feels gross in her own skin. It feels like your stomach is churning just from seeing yourself in a mirror or, god forbid, seeing yourself naked. *This is a mental health issue*. Anyone giving advice to do anything other than apologize and be understanding is utter crap. You have to understand that you\u2019re apologizing not for your intentions or even what you said, but apologizing for hurting her feelings and commenting on her body. ",
            "You did nothing wrong.",
            "Yes it's a self esteem issue. But you shouldn't be put on blast for trying to make her feel comfortable in her own body, and loving her for who she is. She's clearly gained weight (she had 2 kids for goodness sakes, it happens) and is upset about the natural changes occurring to her body. Coupled with the fact that she didn't view your comment as helping her feel or get back to what she considers her \"normal self\". \n\nI suggest post birth counseling or therapy to address these changes and let your wife express herself. You realized that she's changed, and you love her no matter what - shes having a hard time loving herself with the changes, for whatever reason. Get to the bottom of it in a healthy no pressure therapy setting. \nWishing you the best, you didnt fuck up. You were celebrating your wife and her new body, which you're attracted to!",
            "My dude, you didn't say anything wrong. She's got self esteem issues and making you pay for it. It looks to me like she thinks not being skinny is the end of her world and nothing you say or do to make her feel better can change the situation. She needs to fix her problems herself. ",
            "You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and she needs counseling.",
            "First, she is making you responsible for her feelings. This isn't helpful in any way. Second, she absolutely needs to STOP saying negative comments about her body. This is slowing building up in the background. Please get her to stop this. Even if it means correcting her every time she says these. It will be worth it in the long run. Last, you didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes it is better for the marriage to be the one to take the fall, but over time it's not sustainable. She needs to get real with herself and decide that if she doesn't like the way she looks, then just lose weight. She needs to understand that resisting that she thinks she's fat is only making her struggle worse. Getting mad at you for not telling her what she wants to hear is misguided. There doesn't need to be crying or emotions involved at all. It is good to have compassion for her, but your apology should be, \"I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings.\" Nothing more. She has to do the rest with your support. ",
            "Yeah I think you were being nice. I think she overreacted...and I\u2019m a women. Give her time I guess. Encourage her to join a yoga class or something light to get her back into the groove? Her low self esteem is going to hurt your relationship soon if she doesn\u2019t do something about it. Also, this is NOT your fault! Good luck! ",
            "I don't think you did or said anything wrong. I'd be flattered by what you said. She is acting very immature. She obviously isn't happy with her body and is responding to the extreme. Women's bodies change as we age and after we have babies. It seems like she isn't aware of this. She really needs to work on her self worth and self essteem issues or you'll never have lasting relationship. I don't really think there's anything else you can do, but appologize. Please don't beat yourself up. You don't deserve to be treated so unfairly.",

Your comment was amazing and of my husband said that to me, I would be glad!! For the sake of getting you too back on the same page you should apologize and tell her you didn't mean it in a negative way. But, again, you have nothing to apologize for...but to restore your connection maybe you should sit her down and address it in this way.",
            "It's her self-esteem. I don't think you actually said anything wrong, per se, it's just that she was already feeling self conscious about it and to her, it's like you've confirmed everything she was feeling.\n\nTo fix this, she just needs time and needs to feel comfortable in her own skin. How to go about that? It starts with her. If she'd feel happier and more confident smaller, then she needs to diet and exercise. If she cannot do that or doesn't have the will to or doesn't want to, then she needs to embrace the body she has now.",

I don\u2019t know how exactly to suggest some type of counseling for her and her body image issues.\nThe thing is, as a woman, I KNOW I have put on some weight but am comfortable with that. I don\u2019t walk around replying to compliments about my body with something snide and negative. Deep down I know that if I want to go back to being petite and thin, I have to change my diet and exercise a lot more than I do now.

Is it your fault she doesn't like her body?\n2. No?  Then why is she taking it out on you?\n\nIf your wife doesn't like the way she looks, she has two valid choices.  She can either change her weight, or she can accept herself the way she is.  It sounds like she's chosen a third option, which is to do neither of those things and instead just take out her lack of self esteem on her supportive husband.  See?  Asshole.\n\nYou can't change her weight, and you can't change how she feels about her weight.  What you can do is encourage her to choose option 1 or 2 and then support her in every way you can.\n\nIf she wants to get back in shape, you can help her out in so many ways.  Go out hiking together.  Download MyFitnessPal and count calories together.  Subscribe to /r/fitness and /r/loseit.  Don't bring junk food into the house.  Take the kids so she can go work out.

Tell her you want her to feel good about herself again, and ask her what she needs for that -- is it a spa day, is it time away from the kids to get back to exercising, is it changing the household food...?",

            "So I understand that alot of people do have issues with post pardon depression after pregnancy and body image issues,but she shouldn't be taking it out on you. The comment you made,in my opinion, is sweet. Curves are amazing and just because you have them doesn't mean you're fat. She's over reacting to the situation and I would follow everyone's advice and try to sit down and have a conversation with her. If she doesn't want to cooperate,and I know this will be fucked up, give her the same treatment. Act distant,change your routine, greet the boys first when you come home instead of her. She will notice right away and most likey get angry about it,when she confronts you tell her \"I tried to talk to you about what happened and you didn't want to. I'm just waiting for you to be ready to sort out our issues.\" And like I said I know this sounds dumb and it's only to be used as a last resort. This will give her  first hand experience and show her how she's being childish and she will probably break down and talk to you.  Constantly trying to get her attention and convince her that's not what you meant/ she's beautiful the way she is won't work because she's got it cemented and Gorrila glued into her head that you meant she's fat and it comfirms and every bad thought she thinks about herself. so she will constantly think you're just trying to make her feel better rather than being genuine. Cold shoulder treatmeamt can show her you're hurt by this to because she doesn't trust your word/ the fact she's blatantly ignoring you and avoiding you off of something said that's not even a big deal (yes it's a big deal to her, but she's over reacting). You don't think she's fat, you know how beautiful she is and you were complimenting her. Remember this should be used as a LAST RESORT and I'm not saying every relationship needs this at some point,but to me it seems like if she doesnt want to be a adult and sit down and have a conversation and ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOUR SIDE(this is importent)  and not disregard everything you say as a just a lie and a ploy to get her to feel better then she deserves a dose of her own medicine. I hope everything works out and she's willing to talk and listen to you.dont reward her childish behavior by saying you were in the wrong. After having children your body thickens up it's natural and that fact that she's as gorgeous to you now as she was then is a beautiful thing and you should not feel bad for aknowledging that and trying to express it. That ddoesntean you can't give her some candy or flower and say \"I'm sorry we had a misunderstanding can we please talk about this\" that shows you care for her,you k I why she's upset, but you want to explain why you said it and feel like you don't deserve this treatment. I 100% suggest that you take all the advice given by the other users before you use the cold shoulder advice. She's feeling very vulnerable right now so make sure you choose your words very carefully. Good luck!!

You can tell her as much as you want how beautiful she thinks she is, but at the end of the day it's her that has to see it that way. You can either go down the therapy route, or the weight loss route, or both. When I say weight loss route I don't mean telling her to lose weight, but continuing being a good husband and subtly making her life easier so it's something that she has time to do for herself. ",
            "I was among those expecting your comment to be much worse. I wish I could show your wife the things my ex said to me when I was 6 months postpartum so she can see how good she has it. Things said to me include \"you're fat,\" \"you're disgusting,\" \"I'm not attracted to you at all anymore,\" \"if you don't start losing weight our marriage is over,\" and \"where are you losing the weight from, your ass?\" He also worked on the road and was gone weeks/months at a time, so I was with our newborn completely by myself.\n\nHowever, every one is correct in saying that there is nothing you can do because this is her own issue. You should gently broach the topic, ask her what she needs from you and listen.",
            "I just wanted to comment to let you know that I don't feel like you said anything \"wrong\" and you shouldn't feel guilty or beat yourself up. I'm not saying to dismiss your wife's feelings or not try to comfort her, just that I hope you won't feel guilty.",
            "Everyone is saying counselling is in order but I think that asking her to go to counseling for this issue/ just bringing up counseling could also hurt her in the same way. Counseling is something that she needs to realize she needs. I'm assuming that now that you guys have 2 kids she hasn't had much time to herself especially in the athletic realm. I suggest offering to take care of the boys maybe 2-3 times a week for 1-1.5 hours just so she can get some exercising in. Exercise is good for the mind as much as it's good for the body. She is going to notice little changes in her body as she gets back into exercising and that's going to help her self esteem. Plus exercising just makes one happier in general. This is is just a nice gesture that you're doing for her and I think she'll appreciate it as well as help the problem at hand. Also this way you get some quality time with your children to yourself as well!",
            "I have been having that issue with people, (I am the fat girl lol), and well when you try so hard to assure her that she\u2019s beautiful by commenting on how amazing her body is (while she knows that she\u2019s overweight), it makes her more insecure as if her body is more visible when people give any comment about it (EVEN IF IT\u2019S A POSITIVE ONE). So well try to make it up for her by bringing her anything she loves (definitely not food), and try not to bring that topic up with her again. And well try to raise her self-esteem by commenting on how beautiful her facial features are. She needs to know that it\u2019s not all about the weight. ",
            "I don't think you should take quite so much responsibility for her reaction. I have body image issues too, so I have so much empathy for your wife, but in this case I think the kind of thing (which I have much first-hand experience with!) where someone says something they intend to be a compliment but it just hits the wrong button. I really couldn't hold *you* responsible for that.\n\nWere it me - and like I say I have plenty of issues of my own - I think the following things would be helpful:\n\n1. Tell her you're sorry that you upset her and reiterate that you actually meant it as a compliment and didn't mean that she was \"fat\"\n2. However, you understand that for her her feelings about her body have been really intense recently and you pushed a button you didn't mean to be pressed.\n3. You think it must be horrible for her to feel so awful about the way she looks and you understand that it's difficult for her to see how beautiful you find her.\n4. You don't want her to have to live with this unhappiness, you want to be able to work together as a team to help her find peace again. Her welfare is very important to you.\n5. Ask her what she thinks would be helpful for both of you to do to help her feel better?\n6. Lastly, although you understand she's acting out of really hard emotions, it's horrible for you to deal with the distance it creates. Instead of being aloof as she has been, which is hard for you, could she talk to you instead about the way she feels so you can work together and preserve the intimacy you value so much.\n\nBottom line - though this might not be strategically the best thing to say - this is her responsibility because there's going to be very, very little you can do. However, while she works on this, being on \"team her\" is really important, particularly emphasising that you care about how awful these feelings are for her. But **do not hide the fact this is hard for you too.** It's your right to talk about how it affects you, and it's also important she gets that feedback because I'm sure she doesn't want to hurt you either.",
            "Your wife just gave birth. Do you think she might be experiencing some stress related to that or even some postpartum depression?  Is she getting the support she needs to take care of herself physically and emotionally right now?  You need to talk to her in a healthy and supportive way about how she\u2019s doing and what she needs because clearly she\u2019s not doing ok right now.  Maybe she needs some more down time, maybe she needs some therapy. Maybe she needs to talk to you as a friend. You won\u2019t know until you open up the lines of communication. Don\u2019t wait for her to do it.   Don\u2019t forget you guys are a team.  If there is a problem it should be you two against the problem, not you two against each other. ",
            "You should apologize to her and tell her you didn\u2019t know she was feeling so down on herself and then ask what you can do to help. Perhaps you can watch the children while she goes to the gym. \n\nShe just had a baby a few months ago. Most people don\u2019t bounce back right after. She\u2019s taking care of child and a newborn that may be keeping her up all night. Hormones are crazy after birth and your sleep deprived as heck. It could also be PPD. I\u2019m betting she\u2019s stressed out and could use your helping and maybe you\u2019re not picking up on that. Are you giving her time to herself so she can do things for her own body? You might want to relax when you\u2019ve been at work all day, but if she\u2019s been with the kids all day, she probably wants a break too. \n\n",
            "As a woman who use to be super skinny, I\u2019m talking 105-115 lbs.. Once I had my daughter, I was up to 155 the day I went into labor. About 6 months down the road, I maintained a weight of 135-140 lbs. Honestly with the new trend of everyone being \u201cthic\u201d, I am in love and am confident with my curves. \n\nI think your wife just needs to be imbrace her thickness. ",
            "This story is ridiculous and so is your wife. Tell her to stop projecting her bs onto you. U give her a compliment, she flips cause she's insecure as hell and you're acting like you fucked up. Man wake up and quit treating your wife like she's a child.",
            "You say she has amazing curves and she flips out?\n\nNah bro, it's not you..its her.\n\nDon't feel guilty.",
            "Your wife is being ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with what you said. Hopefully she will pull out of her depression or else she is going to ruin your marriage with her vanity. ",
            "If your wife is giving you the cold shoulder when you complimented her curves, it's really her issue. "

        "selftext": "When we were dating and for most of our marriage (4 years) he has had short hair. It wasn\u2019t until covid that he started growing it out. \n\nNow, I actually like his long hair. I love it when he wears it down and it\u2019s clean. The problem is, he never wears it down and despite me trying to show him different things like conditioners and product and how to brush it, he\u2019s never had long hair so he\u2019s not used to the effort it takes to maintain. He doesn\u2019t seem interested in learning, either. He washes it with soap and sometimes goes days without washing it at all, so he transforms from Jason Momoa into Ed from 90 day fianc\u00e9 really quickly. It\u2019s always tied back into a greasy, stringy ponytail, and he wears it in a high pony which I hate because it makes him look like a cheerleader. He also uses my bright pink scrunchies and bows when we are around the house because it\u2019s convenient, and also because he thinks it\u2019s funny, but I don\u2019t find it attractive at all. I also don\u2019t want to use my brush and my hair ties anymore after he does just because his hair is so nasty. Imagine if Jojo siwa didn\u2019t wash her hair for five days. That\u2019s what I\u2019m married to. \n\nHow do I go about this? I don\u2019t really want to hurt his feelings, but the little hints I\u2019ve been dropping like trying to show him how to take care of his hair have not been working. I\u2019m starting to resent his total lack of effort into his appearance. It\u2019s  one thing to not comb your hair one day or just stay in your pajamas, but his hair is just straight up gross and I cannot take it anymore. \n\nTl;dr: husband grew out his hair when covid happened, has no interest in cutting it now that things are opening up, but refuses to take cake of his hair and I think it\u2019s gross. How do you confront a partner about their hygiene and appearance when they let themselves go?\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your suggestions. I don\u2019t have time to answer everyone individually tonight, but the consensus seems to be that the time for sparing feelings has passed and a blunt conversation is the best way to go. I\u2019m going to reread all your responses and put together what I want to say and give it a go. If it doesn\u2019t go well, then I\u2019ll take the advice of the one redditor who suggested I cut it off while he was sleeping.\n\nEdit #2: wow, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up like it did. calm down folks, I\u2019m not going to actually cut his hair while he\u2019s sleeping, that was a joke. I might spray it with dry shampoo though.",

            "When my boyfriend was growing out his hair (to the point that he looked like Jim Henson by the end of Quarantine), we had a similar problem. I just straight up said \"you need to use shampoo and conditioner, not soap. Soap will leave your hair full of residue. Shampoo and conditioner will make it feel like mine.\" And if his hair looks greasy, I was directly say \"babe i think you should probably wash your hair\". I feel like if you have a level of intimacy that you're married, you can be honest with him and be like \"hey your hair is dirty, lets fix it\" .\n\nOnce you've got him to properly clean it, then you can work on the styling. Maybe ask him to wear it down for sexy times? So he will associate that that hairstyle is something you really like and may be more motivated to try it out.\n\nYou gotta be prepared for the possibility that he just prefers the high ponytail, though. That could be his version of a woman's messy bun and I'd roll my eyes so hard if my boyfriend told me he wanted me to stop wearing my messy buns when I'm just hanging out in sweats because it's not attractive to him (this is separate from the hygiene thing of course). If that's the case, buy him his own brush and scrunchies, and present the scrunchies like a joke (\"hey since you like mine so much, here are some that will go better with your hair color\") and try to find some good hearted humor in his look.",
            "I guess you could just randomly dump some shampoo on his head, which would force him to then go and rinse it out. \n\nOr, you know, you could just be direct. \"Babe, I love you, but your hair is nasty and it's not attractive when you don't wash it for a week and I'm going to have to burn all my hair ties.\"",
            "[removed]",
            "Give me 20 bucks and I'll tell him. I'll call him a greasy meatball or something and give him the tough facts about proper hair maintenance. Tough love. It'll work, don't worry.",

            "I mean you married the guy. Just talk to him and tell him what you told us.\n\nIf you really can't have an honest conversation with your husband, then we've got waaaaaay bigger problems than hair lol.\n\nStop dropping hints, that's like never going to work for anything.",
            "Greasy hair stinks. Sebum collects on the scalp and traps bacteria making it smell really bad. That particular smell is a huge turnoff for many people. I bet his pillowcase and sheets are also greasy. Just level with him. \"Your hair isn't getting clean and it's getting oil all over my stuff when you use my brush and scrunchies and I can't use them unless they are washed. Besides, it stinks. Please wash your hair every 3 days or every other time you shower.\"",
            "Buy him his own black elastics, his own brush, the shampoo and conditioner you think he should use etc. Put it in a gift bag from the dollar store for when you present it to him, make it fun.\n\nIf he still doesn't get it show him the pictures of hot hair down Aquaman vs. greasy ponytail neckbeard.",
            "Well you mention the Jason Momoa thing, why not work that angle? I've grown my hair out since COVID and have been doing that hairstyle and it's exceedingly easy. He doesn't want to cut his hair so maybe try telling him about how styling it that way looks so sexy. And through that encourage him about shampoo and conditioner and some styling product.",
            "You have two separate problems. One is hygiene/him not having his own stuff and the other is you not digging the look. The first is a completely okay and important thing to address. The latter is a matter of personal preference.\n\nThe grease is an issue. It, as many have noted, can lead to hair loss and skin problems, some of which can ruin linens and furniture. It\u2019ll DEFINITELY make people judge him. \n\nAs far as the ponytail part\u2026I mean, you\u2019ve worn them, haven\u2019t you? There\u2019s a reason. Long hair in the face all the time is irritating. As much as you wouldn\u2019t want him to tell you what to wear or how to cut your hair, it goes the same for him. You can give positive reinforcement when he wears it the way you like, but the choice is his.\n\nHealth and wellness and social ostracism? Important to discuss. Don\u2019t like a sartorial choice? That\u2019s a different story.",
            "I was in a similar situation. Constantly greasy hair on men will lead to early thinning/balding as the oils block the follicles and prevent growth. For men it\u2019s ideal to have very dry hair. (Advice given to me by my hair dresser < three days ago)",
            "I got my partner to start taking better care of his hair (sorry if you read this babe) by buying him his own 2- in -1 shampoo and conditioner then I would play with his hair and tell him how I much I loved how soft it felt and I would brush it for him. Just be gentle and explain how you don't want to use your hair stuff anymore brush, scrunchies ect because they are gross or ask him to rinse them with hot water when he is done with them to get rid or the grease.",

            "I had a nasty long hair, my partner told how she really felt about it to me during our 1st year together, it didn\u2019t hurt my feelings, I was a bit ashamed of that and immediately fixed the situation (first took care, later decided to cut for other reasons). I don\u2019t even think about it anymore, and we have been 5+ years together now. \n\nJust be honest.",
            "I tell my fianc\u00e9 when his hair starts getting greasy or if he didn\u2019t wash it right, he appreciates it because his hair is so full and thick he sometimes can\u2019t tell if he cleaned it right, I have also pampered him and prepared a bath and washed his hair for him, helps him relax when his been having a stressful day/week.  \n \nYou can also be honest and tell him how you\u2019re not trying to be a d*ck but his hair is starting to get very greasy and how that can cause it to fall out/ get a receding hairline.  Greasy hair especially if it\u2019s hot can fall off.",
            "Just tell him. Be like - want to shower together? Already, defenses down. Then wash his hair. Have him wash yours. And then once you\u2019re out of the shower, compliment him when he wears it down. Touch his hair. Be like - it feels so clean and soft (or something like that). That\u2019s the healthiest way I can think of to hint but you might just have to get down and dirty and go - listen babe. I love your hair short or long. But I don\u2019t love it greasy. What do you think about washing it a bit more? I can help to begin with?",
            "Tell him exactly what you wrote here. You like the long hair, when it's properly cared for. But unkempt hair is the opposite of sexy.",
            "How does he not wash his hair in the shower?",
            "Separate haircare sets. He's not allowed to use your scrunchies. If he wants pink ones, he gets them himself.\n\nHair doesn't need daily washes, but if it's greasy, it's not clean. Soap can be very dehydrating and on a scalp, that might mean it produces more grease to combat. Getting him a decent shampoo he uses once a week or so could change that. Otherwise, you're not the boss of his hairstyles, only express your preferences but if he wants to be a cheerleader, he's going to be one.",
            "On the hygiene note, stop hinting and talk to him openly (and don't cut it off while he's sleeping...I hope that was a joke). On the attractiveness note, you gotta let it go. \n\nAsking him to not use your products because it's unhygienic (even if he DID take care of his hair, sharing that stuff isn't the wisest) is super valid without using \"this look isn't attractive\" to back up your request. It's not his job to make himself attractive to you at all times, but it is definitely necessary to respect your stuff and your shared space in terms of cleanliness.",
            "DON\u2019T cut his hair while he\u2019s sleeping! Even if communication doesn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a MAJOR breach of trust and is an abusive behavior, it can and will lead to an even worse issue in your relationship.",

Honestly, I would worry he\u2019s depressed, I couldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019s happy being unkempt, it\u2019s definitely a sign of being too sad when you stop basic hygiene.",
            "Could you take him to a salon and get a trim and style? He can then see how great it can look while getting some education on how to care for it. \nThis worked for my partner when he started growing his beard longer and he didn't quite know about styling and care.",

            "Honestly, you have no say in his appearance. You can make it clear what you prefer, but if he likes ponytails and scrunchies you can't control what he wears. Hygiene is a different matter. I guess just stop hinting and make it clear he should wash it more often",
            "Just tell him. He\u2019s your husband, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re telling a stranger that their hair is greasy. You should feel comfortable enough to tell him this, especially if you\u2019re married. Be nice about it, but be direct",
            "How about.. honey. You know I love you oodles and oodles. So I feel like I can be honest with you.

It smells so good. But also if he doesn\u2019t have that dye concern, he should just wash it more to be clean.",

            "Do you also have long hair? Maybe you could show him some tips and tricks on you or each other? Also could you maybe tell him it smells? Maybe that will trigger change better than looks since he likes that he looks silly but no one wants to stink (I hope)...\n\nAlso - your hints may just be coming off as jokes. I'm big on saying what you feel because hints are often easy to miss. You're married, hopefully you can be honest.",

I really hope that was said as a joke. \n\nShow him side by side pictures of Jason and Ed. Tell him this is how you look to me with clean hair and this is how you look when it gets greasy. If he doesn't take heed of the conversation you need to adjust to survive. Hide all your scrunchies and put simple black ponytail holders out so that those become what is convenient. Zip up and put away your brushes and leave his easily accessible.  Have sexy shower time with him and wash his hair while you're in there.

This can lead to people telling them to use shampoo and conditioner,  which makes the hair lose all shape and constantly dangle in their eyes.

Having long hair is not like having a beard, it requires more maintenance than just washing it out with soap every few days. Your hair is greasy and it's very noticeable. And it's causing a strain on our relationship on my side; I don't want to run my hair through your hair and I'm against you using my brushes and hair accessories when your hair is in that state (if he still says it's funny to him, make him aware of how serious this topic is right now). I find your dirty hair very unattractive in the short and long-term. Please work on healthy hair-maintenance for me and for your own hygiene.\"",
            "Just tell him? If he's your husband you must be pretty comfortable with him. If my husband has BO when he has been out working all day in the sun I just tell him he stinks and to get in the shower lol. I am autistic though so don't tend to mince my words. \n\nOr if you're not that comfortable, with my husband sometimes his bo smells like onion and I walk up to him smell him and say 'you been eating spaghetti bolognese' and he gets in the shower lol. Make it funny? \n\nAlso I have really long hair (nearly to my bum) and only wash it once a week which is adequate. I don't have greasy hair though, but if you ask any hairdresser most don't wash their hair more than twice a week.",

Just tell him straight-up what you want. It may feel rude to tell him that his hair is gross because it\u2019s greasy and it smells bad, but at least then he\u2019ll understand the actual problem.",

            "Be honest, and be direct. The long hair is lovely, but when it\u2019s unwashed he looks like he gets into fights on Internet forums over anime high schoolers. Also he can\u2019t keep using your hair care products if he gets them greasy and gross, that\u2019s just disrespectful. \n\nHonestly though? As someone who\u2019s had long(ish) hair their entire life, you don\u2019t *actually* need to wash it that often. I was down to once a week when I had it dyed, and now I\u2019m up to around 2x a week (I still take normal showers in between, obviously). \n\nDon\u2019t get it twisted, the transitional period was hellish and my hair got nasty af between washes for a little while. But after like two weeks going from washing it every day to washing it every 4 days, my scalp straight up stopped producing as much oil. I also stopped getting as many split ends and shedding as much hair, which was great. This was with regular shampoo and conditioner, though, and dry shampoo between washes when it got bad. Using bar soap on your head should be a crime.",
            "I have long hair and it took me a long time to get used to maintaining it. Give him time. He will start to get annoyed with all the knots and split ends. \n\nYou can also tell him that the greasy hair is not good for his scalp and he will end up with dandruff. That may spark some insecurities and make him clean it more.\n\nNow in regards of the ponytail, that's his choice not yours. If he likes it then let him wear it up. Just make sure it's clean.",

Unfortunately they closed down to move premises just before the pandemic and still haven't reopened so his hair is so dead at the ends and I'm genuinely worried about how much he's gonna lose if he doesn't go soon.\n\nI suggest just dragging your husband to the bathroom and washing his hair for him in the way it needs to be done.

I can tell you that I can go at least a week, or even two, without it being greasy or smelly or whatever (maybe having a lot of super thick hair helps).  It might take some time to get to that stage, but it's possible if you go about it right.  Personally, I've only ever been a once-a-week hair washer, so I can't tell you how, but some videos on youtube might help.

One trim and he was sold. He no longer had tangly masses to deal with, just smooth locs.\n\nInstead of telling him his high pony tail reminded me of a high school cheerleader (LOL), I went ahead and *showed* him how dramatically different a pony tail looks depending on where he put it on his head.
