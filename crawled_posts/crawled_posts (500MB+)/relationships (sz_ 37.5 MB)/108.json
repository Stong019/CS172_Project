Things didn't end up as well as I'd hoped but they weren't as bad as I feared so honestly I would call that a win.  Let's start with how I told Claire about not going to Christmas Eve.\n\nI basically told her what sarah8 said: \"Your dad's family isn't ready to accept you for who you are, and that is their loss. They are in denial, and they think that they can change you by not inviting you for Christmas. I'm sorry Claire. We both know you deserve better.\"  She didn't take it well.  She was heartbroken but I knew she would be no matter what.  That night we had ice cream and she just cried for a while and I comforted her.\n\nI researched a bit on the churches in our area and called a few to ask about their views on transgender people and found one that might work before I asked Claire if she wanted to go with me to a midnight mass.  She was grateful that I would go with her and we went to a nice mass that was not so religious that I felt uncomfortable, but religious enough for her to enjoy mass.  We will probably continue going there in the future.\n\nChristmas Day was good.  She invited one of her closest friends over for a while so that she wasn't the only teenager.  She loved her present from me.  I got her those fake gel insert breasts and some nice bras so she can feel more like a woman instead of a little kid.  Some of you might tell me she isn't old enough for a gift like that but I could tell it made her feel more comfortable in her own skin.\n\nThe bad part is that she's still hung up over her father not wanting to see her.  I learned recently that she emailed him or Facebook messaged him and begged him to at least come to our Christmas or come visit and she never got a reply.  Last week we went to her therapist and so far it didn't seem to help.  I think she's still in shock that someone she loves so much sees her as something that shouldn't exist.  We're still trying to work through it.  I contacted some of her aunts and uncles but they don't want to see her either.  It's upsetting but we will find a way.\n\nClaire also read some of your responses to my first post and she wanted to say thank you.  I wanted to thank you as well.  We're just going to send her father some research on trans people and hope he eventually sees the light.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Had a fun Christmas, made new traditions, but Claire is still heartbroken and upset over everything.",

            "Don't hold your breath on him changing his mind. This is something you both need to prepare for, that he may never come around. The sooner Claire can come to accept that as a possibility,  the sooner she can move on and deal with the loss of a father. He may surprise you but its more prudent to prepare for the worst, Claire's life for the foreseeable future will be hard enough as is due to the fact that public perception of transfolk hasn't quite caught up to the rest of LBGT. \n\nYou seem to be doing everything right, and I don't think Claire could have asked for a more supportive mother.  Good luck to both of you. ",

Most girls go through that phase around 13. She is more than old enough to feel like a lady. ;)\n\n>The bad part is that she's still hung up over her father not wanting to see her.\n\nThat's not an easy thing and it's going to take a lot of time to deal with that level of abandonment. It will take time but this may always hurt her. \n\nYou are a great mom. You are doing good. Stay by her, and see about a trans support group. It may help her.",

            "I work as a service provider for LGBTQ clients and you are really doing everything right. What your daughter needs is support for who she is and you are doing just that. \n\nUnfortunately, trans folks and especially trans women are treated with an incredible amount of contempt by many in society. Claire going to a therapist already is great so she can learn strategies and coping mechanisms to protect herself from hurt. However, like another commenter said, both her and you need to plan for her father and his family not ever accepting her. This is an unfortunate reality that many, many people in the queer community face. \n\nNothing comes over night, and Claire is going to be very hurt, but dealing with the grief of losing a parent in a constructive way will only help her in the long run. Some folks learn to forgive or empathize with family members where as some are less constructive and turn to anger. Ultimately, as a trans woman, Claire is certainly going to face similar or worse behaviours from fellow students, colleagues, and strangers. Learning to deal with this in a positive way is only going to make her that much stronger of a person. ",
            "You're a good mom who will stand up for her kid and do what's right and what's compassionate and loving.  I think Claire will be just fine as long as she has you.",
            "Claire is so lucky to have a mom like you!\n\nThe only suggestion I have is do what I've done and build new traditions, and look at certain friends as family.  I had a Friendsgiving this year and it was one of the best Thanksgivings I've ever had. Keep positive people around her and those that accept her, and she will be okay.  It'll always hurt how her dad is acting, always, but keep good and positive people around her, and she won't become jaded.\n\nNew Traditions are great things as they REALLY do help make holidays better.\n\nI hope her father and the family come around, but if not, at least she has you, and that's so much more than some trans people get.",
            "Realizing you're not loved by a parent can be so, so hard. I'm incredibly glad that she has you, and her friends, and her faith. It's an absolute tragedy that her dad helped build a person who's growing up so full of affection and idealism, only to turn his back on her when faced with the unexpected, but I hope she's able to fill up on so much love from those other sources that she'll one day be able to heal even if her dad never comes around.\n\nAlso:\n>I got her those fake gel insert breasts and some nice bras so she can feel more like a woman instead of a little kid. Some of you might tell me she isn't old enough for a gift like that...\n\nNah, she's 16! Most girls start trying on womanhood around there regardless of whether their parents are supportive open books or try to repress the hell out of 'em. Plenty of parents don't even like to think about their kids developing breasts, and it screws people up; having a mother who just flat-out hands her a pair of artificial boobs to try on for size can only be helpful!\n\nBest of luck to you both.",

            "You're a good mom, and I am sure Claire will appreciate what you did for her, especially as she gets older and reflects upon it.\n\nAs far as the dad's side of the family is concerned, hopefully they'll come around to Claire once they figure out it's not \"just a phase,\" but I wouldn't hold my breath.",

She needs friends she can commiserate with and are going through some of the same things.",

            "You're doing everything so right. (Even the bra + inserts, because if she's old enough for you to be buying her bras if she'd been cisgender, she's old enough for you to be buying her bras and inserts.)",

",
            "Honestly, she'll remain heartbroken for a long time. Perhaps, forever. \n\nI'm 35 years old, and the pain of my dad choosing another family over my siblings and I, over and over, has never gone away. \n\nIt's the support that gets me through it. My brother and sisters are tight, and we are each others parents, essentially. They are my rock, and I would die without them. \n\nSo, continue to be her \"rock\".

            "You're the best mom!\n\n\n\nI'm so sorry your sweet girl is going through this. She's, over all, being very brave in this situation. Rejection from a parent is the worst feeling and mentally broke me (and I'm sure many others). But she seems so strong and smart from what you've shared with us and I'm sure she will be fine. She has all of your support, as well as your family's. And now, she has a new church group to lean on, so that could help, too. \n\n\n\n\nAnd just remind her. Just because you share DNA with somebody, doesn't mean they are family. Just like if you're born with a penis doesn't mean you're a man. \n\n\nSeriously, though. Claire sounds amazing. Her father is missing out on having a wonderful child. But like you said--it's HIS loss. Claire isn't missing out on anything by not having somebody so hateful in her life. ",

No matter what happens with her father, as time passes one day your daughter is going to be so glad she has such a great mom to support her through everything.

You have no idea how much of a difference you will be making to her life.\nFrom one trans kid with a supportive parent to you, you are vital in her journey and in her staying mentally sound. \nIf you have any in your area, I'd also suggest support groups.

Those gifts, to your daughter, say all of the things she needs from you: \"I love you unconditionally, I accept who you are no matter what, you are beautiful, I support you, *you are a woman.

You two are a great team together.\n\nMy brother waited until he was almost 30 to transition (FtM), and our family found that his transition was a lot like winnowing grain. Those that remained after all the chaff blew away (because they disapproved, or were uncomfortable, or didn't know how to alter their own perceptions in order to accommodate that someone they knew for a long time had a new name and a different gender on his driver's license) were the real treasures. \n\nThose were the people who were invited to his wedding when he married his love. Those are the people who will be part of their children's lives when they start a family. Those are the people who are lucky enough to have him and his wonderful wife at their holiday tables and framed on their walls at home. \n\nClaire, if you read this, please know that your courage and your sweet spirit are gifts to the world. Your mother loves you so much, and you'll be loved by so many more people in your life, just because you're you. The rejection you experienced this Christmas is *not* a reflection on who you are or what you deserve. It's a product of bigotry and fear.  You're just as you should be.  \n\nThe hard lesson here is one that a lot of us learn later in life, unfortunately.  And that lesson is that not everyone we love is going to nurture and treat us well. Many of us go a bit longer before we realize that someone we love is toxic, or wants to change us, or that their love is conditional.  It's no less painful, but those rejections do steal a lot of our innocence and idealism, especially when they come from family. \n\nDon't let this crush you. Don't let this darken your spirit or make you bitter.  Put on your new boobies and march into 2016 feeling brave and beautiful and loved, because you are. ",

And he's a petty criminal who comes from a family of cold-hearted knuckle-draggers, too. Still, being rejected and abandoned on Christmas for being who you truly are is a deep and major blow. \nWild idea, is it possible to move to a new town as far away as possible from these people?

I know how hard it is for your child to have someone in their life who isn't supportive. And it's a terrible loss. But she will be okay. One day she will realize that she doesn't need her fathers approval. I normally wouldn't say that, as I know how hard it is for trans youth to deal with, but with a mom like you... I think she'll be able to get through this. I want to say thank you from all of the trans kids out there. My little brother will love to hear about this in the morning! ",

It's been about two years and we've seen each other basically once (for a funeral), which went awful.\n\nI am so jealous of Claire for having you as a mom. Sometimes family members never come around, sometimes it just takes a looooooong time. Try and focus on the positives, and I think Claire will pull through. You've given her a lot of advantages. \n\nOne of the things my therapist told me early on has really stuck with me. He said the biggest factor in how successful someone's transition is, is the support network they have around them. Even when my family dropped me, having my friends standing strong meant the world to me. Stay on her side and you'll both be fine, in time. ",

Most girls her age have developed by 16 so if it makes her feel more like herself who cares if it's not appropriate. (Which it's not)\n\n",

I bet Claire will grow up to be an amazing woman with a mom like you by her side. I'm rooting for both of you :) ",

            "My FtM son just recently came out to my parents. My mom is VERY religious and wasn't very supportive that first night she found out. But-- after a few weeks went by, my mom told me that she has found a way to make it \"ok\" in her head. \nShe says that once we (humans) are done with our physical bodies on this earth and we move on to our next life as spirits- spirit beings are genderless. She says the only reason god gave humans sex was so we could \"go forth and multiply\". She says since our spirits (souls?) are essentially genderless, that she's okay with my son, because in the end it won't matter anyway. Our physical bodies are only on the earth for such a short time, compared to the millennia of spirit beings... Or something like that. \nSo- that's how my mom has managed to find a way to accept it. I told her \"whatever works for you!\" \nMaybe your husband and his family can understand my moms point of view if suggested? ",
            "I know I'm letting the world know I'm a big jerk here, but I'm very uncomfortable around transgender people.  I don't know why.\n\nI want everyone everywhere to have a happy life, but I it's a very deep-seated thing and I don't know that I can change myself on this.  \n\n:(",

You are an inspiration to parents everywhere. We should all strive to be like you.",

It's hard, losing a dad, but the sooner you let her know that it is his decisions that make him lose her, not her own. And it is incredibly hard to realize that. I'm still trying to.

            "Thank goodness you are her mom! It's a damn shame that her father and his family are a bunch of transphobic morons. Hopefully at least her dad will realize that it's not bad to be trans, it just is. Sometimes people need some time to mourn what they expected for the person's future. I hope he comes around and realizes he didn't lose his child, that she is the same basic person she always was.\n\nI think your present is a great one and if she wants to do physical options like hormones, she's at the best age to do hormones. I have some trans friends that have opted not to do hormones and that's fine too. Everyone has to do what feels right for them. ",

Any good trans forums or social groups she can join or set up so her and other kids can feel accepted when they have to go through this with some family. ",
            "You're an amazing mom! And to your comment about people thinking she is too young for that type of present - forget anybody that is telling you that is wrong! When you're 16, I think your body/having the right size boobs/etc. is a majority of what a 16 year old is thinking of! I can imagine how pleased she much be with your present and it was definitely a wonderful idea!",

But I think you did an absolutely amazing job at being there for her and keeping her spirits up during the holidays. You sound like a wonderful mother. :)\nI sincerely hope that Claire is doing well and staying positive. She also sounds like a pretty fantastic person. Ya'll take care!",

And not to forget that she is also human.\nI hope your daughter transitions smoothly and I'd just like to say thank you. \nThank you for not only being an amazing mum, but for teaching your daughter that transitions will never matter in the eyes of the ones who love you, that no matter the changes those who love you for who you are will have your back and those who care for you will always want nothing more than the best for you.\nContinue being a great mother.

There are, unfortunately, a lot of people out there who hate TGs with a passion. I can't speak on the subject, because I don't know one, but I know I wouldn't hate them for what sex they feel they are. Yes, it's awkward, but her \"father\" is a special kind of *expletive*.

I'm even more extremely grateful to have this core group that I've grown up with for most of my life that stays mostly separate from the rest of the circles because it gives me the chance to speak *in confidence* about other people without any bias in the opinions that they give to me.\n\nRecently I found out that said closer circle of friends had been playing pranks on me for the greater part of this year, and had been getting a kick out of watching my frustration with new friends I had made this year decide to cut contact with me. I only found out as in a group chat I'm in someone accidentally referenced an event I had not told them about in a way that could only be described as them being orchestrators behind the drama.\n\nTurns out this insider knowledge came from my closest friend who had been actively reading my messages on numerous social media on my devices and with the help of the others in the group, began thinking and acting out ways to subtly mess with these newly-formed friendships and relationships.\n\nThey've told me that they only went after specific people that they deemed that my relationships with them won't last, and I had to agree to disagree because it was as a result of their interference with them that they didn't. And it hurts me deeply because I tried to be a more open person this year and I wanted these new relationships I made to work but negative experience after negative experience led me to returning to being defensive and overly-cautious with making genuine lasting friendships and relationships.\n\nI'm not sure how I'm to make a decision to address this.

They 'deemed the relationships won't last'? Of course they didn't once they interfered! They betrayed your trust in them by messing with your life and from the sounds of it, snooping through your phone as well. They show no remorse from what you've said, and their behaviour is that of people who feel superior to you because they think they know better than you do.\n\nI would cut them off and move on.

I can ALMOST see pulling a prank and at the end fessing up for all to have a laugh about it, but this shit is dark man. These people aren't your friends; you're their guinea pig. \n\nEither they're jealous and want to keep you for themselves, which is unhealthy and untenable, or they're purely malicious and don't give a fuck about you, which is also unhealthy and untenable. \n\nTime to move on; maybe you can reach out to these spurned friends and explain to them what happened?

We all survived different colleges and remained tight. But sooner or later, when you're dealing with toxic people, everything falls apart. I learned this lesson the hard way and had to cut all my friends out in my early 30's. Starting over is hard and as an adult making new friends seems impossible. Making new friends is difficult enough with out your so called friends sabotaging you. Cutting them out will be painful, it will be lonely and it will mess with your head. But it's still better in the end.

        "selftext": "[First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3swbe5/i_just_realized_that_20f_have_a_twin_brother_that/).\n\nLots have happened in the past few days. I'd like to thank all of you who helped me and gave me different opinions, especially those of you who shared personal experiences. Quick summary: My mom confessed that I have a twin brother who she gave away for adoption shortly after we were born because she was alone and didn't have the means to take care of two kids.\n\nFirst about my mom. I talked to her at length about how I feel and told her everything that I felt. That I understood the situation she was in and how this was the most difficult decision of life, how it's easy to blame her for it but that she did what she thought was right, and how I really don't blame her for doing it or for not telling me, but I would have preferred if she had told me sooner. She asked if I would forgive her? I said even though there's nothing to forgive but yes. To be honest she's at ease now, more than she's ever been. She told me a few times that now she feels unburdened, which I'm happy for her. For all the problems that we had she always took care of me to the best of her abilities and I know nobody loves me in the world more than she does.\n\nAbout my brother, I decided to contact his parents, reach out and ask whether they have told him, what they think about this whole thing and how they want to go forward. I know we are 20 and I didn't have to contact them, but I thought reaching out to them was the best idea. I don't want to create a mess in my brother's life, in case he doesn't know. So I found his mom on Facebook and sent a message, mostly what /u/jpallan suggested in the previous thread. I explained who I am, that was just informed of the whole thing, that I'm interested in getting to know my brother, etc. I left my phone number too.\n\nShe called me a few hours later and asked how I was doing, she was really friendly and asked if we can meet to talk. We arranged a meeting for the next day (yesterday), in my town even though I was willing to go there but she insisted.\n\nSo we met at a caf\u00e9. I was very stressed and really didn't know how it was going to go. I couldn't have guessed. She was very friendly and nice. When we started talking she was just looking at me. She told me that I have my brother's eye and hair color, our eyes are the same color, my fingersnails look exactly like his, that I smile like him. Honestly it was getting a little strange. She had tear in her eyes and cried a few times. She told me about how she wanted to adopt both of us but my mom couldn't go through with it, how she had gotten attached to me for the few times that she had met be before my mom decided not to put me for adoption. She explained how she decided to adopt another girl instead for years but none of them felt right as she couldn't replace the feelings that she had for me. I was really surprised by all of it.\n\nSo my brother does know that he is adopted, but doesn't know about me. She said they planned to tell him on when he became 21 but she thinks he is ready to know. She asked me to give her a week or so and allow them to tell him everything and then we can meet. She had brought a USB drive full of pictures and videos from his childhood until now for me to see. We took a few pictures there for her to show him when they tell him about me. \n\nLast night my mom and I went through all the pictures and videos, my mom was crying all the time. She was very sad but she also had some happiness because in all those pictures and videos it seems like he is happy and has a very good family who love him very much. I really hope this helps her overcome her sadness and feelings of guilt and regret.\n\nSo that's the progress. I'm waiting for her to contact me. \n   \n**tl;dr**: I told my mom that I don't blame her for anything and she shouldn't feel guilty. I met with my brother's parents and it went well. He knows he is adopted but doesn't know about me. They wanted to tell him and hopefully we will have the opportunity to meet and get to know each other after that.",

            "It sounds like she really cares for you as well. I truly hope you develop and great relationship with your brother and his mom. I am so glad your mom is unburdened too. Best of luck!",
            "just airing on the side of caution, and this may be a bit indelicate, but what are both you and your brother's economic backgrounds. you mentioned you had some struggles growing up, is your brother in an affluent family. \n\nim only asking because if he is, your mother may fall into the trap of thinking that he's had a better 'opportunity' and maybe you would've been better being adopted as well. im not saying that this will happen, but it may, especially with seeing all those pictures and videos of the way he grew up, she may begin to resent herself for keeping you from that same opportunity. \n\nmaybe keep an eye out for this and respond how you feel appropriate, should you need to.\n\ni just have this uneasy feeling that the focus of this event will be on this other family meeting 'the son that got away', so to speak. please make sure that your mother is a part of this every step of the way, that means not just keeping her apprised of the situation but a part of the situation itself.",
            "While I doubt it will happen you may want to be aware that as great as all this is going there's the chance that he might have resentment with your mother/his biological mother for having given him away and depriving him of his sister.",

            "I fucking shouldn't have read this thread. Now I gotta hide my eyes from my coworkers for a bit",
            "It's going to be much tougher on your brother I think when he finds out.  The question that immediately springs to mind is, why was it him and not you that was given away?  I think it might take some time to reconcile this, as well as his inevitably wanting to meet his bio mom.  Definitely give him time and space to process this after his adopted parents lay it on him.  He might need a few weeks or more to digest everything.  ",

        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6p3gsf/i_19f_am_being_excluded_from_our_gaming_group_i/\n\nThank you everyone for all the advice! And thank you to those that also offered to play with me. I wasn't expecting my post to get so many replies. Unfortunately, I had some unrelated family business, so I couldn't respond to you all. However, I have read everything and have taken all your words into consideration. Some people have also asked me questions about how we can play so often, how long I've been with my boyfriend, etc., so I'll just give a brief background (skip to the next line if you don\u2019t want to read it). \n\nFirst off, most of us are college students [18/20], either working part time or staying at home with our parents. As of right now, most of us are on summer break. We only have two older members in the group, which are R [25/M] and another guy [23/M]. The rest of us are or fall under 20. R is actually married and his wife makes good bank, so he has a ton of free time. \n\nSecond, about my boyfriend. Surprisingly we met through the gaming group, as he was the one who advertised it, which was how I found and joined the group. That was about 2 years ago, and about a couple of months after we met, we just clicked and started dating. My boyfriend has known R for about 3 years, so they're close friends. However, R did not join the group until 6 months ago, as my boyfriend invited him because he thought it'd be fun to have him there too. I did not know much of R, other than that he was my boyfriend's friend, until he joined the group.\n\n  ---   \nSo, after I posted my original post, I signed up for 2 different groups. The first one was an all-women\u2019s group [16-20F]. They responded to me pretty quickly. They were very nice and polite, but explained that they only play once/twice a week. Unfortunately, that didn't cut it for me. The second group responded to me the next day, and I learned that they were more active but that they're also an all-men\u2019s group [17-19M]. However, they were open to having me there. At first, I felt pretty sketched, but the oldest and most popular guy [19/M] there took me aside and explained to me that he does not tolerate any type of harassment and that he will definitely kick out any of the other guys if they were bothering me. Hearing that made me feel more comfortable and I played some games with them. I had so much fun! All the guys were really nice and friendly. No sexual remarks, no more screaming of profanity against women, etc.. It was nice being in a group of people who were happy to play with me.\n\nAfter I finished my games and left, my boyfriend called and asked if we could talk. When he came over, before I could even ask or speak myself, he told me he was really sorry and that he screwed up big time, and he understands how wrong he was. He said he didn't want me to go to a new group because he feared that I would leave him too for some new guy. Then he told me that he didn't realize how hurt I was from being excluded from the group because I had never complained or voiced against it, which was true. I never complained about the exclusions, or even R\u2019s behavior before, because I knew it would just cause more conflict. I also didn't want my boyfriend to stop playing with his friends because of me. I explained this to him, and he said he was sorry for not defending and comforting me like he should have been in the first place. \n\nTo my surprise, he then showed me his text messages between him and R that happened a few months ago. Apparently, way before my exclusion, R had a few conversations with my boyfriend, telling him how much of a pain it was to play with me there. He wanted my boyfriend to kick me out. However, my boyfriend refused and told R that was not happening. Then, around the time when I decided to stop hanging out around R, that's when R sent a group text to everyone in the group explaining how he doesn't want to play with the group again, and he hopes everyone understands. Everyone, and to my shock, even my best friend, all agreed with him. Only my boyfriend protested, but R was really stubborn and he had the whole group to support him, so my boyfriend gave up. After showing me those texts, he told me next that he kicked R from their group earlier today. R was not allowed to play with them anymore, but my boyfriend said he'd still be willing my play with R one on one, but only like once a month. Surprisingly, R agreed, and that was that. My boyfriend said he understood if I didn't want to be with him anymore, but said that he truly does love me.\n\nHonestly, even after all that has happened, I'm not mad at my boyfriend. This is both of ours first relationship, and we\u2019re still learning. He's always been kind to me and I\u2019ve never had a problem with him before this situation occurred.  I feel happy that he realized his mistakes and did apologize without me asking. This is the first time he's ever come across a situation where he has no choice but to choose a side, so I don't blame him for trying to do anything to keep the group together. He told me he would also like me to come back to our old group, but he said it's completely fine if I stay with my new group. He knows it was wrong of him to ask me not to join a new group. I told him I don't think I'll ever come back to the old group and that I will definitely be sticking with my new group from now on. However, I will always make time for him and put him first. He accepted it without any protest, and we went back to our usual fun activities. \n\nI feel bad that my boyfriend may have lost a close friend since I never asked him to do any of that for me. Regardless, I am happy, and lately my boyfriend and I have been spending more time together now that R isn't around as much. I have also continued playing with my new group and it's been awesome. If you've made it this far, thanks for reading this long update! Sorry for the ramble and mistakes, my mind is all over the place right now and I wanted to explain as much as I could. Thank you guys once again!\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend apologized for everything and kicked R out of his gaming group. I will continue to play with my new group and boyfriend is ok with it now. Things are better.",

And, aside from your boyfriend's initial reaction, you both handled this pretty well. Good luck with your new group and with your boyfriend :)",
            "Glad it worked out. I'm confused by the \"R texted the group\" bit though. R wasn't going to play with the group, the group agreed, then your boyfriend kicked him out. \n\nWhat did I read wrong?",
            "OP, I hope you are reconsidering your relationship with your \"best friend,\" who had you kicked from the group.",
            "I think you handled this situation fairly well and I think both you and your boyfriend learned a lot from it.  Sticking with the new group is a fantastic idea, and they sound like a lovely bunch!  Though I think I big take-away from this is learning when to tell someone that something is happening or that whatever is happening is making *you* feel uncomfortable.  When I was your age, I rarely spoke up when I should have because I didn't want to cause conflict; but sometimes not saying anything makes the situation worse.\n\nMy own two cents on this, I don't think it's appropriate for your boyfriend to still be playing with someone who was so aggressive especially to you.  A whole other issue, but your boyfriend is responsible for himself and his choices.  If R does become an issue again in the future, let boyfriend know.  You got this :)",
            "I just wanted so say kudos to you for standing by your decision to stop talking to R. Even after to pressure from your BF. I've definitely been in your shoes and the pressure to apologize to types like R from the friend circle are insane. Sadly it seems all to common in nerider circles.\n\nI still think it's shitty that he''s willing to hang out with R. The dude has clearly talked a lot of shit about you in front of and behind your back. It sucks he doesn't see any problem with spending time with someone like that.",
            ">R was not allowed to play with them anymore, but my boyfriend said he'd still be willing my play with R one on one, but only like once a month. \n\nI raised my eyebrow a little bit at this. If your BF can continue to maintain boundaries with R, that's great. But I think he might also benefit from reading up on geek social fallacies (just Google \"geek social fallacies\" and you should get some good results).  Good luck to both of you.",
            "You know, your boyfriend did screw up, but he did seem to make amends and handle it well afterwards so that does say something about his character. Hopefully this can be a lesson on communication and boundaries for the future.\n\nI'm also glad you found a new group and that you fit well with them. It looks like everything worked out!",
            "I don't think it's appropriate for your BF to still hangout with R. R was wildly rude towards you and had the whole group turn on you, including your BF before he came to his senses. R is 25 years old and should know by now his behavior is awful. I wouldn't be surprised if R was still looking to cause trouble between you and your BF just out of weird revenge. ",
            "so your boyfriend is going to remain friends with, and keep playing with, the misogynist man who led a campaign of subterfuge against you and tried to get you kicked out of your friend group.\n\nwow.",
            "Ok so the ending is kinda happy but there is some stuff buried here that should be making you uneasy. Your boyfriend says that he was upset at you doing something on your own because he was worried you'd leave him. This is a huge flag to be aware of.",
            "Be careful: your boyfriend got his shit together out of fear of losing you, not necessarily actually having his shit together.\n\nBut he's going down the right path.\n\nYou two are together because you enjoy each other's company. You are not a prize to be won or awarded. You are a human being with the agency of choice and with interests and hobbies.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "Yay OP! It's good that your boyfriend apologized and fixed things of his own accord. Your last post had me thinking he was sketchy, but you guys are young and people our age are still learning how to handle these situations. \n\nI like playing with guys honestly, and our group is incredibly inappropriate and idiotic... but not misogynistic, if you can believe that lol. I hope you enjoy your new group! There are definitely guys out there who aren't cool with making their friends uncomfortable, regardless of gender. :D <3",

            "Reading this it sounds like you were struggling to find the right group of people to play esports or MMOs with, yes? It doesn't read as online table top gaming. \n\nI really want to say good on you learning early to stand up to an environment that you don't enjoy. \n\nI'm really sorry about your friends, or \"friends\". I hope this new group helps you build some healthy friendships. \n\nNot every couple plays well together. Your boyfriend seems stressed about the idea of you playing without him, and you playing often seems important to you. Yet, not enough to make sure you got to play. \n\nHonestly, the fact that you got left out so often, but they sited not wanting to play with you, for personality or skill reasons is shitty. I've found that most anyone unless they're utterly toxic or pants on head stupid gets better with time. Even the pants on head stupid gets better with time and the rest of the people become real friends or people you wind up enjoying time around. (Unlike your boyfriend's friend.) Im not saying you can always force friendship, but in gaming communities, keeping you away did you no help. \n\nYou should have been told or included. Not held in middle ground until you decided to leave on your own. \n\nIf you're not returning to your boyfriend's group, don't be shocked when his friend returns in a few weeks. If this happens, maybe consider if your boyfriend really supports you. ",

        "selftext": "[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/32m5lj/i_22m_just_walked_in_on_my_girlfriend_21f_of_7/)\n\nFirst, I want to thank everybody for the help and many kind words that were sent my way. Seriously, thank you.\n\nI'll start with what happened afterwards, and work my way up to today, and that's the only reason that I'm making an update only a week later.\n\nEmily (my best friend's sister), texted both of them informing them informing that I'd be coming by to get stuff (Emily would be going to my ex-SO's). I went with my best friend (Trevor) and Emily to get some stuff from my apartment, my roommate wasn't there, but he left me a note saying that he's sorry, and attempting to explain the situation. I threw it away (after reading it), grabbed some stuff and loaded it into my car. I drove back to their house while the two of them then went to my ex's apartment to grab my stuff.\n\nMy ex was there and at first, she wouldn't let them in. She yelled at them to go away through the door, and after about 15 minutes of them sitting there, she eventually opened up and let them in to collect my things. They grabbed my PS4, movies, cookware, clothes and some random other things. She cried the whole time and asked them if they would tell me that \"she's sorry\", \"it was a one time thing\", \"I would do anything to change it.\" They didn't say a word, although she was crying into an older hoodie of mine, so they left that there. I'm not too torn up about that.\n\nI told a few select friends what happened, and asked if they would watch the doors to my classroom when I had classes as I didn't want to cause a scene. Nothing on Wednesday, but she stood outside one of my teaching classes on Thursday. I went in through a different door, and thankfully she didn't see me.\n\nFriday is the day that really upsets me. As I said in the last post (in a reply), I'm an Education Major and I have my practicums this semester. Our Education building has two floors, and the 1st floor is a laboratory school (an elementary school that has a lot of Education students come in and do their practicums, or observations), while the 2nd floor has classrooms for Education students.\n\nMy practicum is with 3rd graders, and she stood OUTSIDE the door to my 3rd grade classroom waiting for me (we have name tags, and only have to show those to the desk to get in). She used to be an education major, but switched majors, therefore it wasn't too uncommon for her to be in there. I saw her and my heart immediately sank. I decided to just walk by her and ignore her. She saw me and started crying and trying to talk to me. I didn't say a word, but just walked into the classroom. My cooperating teacher asked her to leave, but all my students that were there had already seen it. They started bombarding me with questions, but I just stuck with, \"It's nothing important right now. We can talk about it later, but we need to focus on our learning right now.\" But honestly, it killed me inside. I explained the situation to my cooperating teacher, and asked her to watch out for if she came back again. She said that she would and would ask her to leave if she saw her again.\n\nI received a few text messages this weekend from her (and her roommate - that was extremely annoying), I got an insane amount of phone calls, and I got a ton of Facebook messages. Trevor and Emily also received quite a few as well. I worked all weekend, and threw myself into lesson plans and projects due. I also went and played a round of golf with some friends.\n\nToday is really why I'm updating. I got a text from my ex at around 7.15p. She told me that she was pregnant and that it was mine. I screenshotted the conversation. I'm trying to stay calm, but if she truly is pregnant (and the baby is mine), then that throws a whole wrench into everything.\n\nCan anybody give me some advice on what to do next? I'm trying to remain as calm as I can, but this is really big and I'm starting to freak out.\n\nThank you all!\n\nHere's the text conversation:\n\n*Her: I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry that I messed up our future, but I think that we just got a second chance. I know that this isn't what you wanted to hear, but I'm pregnant. Maybe this is why I made my mistake.*\n\n*Me: You can't use a pregnancy to explain cheating, it doesn't work like that. I want a pregnancy test. Not one from the store, but to actually go to the doctor and have them do that. If it turns out that you are pregnant, then I want a paternity test.*\n\n*Her: Fine. I'll call the doctor tomorrow and set up an appointment. But if I am pregnant, can we have a second chance?*\n\n*Me: No. All I want to know from you is when and where the appointment is.*\n\nShe seems to calm for this to this to just be a joke. She's been bat-shit crazy for almost the past week, and now she's extremely calm. I'm honestly extremely scared.\n\n**tl;dr: Ex-SO waits outside my classroom for me and says that she's pregnant. What do I do next?**",

            "It's pretty simple. \n\nText her and ask when the doctors appointment to confirm is. Offer to meet her at the office and you can both be there for the doctor to give a test. I stress. You will meet her at the office.

If she is and decides to keep it, be the best father you can but don't let her suck you back in.\n\nIf she is pregnant that doesn't make you obligated to be in a relationship with her. Also get a DNA test before signing the birth certificate ",
            "Look at what you know. Make each piece of information a bit of data. Then plot all of that data onto a graph where the horizontal line is time elapsed and the vertical line is extremeness level of her behavior, where the two lines meet is the moment you walked in on her and your roommate having sex (in what was most DEFINITELY not their first time). \n\nI am sure if you did this you would notice that overall she has been escalating her behavior: initially she locked your friends out for 15 minutes then lets them in, then she stands outside your class building, then she stands outside your classroom, etc. All the while you stay firm and consistent and do not acknowledge her or give her the relief that she wants (and just getting to talk to you for a second will relieve some pressure from her no doubt about it). Finally she tells you something that she knows you are going to have to respond too...\n\n**Do not trust her!**\n\nTell Trevor and Emily the new development and let them be your liaison. There are plenty of ways she can verify the pregnancy in an objective way that will likely put the proof to her lie when she refuses (say wont piss on the stick in front of Emily for example or wont get a blood test). If on the off chance she is telling the truth, then your next move should be to get a Prenatal DNA test performed to determine the paternity of the child. You honestly cannot say with any confidence the child is yours -- you were not the only one who was sleeping with her at the time of conception. And as I said above, it is very unlikely that you just so happened to walk in the one time that happened. \n\nShe is trying to manipulate you because she is in free-fall and you are not moving to catch her. She is trying to become the victim, first by elaborate displays of remorse and finally by likely inventing some story to try to get you to give in to her.\n\nKeep your wits about you like you have this whole time. Do not be reactionary about this news. I would suggest continuing to maintain no contact until the paternity test is performed (probably will never get that far as I said).\n\nAgain, I am sorry for your situation. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other.",
            "Ask for pregnancy test to be done at a doctors office, don't trust any piss test, she might be just altering the results in a bid to hook you back in. If the doctor administered test comes out negative then you're in the clear and tell her to fuck off. If it comes out positive then consult with the doctor pertaining to when DNa testing for an unborn fetus can be done safely, while you wait for the dna testing, do not support or even remotely do anything that could be seen as you being a father figure, do not sign anything, and please consult a lawyer. After DNA testing is done, if the baby isn't yours then tell her to fuck off, if it's yours then continue consulting your lawyer to arrange for your child rights and to protect your finances and assets.",

            "I would recommend that you bring Trevor and/or Emily with you to this meeting as a buffer. More than likely she's using this as a way to get you to show up and talk to her, and if it appears that she's just trying to convince you to get back together with her, have Trevor/Emily stay and leave the premises. \n\nI assume you trust them to make sure the doctor gives her a test and confirms her pregnancy. The odds of her being pregnant are SERIOUSLY SERIOUSLY low. I just would worry that this is her setting up an \"ambush\" for you to try and corner you into listening to her bullshit justifications for being a fucking terrible person.\n\nETA: Also, the fact that she is SUPER CALM should be evidence that this is a lie, not that this is real. If this was real, she would be equally emotional about it - I mean, put yourself in her shoes if you can. There's NO WAY that she'd be handling this calmly if it was true. Probably she just sat down and thought, \"how can I emotionally blackmail him into talking to me? What's the one thing he can't say no to?\" and then came up with this ploy.",

On the one day you happened to come home early, what are the odds! \n\n/s\n\nAs for advice, on the slim chance she isn't making this up (I know you seem to think otherwise but given everything else she's done since it doesn't seem that much of a stretch imo) I'd say you need to make it as abundantly clear as possible that a baby will never be grounds for reconciliation. Under the circumstances, unless she's particularly pro-life, it seems highly unlikely she'd want to be a single mother, and obviously it wouldn't be fair to the child to just be leverage to make up for her fuck ups.\n\nedit: format.",
            "She said she's pregnant, and then in the next message \"IF I am pregnant\"?  She's not pregnant.  \n\nAnd it wasn't a mistake.  A mistake is, like, losing track of time and not calling to say you'll be late.  Fucking someone else is being a shitty human being.",
            "Damn if she really is pregnant and its yours what are you going to do? I think youre handling this situation like a champ btw, not too many people can do the no contact and I applaud you. \n\nHopefully she's not just saying she's pregnant to get you to talk to her which is totally plausible since she's desperate.

            "The best piece of advice in this thread is NOT go with her to that appointment and to send one of your other best friends instead. You want to know why she was calm? Because you broke the no contact and are actually talking to her! You need to stop responding to her and let your friends take over again. Ask them to text her and set-up a  time for them to go get her tested.",
            "I would start by getting confirmation that she is pregnant. Start small and request a text photograph of a pregnancy test (others are saying it will take awhile, but I would still request this now). If she produces a photograph of what appears to be a test showing she is pregnant, I would ask her to meet you to take another test, and bring a female friend. Explain to your ex that you will not discuss anything and that you are simply there to observe the results. Tell her you will bring the test so you know it has not been tampered with. Do not break, do not discuss anything else.\n\nIf the test is positive, request a paternity test in writing. If it turns out she is pregnant with your child, it will be very rough, but you will need to discuss these things with her. Doubtful she is pregnant. Good luck. ",
            "You may also be able to shake her loose by telling her being pregnant has no affect on your relationship. If the kid is yours, you will be a father to it, but you will never get back together with her. Might save you some trouble. ",

            "If she's stressed about the break up, I imagine she'd be too distracted to notice her period a couple days late. Or at the very least, she would know high stress throws off a period, and she'd wait a couple days before rushing to take a test. And if the period has already been late a few weeks, it's even more fucked up that her thought process is, \"Damn, I could be/am pregnant. I guess I'll just bang my bf's roommate on a couch for the first time.\"",
            "> She seems to calm for this to this to just be a joke. She's been bat-shit crazy for almost the past week, and now she's extremely calm. \n\n\nHer most telling point is how rehearsed she sounds and the big \"But if I'm pregnant, can we have a second chance?\" Yeah, she's calm because she practiced this and knows you can't ignore this, she's basically found the one guaranteed way of talking to you. If she's really crazy, she's been trying to get pregnant this whole time because you can't take a paternity test for a couple of months and thats a few months she has to 'win you back' via forced interaction. If she is pregnant, don't believe for a second that its yours, and don't interact with her at all until you can get a paternity test.\n\nIf she's only semi crazy she's probably looking up ways to fake an in-office pregnancy test. ",
            "I hate to sound like a broken record but your next move is pretty much what everyone else is saying it should be. \n\nAs others have said, I'm almost positive that she is not pregnant and she is just throwing this out there as an excuse to get you to talk to her. But in the meantime, meet her at the doctor's office. Don't talk about anything other than the pregnancy. No apologies, no reminiscing, no arguing. Engaging in any of those conversations is a very easy way to get manipulated back into the relationship.\n\nIf she is pregnant don't do anything until you know if the baby is yours. It may seem cruel, but you can't act like a father or sign your name on any documents that would imply you've assumed responsibility for the child. In some states simply signing the birth certificate makes you responsible for the child and thus, responsible for paying child support (if it ever comes to that) regardless of paternity. So it is very important that you keep your distance from her until you know the results of the paternity test. But, I seriously doubt it will get that far. \n\nI actually knew a girl who used the \"I'm pregnant\" excuse to get her ex (a good friend of mine) to stay. When he started pressing her for proof of the pregnancy she claimed she miscarried. He felt so guilty he stayed with her longer than he should have. So beware of this kind of manipulation as well. That is why it is so important for you to first and foremost find out if she is pregnant at all. This woman is obviously very manipulative and I wouldn't put it past her to claim she had a miscarriage when backed into a corner. \n\nGood luck. ",
            "The old pregnancy trick.... The fact that she specifically said \"if\" has me thinking its a ploy to \"win\" you back.  What I would do is drop all communication no doctor office visit.
