My oldest daughter and youngest stepdaughter don\u2019t really like each other anymore. They\u2019re barely civil, and they completely ignore each other unless they\u2019re forced to interact.\n\nSarah is struggling financially. It\u2019s partly due to the pandemic but mostly due to her husband and his lack of work ethic or financial sense. He spends money faster than they earn it and we\u2019ve bailed them out multiple times already. The pandemic has hit me hard financially so I\u2019m no longer in a position to help them. \n\nOn the other hand, Annie is married to a wealthy man and has generously been helping everyone (excluding Sarah) financially for the past year.\n\nAnnie invited my wife and me to join her family at her in-law\u2019s holiday home. She offered to cover all of our expenses and my wife missed her a lot, so we agreed to go. We didn\u2019t really think about how it would make Sarah feel.\n\nSarah found out about the trip and is now furious at me. She thinks I\u2019m lying about not having money to help her and doesn\u2019t believe Annie would pay for it. She is refusing to speak to me and has told Suzie she feels like I replaced them with my stepdaughters. \n\nI would really like to fix this, but she continues to ignore any attempt by me to get into contact with her.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 I went on a trip to visit my stepdaughter, she covered all of our expenses but my oldest daughter, who is struggling financially,  doesn\u2019t believe me and is now refusing to speak to me.",

            "My first thought when reading your title was \"she needs to get over it. It's your money.\" But reading the post, it wasn't even your money, it was a gift. You are free to accept gifts as you wish. And your daughter needs to get over it anyway.",
            "A 32 year old married woman has her priorities all wrong. Even if you did pay for that trip...she\u2019s too old to feel so entitled to daddy\u2019s money. She needs home truths about being a grown up, solving your own problems and being responsible for yourself more than anything else. Yes it\u2019s nice to help where possible, but her and her husband can\u2019t be expecting you to not live your life just because they\u2019re struggling",
            ">We didn\u2019t really think about how it would make Sarah feel.\n\nWhy would you?\n\nStop trying to fix it and focus on the daughters who aren't being daft. Leave the door open, but stop chasing her.",
            "She is 32yos but has the mentality of a 12yo. \n\nLeave her be. She will grow up and get over it.",
            "Sounds like Sarah doesn't want to wake up and acknowledge the actual source of her financial woes, so she's displacing her frustrations onto you. It also sounds like you're a wonderful father.\n\nI don't have advice because I'm also struggling with a beloved family member who doesn't want to see the person she's with for the shithead he is, but I wanted to provide validation.\n\nUnfortunately it might be a case of you did nothing wrong, so there's nothing you can do to fix it. You might just have to leave your figurative door open until she unlocks hers.",
            "You've done nothing wrong.  Your job, as a parent, is to raise your children to adulthood.  It's kind and loving that you continue to support her but it's not a requirement that you give up all joy and fun so that she can have everything you produce.  You are *not* The Giving Tree.  Your daughter is sadly entitled and is not appreciating the help she is getting.  Grownups make their choices and live with the consequences.  If your daughter needs more money, she needs to take steps to address that which *doesn't* consist of expecting you to open your wallet.  You're allowed to go on a first-class grand world tour if that's what you want.  Set those boundaries and recognize that they are *helping* your daughter, not hurting her.  She's not entitled to your money or her sister's money.  Giving her more is just making her worse.",
            "I just want to say something.  \n  \n**Poverty fucks with your head.**  It means you are facing a true personal emergency, but other people are going about as if everything was normal.  Because it is for them.  But your life is in crisis.  Psychologically, people can become  unmoored.    \n  \nI see this to give some perspective, and suggest the possibly to find some empathy and forgiveness.    \n  \nI agree that, speaking pragmatically, the daughter is clearly \"in the wrong.\"  \n  \nBut that doesn't mean that you have to be harsh to her.  Firm, yes.  Clear, yes.  Having boundaries, yes.  But you don't have to be cruel or judgmental.  \n  \nOn the other hand, this doesn't mean that you have to accept their abuse.  I'm just saying this is a counterpoint.  Do stand up for yourself, and protect yourself from toxic situations.",

            "Sarah's husband is pulling her down with him. She is in denial about how bad he is and is taking her frustration at her life situation at you and Annie instead of at where she should: at her husband. \n\nTry being more empathetic with Sarah while also drawing boundaries and giving tough love. \"Sarah, I know your situation is not the best right now. You know I love you and would do all I could if it would fix your problems. But you know I can't. Even Annie couldn't if she wanted to. You need more than money to fix this. If you want to talk about it, I'd be happy to lend an ear. But if you're going to keep blaming other people for your problems at home, how am I supposed to listen to you?\"",
            "Yikes. Sarah is in her thirties and should know better than to expect *anyone* to financially support her. You've already bailed her out multiple times, so for her to have an expectation that you would just give her any excess money you had is incredibly immature and entitled. She and her husband need to fix their spending/financial issues on their own, without just continuing to rely on others to bail them out over and over again. If I were you I would give her some time and space. Hopefully she will come around and realize that this is not about \"replacing\" her.",
            "What went on between Sarah and Annie? Does Annie specifically leave Sarah out of the help she gives because Sarah needs it the most?",
            "So lets say you did give her money. What does that do? Fix the problem? Absolutely not. You would just be enabling her families shitty spending habits. She is not entitled to your money, if she wants to thrive, she has to budget appropriately. You should honestly tell her you didn't have the money but it doesn't matter anyway as this is a boundary you need to set. How much does she owe you by now? Or even worse, are you not expecting to pay it back?",
            "The only part where I empathize with Sarah here is that Annie has been helping everyone else out over the last year, except for Sarah. You did say that some of her problems are due to the pandemic, on top of her husband's awful behavior. Add a vacation for everyone else on top of that, and that's a lot of feeling excluded and hurt, I think. None of this is your responsibility to manage, however.",
            "I understand the comments talking about how she shouldn\u2019t feel entitled to your money and all that and that\u2019s fair. I personally wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable repeating asking a relative for financial help like she did. but I think we need to keep in mind that her feelings are probably amplified by the stress from her financial situation and the pandemic. \n\nHow much is she actually struggling? If I was two months away from getting evicted, my dad tells me he can\u2019t help but then he goes on a trip, I think I\u2019d be initially surprised and upset. Especially if I feel I\u2019ve been lied to by my own dad. She should believe you after that though.\n\nIt might also be hard for her to stand up to her husband. I know my mom has a really hard time standing up to my stepdad who\u2019s really irresponsible with his spending, but he makes more than her and he\u2019s got a terrible temper so that\u2019s the end of that, apparently.\n\nIn the end , if she doesn\u2019t calm down in the next few weeks, it might take until sarah\u2019s finances get better before things can be mended. \n\nI hope things work out for you, op.",
            "Op, the best thing my parents have ever done for me was telling me a firm no when it came to money. They helped me out a time or two, but that was it. \n\nOne day, I go to their house and ask for money. I was wearing brand new shoes, carrying a new cell phone, and drinking something from Starbucks. Then I asked my dad for some help with my rent because I \u201cwas short a couple hundred dollars\u201d (I\u2019d spent part of my rent money on the phone, because dad will help me\u2026right?). \n\nDad said no, and mom backed him up. Mom said that there was a simple solution, and I would have to find it on my own. I found it, after pawing a couple of gaming systems, selling plasma, and picking up an extra shift at work every day for a week, I found it. I started to learn at that point. That month, I made rent and barely paid the electric. The next month, as soon as I got paid I forgot myself. There\u2019s nothing like your electric getting shut off in an Oklahoma July to wake you up. My dad tells me that, to this day, telling me no was one of the hardest things he\u2019s done in his life. It forced me to learn, to change, to grow up. \n\nSome people do fine when they have something or someone to fall back on, but some people become dependent on that person or persons to fallback on. When they can depend on someone bailing them out, then they never have that opportunity to grow because they\u2019re never forced to deal with the consequences of their actions! Sometimes, that consequence means the power gets cut off. From my own experience, a person does a lot of growing up when that consequence is the sound of the power going off.",

            "It\u2019s just much easier to blame you than herself or her husband for the financial mess they\u2019re in. I would refuse to support them anymore. Period.",
            "Sorry but this was a problem coming way before this moment and the pandemic. She (not her husband because what the fuck: that is a different problem) was relying on you for her financial problems. I mean were all these things going to be loans or no strings gifts? She became accustomed to you being a supplementary income and becoming overly reliant on you. She has no real sense of self reliance or shame in asking for money from anyone anymore",
            "Tell her  you'll pay for a divorce attorney.",
            "Stop worrying about Sarah as you have done absolutely nothing for her to be upset about. \n\nFocus on your other children and let Sarah know that you are open to an apology for her entitled behavior when she feels up to delivering one to you. I think you have pandered to her selfish and entitled whims for too longs and cannot see how unreasonable her behavior is. \n\nAlso, for the love of god, please look after your own finances and never give her another cent.",
            "Even if you were paying your own trip, you would be perfectly justified in doing so. It is your money, not hers and you are not obligated to bail Sarah out for the umpteenth time. In fact, you should stop bailing her out even when your situation stabilizes. She and her husband need to live within their means.\n\nThat said, this isn't about the $. It sounds like there is jealousy or feelings of being emotionally neglected that you need to target if you want her to feel better. We don't know your family history, so think back to how she has felt about your remarriage, your step-kids and put in a fix that deals with that emotional context.\n\nBut don't give her more $.",
            "Sarah is about the same age as me and I have only once let my parents help me with money when I was fucking desperate, as a 23 year old straight out of university. I'm not even a particularly mature, competent or independent person, but I would still be mortified to have my parents bail me out repeatedly. I have never felt entitled to their cash. In fact, I anticipate having to help them out financially when they are older.\n\nJust sharing this to put your daughters fucking attitude in perspective. Her behaviour is not normal and you have already been more than accommodating.\n\nAll that said, I do wonder if there are other reasons why Sarah feels insecure with regard to you and your stepdaughters. I suppose it's possible that she is using this holiday argument as a proxy for a bigger problem. Something to at least consider.",
            "you know, I wonder how can some privileged adult children be childish while also being middle aged. \n\nI think lots of people in developed countries don't realize that nobody owes them anything at all.\n\nTell her to grow up and remind her that she's an adult and that you are no longer responsible for her.",
            "The issue is you giving money to her. This is basically no different than having alcohol at a friends' house after telling your alcoholic friend you won't drink with them. You will need to put your foot down on that issue and tell her that your money is your business, not hers.\n\nSome people need to hit rock bottom really hard before they make changes. You've done all you can on your end. She needs to make that decision if she wants to live that way, or make changes (which divorcing the dead-beat husband absolutely should be on the table) to get put of the mess she put herself in.\n\nIf she needs cash, there's one place to go: to work.",
            "I can't get over the fact that she doesn't believe you. She knows you, she knows Annie (whether she likes her or not is a different issue), and she still chooses *not* to believe you?\nI'm sorry OP, I don't think it's your daughter you're arguing with - nor your daughter requesting financial aid. She's a proxy for hubby, and he doesn't care if it's believable or not - she wants her to use that possibility to guilt you into giving *him* more money, somehow. He isn't risking anything by trying since these are your daughter's relationships getting strained over and over, not his.\nWere your youngest and eldest ever close?",
            "I am also 32 and don\u2019t always do the best financially due to being a single parent and life being ridiculously expensive. \n\nMy dad has helped me out at times but I never expect it, I\u2019m always extremely grateful and I feel really bad ever having to ask. I can\u2019t imagine him being in a position that he couldn\u2019t help and then me getting angry that he was going on a trip? \n\nYour daughter needs to grow up. You\u2019re not her personal bank, you are a person with your own needs and feelings and it\u2019s incredibly toxic for her to feel you can\u2019t have good things while she\u2019s not having good things.\n\nI would let her stew it in personally. Let her come to you because you are not the one in the wrong.",
            "She is 32 and married. She is not entitled to your money. You are not required to bail them out.\n\nTell her to grow up, and get her life together.\n\nIt is not fair to the other 3 daughters that you spend all your time and finances on the oldest! Who should be setting a better example for the other 3.\n\nBut it is kind of messed up that the youngest helps everyone else and treats everyone else. Tell the youngest that you wont be around forever and you would like to see them all get along before you go.\nOf course that doesnt mean she has to be oldest sisters new source of bail money either.",
            "If you want to give her any more money then she has to sit down and work out a budget with you. That includes her and her husband explaining every single purchase they've made for the last two months, as well as pay stubs, and banking statements, nothing  that can be faked. If they're looking for help with their money troubles , fine but you're allowed to see where their money is going. I get the impression that husband won't need money enough to explain his financed big screen TV and premium cable package while he's missing credit card payments to his father in law. And you're free to say to your daughter 'I am no longer funding your husband's mistakes.' If she says you're being divisive you can say that you have no problem with him but you're not paying him just because he's married to your daughter.\n\nIf your daughter has a problem with how you spend your money she needs an attitude adjustment. Next time she brings it up say 'My finances are not in question and not open for discussion. Are you done questioning my finances or is this conversation over? If she presses, hang up and don't talk for a week. Repeat as necessary.",
            "There isn't anything you can do here, unfortunately. What are supposed to do, trot out receipts and bank statements to *prove* to her you didn't pay for this? Even if you had paid for it, you're not taking luxurious vacations while she's destitute. It sounds like she's got a home, food and all immediate needs met but is making poor financial choices (i.e. hitching her carriage to a fiscally irresponsible partner). And you have offered her assistant before, it sounds like to your own detriment at that. Your wife visited her own daughter and you tagged along. You don't have to consider anyone else in that scenario.\n\nThis sounds like misplaced anger. She's envious her stepsibling is not struggling as she is. She's upset that she can't get her spouse on board with limiting spending when their finances are low but instead of getting mad at him, she's punishing you. But she's an adult, so she's just going to have to sort it out. You can't make her believe you; you can't make her talk to you; you can't do anything about this except hope that she finally comes around. I'm really sorry. It must be difficult to see your child struggling and even worse to be the target for their maladaptive coping.",
            "Sarah should be mad at her husband.",
            "She's jealous.  While I understand why she is, she can't afford these things, it's also true that she needs to reflect on her emotions and control them.  Not all emotions are valid and this is one of those times.    \n\n\nShe needs to grow up. That's the long and the short of it.  She's not entitled to your money, and it seems she thinks she is.  She's not speaking to you, yet I can almost bet that when the time comes for her to need more money she'll be knocking on your door.  I suggest you keep up with NOT helping her, even if your financial situation improves.  Let her and her husband figure it out.    \n\n\nYour other daughter is being kind with her money.  She's allowed to.  No one gets to dictate to you or her on how she chooses to spend it.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Jelly daughter needs to get over it and be a grown assed woman.

It's up to them and not us.  The fact that she is this upset usually means one thing.  She is extremely jealous because of how unhappy she is on her life right now.  She's miserable and there is nothing, no amount of money that can help that.\n\nYou are fine and she needs to get a handle on this.  There is literally nothing you can do.  Throwing any money her way is like trying to herd cats.",
            "The first thing you need to clarify is that it\u2019s your money and you use it as you see fit. Even if she\u2019s your daughter, it doesn\u2019t mean you would rather feed her than go out for a trip now that she is 30+. It could have been the case 15 years ago when she was still a kid, it could have been the case a decade ago when she was still a youngling learning the ropes of society and understanding how to spend and save. It sure as hell isn\u2019t the case right now.\n\n I\u2019ll be honest, at one point in time, even i felt like i could have bought xyz in the money my parents spent on abc; but that was around the time i was in my early teens; even then i knew I was wrong and corrected my thinking right away. Now, I don\u2019t care what they use the money for;\n I arrange for my own savings as well as leisure expenditures and have Never asked them for anything even if i know they might provide. Honestly explain to her that you can and you will spend on luxury items when you feel like because you saved it for that purpose and not to help her.\n If you don\u2019t enjoy now then when? Buy something you find useful and wanted to for a long time to prove your point ( I am not asking to splurge, just buy something). If she understands, good. If she doesn\u2019t, stay firm. Tell her you are always there emotionally and will help whenever it\u2019s convenient for you and when it doesn\u2019t mess up your budget/ plans to buy something. \nTell her you are going to get everything when you die but till then let us enjoy our life as you have already struggled enough for a lifetime, no need to inherit your kids burden to this extent as well if they are able bodied.",

She's probably not even doing it on purpose but given a choice between \"I might need to divorce my husband\" and \"the stepdaughters are ruining our family\" it's easy to see why her brain would ping on the latter as an outlet for all that stress and anger.",
            "she doesn't want an apology. some wants guilt so that she can continue to manipulate you.\n\nat what point is an adult responsible for her own circumstances? if you bailed her out once, fine. emergencies come up that are outside of one's control. but a second or third time? now you're just part of her budget.\n\nno wonder she is pissed.",
            "Wealth disparity. You claim your step daughter is comfortable because she\u2019s married to a wealthy man. Pretty sad people have to marry into wealth to stay afloat when the economy and world collapses.

Imagine loaning someone $2K and a year has gone by and you keep being told \"I don't have the money yet to pay you back.\" Not even a partial amount. Then later you see that they posted on social media the details their fabulous vacation...because your one of their \"friends\".\n\nI share this because your adult daughter really needs to figure things out and to not take everything personally. I'm assuming you didn't borrow money from her so she has no right to be mad at you.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh but we all have to cut the cord with our kids at some point. Gradual weaning off the money train is probably best instead of an abrupt end.\n\nI hope this helps in some way. Relationships on any level can get complicated. And \"fighting like family\" is real. Love ultimately wins but it can take time.",

            "Hm, I\u2019m surprised but I shouldn\u2019t be, with all of the critiques of Sarah and her husband, provided with only the context of a few paragraphs from a one person perspective. There\u2019s a lot of judgements here coming from various internalized biases. I\u2019m calling that out because it\u2019s simply too pointed and unprocessed emotions-driven to be generally and objectively helpful for someone\u2019s personal situation, in one online account, which third parties simply don\u2019t have a full picture of. \n\nThe dynamic here seems to be you have an adult child who is in a place of loss, financially and emotionally (+ whatever else), which is all her own business at the end of the day. It\u2019s more vague what your end of the dynamic is since most of your description is about Annie or Annie and Sarah. Do you think the focus fields of your post could suggest, in reality, an absence of your own boundaries and grounding in your own relationship with Sarah? I ask this to refocus the intentions away from aforementioned focus on (Annie) or (Annie and Sarah), and back to where this post lies \u2014 you and Sarah. \n\nObviously, no one is entitled to anyone\u2019s anything, material or not. Regardless of if you could offer financial support, or even if you wanted to, your relationship priority together should be one of love and compassion, if that is your true intention. Does she know how much you care for her? Does she know how much you want to support her (financial or not)? Does she know how much you feel for her in her current situation? People want and need help, but when that\u2019s not available, it is still comforting to be seen. And anyone can always be reminded of the positive feelings and support that others have for them, especially when things aren\u2019t good. \n\nHave you expressed your feelings about this situation, in terms of how it has affected you? Have you established with Sarah what your limits are when it comes to support, money or otherwise? Have you explored/established an understanding with Sarah about boundaries (what they are, and why they\u2019re necessary) when it comes to support? Have you asked and allowed space for her to fully express her thoughts and feelings about your feelings for each of your daughters (without interjection or inclination to explain yourself)? Have you reassured her how you feel about your daughters altogether? Have you reminded her that sometimes emotions are illusions based on personal experiences and internal narratives, so there is a difference between what she\u2019s telling herself about your love for her vs Annie in comparison to your actual feelings (if that\u2019s the truth, which it sounds like it is)? Do you actively consider how your actions towards each daughter expresses different amounts of love? \n\nI\u2019m saying : give reassurance and support, listen to understand more than what you already know, share your own experience (of this situation, because your perspective and feelings matter too), and draw new lines\n\nIt seems important to be careful about letting communication dip into the areas of (Sarah and husband) or (Sarah and Annie) because this is about you and Sarah. \n\nWith anything you care for, persistent and clear communication, and practice (trial, error, reminder, repeat), is key. So the immediate problem is you are being ignored, that\u2019s understandable that she needs to cool off, and hopefully, process. Figure out by what means you can send your full communication to her \u2014text, email, letter, etc (never an other person). This way, every feeling and thought that you need to share exists for her to digest at her pace. Send it, check in, check in again for as long as it takes or as long as your heart can stand it, as soon as things seem cool, create a date to do something together and stick to it (with the clear intention that it is to heal from this situation and set off renewed, together). \n\nIt sounds like you do care a lot for each other. You\u2019ve made a whole post for strangers\u2019 commentary, and she\u2019s expressed an exhausted sense of rejection and abandonment (in convo with other sister) which means you want to fix things, and she wants to be your daughter. \n\nI absolutely know that people use people, even their loved ones. And maybe that line of \u201cusing\u201d or over dependence has been crossed or blurred in your relationship but that does sometimes happen when things are desperate. By this account, it doesn\u2019t sound like a toxic dynamic altogether but just one toxic environment which we are all guilty of entering from time to time, esp when something, like an emotion, is intense. As it is just one toxic environment, you can step out of it, hopefully together! So I have a lot of hope for you and Sarah! Just be sure to stay focused and intentional (the sisters dynamics are whole other problems that are not necessarily yours to navigate and each person\u2019s personal development is a personal path). \n\nI don\u2019t know if any of the above was helpful at all but I wish you so much luck and family healing.\n\nEDIT: I think it is also so very important to refrain from changing your attitude towards Sarah, for the worst, in this very moment because it would nail down the sense of abandonment that it sounds like Sarah already feels. Unless, your attitude has truly changed for the worst \u2014 then that\u2019s your truth. But don\u2019t craft an attitude (i.e. coldness, distancing, etc) for the hopes of any particular outcome. And remember, things like boundaries are not an attitude change, they are tools for maintaining and sustaining. Compassionate communication is key.",

Even if its just a small thing! Everyone is struggling mentally right now so just make her feel heard when she is ready to talk. I dont think continuing to bail her out is helping her and her husband. Its hard because that's your baby and you don't want to see her stuck like that.",

We used to have files where someone's mortgage would get to the point we had an eviction scheduled, and then they would pay off the arrears with money from family. This would repeat again and again, each time adding legal costs to the mortgage.\n\nThe problem was that no one from their family (our client the mortgage lender would, but would get ignored) would give them the hard truth that they couldn't afford the mortgage long-term and either needed to reduce their expenditure or, more usually, sell the house.\n\nBy bailing her out you're treating the symptom rather than the cause. If your bucket has a hole in you don't fix your water problem by continually topping up, you fix the hole.\n\nIf you can get her to engage with you, I'd download a budget form from the internet (might be called \"income & expenditure\") and sit down with her to go through it. Have her get out the bank statements and really look at what they're spending each month, and what they can cut out etc.",

She is an adult, she needs to take responsibility for her own life. Allowing her to treat you like that is enabling her, she needs to grow as a person and make better choices for herself. Please do not bail her out anymore.\n\nShe is currently stonewalling you, which is emotional blackmail, and this makes this whole thing even worse.

I would express love to Sara but state that you are a grown man and do not need your daughter's permission on who you visit or what  you do.

I called (well, emailed\u2014I\u2019m a millennial) a company after doing my research and I took out a loan. I cut back on expenses and worked hard to pay that loan off 2 years before the end of the term. I got more responsible with my credit and started living within my means. Now all I have left is my crippling student loan debt, which I\u2019m working towards public service forgiveness on (should only have about 3.5 more years).\n\nSarah is a married woman in her 30s.

She needs to either take control of the finances and manage them herself for the household (e.g. his paycheck goes into an account only she has access to and he only gets transferred money that is not contributing to household bills, home/auto upkeep, savings, and retirement) or she needs to detangle *her* finances from his completely and kick him out if he can\u2019t or won\u2019t live up to basic roommate standards. \n\nShe can put on her big girl pants and figure this out. *She is not owed financial assistance from you and by bailing them out repeatedly, you are making it WORSE.* If they know that, no matter what, mommy and daddy will rescue them, they have literally zero incentive to make the necessary changes to fix this for good on their own. You\u2019ve seen that this has become a pattern. It\u2019s up to you to walk away from this mess. \n\nI know it hurts to do. She\u2019s your kid and you want to help her because you love her. But I\u2019m telling you, the best way to help her is to let her grow up. If she stops acting like an entitled person and reaches out to you, feel free to give her your best advice and recommendations and then let her know that you will no longer be providing financial assistance or discussing that going forward. Set a boundary and stick to it. You have to let her sink or swim on her own.",

He is financially irresponsible and dragging her down with him.

            "You can't fix it. Even if she's your daughter Sarah is a grown woman who made grown woman decisions. She's also making the decision to be jealous of Annie and cutting her father off for simply accepting a gift. The fact that she thinks she's entitled to other people's money is already wrong and you know that but I get it, she's your kid. Chances are she resents her life but you know, she chose to marry a loser instead of a winner like Annie did. In the future, stop bailing her out. She needs to put on the big girl britches and get her life under control instead of being so helpless.",
            "Your daughter is old enough to finance her own life and lifestyle. It is not your responsibility to take care of a woman in her 30's and her immature husband while struggling yourself during a global pandemic. If she can't afford her bills or lifestyle, it's on her to fix that, not you. Her behavior is a result of being spoiled her entire life and continuously bailed out by you, which she obviously hasn't been grateful for and has taken for granted. In all honesty, there is nothing that you can do to change her mind now that she's decided that you are intentionally making her suffer due to her own bad choices.\n\nI would try to look at this situation from an outside perspective. If this scenario was playing out on TV, what would your thought process be? What would you think about the person playing your daughters role?\n\nWhen someone has decided that they are the victim, nothing can change that mindset but that person. Your daughter has issues that she needs to see a professional for. The way that she expects things from you purely because 1-you are her parent and 2- because you have it and she deserves it, is toxic and requires therapy to fix but at her age, she needs to seek that out and hearing it from you will only fuel the flames. She is entitled and childish and has big decisions that she needs to make in order to grow up. Some people can never stop blaming their parents for their woes. Regardless of the good that happens to them when one bad thing comes along it always falls back to \"my parents did xxxxx and that's why I'm messed up, it's all their fault!!!\" instead of being accountable to themselves it is easier to blame all past and future problems on their parents and childhood. The only thing that will get her out of this mindset is going to therapy.\n\nI recommend just leaving it be. Nothing you do or say will change the way she is feeling. You could give her a million dollars tomorrow and she will still want more or ask why you waited until today instead of yesterday or five years ago. It is time to leave her to her own self. Let her know that you love her but you are not and will no longer be her cash cow because obviously, it isn't helping and she will always expect more. Make sure she knows that you are there when she decides she is ready to take responsibility for her own life and stop blaming all of her problems on you and your wife. She needs to grow up, big time. In order for her to do that, you need to pull away and let her fall and learn to stand back up on her own.",

Instead of giving her money in the future, maybe you could hire her or her husband to do some work around the house. They need to realize that no one owes them anything, and if you want money, you need to work for it. I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t see you coming out of this with a good relationship with your daughter if you don\u2019t give her money, but you should not do that.",

I've asked and she has lended a helping hand but I have not had any expectation nor any animosity when she refuses to help me. This doesn't help you with your situation since your daughter already has this expectation and holds it against you for not helping her.\n\nHowever, what I hope my story does offer you is another perspective that maybe this situation you've found yourself in doesn't have to be the norm. Parents have to find a time to let their children fail or thrive (maybe within reason). If your daughter still has income, from herself or her partner, they should probably work out for themselves a budget and learn to stick to it. I've had to do this when my partner lost their job. I was able to afford to live so I didn't ask for help. We had to tighten out belts but we've survived.",

His mindset isn't ready for marriage because he lacks the fundamental BASIC to build a marriage. Saving money. If husband was decent person, it shouldn't be a problem.

So, they test you - they push and push in a variety of ways. They know your buttons - as a parent, you probably feel like family is important, caring for your children equally and not playing favorites is important, etc etc. And so, when the manipulation attempts come in from Sarah, they will be oriented around the \"buttons\" that they think you have. It's all part of the shake-down. \n\nYou see it with addicts a lot too - they will get very personal and brutal in their attempts to make you feel bad for saying no. Just remember, when you said no to giving her the money, you made a commitment to yourself -- and if you break that commitment, then she will learn the lesson of \"if I throw a big enough tantrum, I can bully my father into paying me\". She currently thinks you'll break if she turns the screws, so she's trying to hit where it hurts. \n\nYou say \"I would really like to fix this\" -- well, too bad, you cannot fix this, because she is trying to leverage your desire to \"fix\" things, and use that to make you cave and pay her.

Sweetie/Sarah u have to go to your husband and if he ain\u2019t doing what he suppose to do then maybe separation should be an option. I just can\u2019t stand when children blame parents for their fuck up. She\u2019s grown 32 she knows better..because if you and your wife wasn\u2019t on this earth. Then what? She would have to figure it out on her own. Which she need to anyway she\u2019s 32 there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m about to get mad at my parents when they can\u2019t support me! But I\u2019m laid up with a broke ass husband. Sarah needs to grow tf up! There\u2019s no excuse at all. To be mad at a parent and they money when you\u2019re grown as hell with a husband Sarah Bye!",
            "She\u2019s a grown woman and you don\u2019t owe her money. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure this has more to do with jealousy toward Annie than anything else.",
            "Your daughter is an entitled brat and instead of being thankful for all the help you HAVE provided, she is outraged she isn\u2019t getting more. The definition of entitlement. I would take a hard stance on this and not give in by pandering, apologizing, or otherwise excusing her unacceptable behavior.",
            "I know how you feel as I've been there and it hurts my ex and parents fell out and I got stuck in the middle you can only Live your life your way I know that you love your children don't let them tell you what you can and can't do they will learn that one day they may have to be in this situation and face exactly what you have gone through and they will know how it hurt you then being ashamed they will be just try to be there for them all be firm you can't pay for everything"

Well here goes....\n\n\nI'm going to pick up where I left off with the last post and detail what happened from there.\n\n\nMy girlfriend called me at 1am and apologized profusely saying she didn't realize what time it had gotten to because she was busy. (She normally calls me around 11:30 or so). I decided then and there that I was gonna save the texts from Dave, a screen shot of the email, and confront her when I got home. I weighed my options and decided it was better to be cheated on and let it go on a few extra days and spend time with my family, then to rush home or accuse her over the phone and find out she was planning something for my birthday....I think that would ruin her trust in me forever. \nNothing seemed odd when she called. She asked after my family, sent me a few progress pictures of the quilt she was making for my mom, told me she loved me and that she would call me in the morning.\n\n\nMonday morning my grandma took a turn for the worse and my brother, mother, and father all gathered at the hospice to spend the final hours with her. Somewhere in the very wee hours of Tuesday morning she passed away from lung cancer.....seriously people, put down your cigarettes. \n\n\nWe were really her only remaining family. My father was an only child, and she had no living siblings, and she had moved in with my parents awhile ago and hasn't kept in touch with anyone. In leu of planning a traditional funeral, we just decided to proceed with having her buried next to her husband's plot (something she had already pre-planned, paid for, and requested in her will) and spent Tuesday gathered around in the living room telling stories about her and looking through her shoeboxes full of photographs to create an updated photo album. It was nice, actually. My girlfriend kept in constant contact with me through this whole thing and talked to my parents as well. They love her. \n\n\nDuring that time I decided to let everything fall out of my mind other than my family. \nIt was pretty evenly split on what people believed about my girlfriend, but what felt right in my gut, was that she was planning something from me.\n\n\nMany of you said I was denying any possibility she was cheating and had my head in the sand. That she was blowing this guy, fucking him in my bed, and that she was on some sort of penis-related carnival ride? \n\n\nSome said I trusted her too much and that it would come back to bite me.\n\n\nAnd many of you said I didn't trust her enough. That I was letting what my friend saw cloud my judgement. \n\n\nThere is some truth in that. Many of you wondered if Dave hated my girlfriend or wanted to get with her. I promise you that is not the case at all. Dave has been cheated on before and just wanted to look out for me. If I had asked him to confront her he would have done it in a heart beat, but even he thought something was up knowing us for as long as he has. I asked him to leave it and that I would deal with Everything when I got home. If there really was nothing going on, I didn't want to risk crushing her spirit when she was just trying to do something nice for me.\n\n\nI let my girlfriend know I would be home sometime Wednesday...but I was gonna have breakfast with my family first. She requested I call her when I get in the state. \n\n\nThis was my intention, but I was getting so homesick, and I just really needed to see my girlfriend, so I hit the road sometime around 5am. With no rest stops and minimal traffic, I made pretty great time and got home at 10:30 or so.\n\n\nAs I pulled into the driveway, I saw the white truck parked there already.\n\n\nI swallowed the lump in my throat and walked up to the front door. I kept repeating in my head that I trusted her and that there was nothing going on.\nAs I walked in the front door (which enters into the living room) I locked eyes with the guy. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor in sweat pants and a tank top eating cereal off my coffee table. He looked younger than I thought he would be from Dave's description. But he had a full beard and long black hair in a ponytail.\nHe nodded and said, \"hey dude. Welcome back.\"\n\n\nWhich felt odd....I just stood there, staring at him, wading through the surrealness of the situation looking for the right words. \nMy girlfriend then came down the hallway, smiled, and hugged me. \n\n\n\"Hey. I'm so, so sorry about grandma. Any chance you remember my cousin Max? I know It's been awhile.\"\n\n\nI stared at him and I swear I had never seen this person in my life. I just had this sinking feeling and only replied, \"I don't think we have met....\"\n\n\n\"Aunt Ellen's son. The one that lives in (other state).\"\n\n\nAnd suddenly it dawned on me. Her aunt Ellen's husband, Uncle Joe, was her SECOND husband. She married young but split up with this kid's father pretty early.....Max lives with his dad in (other state) and Max's dad is 100% Italian.....which explains the hair.\n\n\nAll I could say was, \"whoa man. You've grown up....\"\n\n\nHe just laughed and said \"yeah. I've changed a bit.\"\n\n\nThe last time I saw this kid he was a chubby, neon green haired, acne covered teenager in an tapout t-shirt. He really came out of puberty well....I\nThink I last saw him four or five years ago on Christmas. \n\n\nShe asked me if we could talk. So I followed her into our bedroom. She basically said he was moving back in with aunt Ellen and getting a job as a grunt with her family construction company part time. He wants to go to a local college around us and my girlfriend promised to help him fill out his FAFSA, polish his entrance letter, and study for his placement tests in exchange for some work. (He went to an alternative trade school for carpentry his last two years of highschool and my girlfriend's dad says he did pretty well.) \n\n\nShe said she had something planned for my man-cave but they hit a few hang ups and it's taking longer than expected. \n\n\nShe brought our x-box upstairs into the living room and has made me swear I will not enter the basement for any reason until my birthday.\n\n\nI debated pretending I wasn't worried at all....but I like that we are always honest with each other. I told her Dave saw her out with her cousin and had me a bit worried about him. She just laughed and said, \"I didn't realize he saw us together! I thought you meant he just saw me.\" She said they had walked basically around opposite ends of the store shopping separately. They only met up to check out. She asked why I didn't just ask her who it was. She said could have told me it was Max and still been able to keep the exchange of work under wraps and just told me about the college thing. \n\n\nI basically told her I didn't want to make her feel like I was accusing her of anything, which I think she appreciated. \n\n\nMax is going to be staying here a few more days longer than she planned, which I wish she would have told me about....but after this....that seems like nothing at all. I think she is a bit upset that I could even think for a moment she would cheat on me....but she said she was glad I didn't come flying home early kicking doors in or anything. \n\n\nSo I think we are good. Just in case, I'm gonna kiss her ass for a awhile.\n\n**edit 1:** maybe I should clarify that max is NOT moving in with is. He is moving back in with his mom. He was already supposed to be home with her by the time I came home...but they hit some snags with whatever he is working on. He is staying a few more days to finish up then going home to his mother's. \n\n**Edit 2:** For those asking why my girlfriend would not tell me why Max was over, she didn't know Dave saw her WITH him, she just thought he saw her in the paint department by herself. I think she wanted to not arouse any suspicion at all in me. He was supposed to be done before I even got home. \n\nI remember her mentioning that he was in carpentry school. I didn't know it was part of a two year high school thing, and for some reason I was picturing him as a lot older than he was (I think I had him confused with his older step brother?). \n\nI've had my brother over when she was visiting her best friend out of state before and it was a non issue. We have a pretty open door policy when it comes to close friends and family so having him over is a total non issue for me. \n\nI see how it would be an issue for some people. But it's not in our relationship.\n\nI think she just wanted me to spend time with my family and not focus on what was going on at home in the slightest. \nShe was going to tell me about the FAFSA/college thing If I asked, but since I didn't, she just decided to keep it under wraps. \n\n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Everything worked out.",

I am glad you listened to the more insightful and observant people here.\n\nI am sorry for your loss, but you did the right thing to stay with your grandma until her final moments and I am glad everything turned out to be alright in the end.",

Your girlfriend just had a hysterectomy, you've been together for a long time, and you go out of town and one friend sees your girl out with some other dude, leaning on him (which you said yourself she does with all her friends because of a medical condition) and you immediately jump to cheating. If I were her, I'd be super hurt, especially since she just got out of major surgery, had to then do the cleaning of the house you said you would do, and then she's trying to do something nice for you. I would be wondering exactly why you jumped to the cheating, and I'd start to wonder if perhaps it isn't a bit of a guilty conscience on your part. Just my two cents.",

I was asking for advice if this meant she may be interested in something romantic or if she may just like saunas (being German and all where nudity often isn't such a big deal).\n\n**Update:** After trying to gather my courage over the weekend to ask her out, she told me on Monday that she has matched with someone on a dating app and was very excited to meet them and talked quite a bit about them the whole week \n\nI think she either never intended to indicate any romantic interest or realized over the weekend that her invitation could have been seen as something flirty, so she decided to tell me about her love life - to set the record dtraight so to speak. In either case, it seems not to have meant anything.\n\nRegardless: Thanks a lot for the advice, it could have very well meant something else!\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nTDLR; My coworker invited my to a mixed sauna after the lockdown is over but it seems to have been meant as something innocent as she talked a lot this week about meeting a match on a datung app.",

            "It's not at all appropriate to start any sexual banter in the sauna (from the blue, at least), since everyone is in the nude. For the same reason, asking someone to go to sauna really shouldn't be seen as asking them out for a date, unless it's explicitly stated.",
            "German female here and I'm shocked/embarrassed by many of these comments. Inviting you to the sauna was not sexual at all. It's not a place you'd take someone on a first date, but it's perfectly fine when you're going with friends. Which is what you've clearly become for her, a friend. She probably told you about the date, because she was excited and wanted to tell a friend.\nSome people said that she was testing you and you wouldn't hang out with a coworker after hours. What a bunch of crap. I hang out with my coworkers all the time because some of them are also my friends. And I don't think she was testing you in any way. She is a 29 year old grown woman and probably a little too mature for such childish games.\nQuarantine has been difficult for all of us, which is why friends are needed. So please, try to be a good friend to her and don't read too much into what she is doing.",

It seems she asked about the sauna out of interest and because it\u2019s somewhere you\u2019ve never been and she likes spending time with you enough to do so.\n\nI think after asking she probably felt weird and worried you didn\u2019t like her so now she\u2019s trying to keep you in the friendzone so she doesn\u2019t get her hopes up.",
            "Lol I'm German and wouldn't invite a coworker to a sauna even one I'm friendly with\n\nBut tbh I have visited a sauna once. Not my style",
            "Quit thinking with your fucking cock. Just because a woman is being NICE doesnt mean they are gonna do anything sexual with you. Youre the one making things creepy. If a MAN invited you to their sauna you woukdve thought yall were gonna sit around and talk, but when a woman does you think youre gonna have sex. You watch too much porn man, women do not exist to only have sex. Try viewing them as people and not objects like porn depicts. I hope you dont get to enjoy her sauna.",
            "If you want to get to the bottom of it the next time you are out just make a comment like:\n\nI couldn't tell if the sauna invite was a cultural thing or a date but either way would have been cool with me.",
            "Bravo for you taking the hint. This is exactly how I would have handled the situation as the woman.",
            "I'm sure someone's said it before but don't shit where you eat.",
            "Unless you don't particularly care about the job or can easily find another one I would strongly advise against asking out or dating coworkers, especially if you're the guy doing the approaching. It's an extension of the \"always give the woman an exit strategy\" rule that determines when you should and shouldn't make a move.",
            "Dude, you have a lot to learn about women. If I had a nickel for every time I've seen a woman try to get a man's attention by making him a little jealous I wouldn't need to deal with working remotely during a pandemic.\n\nYou need to learn to be direct about what you want with someone or you won't get it. You are waiting for her to make the first (and second and possibly third) move, and still you haven't indicated you see her as anything other than a friend. She has clearly been testing you. She wanted to know if she could convince you to do something new that made you a bit uncomfortable. Checkmark! She knows you are not accustomed to nudity and it would be titillating to you. You can't take the word of a few people on the internet that the playful invitation was not real flirtation. Just because someone has seen extended family members naked doesn't mean everyone usually sees their COWORKERS naked. Plus she didn't actually take you, she just playfully teased you about getting naked together, with full knowledge that is something significant in your culture.\n\nBy talking about her \"match\" she has made it super clear she is single and ready to mingle, in case that wasn't clear enough already, probably hoping you would jump in. That's why she told you *before* going on any other dates. She was hoping it would prompt some kind of reaction from you that would clarify your intentions. I'm guessing she didn't want to start dating this other guy if you were interested, so she bounced the idea off of you. It sounds like you signaled really clearly that you are not in the slightest bit interested in her, and she should feel free to date whoever she wants. *facepalm*\n\nAn invitation to do anything personal outside of the office by a coworker is a very strong signal that they are interested in something more. She is worried about all the same risks you are. If she comes on too strong and you are not interested it could create emotional complications in the workplace. So she is feeling you out in all these other ways to see if she is on safe ground.\n\n> talking to her is one of the highlights of the day during this crappy time.\n\nTell her this. She is the highlight of your day, and you would like to spend more time with her. What is a safe fun thing you can do together? She is planning a date with this guy, she could plan something with you too right? Hiking in the forest is pretty safe. In any case, if she is into you she will light up at the idea and might even start flirting (half-joking) about whether it is a date or not. If she freezes up, turns you down because she is busy and does not offer another time, then you have your answer. But right now I am not seeing any indications she is not interested in you, and many signals that she is.",
            "She could still be very well interested in you.  Just because she matched with someone doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t interested in you.  As cynical as it sounds, perhaps she\u2019s trying to just blatantly show she\u2019s interested to be in the dating realm.  Perhaps, it\u2019s a female way of sending you a sign (although I\u2019m not one to perceive signs well when it\u2019s directed toward myself).  Either way, there is no harm in asking her out anyway.  What do you have to lose? Take it slow and don\u2019t rush anything where if it doesn\u2019t work out, it would be awkward.  Take a few dates to really get to know her and click!",
            "I am European (not German) maybe we care less about nudity than other countries but still I think that going to a sauna with somebody is a pretty intimate thing. Maybe she sees you as something more than a friends but not enough?",
            "She knew what she was doing.\n\nTested to see if your were interested in her.\n\nWill now act accordingly to her data.",
            "So from these comments and a little research I did, it seems like saunas and nudity are something that are more acceptable in Europe for people to just \"do\"  however the degree of which you engage in and who you bring varies from person to person.  Some germans and europeans are saying its just a thing you do and means nothing others are claiming that they would only do it with there partner or a really good friend which implies a certain level of intimacy's must be made before engaging in the activity.  So you thinking that this could be her clumsily coming onto you is not off base as at least in some context it does mean partner of some sorts.\n\nHowever, with that being said if a woman starts talking about another guy in front of you and you are not already together sexually, yea she friend zoned you.",
            "Dude holy shit this is so painful to read. Just tell her how you feel. If she ends up dating this dude do you really want to think \"what if\" for the rest of your life? Just go for it. It's worth a shot because YOU LIKE HER. The worst that could happen is she says no and then just say okay well I'd like to continue a professional relationship. PLEASE just go for it for the love of God and give us an update!!!",
            "You snoozed, and you loozed.",
            "Interestingly, I have found some women tend to start speaking about other romantic interests in an effort to encourage you to act quicker. People are awkward, being straight and just asking her would possibly still be a solid idea. At least you\u2019ll know and can move forward.",
            "I suspect that she told you about the match to gauge your reaction - e.g., see if you looked jealous or if it prompted you to to express interest. But it is hard to know. She's deep in the \"is she  or isn't she\" gray area, imo. I also don't think it would be terrible to do a little light flirting (NOT while you're in the sauna though) - having a first date with someone else isn't the same as being in a relationship. Who knows? The date could turn out to be a dud.",
            "Ah, sorry bro. But hey, you know what they say, \u201cIf you shoot for the moon and miss, the moons diameter is 3,475km so you could not have fucked up more.\u201d",
            "Don't go to a sauna in the midst of a pandemic. Sorry to be the party pooper, we're all alone and needing company, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
            "she sounds like a floozy so consider it a blessing",
            "In case it doesn't work out for her with her date, you should still ask her out if you like her. Don't regret not trying it out.",
            "I think she\u2019s into you, dating app stories and all..",
            "Her telling you she matched with someone is an attempt to gain the upper hand while also providing an easy exit.  She is interested and you\u2019re in the game if you want to be.",
            "Ouch bro.  You\u2019ve been friendzoned.  It happens to all of us.  This chick is ridiculous inviting you to a sauna and then telling you about her match.  She didn\u2019t even know that other guy existed when she asked you that.  God damn...",
            "bro, you are SO fucking lucky.\n\nYou already know what she wants.  Don't over think this.!",
            "I don\u2019t know. I am admittedly a very confusing woman. I would do this and still be interested in you, and also never ever say anything to you. Sorry. But I think you should still ask her out. She might be trying to tell you that she is single.",
            "From Austria (the better Germany): You already have your answer now I guess, but I would have told you not to read too much into it, because this is something many people who are just friends do over here. That said, if the offer still stands I'd still go. You might find you like it. I absolutely love it, it's my favorite part of winter.\n\nJust don't be pushy about it, because even though she offered and does not have a problem with nudity, some people are more reserved in a relationship out of respect for their partner. (I know both kinds of people.)\n\nMy advice is: Even though just because she matched with someone does not mean anything as you might already know, you should however still move on and don't read too much into her words and gestures. Keep it platonic. She gives me the kind of vibe that she'd let you know she is interested in you. If you are in doubt it's probably nothing.",
            "It's possible that she was interested but couldn't tell if you were too so decided to cut her losses. Seemed like she was into you from the first post but obviously you can't get that much of a picture of people and their intentions from a post. Either way, don't let it get you down!"

        "selftext": "I lied, this is Tammy. \n\nI am 23f and I have an 'Irish' twin, Brock [22m]. \n\nBrock is an idiot, sometimes. He can be really fun to be around, but he tends to not listen to things. If Jackass could be the life philosophy of anyone, it would be Brock. There is a reason we don't hang out much, because he always does stupid stuff. Even when I have sat down, explained in detail what I need from him, he is always saying \"he forgot.\" \n\nTo be honest, at this point, I go out to a mall to hang out with him because he doesn't do stupid stuff in public. He just does it in other people's homes. Which is fucking annoying. If he wasn't my brother, I honestly don't know if I would want him around. But I love the fucker and at the moment do not want to sever contact because of stupidity, though that is not out of the question as I get older. \n\nRight now, I guess, I am hoping he grows out of it. Hope being a delicate word. \n\nThe point of this? \n\nOver Labor Day weekend, I went to my mom's home to see the family. We had ribs, visited, and had a great time. I went inside to change for the gym, because I had work in two hours and my mom is right down the street from my gym. So I was going to go there, change for work and shower after. \n\nI had my phone, iPod, earphones, and Fitbit on me when I went to say goodbye to everyone. My fitbit is white and i had my huge earphones around my neck. Brock even commented on how I have 'way too much stuff to exercise with.' I was saying goodbye to my sister (who was in the pool with her son) (30f and 7 male). \n\nBrock came up behind me and pushed me into the pool. Not only did all my things get destroyed, I hit my wrist on the side of the pool and had to miss work. \n\nHe destroyed over $1200 worth of things. \n\nMy mom yelled at Brock and he was asked to leave. I went to Urgent Care and I cracked the bone. My mom told me she was sorry it happened and my sister has now told Brock he is not to come to her home for a while or see her son, because she thinks he is dangerous in the name of a joke. Brock is really upset because he was supposed to take Nephew camping. \n\nPeople have been giving Brock a lot of talks about being responsible and paying your debts. Brock has told me he is sorry, but my wrist hurts and I am really angry about what happened. He has been told not to do anything 'funny' to me because I hate it. I hate pranks because of him. I hate surprises because they always seem to be cruel. \n\nI have not spoken to him and told him I want those things replaced ASAP. He gave me $400 and told me to \"take a joke.\" \n\nMy mother came over earlier today and gave me a wrapped box. She had the receipt for the PS4 and a ton of games. She said everyone in the family pitched in because Brock wanted one, but since he destroyed all my stuff, I should return it to buy a new phone and FitBit. My phone, alone, cost about $400, so the rest of the things still had to be paid for. The total cost of the gift was about $800 (with games and accessories.) \n\nI thanked my mom, and told her she didn't have to pay Brock's debt. She said she understood Brock would never pay it and this would be a better lesson.\n\nSo I returned everything and have a new phone, iPod, earphones, and fitbit. \n\nNow Brock is furiously sending me texts about how his birthday is ruined because I guilted Mom into \"giving up his present.\" He claims he was going to pay me back ASAP, but I told him that I shouldn't have to wait months to get my things paid for because he didn't want to pay up right away.\n\nI told a few friends what happened and its 50/50. Some people said it was wrong to take his gift, as birthdays shouldn't be about getting even and he was an adult. I could have gone through small claims court. \n\nAnother friend said I should cut my brother off. \n\nI am not sure, I just wanted to get other people's opinions on how to handle this. I am not really in the best frame of mind, as I have been typing with one hand.\n\nWhat do you think is the best way to handle this? \n\n**tl;dr** Brother shoved me into a pool while wearing my electronics, my mom gave me his Bday present to cash in to pay for the items. Brother is now pissed off it happened. ",

Either he gets a hint and starts being decent, or shoves off and you guys get to have less stressful lives.",
            "Well if he had the money to pay you back, he can spend it on a PS4 for himself. I'm glad your mom is wising up and not enabling his entitled behavior. Tell him you've lost respect for him and now the debt is paid, even if your relationship with him is repaired. ",

He's not really an adult, he's an immature man-child so it's fitting that he didn't get his toy.

What sucks more is that your prank cost me $1200 and a cracked fucking bone.\"  And then shrug while walking away.  \n\nI'm just happy that the peak of my brother's assholery was before personal electronics were a thing.

It's a lesson he needs to learn.\n\nEspecially if he's 23 and crying about a video game console. And I say that as an avid gamer. Replace your things and don't worry about him. He's the type of person who doesn't really care about anyone besides himself. Don't feel bad that he is for once being held accountable for his actions.

Not sad or guilty on your behalf, he just feels negative emotions and that is all he can process. He is extraordinarily selfish and     I don't see that changing. \n\nDoes he have friends?

By 22 years old, he should be able to behave like an adult (because he is an adult) and it doesn't sound like he is anywhere near that.\n\nAlso, your Mom is 100% right to give you his present to be returned and used to pay his debt. If you were to go to court you would win the case so why shouldn't you have that money? You should not feel one bit bad about it.

If your brother had some sort of mental or developmental handicap I'd say the same thing. In both cases the punishment should not only fit the crime but also we should keep in mind the capacity of the offender in terms of the level of responsibility we hold him to (as to restitution).\n\nBut he's not. He's a 22-year-old MAN who needs to stop acting like a child. Not that an adult can't pull pranks. He can, he just has to accept that he's responsible for the fallout. And of course he shouldn't pull pranks on someone who has sincerely asked him to stop.\n\nI really don't like that your family is bailing him out, but based on everything you've said it could be a LONG time before you ever see that $800. Probably longer than it will take him to save up the $ to buy his own damn video games. Come to think of it, maybe he should focus less on video gaming and more on being a responsible adult.\n\nIt doesn't sound like the kind of thing you should cut him off over. Maybe throw him a little lifeline. With a lot of hard work he should be able to come up with $400/week. If he can give you $400 in 7 days then he buys another week to pay off the remaining $400, at which time he gets his bday shit.

I would also tell him to thank your Mom for paying his debts for him, even if he's pissed about not getting the PS4. Why you're buying 800 dollar presents for this guy in the first place is insane. Even if it was a joint effort to buy it for him. If he wants to be mad, let him be mad. Just move forward. Maybe he'll learn a lesson from it, maybe he'll punch you in your face when he sees you.

This *almost* sounds like something I would have done in my late teens or early 20's. I finally got evaluated in my late 20's and was so off the chart the doctor seemed surprised I had got as far as I did without treatment. I have zero medical training but I'd suggest he might want to get evaluated if that's an option. If If he's like me, he wasn't seeing his actions of pushing you in the pool with long term consequences. Now he's angry because the immediate situation of his gift is somehow connected to a past event. I used to get mad at getting bad grades on my report card but night by night during the school year I'd say I could skip homework or not study for a test. On a level I 'knew' what the problem was and it made me feel really terrible I couldn't do things I wanted or needed to get done, imagine going through life screwing up over and over, knowing why, and not feeling like you could control or do anything about it.

It might help him realize that he hurt you and broke your shit so your not going to \"take a joke\".

His cognitive and emotional (and I'd suspect physiological) responses are not appropriate, ie. I don't just mean they're wrong and bad but that his brain is not working like a \"normal\" human. Best guess seems a clinically diagnosable personality disorder. The reason I say this is not to excuse his behaviour or make you feel sorry for him. But more to suggest there is no point thinking of his behaviour as you would another person's. It doesn't have the same meaning or intent. If he were to recognise that he has a problem it may be possible to get some treatment, but beyond that all you can do is manage him and try not to let it get under your skin. I'd suggest at a minimum that you yourself talk to a clinical psychologist to try and understand your brother and how best to manage him as I would highly doubt that applying normal social consequences to his behaviour will actually help modify it.

I don't know if this is a cultural thing but where I'm from people don't get gifts when they're not in secondary school any more. He should either be studying or working (or trying to get a job and receiving benefits in the meanwhile).\n\nSomething is also seriously wrong with the people around you for wanting to give this guy presents and saying it's bad when his presents are taken away. On top of the 1200 dollars I think he should give you some extra for the medical bill, your clothes, the fact that you didn't have a phone etc. for a couple days, that you quite possibly lost pictures/videos that cannot be replaced.\n\nCut this guy out of your life. A friend of mine once thought it was funny to push me down some steps. Even though I didn't fall I threw him off those stairs. They need to learn to grow up and face the consequences of things.\n\nIt's like people who have a dog and when the dog barks they pet the dog to comfort it which stimulates the dog to bark some more. While he is still \"young\" perhaps you can talk to your family and tell them they need to consequently punish his bad behaviour.",
            "Going against much of the current grain - I can understand why your friends would want to separate his birthday gift from his prank. If a child (thinking age 10 or younger) misbehaves near their birthday/Xmas, most parents will still give the gift anyway because they will have a separate consequence in mind. Also, they wouldn't want to tie in good behavior only around occasions in which there are presents because it then encourages the kids to be brats all throughout the year except during those times. So I can see that while your brother is terrible with boundaries, your friends may not want him to be punished on his birthday for lack of said boundaries and would want him to serve his punishment in another manner. Dick or not, he's still a person who's birth should be celebrated by somebody. (Not necessarily agreeing with that line of thought as he's an adult now and needs to own up to his shit, but that may explain some of your friends' reasoning) \n\n<Edit> Also, taking him to small claims, while a giant pain in the ass, I can see as being an \"adult\" thing to do. (Again, not agreeing as I am for less stress and mess) Because if this had happened to anybody outside of the family, that's what they would have done - take him to small claims. However, family relationships are different, so it's a bit uncommon to go that route unless the relationship has gotten so terrible that court is the last resort </Edit>\n\nHowever, what I see is that your parents giving you his gift to clear his debt is continuing to enable his man-child like behavior as he really isn't serving his consequence - someone else is doing it for him. Your parents are bailing him out, again. Sure, he's mad, but he's lost nothing in that exchange since he never had the gift to begin with. If anything, he's lost relationships and if he's not paying attention to that loss, then I don't know what motivate him to change. \n\nWould he have ever made some sort of reparations? Probably not. But if he is supposed to do this growing up kind of business at the ripe ol' age of 22, then your parents also need to be on board too and stop covering for him. Thankfully, you've already begun that process with this incident. ",

Your use of the name \"Brock\" makes me think of Matthew Lillard in She's All That, and I'm giving you and Internet high five for it, so you should be on the look out for that. \n\n3. Your brother is acting like a child. He needs to know that purposefully hurting his sister and telling her to \"Take a joke\" is not acceptable behavior for a person his age. Telling you to take a joke is showing that he's not really sorry. I wouldn't cut him off entirely, but I would make this clear to him, and that his flippant-ness won't be tolerated by you anymore.

Whatever is to be said for the 'spirit of birthdays' -- and frankly I think it's a bit silly to make so much of it as an adult -- it surely doesn't trump the spirit of treating your family members with minimal decency.

She still complains about it every time we talk though, and she still asks even though she knows the answer is no. Recently, she asked me if I needed her to come visit to help me move. After that didn\u2019t work, she asked if she could come visit in August to \u201csee the new place\u201d and celebrate her birthday. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019d want to see her even if she did quarantine for two weeks beforehand. My mom gets way too pushy when she doesn\u2019t get her way, and it makes me very uncomfortable. The problem is, she\u2019s also extremely giving and generous, so it makes me feel guilty denying her requests. \n\nShe\u2019s constantly offering to give me money I don\u2019t need, and she tries to lend a helping hand in every situation without being asked. She has offered to pay for graduate school for me *and* pay for my living expenses, because she wants me back in school. (We had that arrangement when I was in undergrad, but the money was never as reliable as she said it would be. Having independence and a stable job has been a godsend. I\u2019m never relying on her financially again.)\n\nI almost think she\u2019s generous so that she has leverage to push people around with. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing it in a conscious, malicious way, though. I think she does it because having control and feeling like a good person makes her happy.\n\nIn the past, when I\u2019ve told her \u201cno\u201d, she has gone straight to guilting me. \nOn one occasion, she wanted to stay the night with my partner and I in our tiny little apartment. I told her that my partner\u2019s family, who live in town, would be more than happy to have her as a guest. In fact, they had already prepared the guest room for her. She cried and said that I \u201cdidn\u2019t want her\u201d, and she basically had a meltdown. I told her we didn\u2019t have room or an air mattress, so she\u2019d have to sleep on the floor. I told her that this was unacceptable, and that I would not allow my mother to sleep on grubby carpet. She then threatened to drive all the way *back* home overnight, after having driven all the way *from* home that day. When we didn\u2019t back down, she went through with the threat. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night out of fear, worrying about her crashing the car from sleep deprivation. \n\nMy partner has held my mother in poor regard ever since that incident. He really doesn\u2019t want her to stay with us in the future. I could blame things on him and tell her that he\u2019s the reason why she can\u2019t stay with us, but that\u2019s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don\u2019t want that.\n\n***Actual TL;DR, after writing out my feelings:\nHow do I tell my mother that my home office isn\u2019t her guest bedroom? How do I tell her that she can\u2019t come visit me in August?\n\nI don\u2019t even want to have her sleeping on an air mattress in my home office, because I\u2019m uncomfortable leaving her alone with my belongings. She has gone through my things at least once in the past.\n\nShe keeps texting me, asking me how moving is going. Every time I see her texts, I feel a mix of discomfort and guilt. It makes me want to throw my phone away. \n\nReddit, please help?\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: Wow, I\u2019ve never had a post receive this much attention before. \nIt\u2019s interesting how many comments I\u2019ve received guilting me for not wanting my mom to visit right now. The majority of comments were really constructive and supportive, but a noticeable minority basically told me \u201cyou\u2019ll miss your mom when she dies\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s divorced and lonely and loves you, you ungrateful child\u201d.\nHere I go JADE-ing at those comments. (Good term, thank y\u2019all for teaching it to me!)\n\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she\u2019s completely disregarding COVID, and I am in a high-risk group. My dad\u2019s health isn\u2019t great either and I worry about him, as they live near one another and still see each other.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she doesn\u2019t care for LGBT people, and both my partner and I are bisexual.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because I went on a friendly mall date with a (gasp) non-white boy once in my teens, and she told me she \u201cdidn\u2019t want a nappy-haired grandchild\u201d.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she has had a history of psychosis. When she\u2019s under stress, she can act in ways that don\u2019t always make sense. When I was little, it was worse, and she scared me a few times.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she\u2019s not very good with money, and she has asked me for money before. Even though she makes thousands more a month than I do. (She wanted to buy a big-ticket item, and didn\u2019t want to save for a month to buy it.)\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she handled divorcing my dad really poorly, and didn\u2019t seem to care for how I felt at all. I was twelve. She discouraged me from talking to my dad, took me away traveling on weekends I was supposed to see him, and she tried to get a restraining order on him. She had no reason to do that. She actually took me with her to court that day, and it was all I could do not to run over and hug my dad. I think I did hug him, actually, and he had to tell me it wasn\u2019t allowed. He and I were so close before the divorce, and we\u2019re still trying to fix our relationship.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she didn\u2019t step in or do anything when I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with an adult male as a teenage girl. He was 22, and I was 16, and she let him sleep in her house. Of course I thought it was a good idea at first, but I was in too deep very quickly. He was coercive, mean, and selfish. I needed my mom to step in and act like a parent, maybe by kicking him out and forbidding me from seeing him. Instead, she enabled the whole thing. I had to \u201cbreak up\u201d with this man, and that was only after he tried to coerce me into marrying him.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable with my mom because she always wants me to approve of her bad decisions, and gets angry when I don\u2019t.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because when she saw that I was anxious as a little kid, she forced pills on me and took me to a psych ward (completely unprompted, I was discharged the same day). When I got \u201cbetter\u201d after gaining some independence, I told her that I stopped taking the pills because they made me feel sick. She then freaked out and told me I needed to take them, or I\u2019d get anxious again and \u201close everything\u201d that I\u2019d built. I\u2019ve been trying to make myself \u201cwell\u201d for years. But I\u2019ve never lost control of my life since I got it.\n- I\u2019m uncomfortable around my mom because she  wants me to get married and have her grandchildren, but I would never want her to influence any child I ever had.\n\nBut yes. I\u2019m guilty. Bad and ungrateful child. Going to regret having boundaries when she dies. For sure. (Shame about all the time I missed with my dad that I\u2019ll never get back when *he* dies, but yeah.)\n\nI may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom, but acquiescing to guilt isn\u2019t it, chief. Thanks tho.",

            "**Don't** put it on your partner. For the time being, whenever she brings it up, you say \"Asked and Answered. We are not having guests during a pandemic.\" Do NOT give her a bunch of reasons or justifications as to why, those only give her something to shoot down so that she gets her way. If you're going to learn to say No to your mother, you have to learn to be *unmoved* by her guilt trips. Caring about someone does not give them a free pass to do whatever they want. Love and boundaries are not mutually exclusive, you can have both. Time to be firm.\n\nNext, you furnish your office as your office. Period. If the time comes when travel and visiting is once again feasible, you don't have a bed for her. (She will say \"But you said you were going to get a pull-out sofa for me!\" which you did not. Don't take the bait.)",
            "Okay bad news: you're going to have to tell your mother a firm no, and she's going to be hurt and going to guilt trip you for it.\n\nThis is unavoidable.  So start getting yourself into a headspace where you're prepared for the fact that it is NOT the end of the world?\n\nThink of it this way- she would be happiest with you and her having a great relationship.  If you have to do things that make her temporarily unhappy, in aid of a life where you're a mother and daughter, not a juggernaut and a doormat.\n\nI'd start practicing some scripts.  \"Actually mom we've found it really doesn't work for us to have guests in the office- but I'm going to book you into a great airbnb right near us.\"  \"It's really sweet of you to want to visit- but now is a terrible time.  What about [alternate date that is genuinely the next time you'd like to see her]?\"  \"No, we're not going for a sofa bed- we don't plan on using the room for company, it's going to be desks, bookcases, filing cabinets, etc.\"  \"I'm really sorry to hear that.  Please let me know if you change your mind.\"",

(check out r/raisedbynarcissists or r/justnoMIL for some info and tips from those in your shoes on setting boundaries with unhealthy family members)\n\nEvery time you give an inch, she takes a mile. Why do you think she's so \"generous\" and wants to pay for everything? Because then you're dependent on her and/or you \"owe\" her and it's harder to say no to someone who's paying your rent/tuition/etc.\n\nI'd start by telling her the truth and establishing the boundary at the same time: \"Mom, I've been thinking about our conversation regarding your birthday and I'm just not comfortable with you coming to visit next month and I'm not sure when I will be due to the virus and my health issues. I need you to know that your repeated requests to visit have felt like pressure at best and manipulative at worst, and whether intentional or not I can't continue to worry about having to tell you \"no\" all the time. Moving forward, I will have to end our conversations and hang up if you insist on bringing up these topics or discussing them when I've made it clear I'm not interested.\"\n\nThen follow through: if she asks to visit, lays on the guilt-trip, or pressures you then just hang up the phone/zoom call/stop responding to the texts.",

But you're going to have to get used to saying no to her, and then ignoring her temper tantrums. She will get worse before she gets better - she will try to test your resolve.",
            "The thing with guilt trips is, they only work if you let them. If she throws a tantrum and you go \u2018ok whatever\u2019 and still don\u2019t give her what she wants, nothing happens. She\u2019ll try a different emotional manipulation, you do the same again, she doesn\u2019t get anywhere. She\u2019ll learn eventually. Be strong. Don\u2019t let her manipulate you. If she brings it up, be firm. It\u2019s an office, not a bedroom. You need the space to work, you can\u2019t work with someone living in it. She\u2019s also putting your health at risk with the covid, so that\u2019s another reason she can\u2019t stay. Until the virus is past, you\u2019re not allowing *any* visitors. Be strong.",
            "Please don\u2019t throw your partner under the bus without talking to him first. Please start practicing telling her no. This isn\u2019t just about your physical health now, with the virus, it\u2019s about your emotional health on going. If it makes you anxious to have her in your space, don\u2019t afford her the opportunity. I do the same thing with all visiting relations. They can visit my home and hang out for a bit, but I\u2019m not their entertainer for the visit, and they can\u2019t stay with me. My home is where I feel safe.

            "We used to have this problem with my in-laws. It was our fault, we were just over accommodating. They would come and stay for a week at a time several times a year.

It is in the corner against the wall and only has about 10 inches between it and my LARGE L shaped desk. We don\u2019t call it the spare bedroom, it is the office and it happens to have a spare bed. When people stay with us we let them know my work hours and that I need to use the room at that time uninterrupted. It has worked out well.

            "You say \"no.\"\n\nYou believe that something truly awful will happen, because you've been browbeaten your entire life to never, ever stand up to your mother.  You've been raised to understand down to the very marrow in your bones that to say \"no,\" to refuse your mother anything will bring...well, you can't actually point to a concrete consequence, but you know it will be *bad.*\n\nWhat you fear most, I guess, is *being abandoned.*  You entire life has been spent trying to avoid losing Mommy's love, because such a primal terror is hard to just brush aside when one grows up.  Without an adult in our lives to love us and care for us, we risk death:  it doesn't get more primal than survival.\n\nI know you don't literally believe, \"If my mother withdraws her love and approval, I will die,\" but I'm thinking that it *feels* true anyway?  It sounds like you grew up with little confidence in her love (with very good reason), so you've developed allllll kinds of unhealthy coping mechanisms to convince yourself not only that she loves you unconditionally--loves you for who you are, no strings attached--but loves you in the way you need to be loved.\n\nAnd it is not uncommon for people from dysfunctional or even out-right abusive families to deny or downplay the dynamics--you know, Dad hit me, but I deserved it; Mom would sometimes make me go without food, but I know she was just concerned about my weight.  It's Stockholm Syndrome, all the way down:  side with your captors and maybe they'll treat you better.\n\nYour mother doesn't want, has never wanted, you to be an independent human being with a life apart from hers.  Thus, she raised you to feel total responsibility for her well-being and happiness, ensuring that she would always have power over you.\n\nA *good* parent raises a child who can say \"no.\"  I can say \"no\" to my mother and know that the world will not end.  Hell, I've told my mother to go fuck herself, and yet...we both lived.  Our bonds are strong because they are *chosen,* not *imposed.*\n\nGo read \"The Worst Thing in the World\" by Pervocracy.  The tl;dnr is that pain isn't infinite, and you survive--you don't see how such a thing is possible, but you do anyway because that's how life works.  When your mother starts her extinction burst and initiates what you see as The Worst Thing in the World--cutting contact with you and thus depriving you of her love--you will lay down and wait to die.  And then, in Pervocracy's words, you will get up because you need to pee.  Even as the TWTitW is happening, you still need to pee.  And get up the next morning because you have to work.\n\nAnd finally, let's address *why* your mother damaged you this way:  **she knows that you have all the power.**  You're the only child she has, and if you become independent, then you assume control of your life, up to and including who gets access to it.\n\nSay \"no\" and stand firm.  Weather TWTitW.  Discover for yourself that you will live to tell the tale.\n\nP.S.  If/when your mother threatens suicide?  You call 911.  It will be part of the extinction burst, wherein she will ramp up the pressure to dizzying heights.  Call 911.  The answer is *always* call 911.",

            "Your mom sounds just like mine.\n\nI'm 9 months pregnant, due any day at this point, and obviously trying to avoid getting sick. She's moving into town in two days and will have many people up from a hotspot. She has been guilting me for declining to be there, despite the fact that she has professional movers and more than enough help. I can't even lift things over 5 pounds right now, what could I even do? She's also started referring to me as \"the vessel containing her granddaughter\".\n\nThe point is, she is not thinking about you and your wellbeing, and that sucks. She is making unreasonable demands and that also really sucks. Even finding a compromise at this point would be completely in her favour and leave you feeling awful and putting you at a risk you aren't comfortable with. I just recently got sucked into a similar situation. She made a reasonable request, could I watch her dogs overnight while they stay in their crates in my house while the movers do their thing. Sure. Then she wanted my husband to drive to her new house before work (he starts at 5am and its 30 minutes away) to pick up the dogs, have me watch them all day without the crates (which means I'd have to be up to bathe them before they come into my space) and then drive them back later that day. I refused, because that would mean my husband would have zero downtime, and compromised by saying I could pick them up and drop them off. I felt good about it in the moment, only to later realize I had been duped. Again. Ugh. I'm also pretty sure that when I'm there she's going to try to get me to come into her house with all those people since I'll have \"nowhere to be anyway\".\n\nYou're not alone, stick to your boundaries and stay safe. You are completely justified and valid in making these decisions for yourself and telling her no.",
            "> I could blame things on him and tell her that he\u2019s the reason why she can\u2019t stay with us, but that\u2019s not fair to him. Plus, she might try to retaliate in some way, and I don\u2019t want that.\n\nI'm glad you realize that this isn't an answer. Maintain your boundaries as a united front. Do not shove things onto him as an excuse (even if he offers). Maintain your boundaries. You're doing the right thing so far, and just keep at it.",
            "\"sorry Mom, but that doesn't work for us\". You don't need to justify, but if you'd like to, just say your health is more important than a visit, and you will let her know when you feel it's safe to do so, but \"honestly it's going to be quite a while\".",
            "Your mom is best viewed as a drug. Really. (The best thing I was told.) My mom was much the same.  A TRUE FRIEND told me to \"Just Say No.\" And then HANG UP THE PHONE.  Take care of YOU. And your SO. It's really HARD at first,  but, I promise you,  IT'S WORTH IT.  Because YOU are worth it. Blessings to you.",
            "Setting boundaries against parents is hard. They know exactly which strings to pull to make us feel guilty. After all, they\u2019re the ones who tied them there. You need to be absolutely blunt with your mother. \u201cMum, I love you, but you can\u2019t visit. I am not willing to risk my health just so you can see me and the new place. If you come, the door will be closed and you will not be allowed in.\u201d",
            "> she asked if she could come visit in August to \u201csee the new place\u201d and *celebrate her birthday*. I felt guilty about saying no, so I gave a very noncommital response \n\nSo this \"request\" came after *multiple times* of you telling her no to visits. Yet she just keeps pushing.  August is only a few days away, the pandemic is still raging. She threw in the birthday to try to manipulate you. Even if her birthday is on Aug. 31st, it will be too soon.   \n\nShe doesn't give a crap about the pandemic, the risk to you with your asthma, nothing. It's all about her and what she wants and she'll bulldoze over you to get what she wants, when *she* wants it. \n\nI found it jarring that she immediately tried to piss on your territory and claim the other room as \"*her* guest room\". It's nobody's guest room. Actually, you don't have a guest room or a 2nd bedroom. You have an office, with no sofa bed. Hopefully it's not a big room so that the office furniture can fill it so that even an air mattress isn't feasible.  Put together a list of AirBnBs or hotels nearby. Have it ready to give her. Don't put up with her meltdowns or guilt tripping. End those calls when she does that. Give her consequences and start showing her you're your own, separate, independent person in a relationship with a partner. You have to start saying NO and stop being afraid of your mother.",
            "Your mother sounds a lot like mine. Pretty manipulative and hiding it behind a generous facade. She may not even realise she\u2019s doing it. My mother interpreted it all as love until I straight up told her that ignoring my \u201cno thanks\u201d and boundaries is not love. \n\nI don\u2019t know how your relationship with your mother is, but from your post I\u2019d tend to suggest you first and foremost do not, under any circumstances, fall for her whining and put a sleeping couch in that room. Or anywhere else. And if you do, do not let her know. Because from what you write, the moment she will know you won\u2019t get rid of her presence. She\u2019ll guilt trip you into visiting every week. \n\nThen, I believe you\u2019ll have to deal with the guilt and be brutal. \u201cWe are not having guests during the pandemic. Period. And even if we did, after you keep guilt tripping me and disrespecting my boundaries I wouldn\u2019t want to have you regardless\u201d.  \u201cI won\u2019t furnish that room for you. Case closed. If you must bring it up, then don\u2019t speak to me\u201d. It won\u2019t be pretty, but after the initial shock, if she loves you she will think about it and the relationship will slowly change and get better.\n\nFeel free to ignore what follows and jump to the end, just adding my experience for context.\n\nLast year I had a very similar conversation with my mother. More than a conversation, I wrote her a letter and told her that due to all the disrespect masked as generosity she was to leave me the heck alone. I told her that if she could not understand that love does not entitle her to step all over my wishes, she could keep all her money and gifts and rage fits out of love, and disappear from my life. The guilt was so heavy, and I thought I had lost my mother. But after 6 months of radio silence we sloooowly started speaking again. And wouldn\u2019t you know, maybe she\u2019s still convinced that she\u2019s right, but her behaviour changed drastically for the better. She really took to heart what I told her and now we have a much healthier relationship because we managed to achieve distance. After my father died I was all my mother had left and she just would not let go until I bit the leash off me. Me closing contact gave her way too much time and she obviously used it to focus on herself, get in physical and mental shape, and recover her confidence. I believe that this helped our relationship enormously.\n\nSo I\u2019d say go ahead and put your foot down for real. From your post I\u2019ve got the feeling it\u2019s not the first time that your mother insisted to cross your boundaries. Maybe this will help her realise she has to stop and your relationship will grow. If she is acting out of a place of love, chances are that it will.\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk, sorry for the long ass comment and wishing you best of luck!",
            "Your mom wants you in school living off her money because it makes you dependent on her. She gives you gifts to make you feel obligated to her.

She's gotten you to believe she's not doing these things consciously. \n\nDo not give in to these tricks. Your mother is being manipulative. Decorate your lovely home office specifically without a pull out couch and specifically with no room for an air mattress.

Do not fall for her manipulations.

I would never let her into any contact with any child of mine either. At all.\n\n\\> I may not be sure how to have a healthy relationship with my mom\n\nBecause you can't. It is impossible to have a healthy relationship with a narcissist or abuser of any kind. They are toxic to anyone in their lives. You might as well be trying to have a healthy lifestyle by drinking poison every day. \"How can I make a \\*healthy\\* drink with this bottle of arsenic?\" It makes about that much sense. There is no getting through to her, there is no \"winning\" and there are definitely no positives. I would go no contact or very, very low contact with her and shut her down every time she even hints at trying to guilt trip you. Don't try to justify your No's to her. You don't need to justify a god damn thing to her about your personal life. Nothing good will ever come out of keeping her in your life at all.\n\nTell her you've turned the room into your home office, if she asks, and if her reaction is anything but positive or at least polite, tell her you have to go now, and hang up the phone.

            "Well you have just described my mother & my adolescent years to a tee. Including the inappropriately older boyfriend she enabled. And the: \"when she\u2019s under stress, she can act in ways that don\u2019t always make sense... she scared me a few times.\"\n\nMy mother came & stayed with me in my little 1 bedroom apartment for \"a few weeks\" which became 8 years from age 27-35, no jokes. Police were involved in my moving out (of the small home which **I** rented - note: she expected to keep all my appliances & furniture too!).\n\nWe saw 4 different therapists together in the 2-3 years following, despite this we are now estranged the past 2 years. Got to be honest, after 35 years living in hope about her, and hoping she'd change or see the light, this is actually move peaceful for me. They key was to unlearn being responsible for her life & feelings (she trained me up good for that!). To have compassion for MYSELF. Because... it was always going to be Me or Her. She was never going to be satisfied. There was no limit to her expectations. I finally chose myself. And I realised I had always lived with some level of anxiety all those years, all the time.\n\nHere's the thing, My mother has Borderline Personality Disorder. She remains: untreated, in denial, lacks insight into her behaviour. Highly illogical, highly emotional, quite impulsive.\n\nMedication would help quite a bit, but she won't admit there is ANY kind of problem, the suggestion of a mental health issue would greatly offend her. Would not surprise me in the least if your mother also has a Cluster B Personality Disorder. I can strongly recommend you get this book ASAP: \"Stop Walking On Eggshells.\"\n\nMy advice to you - as a younger me - is: lay down the lines hard & early.

I said I couldn't stop them from coming up to see me in the hospital, but they weren't welcome to sleep in my home.  What did they do?  They got a hotel room.  That's because I have set boundaries with them, and they are punished with low or no contact whenever those boundaries are broken.  So rather than get embarrassed when I locked them out, they decided to get a hotel room like grownups.\n\nI'm telling you this story because there is sometimes hope.  Sometimes JustNos don't have to be blocked and cut off entirely from your life.  Sometimes setting strong boundaries and adhering to them works and they figure out that you are not the one they are going to push around anymore like their little puppet.  I encourage you to give it a try.  Stand up for yourself.  Do not argue with her when she makes excuses for how it can work.  Tell her that you have made the decision not to have her as an overnight guest and that, as it is your home, that decision is final.  If she continues to pressure you, end the call.  If she brings it up in your next conversation, it's time for a time-out.  Don't get emotional.  Don't cry, don't yell, don't change your facial expression to indicate that it's affecting you at all.  You will simply tell her you'll talk to her next week since she is unable to respect your boundaries and you'll hang up.  Next time, maybe it's two weeks.  Next time, maybe it's a month.  Eventually, if she is a teachable JustNo, she'll get that her conduct is not getting the outcome she wants, and she'll cut it out.",

            "God, I can't with this subreddit sometimes. Not every unstable parent is a narcissistic manipulator. Your mom sounds to me like she has some serious anxiety and attachment issues, and while it's way too much of a burden for you, she needs help. Maybe therapy, a book group, some other form of social support might do her some good? She sounds extremely lonely, and while it's not fair for her to push you like that, it doesn't sound like she's trying to control you nearly as much as the commentors here are making it out to be.\n\nI understand that \"grey rocking\" with ambiguity is a way of dealing with narcissists, but not all mental disorders are the same or should be treated the same, and people with attachment issues need different treatment than narcissists do. Brushing her off with something indirect like \"it's because of covid\" or \"we can't have guests stay here\" is only going to put her attachment system into overdrive, because the uncertainty of the ambiguity will make her panic harder. You should be direct with her and let her know exactly how she's coming off, the same way you phrased it in this post. She needs a wake up call about how much she is pushing you away by trying to pull you closer. Unlike a narcissist, someone with an anxious attachment style is still empathetic to the needs of others and willing to modify their behavior for the good of their loved ones, and I think she can be reasoned with.",

It's not terrible, but it's nothing fun when I get a normal chest cold. Because of this (and having only one kidney), I'm cautious and very strict. \n\nMy husband and I developed rules that you may want to adapt for what works for you/adopt for yourself: we social distance 100%. He goes out for an occasional coffee (that we can't make his preferred way at home). And I go out for groceries. I work remotely (otherwise would be driving to a hospital....where there's been covid since the beginning--no thanks!). We hang out with friends doing things like kayaking together.\n\nWe see NO ONE who has been to a high risk area/facility unless it has been two weeks since the last time they were there. No one. Literally no exceptions. His mom works at a hospital as well (different state than us, not the same one I work at). In the beginning, we wanted her to switch to full time remote, since she was already working remotely part time. She refused bc \"she's essential\"......(I just blinked at the phone when she continued to insist bc she isnt--she oversees the mandatory annual HR-required education for some of the staff...and is already set up to do 50% remote). \n\nFast forward to now, she's still working at the hospital (where there are covid pts...) And she's meh about precautions. As more and more research on the virus is being done (which I work on some of it), my husband and I increased our precautions.....which meant no seeing her until she went at least two weeks without putting herself in a high risk setting (her work). She **refuses** to accept this. Every time we talk to her, she asks something. Continued commitment to our boundaries is the only option we have and I think it's what you may want to commit to as well.\n\nAs far as your home, I think one idea you might be able to say (which you'll have to repeat a million times) is \"you know mom...the townhome is shared space for myself *and* my SO....I don't have the only say on how this space is used. I have to compromise with the person who's name is also on the deed\". \n\nIt's totally understandable that your SO wouldn't be a fan of your mom.

            "You are getting some really good advice in the comments on how to approach the conversation so I won't get into that too much. I would suggest looking at your area and finding a good hotel that is close that she could stay in for a night or two when it is safe for her to visit again if she doesn't want to take the option to stay with your partners parents. When it comes time to have that conversation, don't throw your partner under the bus for reasoning. Just tell her you furnished the office as an office and that you want it as your office and nothing more. You can tell you that the two of you prefer to not have visitors that stay over and sleep in the space, no matter who they are. You can also say that the two of you don't mind visitors during the day but that you both prefer to have your space to yourselves in the morning/evening time. This sets the boundary for visits on a United front. \n\nSetting boundaries with parents is hard. My mom separated and divorced from my dad a few years ago and in her moment of deciding to focus on her and her needs, she picked up quite a few narcissistic qualities.

            "I'm not sure if you'll ever see this, but I think I can share some wisdom. You described my mother so perfectly that I'm shocked, so I think I have some relevant advice for you that I had to learn the hard way over the years.\n\n1. Even healthy boundaries will make people mad.  The anger does not mean your boundary is unreasonable or even hurtful. People like your mom and mine do not accept boundaries well and there's nothing you can do about that. If you expect that going in, it's easier to hold firm to your boundary even in the face of her anger. \n\n2. However much you do to please her, something new will upset her tomorrow. It's inevitable. So instead of constantly trying to meet her needs to keep her happy, ask yourself what YOU want. If she's going to be mad at you for something new tomorrow, you may as well do what you want today. (Provided it's not deliberately hurtful, obviously).\n\n3. You cannot reason with crazy. I am NOT calling your mom crazy, but the expression is relevant and useful here.  I'm saying that her behaviour in the face of conflict seems immature and you cannot expect to successfully reason with someone who is not coming to the table as a healthy, reasonable adult. Trying is only wasted energy and emotion. State what you want and don't feel the need to explain it so she understands and sees your side. It's unnecessary and likely not possible.  With my mother, I always tried to get her to \"see the light.\" Once I accepted that she never would, I stopped trying and it's been a weight off my shoulders.\n\n4. Finally, and I think you know this already, generosity does not give her a free pass for poor behaviour. One does not negate the other. So let go of the guilt about what she has given you and allow yourself to objectively see her behaviours for what they are.\n\nI hope this helps. It's a complicated thing to love someone who is simultaneously so genuinely loving and yet so manipulative. We were never taught that those two things could co-exist in the same person.",
            "Have you ever heard of love bombing? She's showering you with affection and generosity, in order to manipulate you into gettting whatever she wants. It is not generosity and altruism. It is a manipulation tactic from the get-go, and a very unhealthy understanding of boundaries. If you see it for what it is, any guilt tripping will be less effective. I have a friend with borderline disorder, for whom this is her primary MO. It's extremely stressful to everyone else, and a lot of people get strongarmed and guilt tripped into things they don't want to do. And when she pretends she just wants a little favor, as soon as you do it, because you want to get her off your back, you find out it's just a first part of a much bigger favor, that she'll piecemeal by little bits, so that you never actually see the full size of it, but that also gives you anxiety, because then you never know whether what looks like the end of it is the end of it.\n\nI am the friend that says no. Learn to say no. You don't have to justify it. It's no. Why? Because you said so. Do not let her push you back on this. The guilt tripping works less when you realize that there is malicious intent behind it. She knows why she's doing it. It's to force your boundaries. What you can do is establish them. And when she pulls a histrionic fit to guilt trip you, you can always take away your privileges. Like after that drive home. *Look mom, I love you, but last time you came, you pulled this, and this won't fly. If this ever happens again, I will have to cut contact, because this just won't fly. Keep pushing me for a visit when I said no, and the next time you ask when, the answer is going to be never*.\n\nAnd you have to follow through. This friend of mine, that insists I am her best friend (we don't have that kind of connection, it's a guilt tripping tactic) tends to delete friends from social media histrionically, when she doesn't get what she wants. Then she'll send a friend request a day or too later as if nothing happened. I refused to add her, pick up her calls, or respond to her messages for almost a year after that. When I did eventually concede to talk to her, I established that if she pushes me on things or pulls a hissy fit when I'm not willing to do her biding, that's it, we're done. It's hard for her, and sometimes she can barely help herself, but now I am the one friend she hears no from and accepts it.\n\nOnce again, you do not have to, and shouldn't have to justify yourself. It just gives her an argument to disassemble.",

You can only   support her. \n\nOnce you are both in convo and in your own core self. Then and only then you can explain why you don't want her to stay or whatever feelings you have left over against her. Compassion is the key to compromise. Win-win. Coach her in being authentic. No mother wants to hurt her kids. But she is probably to blind or scared to open her eyes. Find out why.",

            "Seriously related to a lot of this. I am a bit older than you by a little more than a couple of years and the promise of financial support never being as stable as promised is what I remember most. I\u2019m also reeeeeaaaaallllyyy seeing what it\u2019s like to not have boundaries set. Like I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever recover. If I could live in your shoes I would almost be vicious. I could also tell myself it\u2019s totally okay to make her not want to come to visit because I\u2019ll make it miserable for her but that\u2019s just me. Other answers are better advice but do what you need to do and if you think you\u2019re being too nice, be mean or maybe fierce is the right word.",
            "Setting boundaries to your mom is 100 % needed. I can relate a little, my mom also has a high need for helping us, due to unhealthy mental issues of her own. But to a faaaar less extent. Wow, how have you managed to still have her in your life. And to get to a healthy place yourself, that couldn't have been easy around her. Well done. \n\nI think you have every right to protect yourself by not having her visit. And I totally understand you are so tired of the way she acts that you don't want her there at all now.\n\nI think the best way would be to tell her what is going to happen. For example, tell her that Covid19 is still a threat and that you fear for your health. Corona doesn't only lead to death, there is also risk of reduced health for the rest of your life. So you are going to assess the situation until *Christmas* and will consider how you can *safely meet her at that time*. You don't even need to mention the room.\n\nSo what to do when corona is no longer a threat? Well, I don't think she will accept it whatever you say. Choose something and stick to it without budging, it's the only way. You could foster a child on the brink of death in there and she would still insist something ridiculous.\n\nI hope you have good relationship with your dad now.",
            "It wouldn\u2019t matter if your mother was Mary Freakin\u2019 Poppins. If you feel uncomfortable around her and don\u2019t want her in your home, then don\u2019t host her. And don\u2019t listen to idiots who call you selfish because they are incapable of understanding your relationship dynamic because they get happen to get along with their own mom.",
            "Oh my gosh, OP, I think you and I have the same mother. I mean, some differences, sure - for example my mom DOESNT like that I take pills/go to therapy for mental health b/c she feels that it is somehow a negative reflection on her. But it many other ways, eerily similar. We\u2019re in the process of buying our first home and this is literally an issue right now (she wanted to send HER BED up here and make us put it in the guest room so she and her partner will have \u201ctheir own place to stay\u201d when \u201cthey come up to go skiing and shopping.\u201d). I don\u2019t have answers, but I feel what you\u2019re going through, and if ever you want to vent, DM me. Sending love.",
            "Absolutely hold your ground about visiting during Covid, and make that room your office for day-to-day. But if you have the space, a guest room is a much more pleasant way of hosting guests (her or friends in town) than putting them in your shared space, so it wouldn't be the worst idea to have some kind of pull-out sleeper or air mattress, even a small one.",
            "Sounds to me like gaslighting is one of the primary flaws of how she handles not getting her exact way. I don't mean to assume, but you mentioned your parents are divorced. Did your father ever discuss the reasons with you? Meltdowns and tantrums over compromise, which is not denial of her requests/demands, simply just making it easier to give her what she wants, is borderline psychotic. She has to get her way no matter what. She's very clingy and sounds like a regular Marie Barone. I hope you figure this out, but you should probably try to break the ice on the subject of compromise and the subject of independence for yourself as a young working adult.",
            "Don't make it a bedroom in any capacity, solution. \n\nThe real problem is your mom is pushy and you don't stick up for yourself.",
            "You need to read the book Emotional Blackmail. There is a lot of practical advice.",
            "Check out the sub r/raisedbynarcissists. Your mom sounds a bit like she is one. Even if she isn't, it'll likely be able to provide good tips for dealing with her.",
            "Hey please check out r/raisedbynarcissist",
            "r/raisedbynarcissists vibes :( please stick to your boundaries. Do NOT let her in your new place, especially if she hasn't quarantined herself in the first place. Do not make a spare bedroom just for her, use it as an office space just as you intended. She is probably using money to control people or feel in control! Financial abuse is a thing and it's real.",
            "Hey! Your mom reminds me of my mom. My moms is a BIG narcissist. I see people have already told you to see r/raisedbynarcissists. I understand 100% the guilt you feel because she sometimes is really nice and cares a lot about you. Unfortunately this comes with a \u2018charge\u2019 of I want it my way and HOW DARE you say no to me? \n\nIf we take in all these, you see you  guys need boundaries. So when you tell your mom the other room is for work, it is for work. Make it clear: there is no couch, sofa, mattress or whatever.\n\nAlso, as someone who suffered from asthma, your mom doesn\u2019t care she might make you sick (and your partner, but you are higher risk and her daughter)? She is probably feeling lonely and missing her daughter, and that\u2019s mom\u2019s love. But, come on, how come she is only thinking about herself and disregarding your health? \n\nTherefore, here\u2019s what you need to say to your mom: \n\nMom, I love you and look forward to seeing you when the pandemic has passed, specially because I have a higher risk of getting sick (and dying if you get coronavirus). \n\nAlso, for the other room, you should mention that you and your partner are making it your offices and that this is the purpose of the room. \n\nIf you and your partner don\u2019t want your mom visiting for a while, maybe tell her you\u2019ll come to her as soon as the pandemic is over?\n\nOr you could take the weekend off (when corona is over) at a hotel in a touristic city where you live?\n\nThis is all love, but with boundaries. People who tend to become drama queens when they get a no need strict and firm boundaries. If she starts crying and saying you don\u2019t love her and stuff, tell her you won\u2019t stand for this kind of behavior.\n\nWhen my mom starts screaming, crying etc., I just stay silent and go somewhere else. When they see they behavior won\u2019t get her attention, they stop.\n\nHope you can solve this. If you want, talk to me on Reddit messages or whatever.",
            "I think your mother is very lonely\nYou could tell her you are not meeting anyone during the pandemic.\nBut that you would love a few days away with her after it. Which could be lovely and you could do this many twice yearly. This could have good memories for you when your mother has gone.\nThe man who who said threaten her with a care home must be a terrible person.\nKeep kindness in you heart she is your mother.\ud83d\udc9e",
            "Disclaimer: Until C19 is over no-one should be staying in your home whatsoever, including your mother.\n\nShe's your mother and her requests aren't completely out of order so your options are limited unless you want to distance yourself from family completely.\n\nHaving your office in the spare room is perfect, as even if you did include a pullout bed (by the way investigate a pull down instead, I have a double in my home office that folds up flat to the wall and is surrounded by storage) you can legitimately say that you cannot have anyone staying long or showing up unexpectedly as you need to be able to work.\n\nIt really isn't unreasonable for your mother to want to come and visit and stay a night or two. I would look to set a specific date for a specific occasion in the future and make it clear that is what works for you.. and also make it clear to your partner that family means doing things occasionally that you might prefer not to do.",
            "I'm sorry, this isn't helpful but I stopped reading after noncommittal response- if she were any other person disregarding your concerns how would you respond? How would you handle anyone who wasn't your mother imposing on your comfort, your security, your space and privacy? Sorry bit fuck that. \"NO.\" There's a saying about how \"No.\" Is a full sentence all in its own, or something like that. If she doesn't accept your explanations, she's have to settle for your declarations. No.",
            "Your mom is treating you like a queen.   So either offer her the spare room or abdicate and quit accepting her gifts.  This is on you.",
            "NTA. Even at 1200 SQ fr it's a small space. You need an office to work only put a desk in that room (maybe a treadmill I'd it fits). That's the room where work stress lives. It's occupied. It's not a guest room. Offer to pay for a hotel next time she comes.",
            "Ok. So there's several things going on. In the end you just don't want her sleeping over at your house because she's gone through your belongings before. This means that even if she accepts the pandemic and your condition as a good reason not to visit now, you will have the same problem in a few months or next year. Since she keeps asking, there's no point in giving temporary excuses because her asking will never stop. Are you ok with her never visiting you? I live abroad and can't stay with my mother because her house is cluttered with junk. I've told her this hurts me that with several extra bedrooms she can't keep one tidy when I need to stay a few nights on visits but she just doesn't care or can't deal with her hoarding issues. Either way it's negatively affected my relationship with her because my only option is staying with my father where I'm not that comfortable for multiple days either. I refuse to take a hotel in my hometown when both my parents could comfortably host me if they got a handle on their behaviour, but apparently they don't care enough. I love them both but like I said, especially the relationship with my mother is damaged because of this. As a consequence I hardly spend any time with her when I do visit but in my eyes, that's her choice by having all her bedrooms full of clutter. If you're ok with a strained relationship like that, you just need to tell your mother that you aren't comfortable with her spending the night because in the past she's violated your privacy by going through your stuff. If she then is happy to take a hotel and still see you for an afternoon and you're happy with that, cool. If alternatively refuses to visit, then so be it if you are ok with that.\n\nIf you do want your mother in your life I think you should host her but talk about rules for when she's visiting. Either way you need to tell her that it's not HER guestroom but YOUR office since you work from home and that she wouldn't be your only guest. And also that because you work from home you will not be able to host her for expended periods or frequently.",
            "Take it from someone with a lot more experience than I care to admit.\n\nYou're only 24.  He's only 24.  He's only your boyfriend.  She'll be your mother your entire LIFE, regardless of her horribly immature and clingy behavior.  **SHE** will be your mother every single day of your life - and then one day, she'll be gone.\n\nThe chances that your boyfriend will be your boyfriend **your entire life?**  Not even remotely close to the same odds as your mom being your mom for life.\n\nSo the lesson here is to **NEVER, EVER** allow your boyfriend or live-in partner to dictate how you treat your mother.\n\nNever, **EVER** allow him to do that.\n\nBecause the day **will** come when you will not be able to forgive yourself because you allowed him to influence your decisions regarding your mom and you treated her more harshly than you would have had you been on your own. I promise you, that day WILL come.\n\nAnd when it does come, the likliehood that you'll still be with THIS guy is 50/50 - at **best**.\n\nMy point is, be very very very careful about letting ANYONE influence how you treat your mother.  Because in the end, it's ***you*** who has to deal with the regrets and misgivings you'll feel for how you treated her.  It won't be him living with that, it will be YOU.",
            "Block her. Go no contact for a week and give a reality check after. Make it clear that the only direction she can push you is away. If she tries to guilt you about visiting, asker her point blank if she wants to kill you. Be firm that your needs are more important than her wants and if she doesn't want to talk to you like a peer then you're done listening.",
            "People really on here citing \"J.A.D.E\" and calling your mom a narcissist to make her look like a terrible person who takes pride in guilt tripping you. Imagine treating your parents likes this smh.\n\nPlease I know I'm gonna get dvted to hell but re-evaluate the relationship with your mother. Look at yourself in the mirror. I hate to be blunt but you sound selfish. You don't want her to sleep at your place, 2020, Covid I get it. It sounds like you just simply don't want to see her at all and are using covid as a scapegoat. Forget about all the things you dislike about your mom and focus on how you can stop resenting her. When that happens, a switch will flip and you will miraculously find a compromise on spending time with each other. \n\nSeriously, my gut would wrench just having thoughts like that about my mother. 64, who knows what she's dealing with and maybe feeling alone/depressed. Could something possibly be wrong? The people on here saying their mothers are just like this are the same ones who fall into a Deep depression after their parents pass away because their relationship was shit. Real talk.",
            "Your mother misses you. If you ever have a child you will understand.",
            "FROM EXPERIENCE \nIf ur mother is able body give her and out date!! Give her time to process and get her things together so she can move out!! Allow her some time but before she moves in let her kno her time limit and stand on it but be reasonable",
            "I fully agree on the 'no guests during a pandemic'.\n\nOther than that, I can't help but feel a little sorry for your mom. Yes she's terribly pushy, maybe you can address that with her? But the idea that my child moves 8 hours away from me and then won't let me stay even 1 single night.. \n\nI immigrated across an ocean and let my mom stay 7-10 days in a row because she's my mom and because she's hurting because I moved out of her life. I wouldn't want her to come every month, no, it's quite overwhelming when she comes, but that's the downside of moving so far from home. Did your mom do anything to deserve going no-contact?\n\nPs: My mom slept on an air mattress stuck between the couch and the tv, fortunately we upgraded to a house with a guest room since then."
