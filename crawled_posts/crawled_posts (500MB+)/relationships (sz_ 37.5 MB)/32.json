On one hand, I don't want to violate my daughter's privacy and trust, but on the other hand, I received countless comments and messages from people telling me how they related to my Mia's situation and wanted nearly as badly as I did for her to find happiness. In the end I decided that while I am not going to tell Mia about this post, I think she would be okay with me sharing vague details in order to benefit other people like her.\n\nSoon after I made my post, I visited Mia and she told me about something she and her therapist had been discussing. Mia said that if she was going to be alone, even if it was just for a little bit longer, she at least wanted be happy with herself. (I think she worded it as saying that was the person she was hanging out with the most, so she needed to like them). So instead of pursuing friends for the time being, she was going to make herself happy.\n\nWe made a couple appointments for superficial things, she got her teeth whitened and her hair dyed. She also bought some new camera gadgets so she could start practicing photography.\n\nThen came the really big decision. She told me she wanted to start taking classes at a different college (film school). I don't know why it never occurred to me but it seems like a natural choice given her love for film.\n\nWe were only a few months away from when this school's semester started, but because they were small and somewhat under the radar they were very accommodating towards us and I managed to enroll Mia in 3 classes for the fall semester. I was very stressed during this time, but it ended up being worth it.\n\nAnyway, Mia started school and is absolutely loving it. The best part, and the reason I am making this post, is because she instantly attracted a bunch of new friends! Mia is very shy so I can tell she's a little overwhelmed by all of this attention all of the sudden, but she is obviously very happy. Instead of teary skype calls she now gushes to me about how her day is going.\n\nYou guys were all right. She just needed to find a common interest to meet new people and make friends, and that interest turned out to be movies. \n\nI hope this helps those of you who messaged me, and I also hope you now know that even if you think you will be alone forever, don't give up! Maybe you just haven't met the right people yet. \n\nThanks again reddit.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Mia has friends now!",

Despite a brief period of \"improvement\" he quickly went back to his habit of what I considered abusive tendencies.\n\nI joined a support group shortly after my original post. A few weeks after that my coworker walked into our shared office and found me crying at my desk...again. I've been friends with CW for a while, careful to talk as little about my home life as possible and for some reason that day I just broke. I let out years of feelings on the poor man and he just sat and listened. Him just being a kind human made me realize how bad I had let things get. Simple kindness is strange to me. People asking how I am and actually caring is a foreign concept that I distrust. I felt (and feel) stupid and pathetic.\n\nIn the past month I felt myself very drastically distancing myself from my husband. He became suspicious, went through my phone, and read my Ejournal. He was furious when he read that I spoke to CW about my feelings, accused me of cheating, and threatened divorce. This time I just said \"fine\". So we're done. I moved into the guest room\n\nA few of the original commenters called BS on the autism excuse he used, they were right. A few nights after I moved into the guest room he stumbled in (very drunk) and said that he had been cheating on me. I don't even care if its true. The second I agreed to the divorce I just felt relieved. I also feel guilty for being relieved but the second I agreed, I realized his s\\*\\*t isn't my problem anymore.\n\nI'm made regular appointments with an abuse counselor at my college who's helping me sort through the nonsense I put myself through. I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore.\n\nTL:DR: Original commenters called it, he just didn't care enough. Husband didn't change, threatened divorce again, I said \"fine\". We're over, and I just feel relieved.\n\nPS: Bought a lock for my bedroom door as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall edit: I realized that I failed to mention a few things on why I'm staying in the house: We do have a daughter (9), and kids make things a little trickier. I am in an intense nursing program and only work (very) part time as a tutor. He works nights so our interactions are limited to the two days he has off. I leave before he gets home and when I'm getting home from school, he's out the door. I know it would be best to find a place to stay but the resources in this area are extremely limited. My college is literally in a cornfield.\n\nI also want to thank you all for the support, I have felt so lonely for months and to have strangers be so kind means a lot to me. I'm definitely going to download  that book, \" Why Does He Do That?\", and make the time to read it. \n\nWe were married for 10 years and one commenter did the easy math....Yeah I was 18 when we married, 17 when we met. I was fresh out of a physically abusive relationship, and he was so nice to me.  Again, the kindness and support means more to me than I can express, I'm determined to be a stronger person and trust myself again.",

It's more likely that abusers prey on people who are like you: people pleasers who want to go with the flow, who make up excuses when people treat them badly, who have porous boundaries that are consistently violated, and who are empathetic and desperately want to believe in the best of people so they give second, third, fourth chances. \n\nJust like a lion on the plains can sense the weakest, slowest gazelle, so can abusive people sense potential victims.

Autism is not a crutch to enable underperformance. If anything we put pressure on him to go beyond what he thinks he's capable of. It's not a license to be rude, annoying, or awkward, because even Aspies can and should learn how not to do those things like everyone else--they just have to work harder at it. We explain to people who may not be aware of his condition that he has these 'tics' but also do not pretend those behaviors don't exist, but try to teach him not to get carried away.\n\nIf your pre-ex husband can hold down a regular job and keep regular friends in his life, the problem is not his autism, because these high-functioning behaviors demonstrate he can turn off his abrasive personality whenever he wants. It also means he never turns it off for you, which should be the one person in his whole life apart from his daughter, for whom he \\_should\\_ turn it off.",
            "I'm really proud of you, OP. That must have been such a difficult choice.\n\n I have a co-worker with an abusive husband (not physical, so she doesnt see his actions as abusive) and I wonder how long she will stay. I fear it will be forever. She doesnt value herself enough to leave and it breaks my heart for her. She confides in me and it's so hard to hear.  Just really proud of you for making the right choice.",
            "> I blame myself largely for enabling his behavior, maybe if I had tried harder to communicate earlier in our marriage we could have fixed it. Or if I had not been so afraid of the fighting and avoided raising issues, we could have made it. I'm not sure but it's not really relevant anymore. \n\nThe way he **chose** to behave all through your relationship is not your responsibility and not your fault. Every time he treated you badly, every mean thing he said, every cruel comment, every single thing... he **chose** each and every one. He's a bad person, he's always been a bad person. There is nothing you could have done, no way you could have behaved, no magical words you could have ever said that could change his **choices or the fact that he is fundamentally a bad person.**\n\nHow do I know he's a bad person? Because NO ONE who is even just a decent person and who loves someone else, really, ever say's something mean/cruel/hurtful even in the most intense of emotional moments and then is incapable of apologizing and feeling terrible for what they said or how they behaved.\n\nHis abuse of you was not about some failing of yours, it wasn't about you, it wasn't personal, hell it wasn't even about your relationship. He has treated every past girlfriend like that, and he will treat every future woman in his life like that too. Because he's a bad person and this is how he treats intimate partners.\n\nHe chose how to talk to you even when he was angry. You think he never gets angry at his co-workers or bosses or random people during his day? He chooses not to speak to them the way he does to you, you think he'd last 5 minutes in a job if he was unable to moderate his behavior and choose his words?\n\nHe is a bad person. His behavior is not your fault. The end of your marriage is not your fault. Don't be so eager to scoop up all the shit he's dropped everywhere and carry it around with you as if it's precious. \n\nI wish you a wonderful new life once you're away from this guy. \n\nAlso, google \"Why Does He Do That Lundy Bancroft PDF\" and read it. I think it will help you out.",

With a lot of people like that it's not that they can't behave like normalish members of society, it's that they refuse to put in the effort to behave normally. Others are just straight up misanthropes who use aspbergers/autism as their get out of jail free card for acting like assholes. ",

I blamed her for a lot, but I look back on it a lot, and the more I do the more I realize what a piece of shit I was. How i hurt her. How i could have been better. It's not your fault.

I did some thinking and decided to break things off so I broke up with him over text. He tried to explain himself. He said he panicked when he saw me and didn't know what to do but I didn't think I could get past that incident. He begged me to take him back, but all his efforts were in vain.

            "When I first saw this update I hadn't seen your original post, so I figured this was maybe an online relationship and he's meeting you for the first time, saw the wheelchair and panicked then drove away.\n\nThen I looked at your original post. Nope, he knew you'd been paralyzed and when you asked him for help in getting your wheelchair into his vehicle when he came to see you, he got angry with you then drove away.  \n\nThat's not someone panicking about you being in a wheelchair. That's someone who was being an asshole that didn't want to help you with a very, very reasonable request. And who did something really, really crappy to you making it all about him. \n\nThe fact that he then doubled down on trying to excuse his reaction and to insist you take him back instead of being embarrassed or even having come back to help you says loads about his overall character. Not just in this one situation, but on a long-term basis.\n\nLife is too short for this type of nonsense or to be with people who pull this type of nonsense. Good on you for sticking up for yourself and not tolerating the BS. Also panic and stress don't cause people to become total jerks like that unless they're already jerks to begin with, or at least that's been my experience.",
            "Well, I\u2019m glad you let that loser go. \n\nFunny story though..I was meeting a guy for the first time and after chatting online. He showed up at my apartment to pick me up (I know stupid, but it was like 8 years ago) and I get a text that says \u201cI can\u2019t come to your door, I didn\u2019t know you have stairs.\u201d I was confused and went to look for him. \n\n\nHe hid the fact that he was in a wheelchair. I let him know id be ready ASAP and meet him at his car. I went down and he was gone.\n\nHe texted me and said he was embarrassed. I told him not to be but it helps to be honest up front , so you can avoid those issues.",

Looks like you on your way!",
            "Definitely made the right choice. My ex once told me he would leave me if I became 100% deaf which is a very real possibility. \n\nTwo months after I married my husband I became really sick, he learned all the best ways to look after me. I have to use a wheelchair for long distances and places with rubbish air qualities like conventions and he uses me as a shelf and battering ram (I started these jokes) and we have a great time.\n\nYou'll find someone who will see you for who you are and not your chair, enjoy being single and good riddance to him!",

THEN LATER, he could've had a heart to heart talk with you and said look I can't do this in the long run, and either remain friends with you or not.\n\nInstead that motherphucker told you he wasn't your maid or personal assistant, I can't remember what he said, to do it yourself, THEN HE DROVE OFF, OH MY GOD. Who does that?! Even strangers would've helped you.\n\nBut there are seven billion people in the sea, YOU WILL find someone who will stand by you. \n\nI don't think you should have broke up with him over text though. You should've did it in person.\n\nIs your paralysis permanent or temporary? \n\nI'm glad you ditched a heartless person. You can't stay with someone like that, you will see his horns come out again in various situations, he won't stand by you or he may eventually leave. \n\nLife's too short, find positive people who will stick with you in the bad ugly times.",

I think your ex boyfriend is worried about what other people think if they see his girlfriend is disabled. It shouldn't matter, even if they did judge him (people don't give a shit, trust me), and you deserve someone who realizes it doesn't matter.\n\nP.S. In my nearly 6 years with my wife(married almost 2), of all the people we've ran into over those years, I don't recall anyone looking down on us and judging her for her disability, if anything, people run over and try to help when they see she is having trouble.

He did apologize i mean you at least should have talked to him. I think its so childish to break up over text. I ever have a suitor that did that i would be that much more suspect of her.   \n\n\nI mean do you have guys beating down the door? I hate to say taht but he was willing to accept something many men could not. It is hard to get used to not just for you but also a bf. I mean you can meet someone who knows the situation and it can be hard for them.   \n\n\nI know reddit=dump them but i hope you did not throw away an otherwise good relationship.

He gives htat up\" Bets of luck dear. He was a jerk but one thing like htat does not make a guy a horrible perspective mate.

She knocked out a 4 year degree in 3, earned an MBA, works at a huge firm (is a rockstar), met me/continues to put up with me, and is an fantastic mother to our children. My wife transfers into her car easily, but I get to literally sweep her off her feet every time we take my truck somewhere. Yeah, there are other complications, but we\u2019ve always managed to find solutions. You\u2019ll eventually find the same, but don\u2019t be in a rush. Enjoy yourself and get after it.

I woke up yesterday morning and told my boyfriend that either we\u2019re going to have a serious adult conversation about the future right now, or you can pick a time later today. After a bit of back and forth, he picked 5pm. At 5, we sat down on the couch and discussed each of our goals regarding marriage, children, employment, etc. We also discussed concerns that each of us had, I started out with mine and then I think that helped him voice his concerns, the largest of which involved my family (they are complicated). I think me forcing the scheduling of a time to talk helped him open up about his concerns.\nNo, I don\u2019t have a ring on my finger yet, but my goal was to get him to open up about why he didn\u2019t want to discuss it. We ended up talking for about 2 hours and I made clear my timeline requirements and he agreed. I feel like we\u2019re in a good place now. Thanks again for all the love and support \u2764\ufe0f\n\nTL;DR finally got my boyfriend to talk to me about the future and I feel good about it.\n\n[Original Post Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ldajij/my_boyfriend_27m_refuses_to_talk_about_marriage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying that this doesn\u2019t change anything and I should have broken up with him, and giving an ultimatum is going to backfire, etc. I didn\u2019t give him an ultimatum. I never threatened to break up with him. I told him what I needed from him and we talked through a lot of questions and concerns(from both sides). It wasn\u2019t a one-way conversation like you all seem to have assumed. Thank you to everyone for your continued support! I hope those of you who feel like relationship issues can never be resolved find happiness in your own lives \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEDIT #2: For everyone saying that my \"timeline requirements\" sound controlling, you must not be women who want to have children. Sorry, but I'd like to have kids and unfortunately my clock is ticking; I think wanting to be married by the time I'm 30 is pretty reasonable. For everyone saying he's just telling me what I want to hear and will keep pushing me off, I understand your concern, but the conversation we had leads me to believe otherwise. I know that sounds fishy, but without relaying word for word what was said, I don't really know to explain it. Again, thank you all for your comments! You're really helping me think through everything from every angle.",

            "This is a great update and I'm glad you two were able to talk. But coming from a person who has been married for 10 years and we still have communication hiccups, please work on communication before you get married. Communication in any relationship, at any time, is hard. And you cannot have a healthy relationship when neither of you are getting your needs met, or when you're not telling each other your concerns without pulling teeth.",
            "This is what I started to do with my husband, we would pick a day and a time for when we were going to discuss important topic or decisions. My husband did not like to immediately start talking about big life decisions in the moment but knowing that there is a discussion that was going to happen allowed him to think about it beforehand.",
            "I read your original post and I remember thinking uh, oh- that's not going to go well. I'm so pleased that I was wrong! Keep up the communication and good luck!",

I'm happy for both of you, that's actually something to look forward to, it's a good thing that u were able to come up with that hard topic that usually puts people on the verge of tears and discomfort and to come out of it unscathed, with a smile in your heart, well that's a Great thing, now your future is ever brighter, I'm deep down happy for you and yuur boyfriend, make the best of it.",

You deserve better.",
            "I understand that you want to get married and want a timeline, but I would strongly caution you against putting any kind of pressure on him to marry or commit to a timeline. Especially if he is the type of guy to not talk about things. It's just a recipe for huge disaster, especially for you. If the guy genuinely doesn't talk to you about marriage or the future, he isn't interested in it. You can create a timeline or say whatever you want, but in the end, you're only in a bf/gf relationship. This means that you and him only have as much say in each other's lives as you let him/he lets you have.\n\nIf you pressure him, mark my words, you're headed for trouble.\n\nYou might ask: What do I do then, if I'm wanting to get married? Then you go find someone that is as excited to commit on paper as you are.\n\nEdit: before you downvote, realize that I'm just speaking from my own experiences as a guy in her b/f's shoes and so I'm playing devil's advocate.",
            "So essentially he can procrastinate until your timeline and then keep pushing it out.",

            "Sorry, I'm going to be the bummer:\n\nSo, you're still considering marrying someone who will not answer a direct question.\n\nNow you know he will ignore, evade and deflect any problems until you badger him into SIMPLY a conversation.\n\nAnd do you want to live the rest of your life knowing not only that he will evade coversations, he will NOT bring a problem to you on his own?  \n\nMany people just do that.  Even men can say, hey honey I love you but we need to talk about your family.  And even the people who might not feel comfortable to bring it up can ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.  \n\nGive him about 8 more years and see how that goes.  Will he EVER confront a problem head-on?  (And please do NOT have kids with him until you know if he can be a PARTICIPATING Adult.)\n\nEven if he changes a lot but you ALWAYS have to take the lead...  Are you okay living like that?  Forever?\n\nI wasn't.  Sorry if you think I'm raining on your parade but when I'm seeing all these thunderclouds, I'm trying to pass out umbrellas.\n\nBest wishes and take care of yourself.",

I\u2019m sorry but this isn\u2019t a win Reddit post. I\u2019m sure more people here feel the same. Just a stall for you to get past it but you\u2019re definitely in no plans for his future.

Sucks but it's true, if they don't talk about a future with you it means they don't see one with you or just not ready at all. We have to move on and stop wasting our time.",
            "Why anyone wants to be in a relationship where you have to force someone to want to be with you through ultimatums or \"timelines\" is something I'll never understand.

            "I would ask myself if you want to be with this person, whether or not you get \u201ca ring on your finger.\u201d Also, if someone wants to be with you you shouldn\u2019t have to \u201cput your foot down\u201d to get them to talk to you. They want to be with you, or they don\u2019t. It\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to be with THEM. If you both decide that\u2019s what you want, you make it work. If one person is on the fence, that\u2019s their answer for you.",
            "I'm so glad you were able to have this conversation \nI had the same trouble with my boyfriend, who became my fiance, then my husband. Even after we were married for six years, he wouldn't talk about the future with me- not even about taking a vacation or looking ahead to replace a car that was steadily breaking down or deciding we didn't want kids or career goals or ANYTHING. It was exhausting and got increasingly lonely over the years. Nothing would happen unless I made it happen. No conversations would happen unless I asked repeatedly.\n\n He is now my ex.\n\nWhat I mean to say is not doom and gloom, but that it might be worthwhile to encourage him to get counseling to deal with possible anxieties he might have that could be impacting this kind of thing. I tried to get my ex to, but he didn't until I left him. By that point it was too little and too late. In my own experience, if this is an issue you can address and address thoroughly now, please do. You're not overreacting.",
            "> I think that helped him voice his concerns, the largest of which involved my family (they are complicated).\n\nExcept you failed to get from him the answer to the real question that is holding up everything:  Does he or does he not demand that you cut yourself off from your family before  he agrees to even consider marrying you?\n\nBecause I think he just told you that but didn't tell you in such an explicit way that would make him seem the bad guy.",
            "Ugghh this sounds all too familiar.\nIt's not going to work out in your favour, honey.\n\nBut I hope it does.",
            " I recently implemented scheduled conversations with my husband about money/budget/bills because this topic is stressful for me and when he brings it up at random times I tend to resist having any discussion.  Now that I've retired, and there are a lot of changes to our financial picture, I just can't afford to do this any more, o we agreed to \"lunch on Monday\" updates on this subject.  That gives me a chance to mentally prepare and manage my anxiety and takes away my excuse to avoid participating in this conversation.\n\nNeeding to schedule a conversation certainly is not a reason to end a relationship, as long as the scheduled conversations lead to progress that is satisfactory to you.",
            "Very interesting topics, I've read both of them. Respect to you that you put your own interest first, and you chose what is best for you, even if that is later than sooner.\n\nMy only gripe with this is: You said you guys were together for \\~8 years? It's frightening that in 8 years he did not ask you what you want from life, or expected that things are good the way they are. I don't know if that lack of proactivity might be a dealbreaker for me, but still, as a man, I would NOT wait for 8 years to find out if my partner is ok with me and if her end goal has already been achieved. I understand some people test waters and maybe at the beginning they are not sure about what they want in life (you were 19 when this started), but still. If you hadn't started that conversation, how much longer would have he waited and went on like this?\n\nI've read your whole post again and in the past \"He said he did not want to talk about it right now\", \"he shoved you aside\", and only after you put your foot down suddendly \" he agreed to openly talk and also agreed to your conditions and timeline\".\n\nI don't want to offend you and make a wrong guess, but again, very fishy.\n\nNote for self: Have the important discussion (future, end goal, marriage, kids) as soon as possible with someone. It seems marriage/kids is a big deal for many women, it seems low level just to run around the bush.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, Congrats and good luck in the future!",
            "I hope you know he\u2019s never going to propose to you out of his own free will.\n\nYou\u2019re going to have to painstakingly drag it out of him just like you did this conversation.",
            "Yea well...so nothing changed. You still have no answers. You are STILL waiting your ass off. And you will be waiting some more then coming back on here and complaining again about this loser doing this again and again. Nothing changes. Congrats on giving him more time woopdyfuckindooo",
            "Congratulations!  Happy for you that this issue got resolved.",
            "Good on you for communicating your needs. However, please be prepared if he doesn\u2019t meet your timeline. \n\nYour BF sounds like my ex who also never wanted to talk about the future. I said I wanted to be married by the age of X and guess what? He didn\u2019t deliver. \n\nI am now with someone who excitedly talks about marriage and the future (we\u2019ve only been together for a little less than a year and agreed to live together before making this jump). It\u2019s a huge difference from the guy I used to pull teeth just for a conversation about where our relationship was.",

            "I'm so glad you had that conversation. Having an open dialogue is so important for any couple and I'm so glad that you guys were able to sit down and have it. I also think it's really great that he felt he could express his concerns and you also got to express yours all about building a strong relationship and that starts with a good foundation and communication. Keep talking even if you both take time once a week to sit down and have meaningful conversations. \n\nYou are 100% right. That it is not a one way conversation and giving ultimatums is not the way to go. Hoping for the best for you guys.",
            "I don't think you should give him an ultimatum and I think you are doing what is best for you. It's nice to get people's advice but I wouldn't listen to every single one. You gotta remember that a lot of people are looking at your problems through their life experience lens. So they will project a lot of their thoughts and feelings on to you. Hope this helps.",
            "I think this might be your go to in the future for serious conversations: \"I want to have a talk about X. What time do you want to do it?\"",
            "Stating your goals are to be married and have children isn\u2019t an ultimatum. Saying you want to be able to start by the time your 30 bc of fertility may seem like an ultimatum but it\u2019s a time limit set by our bodies and I completely understand. your not 21 giving your bf until the new year to put a ring on your finger, your giving both of you the opportunity to live the life you want by speaking up before time is wasted.",
            "Heyo, \\_really\\_ glad this seems to be moving in a positive direction for you! I can't agree enough with the counseling/communication work. It's important for all romantic situations, whether they're in a positive or negative spot.\n\nIn my wife's and my experience, counseling was a great way not just to have our concerns voiced, but to learn how to navigate addressing those concerns ***together***. This is the life that both of your are claiming you want to sign up for, so showing up together to do that work helps to solidify that commitment for everybody involved. \n\nIf you continue to respect each other's space, pace and feelings with things, there is a way to talk it out. I hope that both of you take this approach as a precedent for other difficult topics that will inevitably come up (life IS, after all, a constant state of un-satisfactoriness).\n\nGreat job to you both :D",
            "I really hate toburst your bubble here, I know time is of the essence for having children, but if you have to be the one who forces him to committ to you it will never work in the long run.  He will cheat or leave.  He's not excited to lock you down?  He doesn't like you that much and isn't sure about a future with you.  Sorry that's just the truth.",
            "I don't think that after being in a relationship for 8 years that wanting to have a talk to make sure you're on the same page regarding the future is at all unreasonable.  And the people hassling you for that - well, /r/relationships is just flat out weird sometimes. (Particularly with anything to do with traditional relationships/gender-roles - total red flag to a bull.)\n\nThat aside, I would be worried that you're not getting sucked into a sunk cost fallacy.\n\nYes you've invested 8 years of your life, and if you had to start over from scratch you'd be 35 when you get to this point again.\n\nBut if you sink another 5 years into this relationship before giving up and tossing in the towel, you'll be **40** by the time you get to this point again (if it takes you another 8 years).\n\nSo be careful that you're not being fobbed off with a minimal response that just maintains the status quo for another couple of months before some other minimalist token gesture is called for again.",

I\u2019ve been trying to help as much as I can, I encouraged her to go to a therapist and tried to make her feel loved and comforted at home but instead she\u2019s been throwing herself into work nonstop for probably 6 months at this point. I\u2019m talking 6 am until 9 pm every day.   \n\nShe\u2019s not only pushing me out but she\u2019s pushed anyone who asks about us away too. From what I\u2019ve been able to gather from mutual friends she\u2019s working even harder now, and destroying her reputation at work while she\u2019s at it because she\u2019s micromanaging everyone. \n\nSince she left I\u2019ve been asking her to go to couples therapy with me but she won\u2019t. She refuses to even try and save the relationship. She said it\u2019ll just hurt like this again when it happens next time, but I can\u2019t convince her that there doesn\u2019t have to be a next time. That no matter what we aren\u2019t the same people we were before she left me and that if we try and work together we can grow from this and be stronger. She can\u2019t see any of it and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s completely ignoring what she\u2019s doing by working so much she can\u2019t think about anything else. \n\nI hoped her mom could talk her down but she threw me under the bus the second she realized if she pushed back my wife would cut her out, despite the fact I took a lot of time off of work last year to help her after the funeral and after she had some surgeries. My wife\u2019s best friend from work and another of her close friends messaged me separately and both said she\u2019s not acting like herself but they can\u2019t say anything to her or she\u2019ll push them out too. It\u2019s like everyone is just giving her room to self destruct.\n\nI keep telling myself it\u2019s going to be ok, she\u2019s going to realize she doesn\u2019t have to do this, but it\u2019s been 20 days and I\u2019m starting to lose hope. I don\u2019t know what to do. I have my finances in order I know what I can and can\u2019t do on my own, but I can\u2019t leave because I\u2019m not giving up on her but every day I wake up surrounded by the cold remains of \u201cus\u201d and it hurts so bad I can hardly breathe. \n\nTl;dr my wife is having a depressive episode (I think) and left me.\n\nEdit -\nI think I might have misrepresented what I'm doing. I've cut contact. I'm not spamming her or trying to make her talk to me anymore. The first few days I tried everything I could think of, but I do respect that she needs space and I've since cut all contact unless I absolutely have to talk to her and even then it's only about logistics.\n\nI've examined my financial situation and I've made plans on how to move forward and I plan on doing it. I'm going to the gym to help with the anxiety and stress, I'm eating healthier, and I'm trying to find a therapist for myself. I'm doing everything I can to actually move on and get through this.\n\nThe problem is just that I feel a lot of guilt about, what if she's actually in crisis and I leave. Everyone else is ready to just let her self destruct so they can pick up the pieces later and I feel like that's not what she needs. The other side is she won't let me help so I don't have a choice but to go and that hurts too.\n\nI also know I'm being unfair to her mother and friends in this post. I have told them all during our separate conversations that I understand why they're doing what they're doing but it still hurts all the same. I do want them to be there for her if she'll let them.\n\nAlso -- I 1000% agree that this is very one sided. I'm literally just saying what I understand to be happening and I fully accept that I don't know her reasons for doing this and that's part of what makes this so hard. I thought we were good at communicating to one another but apparently I thought wrong or something changed and took that communication with it and I didn't see it.",

People in depressive episodes often cut away their support network and that seems like what she is doing. It sucks, but at this point you need to worry about protecting you. I'd talk to a lawyer.",
            "Wow. Well she sounds very determined.\nI guess get some therapy/support just for you to make sure if what you think. \nThen prepare? You feel blindsided and want to get her back? Or move on?",
            "Had something similar happen to me and while it has worked out in the end, it took a full year. I obviously can't say with any degree of certainty your situation will improve at all. \n\nYou've made it clear to her you're going to give her space so do just that. Cut contact with her unless she contacts you first. Try not to think about her. Get yourself out of the house as much as possible so as to not wallow in the memories of you both in that space. \n\nIf you keep texting, mailing, phoning or whatever that is the opposite of giving space and she will resent you for that and it might make things so much worse. \n\nKeep yourself occupied.",
            "It sounds like a very depressive episode. You can't force her to do anything. It sounds like she needs space and is ignoring you to get it. I would just send her one last email- you're giving her space, you want to try counseling,etc.. but otherwise you should start seeing a counselor alone and start to process this.",
            "My boyfriend did this out of grief as well. I can say, trying to stay and fix it has only hurt us both and has been more to damaging the relationship in his state of mind. I wish I would have just taken the space but the same, no one could tell him anything or he would cut them off.\n\nYou know yourself and your wife so take this as you will, my advice, give her the space and give yourself the space as well for your mental well being (it will drive you insane trying to figure out what you did wrong, what changed, etc..)\nIt may take time or she may never come back to the person she was. As a partner you accept both outcomes but in this scenario, for yourself, take the space. You decide how you want to deal with it and how long you want to wait. You still have a say in all this even though it seems like its external factors affecting your relationship, you have a right to be happy.",

So she is cutting you out so she doesn\u2019t feel hurt if you leave. I\u2019m just a young person saying what I think is going on.

I have a friend who was in an open relationship for almost 10 years and they broke up a few months ago. He also said \"it's great, we're totally on the same page\" etc. etc. and she broke up with him from what his perspective was out of nowhere, but essentially she had been in an open relationship for him and suddenly realized that it wasn't what she wanted anymore and one of her partners helped her realize that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust seems like this is an important component that may be influencing her decisions.",
            "You have run directly into three of the unwritten rules of life:\n\n1. Everyone does things for a reason and sometimes it's just not clear what those reasons are. You are trying to guess the reason your wife bailed but in time, the real reason will probably become clearer. I applaud you taking a big step back to wait and see.\n\n2. Blood is thicker than water. You should not hold it against your Mil that she sided with her daughter. That's just the way it goes, most of the time. It sucks, but that's the reality of the situation. Don't take it personally. \n\n3. You can't control how other people behave, only how you react to them. You are doing as well as could be expected with this one. You are entitled to feel extremely hurt by your wife's behaviour. No one could blame you for ending your relationship with her over this. That said, if you still love your wife and want to try to fix things, you need to put that hurt on the backburner while you give the situation time to play itself out. Only you can decide to whether to do that and if so, for how long. At some point, your heart will tell you enough is enough and you will be ready to move on.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
            "If your wife won't go, maybe individual counseling could help you get some perspective on this. I honestly don't know what's going on, but maybe if you talk through it all with a professional, they might have some more insight for you.",
            "looking at your other comments in your profile (open marriage, etc) i\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more going on here than you\u2019re representing",
            "This almost identical thing happened to me. The friends, the family, they all acted exactly the same. She met someone else. She didn't tell anyone until much later. Maybe that's not it in your case, but if she pops up in a serious relationship in 6 months, I'd have a tough time believing it's a coincidence.\n\nThe thing is, it doesn't really matter. Based on what you described, it's over and she is not on the fence about it. You should be turning your attention inward and start moving on. It was actually easier to move on when I found out she met someone but that's because I was like you and holding on to hope. Let yourself feel the pain, talk to a therapist, be with friends and family, and start the healing process today. I'm a happier and better person than I was before it all happened. Life does go on, and from the sound of it, there is probably someone out there that is better for you anyways. But most importantly, learn what you can from the experience and grow as a person.",
            "That's not what ghosting is. To be blunt, she dumped you. Ghosting would be if you came home one day and she was gone and you never heard heard from her again.",
            "I'm on the other side of this situation right now maybe I can offer some perspective.  I broke up with my gf of four years, from her perspective it was out of the blue.  I was unhappy in the relationship for a number of reasons, and was just a poor communicator.  She suggested couples counseling but I declined, counseling is for people who want to save the relationship, I don't.  I love her and I'm trying to limit contact with her to spare her feelings, dragging it out will only make it worse.\n\nThe prepared statements are interesting.  I'm not good at confrontation, i don't think on my feet while discussing emotionality charged issues, therefore I don't say the things I want to say or say them the way I want to say them, it sounds like she may have a similar issue and is coping with it.  You might have to do some self reflection here too, are you over baring when discussing things with her, she might be intimidated.",
            "She's not ghosting you.  She very clearly told you it's over.  I'm sorry.  You need to move forward with your own counseling and find your way to heal.",

            "As much as we'd all like to have a postmortem on relationships that don't work out, we don't always get that. I think your wife has been pretty clear that she doesn't want to work on or continue a relationship with you. That's painful, and I really empathize with you and understand what it feels like to be totally blindsided like this. But you need to work on your next steps and healing yourself now. It sounds like it's a good time to try some individual counseling, and also to talk to a lawyer because if she's blowing up her life you'll want to make sure she doesn't take you out with her. You don't need to file anything until you're ready, but at some point one of you will have to. You can't make her stop self destructing or really even save her from herself, you need to worry about you right now. But you will be ok, and you won't always feel like this.",
            "Everyone seems to be covering the bases of depressive episodes and whatnot. I'm going to point out the counter and give you somethign to consider.\n\nI don't know you, just delivering a possibility. I was with my husband 13 years. It took me a LONG time to realize that he was emotionally abusive. I put everything into our marriage, absolutely everything. I begged for couples counseling, but he insisted no, we didn't need it. He blamed my mental illness for everything, when instead it was simply gaslighting (confirmed by peers). I decided to leave him when I was out of town on a vacation. It was a gaming convention he didn't want to go to, but my only way of seeing most of my friends. We had a fight on the phone the day before I was supposed to return. He asked if I wanted a divorce (it was very heat of the moment I know he did not expect my answer). Yes. I drove down the next day, grabbed my stuff, and left. He thought I was avoiding him, but I needed to finally break free. He said I blindsided him. I hadn't, but he had refused to see what I was trying to say for months. Honestly, I don't think he realized he was being abusive (again, despite what I would say, it would get shrugged off as me being \"crazy\", despite him meeting the checklist for both narcissistic personality disorder and emotional abuse). He begged me to come back, he reached out to my friends and family too. I'm not going to say you're abusive, because you've given no indication. Is it possible? Maybe. But I wonder if she's been giving off these signs for a while that she was over the relationship and you didn't see them, or didn't want to see them.\n\nAs for your wife's behavior after she left, it's possible she's looking for a fresh new start, or needs to bury herself in work and other stuff.",
            "Red flags everywhere brother...\n\nThe biggest: \"Prepared statements\"\n\nShe's done. No ifs ands or buts, it's over. After 2 ex wives and raising 4 daughters, I can tell you this: when they take the time to do that, there's no coming back, it's over, there's no \"saving\" anything. \n\nYou can't force her to talk to you, and talking to her family and friends will just drive her (and them) further from you. \n\nLike a lot of the comments already made here, it's time to look after yourself both physically and mentally, accept it and go on with your life. \n\nIt's not a \"good\" or \"bad\" thing, no one is evil here. She lost her dad, threw herself into her work...been there, done that; it's a hell of a pill to swallow, took me about a year to get somewhat right in the head after I lost mine.\n\nBest advice I can give ya: Tell her you love her, you understand and that you're there for her. Let her know she can stop everything and change her mind if she wants at anytime before the divorce is finalized. \n\nOther than that, get everything going and go on with your life as if she's not coming back.",
            "Beloved, you can't win here. She left you. You don't get to decide if that was a good decision or not.",
            "What might be going on here is some kind of mental break where the trauma of losing her dad has pushed her over the edge. At first I thought it was likely she had a side piece at work. But the more I read, the more I think she is trying to micromanage the world because she feels out of control. She very well could be pushing you away because she can't control you or she doesn't want to be vulnerable if (or in her mind, when) you either leave her or die (both of which are out of her control). \n\nIf I'm right, there's not much if anything you can do to change her mind. She has to see her behavior as a problem before she will seek help. Until she seeks help, you and your relationship are a threat best dealt with by going no-contact. Anyone else trying to help her will be seen as trying to control her.\n\nThe question is what are you going to do about yourself. My recommendation is individual counseling ASAP. A good therapist/counselor will help you stay centered, help you see her and yourself clearly, and protect you from further mental damage. Long term, she may come back once she's thinking clearly again. There's no guarantee, but I have seen where people go a little crazy for a few years after a traumatic loss and then have to come back and rebuild relationships. You have to decide whether you're going to hold out hope for that, or you're going to move on after giving her some time to figure things out.",

Shes textbook narcissist and I never saw it until it was too late. I still don't have answers and I never will. I'm heartbroken and confused, but take comfort in knowing that it gets a little easier once you start allowing the anger to come. I seriously thought my ex wife maybe had a brain tumor because it was so out of the blue. She even took our dog. She refuses to see anyone and now I hear Shes dating again. It makes me sick to my stomach every day. We may never know why, and it's awful. But just know, if she wanted your help she would take it. It was hard to hear for me, but it helped me just to almost make it a mantra \"she doesn't feel bad about leaving me and she doesnt miss me\" . it's not normal behavior and you deserve more.

            "The same thing happened to me with my ex-fiancee. Her dad had gotten cancer again and even though I was there beside her and her family through it all, she left me. She told me that she wasn\u2019t the woman I needed in her life and I never heard from her since other than a text here and there. Her dad ended up dying and her mom died a few months later. She called me to say it was all my fault that she didn\u2019t even get to spend time with them. I reminded her that we were there every day when her dad was in the hospital. That was about 2 years ago. Now I don\u2019t let anyone get too close me because of all the pain I felt when she left.",
            "You mention that at the request of having marriage counseling she refuses because it'll hurt too much the next time it happens. So the question is the next time what happens? It sounds like she implies you've wronged her despite you saying nothing has happened. Even if she's not saying it or she doesn't even think it, it sounds like she wants you to feel at fault in some way. \n\nThis certainly could be just a bad depression, but be careful ruling out that nothing else has happened or will happen.  When people ate in a dark place the don't follow the same set of rules they normally a abide by.  I'm not saying she's cheating, but it might be more likely than you think, if she's at work all the time it might be a coworker (and could explain the self destructive behaviour as she punishes herself). People in a bad place are very secretive, other coworkers and close friends might still miss it. Maybe that's not it at all, just don't expect her to be herself, trust isn't a luxury you can afford her anymore.

            " This will probably be buried, but here goes.\n\nI never married my son's mother (not for lack of trying). We had a young child, and she went off the deep end with drugs and alcohol after he was born. I blamed myself for our problems, even though a lot of them weren't my fault. I thought that I could repair our relationship, win her back, and everything would be all sweetness and light. Boy was I wrong.\n\n The tough, painful lesson that I learned was that relationships always need the efforts of two people if they're going to work. If one person stops putting in the effort, the relationship will fail, no matter how much the other person tries. If your wife has packed up and left, and told you it's over, well then it is truly over. There's nothing you can do about it. The reasons why don't really matter.\n\n I tried to hang on to my son's mom for months after she left. All it accomplished was to further alienate her, and humiliate me. \n\n When the realization that she was never coming back finally hit me, it was like having a huge weight lifted from my shoulders. I began focusing on myself and my relationship with our son. I went to school, started a new career, got married, and have custody of my son. She never got better.\n\n My advice to you is to just accept that your wife is never coming back. Focus on rebuilding your life, and bettering yourself. Don't waste another second pining for someone who won't give you the time of day. Life is just too short.",
            "Well, she's not ghosting you because she told you she was leaving you; I mean maybe it's depression, but also maybe you need to really reflect on your marriage and how well it functioned as a partnership.",

She started grasping for control in all her relationships, going so far as to tell me that if I ever did some unnamed thing to her, she would have her lawyer tell me never to contact her again. Questions were meet with cruel accusations. I still don't know what the mysterious trigger for being cut out of her life would be.\n\nThe reason I'm sharing this is that my mother felt the loss of control due to my dad's sudden death so deeply that she went to crazy lengths to regain control in all other relationships. She threatened more people than me with the loss of, well, *her* if we crossed her in any known or unknown way. I couldn't get my mother to therapy, but I got myself there eventually. I learned to accept that I could not change her one little bit, and that she was never going to be the mother I had always hoped for.\n\nPlease, please seek immediate therapy. Tell them you are in crisis. If a friend is seeing a therapist, use that connection and ask the friend to seek a referral for a friend in crisis. Use the word crisis, because it's true. You need help, now.\n\nFYI, my mother did come around, but not until long after. Don't wait for that day and seek help NOW.",

Let her know your capable of moving on as well.",
            "Sounds like the death of her father broke her. Like she can't control anything and that things will never last. Then she starts to overwork herself and as you said micromanage everything that can be managed and be kept under control. Starting to see that everything has changed for the worst and that there's no point to things now since it'll all end. Because things can't stay the way they were.   \n\n\nInstead of couples therapy, she should probably see someone on her own.

            "So no one else has said this yet but I think what you said is pretty concerning. If she's behaving erratically at work, not getting enough rest, very suddenly tried to break up with her husband, threatened to cut off her mom and her friends are contacting you concerned, I would seriously be considering contacting authorities about a mandatory psychiatric hold. It may not help your relationship (she might be furious with you), but it sounds like she needs serious help. Do you feel confident that this episode isn't going to culminate in her hurting herself?   \n\n\nOn the flip side, keep looking out for yourself. Eating healthy and going to the gym are great, but this is a hella stressful situation and if you can see a therapist for yourself I think that would be great.

            "I'm really sorry, your wife is right at the age the women risk hitting a mid-life crisis, in this case triggered by the death of her dad. Much like when this happens with men, it can end up with a dramatic and total personality change. We don't talk about women's mid-life crisis, but they do happen (typically between 30 - 45 for women, & 45 - 65 for men). \n\nWe all wrestle with our mortality and aging impacting our sense of identity and & self confidence regardless of gender, and for some people the stress of facing these unstoppable inevitable things causes a break in personality as they try and escape acceptance. This break can look like a few different ways, but almost always involves completely abandoning the previous life and alienating everyone they used to know one way or another.\n\nAgain, I'm terribly sorry, but unless she's able to admit that there's a major fear she's wrestling with and gets the intensive professional help she needs to navigate this without blowing up her entire existing life, there's absolutely nothing that can be done for this and by trying to pursue her beyond where you're at, you're only going to perpetuate your own suffering. \n\nReally the best thing you can do right now is get yourself into individual therapy to help you cope with the grief and anger her behavior is (totally understandably) causing, so that you can extricate yourself with as little damage as possible and be able to build a new future for yourself. It may also be possible that a professional can help you word a last attempt to get her to accept what she's going through, but honestly that chance is extremely slim judging by how determined her behavior is at this point. \n\nFocus on yourself friend, I know this is utterly terrible and you're desperate, but there's no magic words to fix this :( you have done everything you can, at least you can be sure of that. Now it's time to look after yourself as well.",

It will seem impossible to believe at this point but trust me, in time everything gets put into a more acceptable reality.   I feel for you and I'm sorry you have to be going through this.   It gets better with TIME!!  Also get rid of anything reminding you of her that you can throw away or lock away for a few years.  It only makes things worse.",
            "Just playing devils advocate here - I left my ex husband 2 years ago. He was emotionally abusive and Gaslighted me for years. He spoke down to me until I felt worthless. Of course in his eyes, because he was a narcissist, he felt I was out of my mind to leave him. We lived in a small town at the time and he told the entire town I was depressed and left him because I was depressed about things that had nothing to do with him. I couldn\u2019t talk to him without drafting well worded replies because I was out of practice at conversing with him rationally. Anything I would say, he would turn around on me. So my replies were rehearsed and guarded. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your situation is the same as mine. There does seem to be some similarities, but I don\u2019t know the inner workings of your relationship. All I can suggest is that you take a look at your own behavior, stop trying to phrase it to yourself that she could only leave you because of issues with her, and let her have her space. If she comes to a realization that you are her path, then great. If not, then I am sure she will find her way and you will find yours.",
            "I'm really sorry you and your wife are going through this. This post has made me reflect on my own past actions. My ex was in your shoes some years ago. My dad died suddenly. It hit my ex really hard, to the point where he had time of work with stress and felt he had to look after me. I, on the other hand, threw myself into my work and continued to live my life. I grieved privately, but didn't let it impact my routine. Cut to nine months later and we were having the \"I'm not happy in our relationship\" conversation and I left. I'd had doubts about whether I really loved him for months, if not years, but had always thought it was a phase. Outwardly, we seemed the perfect couple and my ex never suspected my doubts. Because of the relatively recent bereavement, my ex assumed it was a delayed response to that, I'd come around eventually and we'd get back together. In my mind, that was never going to happen. I'd taken a long time to realise that I wasn't happy and didn't want to be with him anymore. My mind was made up and I'd grieved the relationship even before having the conversation. No amount of counselling was going to fix how I felt. I now appreciate that to him this was raw and out of the blue and he thought he could do something to save it.  He was also shocked at the rejection after all the emotional turmoil my dad dying wrought on him.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that she may still be dealing with her bereavement, but this could be unrelated. \n\nAlso, she might be cutting you out because she doesn't have the emotional capacity to deal with her own pain let alone yours as well. All you can really do is make sure she knows you're there for her as a friend, but don't burden her with your pain. Easier said than done, you love her and want to keep her safe, but she clearly doesn't need that right now.",
            "\nShe may be in some kind of crisis but if you have reached out to her and she doesn't respond, then that's all you can do.  You should be the one she responds to the most, and she isn't.  It sucks to know but she has cut you out of her life right now.\n\nWeirdly, she hasn't asked for a divorce so she may think there is some chance to come back, but if you don't like this and you can't get any info from her about this kind of timeline, you can only proceed forward with what you think is a good option with the information you do know.",
            "Unfortunately, your wife is surrounded by people who would rather maintain the appearance of a healthy relationship than step up and confront her behavior. If she\u2019s spiraling into a mental health decline, the people closest to her are acting like an audience. This isn\u2019t going to help her. Individually you may not have an impact on her but as a group willing to support her, you need to come together and stage a \u201clife\u201d intervention.  You will need to rely on each other to come together to talk to her. This needs to come from a place on genuine caring, love, and a desire to help her *if she needs it.* \n\nAs much as it hurts, we can\u2019t always save people from themselves. Sometimes people make poor life choices and they aren\u2019t suffering any mental illness. If the group of you gather and approach her and realize she\u2019s just decided she\u2019s living her new version of an authentic life and she\u2019s changed her approach to living as a result of her father\u2019s passing, you have to accept what she wants for her life doesn\u2019t include certain people or relationships. It could be mental health or it could just be her having a new perspective on life. I\u2019ve had the latter happen.\n\nSeveral years ago, I salted the earth of multiple relationships, both family and friends. Everyone thought I\u2019d lost my damned mind but the truth was, I was seeing clearly for the first time in years. They felt I was being irrational. Instead, I\u2019d taken some time to think about what I wanted in my relationships and discovered I was surrounded by people who weren\u2019t good for me. I went no contact with a father who\u2019d been physically and emotionally abusive. I ended a 20 year friendship with someone who I had thought was my best friend but was really my biggest enabler for self doubt and negativity. I moved across the country, changed career focus, and set out to change *for the better.* Having been raised around bigots and abuse, I shed the racist, homophobic energy from my life and their inability to see they were flawed in their thinking meant I was the problem, not them. \n\nI had a small group of friends reach out to me and ask what the hell happened and that made all the difference between me feeling like I was completely alone and having a small but important circle of support. The love and support of that small group of friends meant the people in my life were positive energy while I was working very hard to divorce the negative energy. \n\nSometimes love and friendship is doing what\u2019s best for someone else even when it isn\u2019t what you want for yourself. That small group of friends was willing to risk alienation over the illusion of friendship.",

Like others have said it sounds like she\u2019s spiraling, but I would say it\u2019s not depressive but manic. She might have some undiagnosed mental illness, bipolar disorder or something, and the loss of her father triggered it, leading her to extremes. Instead of couples therapy, it might be beneficial for her to go to therapy on her own or even see a clinical psychologist who can prescribe something if necessary.

            "I think you are correct that your wife is in the midst of a deep depression. Unfortunately, when tragedy hits, not everyone deals with it the same way. The fact that she's not acting herself, her friends are concerned about her, she's thrown herself into her work (avoidance), and has cut herself away from you... It all points to that. Additionally, depression can make you forget your love for your partner (until you get it treated), which may be why she's pursuing a divorce. Would it be possible to organize an intervention for your wife? Her friends, any of her relatives that are open to it--and plead with her to get professional help? It sounds like she should really be seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist at this point. I'm so sorry you are going through this.",

I've dealt with depression my whole life and my mom has always told me that in order to get through it, you have to do just that, go through it. You have to feel every single bit of hurt before you can heal from it. Shes feeling it but trying to fight it.

Even if it means (for example) moving into a smaller house. You can definitely always be ready for her to return and y'all will manage with what y'all have at that time.

Part of overcoming depression is building self reliance and as idiotic and unproductive as it may *seem* sometimes destroying your own life so that you can build it back up is necessary for people to see that they are in control of themselves and they can change their reality.\n\nIt's just so hard for their loved ones to watch.

And that was the reason for the separation, she just didn't want me in the way of her partying lifestyle any more. But she couldn't admit that, so she just didn't give a reason.\n\nI highly suspect there's another guy at the heart of this, and that it's been over for her for a long time.

They have to not only take action to be better but they have to want it as well. Not for you or even the relationship itself but for themselves.

You also mentioned that you were able to talk before she left.

It's somehow comforting knowing that im not the only one who is dealing with this. See, I'm going thru this with my husband right now, too. His dad (who was very abusive and drunk during my husband's childhood) had a stroke 2 years ago in November and our marrige has been getting harder and harder ever since even tho we love eachother very much. We were moving out of state for a clean break from his family (toxic) so we could have a chance to start over a bit,  but i moved first and then he just never came up here to meet me. It's been 4 months. He won't answer my calls/texts since i left. He moved in with my best friend + her husband back at home, but they barely talk at all and if i come up in conversation he gets upset and leaves... she keeps me updated on him and I guess he is taking care of his father, even tho the man is awful to him and we had set him up eith a care giver situation.   He texted me 3 weeks ago and told me he knows we have a good marriage but he is depressed and doesn't know how he feels about things. It hurts for about a million reasons, but one of them us that i gave up a lot to help eith his dad after the stroke (even tho he has always treated me very poorly) and after almost 2 years of working part time to care for his father i have run thru almost all my savings and am now starting from sctratch. I had to move into my parent's basement because i couldn't afford the place we were planning on moving into. I feel so abandoned. Our dogs are even depressed. I can't do anything.",
            "My husband did something similar, but not quite as severe. And I have suspected for years he has untreated depressive episodes - maybe even just lingering depression. \n\nI gave him his space. He wanted out, I obliged. I moved on with my life. He came back and begged and pleaded to let him back in my life. I told him I'd do this, but never again. He continues to have periods of depression where I feel that my behavior (needy/clingy) exacerbates his want to escape. I find I have to give him space. And eventually he'll come back around. It's the hard part about living with someone who has mental health issues. They're sick, but they don't want to admit or acknowledge they're sick. And in case anyone is wondering, I had suggested to my husband that he was depressed and his was response was \"but I don't feel sad\". So, he believes some strange trope about depression - and no matter what I tell him he doesn't believe it because he doesn't FEEL like he thinks it should feel.\n\nNo matter what, you have to move on and do what you need to do for yourself. This is a form of emotional abandonment on your part and if she DOES come around you have to decide if you can trust her to not do this again to you, because I am going to bet in some way, shape or form she will do this again.",

I can\u2019t say I understand why she would act like this, but I\u2019ve been on self destructive benders before and there is absolutely no stopping me once I hit that roll. Literally, nothing. \n\nI think the best thing for you to do is give her the space that she wants and try and just work on yourself. You\u2019ve done everything you can and if she doesn\u2019t want your help and won\u2019t take it then that\u2019s your answer. I\u2019ll predict that soon she may lose her job and some more friends and will hit rock bottom; that\u2019s when she\u2019ll come back to you. So just take some time for yourself, like she\u2019s doing, and think about the relationship. Will it be worth it to salvage if she does come back? Maybe you\u2019ll decide to move on too. Only time will tell.",
            "Sorry for your struggle, it sounds like she\u2019s going through a type of bereavement dysfunction or having an issue coping with the loss of her dad. She absolutely needs to see a therapist to work through this. If she doesn\u2019t voluntarily see a therapist or counselor then it sounds like she\u2019s bound for a breakdown (emotion, physical, mental or all 3) which may put her in the hospital due to fatigue or exhaustion. At that point she may be offered inpatient treatment or if she comes to her senses she can opt for outpatient.\n\nI know it\u2019s a stretch and a lot of assumption on my part but if there really is no other inciting event then it sounds like she\u2019s suffering from some type of Bereavement disorder. She\u2019s struggling with coping with the death of her father and is cutting out anyone she cares about as a defensive mechanism. \n\nAnother alternative is that she learned some bad news about herself (terminal illness maybe?) and she\u2019s trying to isolate herself and protect herself and (what she thinks she\u2019s protecting others)\n\nI really hope this works out for you both. Be patient and don\u2019t do anything extreme or reactive. Be patient and present and supportive, but also at the same time, protect yourself. You should definitely contact a lawyer so you know your rights and responsibilities in this situation.",
            "It sucks, and i feel for you.  But there is nothing more you can do.  She is more than likely hurting from her father passing, and trying to bury it at work like she does with other pain (i did much the same but not to the same extent when i was going through a divorce, i used it as a means to not feel anything). The reason why she is pushing anybody away that talks about her relationship is the fact that she doesnt want to feel there too.  She probably realizes what she is going but cant stop it.\n\nAll you can do is better yourself.  Work on you, and what you want, and take the time to keep your perspective in this.  Give her time to burn out and crash and potentially come back, but if its over a year start moving on.  You may find the fact that you're not going to make it through this as a couple.  It may take YEARS for her to get out of the funk, and realize all that she had and come back to you.  \n\nI know couples that grew apart like this, got divorced, and then remarried 20 years later.  This may be your story, or it may not be.  But waiting around to find out is only going to hurt yourself.",

I know he has seasonal depression and works retail, so I was just waiting for the storm to pass. \n\nI made it my mantra and my intention to \"PERSIST\" when the new year came around. January 1, Elizabeth Warren announced her campaign and her tagline was \"PERSIST\". I was like, alright, this is good! Things will continue to get better. \n\nWhen he left, he cut off all my access to our credit cards and our finances. I have been out of work for 2 years this August and I have $0. I had no groceries at the time as that was one of the things we were putting off due to his 3 day parade of coming and going... I was abandoned in our newlywed home with no money, no food and NO IDEA why he left and in such a devastating way...\n\nThis last Christmas (we're not religious, but our families are), we BOTH had expressed such love and such gratitude for the day, how we chose to spend the holiday and start our own traditions that fit us and our family, how grateful and happy we both were to be married... All of it... The next day he got in a car accident, didn't tell me for 5 hours and when he did, he came home and was just... Different. I don't know what happened. We had issues I was hoping to work out through a couple's counselor; but this? I didn't think he wanted out and I didn't know he would just leave me behind like this...\n\nI'm not sure why I'm writing this to you.

Maybe someone who is an expert dealing with loss can tell you what approach you should be taking.  A counselor might be able to tell you whether riding this out is best or that there's a real danger here and your wife needs intervention. Also, long shot because of privacy, but maybe get an appointment with her primary care and tell her doctor what's going on.  At some point she may go into her doctors office and if the doc has info on what's going on they can ask the right questions and maybe order additional tests in case there's something they can look for (something out of balance).  I guess the lawyer up thing is a necessary evil but I'm looking at this as your wife has had some trauma and she's having a mental health issue and needs help.  I know you feel helpless but one thing you want to avoid if you can is looking back at this situation in 3 years and feeling like you didn't do everything you can to help her.  The guilt will eat you up.  Now go find that counselor.  Many employers have employee assistance plans that can get you free visits....

There's nothing you can do, talking to her family, friends won't work and I'm sure it gets back to her, and you've tried talking to her with no success. My question is, since she has started working so much, are you sure she's working? \n\nAll of a sudden working so much, then leaving you so unexpectedly, she could be seeing someone. If she gets off usually at 5 but says she works till 9 that would give her 4 hrs a day to be with someone else. Just saying that might be a reason for her sudden exit from the marriage.",

His wife lost her mom, he helped her get the moms house and affairs in orders for 6 months after, and then on Christmas this past year she told him she wanted a divorce. Nothing else bad happened, according to him, and he\u2019s not one to lie to me. Now he\u2019s living in his own apartment. She also refused to go to therapy.

            "Wow, i'm sorry you're going through this. She abandoned you, when things get tough in a marriage you stick together and work it out. She's cold that she can just cut you off like this without even trying. I wouldn't put too much effort in getting back someone who could do something like this. She's proved she can just get up and leave and she'll most likely do it again in the future if she comes back. You need to focus on yourself and your well being. She chose this. I know it's going to be hard but lean on your friends and family. Your wife had a change of heart and ditched you. It's time you start moving on and calling a Lawyer. She needs to know that you're not just going to sit around until she decides to come back. Whatever she's going through does not warrant this treatment. No explanation, just unhappy.",

Idk if this will help, but maybe knowing it's not your fault will ease your mind a bit. When someone is so caught up in their own grief and themselves, i/they dont realize the damage they are doing to others. And when i/they do finally realize it, like I did, I thought I couldn't come back and didnt think I could fix the damage that I had caused. Be strong OP.",

She is not feeling sad, she is feeling numb and when someone feels that way you can\u2019t talk her down or get through because you are emotionally involved. She needs therapy and some chemical help. Again you can\u2019t force that or suggest it. All you can do is support and let her find her way. Good luck but I am afraid she will either come to the conclusion she needs help or she won\u2019t.

            "When you said she didn't want to talk or work on things because it will hurt just like this again next time, I don't see cheating. It sounds just like severe depression. Perhaps her pain over her dad made her realize that loving someone so much can practically kill you when they die or leave, and she is cutting everyone out to protect herself. Of course, that's faulty thinking, but depression clouds your judgment. Sometimes, in depression, a person is barely hanging on, and composure is a full time job..Anyone bringing you up may have her teetering on an emotional breakdown. I would write a heart felt letter. Perhaps she won't read it right away, but she may read it when she feels stronger. Convey your support and tell her, you will step away. Then do so, and take care of yourself.

            "So many similarities to my situation its mindblowing. Only differences are we were together for 11 years. 9 of those years were great. We hardly ever fought or argued though we have albeit rarely (about 1 real spat about 1 or 2 times a year (about dumb stuff mostly). This is where our stories differ........about year 10 we started drifting apart. Our communication was scarce and our intimacy was almost non existent. On January 2019 she just came to me with tears in her eyes that she didnt want to be with me anymore and told me I would have to move out the house. It's now May 8, 2019 and I have come to find out she is now taking anti-depression anti-anxiety pills..........which is ironic, because while we were together it was ME that was on those meds and since we broke up I have had no need for any medication. I still love her and she probably still loves me, but when we now communicate via text her replies are very short like several word responses. \n\nSometimes it's hard to let go, I know we wont ever be together ever again. We are not enemies yet we are also not friends. I have only until recently accepted that. Since January if have lost 15 pounds maybe more just off the stress and lack of sleep alone. Your still young.......you will fall in love again. For me it's going to be tough to ever fall on love at my age of 45\n\nYour life will continue.

She ignores you and doesn't communicate except through scripted messages because that's just how she talks now. She was working ridiculous hours every day bc her dad died.  She's so depressed that her work life is completely uninterrupted since the breakup. It's all \"depression\".\n\nOR:\n\nShe has met someone else at work with whom she started an emotional affair when her dad died and was seeing him while she told you she was at work. He gave her an ultimatum that he wouldn't be dating a married woman. She came home, got her shit, and went to his place that night.  She now communicates with you through scripted messages to protect herself pending the day you discover her infidelity and she can have you served and protect herself legally by submitting these communications through the courts.\n\nI advise you to WAKE UP and do basic research. Check shared bank accounts for suspicious activity. Look at phone records.  Hire a lawyer.  Get advice on separation. I totally understand your desire to save your marriage, but it looks like there's no marriage left. You're groping around in the dark for a live grenade.

Sounds like it's not you're fault and you can take you're good character to someone else. \n\nIf you're not divorced. Just wait for her to have an emotional break down. She sounds extremely tough. Her breakdown is going to be along the lines of near suicide. But that's where her standard lies and that what's got to happen because she's not talking to you at all. \n\nSounds like her relationship with her father was drastically more important than her relationship with you. Sorry to say. It's ok. That's her fault not yours. \n\nI believe she's working so much to avoid her emotions. And she's not going to counseling with you because the therapist will just dig up her emotions. When she breaks down she might pour tears for 24 hours and not be able to get out of bed for a month. Expect something like that to happen if she gets her emotions dug up. \n\nTotally tough. It's a mortality thing.",

The stress...the worry... and the situation being out of your control has got to be extremely difficult for you. Ghosting you and not dealing with the life she chose to leave is not ok. She needs you now more than ever if you are all in and want to save the marriage, all you can do is do what you can and control what you can in a situation where you are not in control. Giving her support and space at the same time. Get yourself into therapy and gather your own support. Rally with her support and try to get your wife the help she needs.

            "So many people in this thread are convinced your wife is depressed and that is why she left you.  If I read between the lines here, most likely she has left you for someone else. You never know what is truly inside another person's head, and it's actually pretty easy to be in a marriage but be living two different lives. It's shitty but it's common place.\n\nThe mere fact she cut off other people tells me she's hiding it.  I've seen this happen too. She has to ensure that no one you both know finds out about it. Just telling it like it *most likely* is.\n\nTake care of yourself, OP.  The death of a marriage is hard. I've experienced it first hand.

            "Well, she can\u2019t ignore her problems forever and it\u2019s all going to catch up to her....and you can\u2019t protect her from that. Right now, she\u2019s running...and if you try to follow her and catch up to her she\u2019s only going to run further away. Nows not the time to take action in that direction....it\u2019s good that she\u2019s still in contact with her friends and her mother and you don\u2019t want to loose that ability to know what she\u2019s up to and that she\u2019s safe. And it\u2019s important that she has her friends and her mother to monitor her mental health. \n\nHonestly, I think you should go see a therapist. Both to unload about the burden that she\u2019s put on you, and because they\u2019ll be able to give you good coaching on how to deal with someone in such a delicate state. How you get her attention eventually is that you serve her divorce papers, force her to confront the you and the mess she\u2019s made. Likely, it won\u2019t come to that. It\u2019s only been twenty days, and she\u2019s going to crash and burn sooner or later because she can\u2019t sustain this. And you don\u2019t need to be afraid of that...she\u2019s a grown girl and she has people really alarmed and vigilant who are monitoring her and making sure she doesn\u2019t hurt herself. Her baggage is not your responsibility and her happiness is not your responsibility. I know you can\u2019t stop from worrying about her and caring deeply about her, but she\u2019s done something incredibly hurtful to you and if she doesn\u2019t turn around and work on getting better...then she\u2019s out of excuses past a point really. \n\nOk so I have Bipolar Disorder right...the more severe kind where I might walk out on my job, and spend my life savings chasing some delusional idea I had about being God or something and needing to buy a bunch of expensive supplies to create a tool to harness my powers if I\u2019m having an episode. I mean that\u2019d be the extreme of having a manic episode, but it\u2019s happened before and I can\u2019t help that it could happen again. But that doesn\u2019t give me a free pass to hurt people and I\u2019d still loose my job and all my money, and that would be permanent. And, at this point, it\u2019d never get that bad because I know I have that pattern/tendency and so do the people in my life and they\u2019d express their concerns. And even before I was diagnosed, I was scared- I knew there was something seriously concerning about my behavior and I knew my life was falling apart around me. And that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no forgiveness or patience from the people around me...but if I hurt someone thru my actions once, I have to learn from that and owe it to them to work on my mental health. It\u2019s always my job to ask for help, maybe I\u2019m not in a place where I can get it together and check myself into the psych ward if things get really bad...but it\u2019s my job to tell someone that that\u2019s what I need. And the same goes for your wife, the grief she\u2019s experiencing may make her actions understandable or forgivable but it does not excuse them. She can\u2019t be protected from the consequences of those actions...and that\u2019s  a good thing too. Sometimes you\u2019ve gotta just let someone fall on their ass. The only thing I\u2019d say is to make sure that her mom removes anything that could be used to hurt herself or someone else from the house. And I don\u2019t want to alarm you by saying that...but just as a precaution and I think you\u2019d sleep better at night.",

            "Bud, this sounds 85% like my story. He mum died last year and after a week she wanted out. I was hurt because for years I told her to keep a part time job and look after her mum because money will eventually come. I gave her the space to be with her mum because I could not be with both my parents so I thought it was the right thing to do but alas. \n\nI tried everything in my power to convince her otherwise, I thought that it was depression because she had a major loss, I proposed counseling but she said no and then I saw that she had court papers ready to move ahead with the divorce. I was hurt again but tried to ignore it and make it work, till an incident occurred 7 months after she wanted to split  and due to it I got a hold of her phone. I found out that night that there was someone else in the picture and the person was there a few months before her mum passed away. I was told that I was not there to provide emotional support whereas this person was. And here I thought I was looking after the finances to give her time to look after her mother. \n\nWe are about to file for divorce and after I found out I didn't really care and used that time to heal and be a better version of myself.\n\nI pray that you dont go through the same, but go back and try to piece together the events to see if there was any odd behavior that you ignored. Mine was not questioning the amount of time she was spending on the phone where even her mum who was on her last breath inquired about her long conversations.",
            "I see that most comments are assuming that your wife is going through some sort of self-destructing downward spiral. I just read through your post and comment history and I'm going to have to 100% disagree with the general consensus here. It does not sound like your soon to be ex wife is in crisis at all - it sounds like she has tried, for years, to be ok with a marriage changing into one that she had not originally agreed to. You flat out lied to her from the beginning: you knew that you were bisexual since you were 13 and had dated/had relationships/had sex with men - all of which you continuously *lied to her* by changing their sex when telling her about your past or just omitting them entirely. But, you didn't tell her the truth until *AFTER* you married, taking away her right to make an informed decision about choosing you as a life partner. That is *seriously* fucked up.  She hasn't ghosted you, she isn't having some sort of mental break. She has ultimately decided that she is very unhappy being married to someone who chose to lie to her repeatedly and is acting like she simply wants the marriage to be over.\n\n\nHer leaving did not come out of nowhere. You massively betrayed her by keeping your bisexuality a secret until *after* you two had gotten married. I think that perhaps you mistook her no longer bringing up your bisexuality as acceptance: \n\n>It took my wife a good while (about two years or so) before she was comfortable enough about my sexuality and our relationship to finally stop bringing it up in arguments and to actually embrace that it's just a minor part of our relationship\n\n\nThat does NOT sound like she was comfortable or embraced it at all...she simply stopped bringing it up during arguments, which sounds way more like she switched to just bottling her feelings on the matter up. Do you see how it sounds way more like it's something that deeply upsets her and she gave up even mentioning it because it was something you couldn't change? I mean, it's not like she could ask you to go back to being the straight male she thought she married. She had literally no choice but to accept who you were now telling her you were. It sounds like she tried to do that but realized that she wasn't happy about it.\n\n\nShe's telling you that she's unhappy in the marriage, doesn't want to waste time in counseling and she isn't telling you why because she knows it's useless and the two of you have hashed it out for *years* already - you aren't able to change your sexuality, she's not into it, and she doesn't want to be in this type of marriage anymore. So, for now she's throwing herself into her job and giving you scripted answers because she's just done.\n\nNot many marriage survive when they were based on a lie. On top of that lie was the pressure of this:\n\n>we were in a position where we either had to marry or had to break up because work obligations were moving us to opposite sides of the world\n\n\nYours was not a marriage based in truth and open honesty. I know it feels like this came completely out of the blue for you but you literally began your marriage based on a huge lie. The signs of a crumbling partnership were all there the entire time - the almost breaking up when you came out to your wife a few years ago? The *two years* of arguments between you two after you came out? Her just no longer bringing it up? Yeah, that was her quietly checking out of the relationship because she finally accepted that she was lied to and she isn't getting her original husband back. This was a long time coming for her and, sadly, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.\n\n\nYou have embraced your bisexuality and you are loudly and proudly out of the closet. That's great! But, that isn't the person your wife married and she has every right to leave because she is ultimately unhappy remaining in the marriage. Let her go, don't make the divorce difficult.",

            "no one ghosts a long term relationship without there being someone else already. Takes one to know one. That's a big part of the motivation to just end it all.  When someone knows that they have other options and esp if there's someone else they are close to emotionally and/or physically, then they stop caring about their current partner and they start to see the grass as being greener on the other side with the new person. This pisses me off. Once the brain focuses on someone else it becomes kind of an obsessive fantasy that this other person is so much better than their current partner. Ghosting is an extremely selfish, heartless and uncaring thing to do. People who do stuff like this will not care what they do until someone they deeply love does the same in return to them one day (and it will happen in return). People who don't ghost or abandon their loved ones have already learned why they shouldn't ghost or are more mature and don't need to bother because they know how to work things out with people by communicating and because they care about people and know that things should be done out of love and respect for others. There is always room for improvement and relationships do improve with work and communication. No one should treat anyone as disposable. This type of thing is scarring for years, you can ruin someones life and sanity, they may even kill themselves. I feel for you. =(",

There's someone else. Its rare in these situations that you don't find out that she \"moved on too quick.\" This is the entire reason she doesn't want to work on the relationship and just wants out right now. \n\nYou've got to brace for that blow now because its coming. I can almost guarantee it.\n\nIt's either she met someone else or she was never the person you thought she was when you fell in love with her and got married. Because that person would never just abandon your marriage without fighting for it or trying couples counseling.\n\nYou think her friends and mom are just letting her self-destruct. I guarantee you she's already justified her leaving you to them and made you out to be the bad guy so she can be with whoever it is she is about to suddenly be in a relationship with. They might not be actively sleeping together but I can guarantee you there was an emotional affair she's been hiding, or a co-worker/acquaintance who she was curious about who she is going to allow to pursue her.\n\nSo there's two options here and both are devastating, and its better you prepare yourself for the blow now rather than have a double whammy of grief when you find out.\n\nThere's someone else.

She knows you love her but she doesn't feel that way about you anymore, so she pretty much doesn't care about your feelings anymore.

            "Take her on a surprise vacation. This woman needs to have fun. You guys need some time together. You're her partner, I think you're right that you need to fight for her even if she won't. She's become a workaholic and she needs an intervention. Call her boss, family, get a fun vacation secretly planned, have it so you meet her at her desk one morning and whisk her away. Maybe I'm just a romantic but might just be enough to snap her out of the malaise.",
