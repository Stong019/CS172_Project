        "selftext": "[Here is my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4fu74o/i_23f_just_met_my_boyfriends_26m_family_and/)\n\nSo I already wrote a short update in the comments of my previous post but I thought I would do a new post since it's probably easier to follow.\n\nI knew that I had to tell Eric about what happened. He told me to come by his place after work to order in food and watch the taping of Survivor from Wednesday night (lol don't judge us!). I got there at around 6 and he asked if I wanted Chinese, pizza or Thai but I told him we needed to talk first before carrying on with our night.\n\nI sat him down and explained to him that I loved meeting his family yesterday but I needed to tell him something. I explained that year, before I met him, I met his brother at a bar and we had a one night stand. I told him we never exchanged numbers, don't have each other on social media and never saw each other again until last night. I made sure to tell him that I didn't want to bring it up yesterday since it was his birthday and all, but he had a right to know and I understand if this is something that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nHe looked pretty surprised and was kind of quiet for a few minutes. He then said I must have felt a little awkward yesterday but I definitely didn't show it, to which he thanked me for. I asked him what his thoughts were and he said \"well, I'm not going to lie and say that this isn't weird, but it's not exactly a deal breaker. I just need some time to think.\" I told him that I would give him some space tonight and he agreed and thanked me for being honest.\n\nI left and we didn't talk for the rest of the night. He did take it better than I thought he would but I for sure thought that this would end things between the two of us, especially with the silence. We both had the day off work today and he called me this morning shortly after I woke up and asked if he could come over. He showed up about half an hour later and told me that, after thinking about it all last night, he realizes that it was just a one time thing, the past is the past and he really likes where we're headed, so he would like to continue to pursue things, as long as I felt comfortable. Eric said he also talked to his brother last night and his brother definitely recognized me but again, said it was a one time thing and that we make a good couple and there's no lingering feelings of lust or anything. Eric then made a joke about his brother having good taste, which led to him pushing me onto the bed and having sex with me, haha (asserting dominance? marking his territory?)\n\nAll seems to be well now! I have the next four days off, which is rare for me as a flight attendant, so we're actually going on a spontaneous weekend trip :) \n\nThanks for all of your advice guys! I appreciate it!\n\nTLDR: I told Eric that I slept with his brother and he was ultimately cool with it. All seems well now! \n",

You could look at this situation as \"he's having sex with me to show me his acceptance of the situation, that he's over it and things are cool with us\".  Which is nothing like dominance.\n\nGuys get accused of acting \"dominant\" a lot, when dominance has nothing to do with it.  I don't mean to be thin-skinned about this, and I know you probably meant the best.  But please understand that this kind of stereotyping can be just as off-putting and reductive to a guy, as similar things are to women (like equating wearing a revealing dress with being \"slutty\" or something).\n",

We went to dinner with some of our friends, got a shared ride, and all that fun stuff. We got to the dance and danced for a while, and he didn't do or say anything creepy. His friend, lets call him Paul since I have no idea who he is, showed up and said something in his ear, and Jake told me that there was a party and we were going. I said no, mostly because I am not comfortable with going to a stranger's party filled with people I don't know. Jake tried to convince me to go, and I kept saying no, until he was really upset. I told him I don't mind him going, and he got pretty mad. He said that I was boring and everyone fucks on prom night so I should too, which was pretty random since sex wasn't even on the table, and that I was making him look bad. He tried to pull my arm but a group of girls next to us told him he needs to leave, and he did. \n\nSo overall, it was an okay night. It sucks I couldn't hang out with Jake all night, but I did meet some pretty cool girls who let me hang out with them the rest of the night! Overall, it was pretty fun, and I didn't die or get pigs blood dumped on me by John Travolta!\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Jake was an ass, but people are nice",

I forgot I had even posted on here with everything going on. \n\nI ended up going to my auntie's. She came and packed up my whole room with me and drove me to her house. It was really hard, because my mom was already talking about selling the house and moving to some other city, so she could start her life. \n\nI still have a lot of pain from what she did, but living with my Aunt and Uncle has been a great experience. Mr. B (my boss) got me a job at a Subway where my Aunt lives. I really like the people I work with. \n\nI started dating someone at my new school and we have been together for 5 months. Dan (17m) is great and we are in the same grade (he just turned 17), so we had the whole year together. School is ending in a few weeks and we have plans to go to the beach with my Aunt and Uncle for a week. \n\nI met some new friends and got involved with Volleyball and took part in drama. I also am Assistant Treasurer, because I was able to talk to the teacher in charge of the group and said I wanted experience. When she saw my transcripts, she said I could assist the girl who got the position. The girl (Joleen) is actually really cool and we became pretty good friends.\n\nI still keep in touch with my friends from home, but I really feel like I have a great support system now. I haven't told anyone why I moved here just yet, minus my boyfriend, because its too embarrassing. And I don't like to talk about it. \n\nI was doing really good and had decided I didn't really want to see my mom again. Because who abandons their own kid? \n\nMy mom came up last week and she has been waiting around to see me. I didn't know why until Saturday because my aunt finally told me, because my mom barged into the house and refused to leave. Auntie asked if I wanted to talk to \"her\" and I told her I would. \n\nMy mom said she was so sorry for the way she treated me, that she wanted to know if I would move back for my senior year. She said we could pack up anytime I wanted. \n\nShe then asked my aunt if she could stay in the guest room. \n\nMy aunt said the room was mine. \n\nMy mom said \"Lucy doesn't mind sharing.\" \n\nMy mom tried really hard to get me to chat with her alone, but Auntie stayed with me. It came out that my Mom wanted me to come home because her boyfriend left her and she blew through her money.\n\nAuntie told Mom she needed to leave and then told me that my mom had been calling her about the check my birth father sends her. I guess she contacted the lawyer, said I was in her custody, and my mom signed the papers my aunt asked her to. Mom didn't realize it meant the check was coming to Auntie, who said she put most of it into a savings account for me. \n\nThere were some things she needed money for and I am grateful she is paying for me and keeping me. It could have been so much worse. \n\nI guess the checks were pretty big. \n\nSo I just told my mom not to contact me again. It hurt, a lot. The only reason she wanted me around was because of a check. \n\nThat said, I guess my aunt has my father's number. She said he wants to talk with me when I am ready. So there is that.\n\nI am not sure what to do now? It just hurts.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Been really happy, until my mom came back to get me to live with her because of my check.",

You learned the first one earlier and harder than most, but when you truly feel the second one you can embrace the third to make your own place in life with the people who nurture you instead of burdening you.\n\nThis is supposed to hurt, because it matters.

Perhaps ask her if she thinks it's possible your mother stopped your father from seeing you... she may have some ideas and been waiting for you to ask.\n\nIn any event, you should only see your father when YOU feel ready to do so.  Perhaps you could ask your aunt to call him and see if you could have his email address.  That way you could chat via email, at a pace you are comfortable with, taking the time to digest his emails and formulate your response.\n\nAs for your mother... well... something inside of her is clearly broken.  That's not your fault and is no reflection on you.  You just keep taking care of yourself and letting your auntie take care of you.  Your mother can sort her own crap out, or not, as she sees fit... but there's no reason YOU have to be exposed to her unless you want to be.  \n\nYou have a fantastic future ahead of you, and it will be of your own creation.

You are amazing. \n\n\nAlso, it's up to you since you have so much going on in your life, but if I were you, I'd hear what your dad has to say. It's possible he's stayed away because of something your mother said/did (like maybe threatened him or something). I'm not saying get your hopes up, I'm just saying, you now know what kind of person your mother is, it may be worthwhile to know if she painted an accurate portrait of your father.

So yeah, way to be a badass. \n\nEDIT TO ADD SOMETHING: it's easy as a young person to think, \"what did I do that she doesn't want me anymore?\"  This is NOT your fault, don't ever even let that thought enter your mind.  This is her acting too irresponsibly and selfishly for a 32 year old with a teenaged daughter.  This is NOT your fault.",

And you're doing wonderful! I love being right! :) \n\nI think seeking a therapist to mourn for the mother that you SHOULD have been born to might help you cope with this latest curveball she threw at you. I could write a very long paragraph bitching about her, but there's no point. You know better than anyone here. \n\nAlso know that just because she's your mother, doesn't mean that she's not a Grade A asshole first, and it's your right to establish a family of choice. Don't convince yourself to get warm fuzzy feelings for her JUST because of DNA. Your FAMILY should treat you better, not worse, than a they would treat an acquaintance or stranger on the street. She's shown you that you owe her nothing. \n\nPlease update us a year from now; I'm really curious to know about how your senior year goes, and what kind of college you decide to go to. :)",

Your mom seems like she will drag you down if she can - so don't let her. \n\nThe fact that she bailed on you and wants to use you for child support checks is NOT YOUR FAULT. This is all on her. You sound like a fantastic person, and I hope you see that from the other positive people in your life. Your school likes having you involved, you are in a solid relationship, the rest of your family is looking out for you, and even your dad might be ready to reach out and get to know you. Your mom's shit is all on her. You did absolutely nothing wrong. You are worth knowing and loving, and she just doesn't get that. ",

            "I went through something vaguely similar as a child. My mother was never a figure in my life after the age of 8. She choose a life of partying over raising me. My father was ill equipped to raise me and had his own substance abuse issues. While my father was there, he never truly raised me. My grandparents raised me and provided me with many opportunities that I would never have had the option of exploring without them. I will never be able to express my thanks to them enough for everything that they have done for me. My mother tried at times to get in contact with me or take me out for a birthday or such, but she always failed to show up. Eventually, I gave up even trying. She was murdered a few years ago after one of her binges out partying. While not completely relevant, it made me realize that while I was upset that she could never get her life turned around, I grew an even greater respect for those who were there for me throughout my life.",

This is my more suspicious side talking, but maybe get a look at that savings account the money is going into.\n\nSpeaking of the money, it seems like your father has been sending it for quite awhile. There may be a perfectly good reason he isn't part of your life, but the reason could also have been your mother? Obviously this is totally up to you, but it may be worth it to give him a call during this transitioning stage of your life. He may turn out to be a more worthy parent.",

Hold your head up, don't be embarrassed or ashamed, you can't be and aren't responsible for the actions of other people, even your mother.  \n\nIt seem like your aunt and uncle are caring for you properly.  I would have your aunt contact your father and let her get the story from him  about why he's been absent for 9 years.  I might have do to with your mom, if she threaten to accuse him of abusing you he might have been left with no option but to cut off contact and keep writing checks.  He could have his own problem.  After your aunt speaks with your father ask for her advice.  If she thinks reconnecting with your father would be a good thing then it probably will be, if she doesn't think reconnecting with him is a good idea, then just forget about it for now and focus on you.

You're already more worried about college than you need be (top post in your first post is right) and it sounds like you might be prone to these sorts of things gaining downhill momentum. You're still in a new situation and you ought to get strong roots and master it before dealing with your dad. You need time to even accept what your mom actually is now that you know it.\n\nYou've got plenty of years left in your life and you can take things slowly. No need to rush. Close the chapter with your mom, put the book down and file it away before opening a new one.

Listen to his side of the story at least.\n\nIf you find your story is too embarassing to tell your friends it's okay, but remember it's your mother who should be embarrassed by this, not you. She sounds really dumb, you're better off without her. You seem to be building your new life just fine. Look at the bright side, you live a stable life with wise people, still have all your chances to get into a good university, and maybe you can get in touch with your father and bound with his side of the family.

Trust me, having divorced parents is hard as they can try to under mine each other, but it's never too late to try to have a relationship.

What I can look back and see is that I have resiliency, strength and a grasp on reality that I wouldn't have had if I would have kept living with them.  \n\nThis will make you a better person. Don't ever doubt yourself. \n\nYour mom is a horrible parent. Your aunt is smart to stay by your side because if your mom gets you alone she will try to make you feel guilty for \"abandoning\" her.

I'm glad you have your aunt - and it sounds like you are doing everything exactly right... building a new support system, doing well in school and extracurriculars. \n\nRemember that none of your mom's crazy is your fault. She needs professional help and that is not your responsibility or - thankfully - your problem.  Stick close with your aunt. It's clear she wants what's best for you.\n\nIt's hard, but if your mom is really a narcissist (as others have suggested), this is going to be an ongoing problem unless you practice setting up really strong boundaries now.  There's a good chance she'll take another shot at dragging you back into her Whirlpool Of Misery once you're 18 and out of your aunt's house.\n\nAlso, just a heads-up - there are going to be people in your life who try to guilt you about your lack of a relationship with your mom.  They'll imply that it's your \"duty\" as a daughter to forgive her or try to mend the relationship.  These people are assholes and idiots.  You are not obliged to do anything for this woman who tried to throw you away because she had a new boyfriend and wanted to be free of responsibilities.  She had a chance to have a relationship with you and blew it for the sake of some novelty.  From now on, that relationship is on YOUR terms.  \n\nMaybe at some point you'll want to try to rebuild it.  Maybe you'll decide that she's not worth the trouble.  You are the ONLY person who gets to make that call.\n\nAs for the others chiming in about your dad... meh. Again, it's your call. You have an awful lot of stress and emotional upheaval in your life right now. Maybe he's a great person, maybe he's a total trainwreck like your mom.  Probably he's a human being who's a little bit of both, and most likely he's not going anywhere.  Chances are good that you have a long time to decide whether or not you want to have him in your life.  Make the decision that's right for you, when you feel it's time to make it.  ",

I am sure that plays into this scenario (not to excuse it, but only to understand)... she probably \"missed out\" on a lot of things her friends were doing in their late teens/early 20's because she was raising a child. She made a choice there, though, and she clearly was not willing to see it through till the conclusion. I just can't believe she didn't quit sooner, or wait until you were off to college.

Many people with totally normal, caring parents do not have that. As you said, she could have used that money and she is putting your needs first. That sure sounds like a mom to me. \n\nPerhaps you will never call your auntie \"Mom\", but that is inconsequential in the long run. She is there for you in the way a mom would be. Of course it hurts to be rejected by your birth mother, especially in the way yours did. It's okay to feel hurt by that. And perhaps some counseling will help you better deal with those feelings. \n\nIt sounds like, in a way, your paths were supposed to cross in this way. She couldn't have her own children and you couldn't have your own mother, you were meant for each other.\n\nAs others have said, your experiences will only help you and build your character. You are already triumphing with a good support system. You're an extremely impressive person, a fact that seems to easily come across to people you meet. \n\nNever, ever feel as though this is embarrassing. It's not. And there are probably a lot more people at your school who feel abandoned by their families in one way or another. So if ever you feel compelled to talk more about this experience, don't hesitate due to shame. The only shame here is with your birth mother. There is nothing wrong with you. You had nothing to do with her abandonment whatsoever. ",

Nobody, not your mother or anyone else, should ever use you for money (especially not your own mother, of all people.)\n\nKeep your chin up and keep being as brave as you are. Kick your mum to the curb and keep on with your new life. You absolutely deserve it, and she absolutely doesn't deserve you.",

In a few years, the pain from this will have receded to a manageable level and you will be so grateful you did this for yourself.

My mother did the same thing to my brother and I, except I didn't have anywhere to go so I got my GED and went to one of those for profit colleges (big mistake) and I've been on my own ever since. \n\nI would strongly recommend trying therapy again, and if it doesn't feel like it's working for you, try different therapists until you find someone that clicks. You sound much stronger and level headed than I was at your age but if you were raised by this type of horrible person, you might have some issues you're not aware of because of it. Best to nip those in the bud rather than end up suffering later in life. I'm finding myself having to completely turn my life around at age 30 and my biggest regret is not getting help sooner. I had no idea how bad my upbringing and being abandoned by my mom messed me up until recently. \n\nIt sounds like you've got a great future ahead, and I'm rooting for you!",

In the end, I think this is an amazing story being written.\n\nI would definitely listen to what your father has to say. It may turn out to be something gorgeous. (I have lots of ideas, but honestly, now's just not the time for random ideas... Maybe for example your father never came around because it was your mother who told him to leave, etc).\n\nAnd we're all proud of you for standing up to your mom.

I really recommend tons of scholarship writing to help improve your quality of life in the near future. If you wanna talk more pm me. I'm on my mobile so this message is a little too concise!

            "I wish I had some really amazing advice to give you that would make all of this less painful for you, but I don't. My younger sister (and I, to a degree) went throught the same thing with our mother. She kicked me out at 16, so I went to live with my father and started dealing with the psychological fallout of all the years of abuse from her. A year later, when my sister (who had not been similarly abused) was 16, our mother decided to marry her boyfriend and move across the continent--without my sister.\n\nShe and my sister had gotten along really well, so my sister took it very hard. She couldn't understand why she couldn't go with our mother or why the couple was moving. She also came to live under my father's care and spent the rest of high school as a seemingly different person. She got into drugs, her grades tanked, she withdrew socially from the rest of the family. She didn't want to talk about it with anyone. It really messed her up, and now, ten years later, she's realizing what our mother did to her was terrible and going through a healing process similar to mine.\n\nThis kind of thing can really mess a person up; my sister didn't really have an emotional support network after our mother left. She didn't have someone like your auntie to validate her and stand up for her. She didn't have the social and academic means that you have to enrich her life and help her find value in herself. You seem to really have made something decent out of a shitty situation. Please keep it up. Continue to talk about your experience, do well in all your pursuits, and definitely keep your auntie close.\n\nYou've had to deal with some serious shit from someone who was supposed to treat you better, but it sounds like you're going to emerge from this a stronger person. I hope this doesn't negatively affect your future relationships, but you seem like you have many resources and supports in place to live a healthy life. I wish you all the best. Stay strong!",
            "You are doing so great. You are so level headed and mature that I have no doubt you will do fine in life. Sometimes adults fail the people who rely on them. This is not a reflection on you but on them. Your mom may have dropped the ball but you aunt has been more than willing to pick it up. Focus on that instead.\n\nBTW I used to prepare applicants for college and grad school, and I can say without a doubt that you have what it takes to succeed. Let me know if you want any help with your college apps. I no longer work in that field, but I will gladly help you anyway I can.",
            "You have taken a very awful situation and handled it better than many adults would. I hope you maintain a good spirit and continue growing as a person. You have done so well. \n\nAnd you aunt is a saint of a soul and deserves all the hugs and love you can give her. ",
            "No need to be hurt; if your mom only wanted you because of a check, then that means it is literally the only reason she wanted you, which means it had nothing to do with your personality or anything about you; it means that this doesn't mean she doesn't like you or anything of the sort; basically, your personality is irrelevant and her reasoning has nothing to do with you, so it can't possibly be anything you have done or any way in which you have acted, so you can then not worry about it as long as you like your aunt.",

I went in to our room and, sat next to her and held her for a little bit and calmed her down.\n\nAfter I asked her to get dressed because I wanted to take her somewhere special. (The restaurant I took her for our first date surprisingly I remembered after all this time)\n\nShe didn't know where we were going but once we got there she got all giddy and happy. We ate and, talked for a bit and listened to the music she seemed happy which is all I really want.\n\nWe went home and I told her I wanted to talk to her.(I wrote down what I wanted to say)\n   \nHere's what I said.\n\n\"Ever since I first met you I knew I wanted to be with you forever, I just couldn't find the words to express it.\n\nYour my world there's nothing that could ever replace you out of the billions of women your special. Because your one of a kind, sure there's other women out there but in my eyes they don't compare.\n\nYour my companion my partner my teammate, and I'll always be here to pick you up when your down.\"\n\nShe cried a lot more and she she calmed down she wanted sex but it was different. It was slower and, calm we looked into each other's eyes until the end.\n\nI reassured that I'm not going anywhere and that I married her and made a commitment to her. We cuddled the whole night after.\n\nI talked to her more the next day about some therapy and she agreed as long as I go with her. (She doesn't want to do it alone) \n\nAs for the whole \"children\" subject I'm going to wait a little bit until she's feeling better. Right now I don't think talking about kids would benefit her anyway.\n\n\nWe also talked about traveling in the future seeing some places and experience things together. Other than that she seems okay now I know she's not fully feeling better but she's happier a little.\n\nHonestly having kids didn't really matter to me as long as I have her I'm happy. But there's the update not too long but that's what happened these past few days.\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr**: talked to my wife and reassured her that I'm not going anywhere we also talked about therapy and future plans.\n\nIt's all getting better now.",

            "I was in your shoes exactly. My wife and I tried for years to have a child and we had the same issues. \n\nIt's really common for people that were in our situation. Fertility issues change a marriage, good or bad. It will make you two come together more or destroy your relationship. You guys seem to be on the right path. \n\nMy advice is to travel and have some fun. That's the main reason you got married to each other, you enjoy the company. \n\nNow here is a warning, this will not last forever. You guys are young and wanting kids only get worse as you get older. If you really want them, get in the adoption process now. It will take several years anyway. There are foreign adoptions and domestic foster adoptions. \n\nIt sounds like you two would make great parents and not to explore that possibility would be a shame. \n\nAlso, you never know what will happen. We went through 3 IUI and 7 IVFs to try to have a kid. I was looking a purchasing a 28 foot Grady White boat when we got the news my wife was pregnant.

Processing that HUGE change in expectations takes time, and the thought of it being your \"fault\" is hard to work through.  The temporary depression is real.  And the scary thoughts of \"what if he changes his mind\" \"what if he's still working through it and decides to leave\" are recurring.  They will lose intensity and frequency over time, but be aware that they will come again for a while.\n\n\nBut the way you dealt with it was perfect.  Just be aware of her emotional state for a while, and if you need to up the romance or encouragement, do it.\n\n\nAlso, be aware of your own emotional state for the next year or so.  You're going to have to process this, too, and you don't want to say something you regret later while you're working through the grieving process.  You might need a bff to work through things like denial and bargaining stages, because telling a friend you wish there was a surgery, an option, go back in time, whatever, is going to be okay, but saying it to your wife is going to hurt her and she may feel you're blaming her and may start the \"is he going to leave me\" thought process.\n\nI wish you patience and happiness, OP.

All fake names etc etc.\n\nJordan and I met in University two years ago. We both started at the same time and because of our ages we were both considered \u2018mature\u2019 students. So we quickly became firm friends as we shared a dorm and we\u2019d joke around together about us being old enough to be considered \u2018mature\u2019 in our early 20\u2019s. We weren\u2019t on the same course, but given we lived together, we would hang out pretty much all the time whenever we didn\u2019t have a lecture. We joined a bunch of societies together, went drinking every weekend together, etc etc. It was a pretty sweet gig because it meant we were at least never alone. Obviously we made other friends, both alone and together, but we were always each other\u2019s #1 at the end of the day.\n\nAt the moment we\u2019re on spring holidays for Easter.

Mine is a big city central. \n\nThis morning we went there and were wandering down the streets, doing some sightseeing, because he\u2019s never been. \nThere\u2019s typically a lot of street sellers here, trying to sell you everything from hotdogs to fluffy pokemon hats. I decided I wanted to get a caricature done. I\u2019ve never had one and I thought it would be funny to get and hang over my bed when we got back for term. I asked Jordan if he wanted to get in and he refused. No worries, so I sat down to get it done.\nThey don\u2019t take very long, 5/10 ish minutes, so I stayed looked straight forward at the artist the entire time. He finished the caricature, I loved it. So obviously I turn to show it properly to Jordan.\n\nWhen I turn though I literally don\u2019t even know what to say. He\u2019s down on one knee holding up a ring box. I don\u2019t even really know what he said, if he did the whole like proposal speech thing because I was so confused, I was barely paying attention.\nRemember again, this is a super busy tourist city, so this has drawn a mini crowd now, coming over to cheer us on.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. To be honest, I thought this was some kind of odd prank type thing. We never HAVE been \u2018prankster\u2019 types or whatever but I couldn\u2019t come up with a reasonable explanation. So I just laughed and laughed and laughed. Until I looked at Jordan and he looked genuinely heartbroken.\nSo obviously I asked him something along the lines of \u2018You\u2019re not being serious?\u2019. \nThis is the only thing I remember him saying. He shut the box, stood up, shrugged and said \u2018I guess not anymore\u2019. And walked off.\n\nThis left me standing pretty awkwardly in this gathered crowd of people, a lot of who were giving me dirty looks, which made me incredibly uncomfortable. \n\nThe plan was to meet back up a hotel that we had booked rooms next door to one another. So I figure that\u2019s where he\u2019s going and head back that way. But he\u2019s not there. So I wait and I wait, and he still doesn\u2019t return.\n\nI text him out of concern, this was at 1:15pm (it\u2019s currently 6:20pm as I\u2019m writing this) just asking if he\u2019s okay. \nHe responds with a LONG message back (which I would post, because it\u2019s an odd read, but I won\u2019t out of respect for his privacy), in which he basically accuses me of leading him on, asking why I didn\u2019t \u2019break up with him sooner\u2019, saying I had \u2018publicly humiliated\u2019 him and that he \u2018thought I loved him the same way\u2019 and that he felt our \u2018relationship was strong enough to consider taking the next step\u2019.\nNow this is completely out of left field. I literally have got no idea where in the world he\u2019s got this idea from. The closest we\u2019ve ever physically been is a hug hello and goodbye. I\u2019ve never even jokingly flirted with him (for exactly this reason, I\u2019ve had too many friendships collapse because they can\u2019t tell the difference between serious interesting and joking banter in friendships, so I\u2019ve been extra careful to not). We\u2019ve never kissed, never been on a date, never had sex. I do not find him physically attractive and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him.\n\nI don\u2019t understand where on Earth he\u2019s got this idea that we are. This isn\u2019t something he\u2019s ever bought up before this and I\u2019m genuinely bewildered.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t returned to the hotel yet, I periodically knock to check, and I\u2019ve been listening out for him walking up the hallway or anything. Nothing. I haven\u2019t responded to his long paragraph because honestly? I don\u2019t know how to.\n\nI\u2019m just so stunned and taken aback that I genuinely have no idea where to go from here or what to do.\n\nI haven\u2019t told anyone I know in person yet, mostly because I don\u2019t want to bring this up to people who know Jordan. So here I am turning to strangers on reddit instead.\nWhat in the world do I do \ud83d\ude2d",

            "Has he ever been in a relationship before, like actually had a girlfriend? ...Is he like the type of fundamentalist Christian who believes in no kissing before marriage or something?\n\nI don't know, my instinct would be to ask him to talk with you, and have it out pointing out all the ways in which you're not actually dating (never asked each other out on a date specifically, no physical intimacy). Like, when does he remember this \"relationship\" being official? \n\nBut then again, he's possibly off his rocker a bit if he's created this delusion in his head. \n\nI think you're going to have to walk away from this friendship. Can you reach out to any mutual friends and ask them their take on this? (If you trust them not to gossip.)",

            "That is just straight up delusional behavior. He built up an entire relationship with you in his head and decided it warranted *proposing to you in public.* Nevermind the fact that even for devoted couples, marriage should be discussed and agreed upon before anyone proposes to anyone. You need to tell him you're just friends, you've always been just friends and you can't and don't see your relationship any other way. Frankly, I'd do it in a text just in case he handles it poorly and decides to do something unpredictable from having his grandiose delusions shattered all at once.",
            "I want to reiterate not to discuss this with him in a private place like your hotel room. Go somewhere public. He\u2019s delusional. That can be unsafe for you. You never saw this coming and I would hate for anything else to happen that you didn\u2019t see coming. Please keep yourself safe until you figure out wtf is going through his head. This is really wild and I hope you give us an update when you figure it out!",

            "I am so sorry you are going through this. You obviously really value his friendship and regardless of what happens next, you will be grieving the loss of your best friend. \n\nThe craziest thing for me is this: did neither of you date or sleep with anybody else the whole time you\u2019ve been friends? Have you ever suggested to him that he should go talk to the cute girl in the library or told him you thought that the guy at the bar was hot? To be clear, I 1000% believe that you did not lead him on and I agree with everyone else that he is delusional but how did the subject of dating (other people) NEVER come up? How did you introduce each other when meeting new people? You must\u2019ve said \u201cthis is my friend Jordan\u201d at some point. This man needs serious mental health help ASAP.",
            "Ummm. You are roommates. It\u2019s news to you that he even had romantic feelings for you, let alone thinks you\u2019re in a relationship. Honestly, what he did was super shitty.

            "I don't know what the wall of text he sent you said, but I do think that you should use this as an opportunity to state your position in writing before he gets more of a chance to derail his perception of reality. He seems to think that he's in the right to feel embarrassed and that this isn't something that he brought onto himself.\n\nI think that you should definitely answer his text with boundaries and, honestly, a bit pissed off. You can totally be worried about someone you care for while also being stern about what just happened and how much he jumped to conclusions despite ALL the evidence against it.",
            "He's clearly delusional. I would text him back a long message explaining that you're just friends, and you have no idea how he got the idea that it was something else. Basically, explain it the way you did here- no physical intimacy, no dating, nothing. \n\nI know it's shitty to do over text but he sounds unstable.

            "Boom - major distance starting now. No more living together, no more hanging out one on one, no trips together even in separate rooms. Don\u2019t text him, but leave him unblocked unless he gets too unhinged so that he might let on what his whereabouts are. Tell your friends about this. A guy that will try to impose his romantic fantasy on you definitely is a risk for a revenge fantasy, too. You need to be safe. I know you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cbut I know him, he wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d The fact is, you\u2019d probably have said the same a week ago if somebody had said, \u201cwhat if Jordan proposes to you on this trip?\u201d You don\u2019t know the inner workings of his mind.",
            "I would only meet with him in a public place. I would be concerned he is developing schizophrenia or some other mental illness, he's the right age for it .",
            "There's no saving this. \n\nBut please do tell other people in your friend group, otherwise he will lie to them and try to ruin your reputation.",
            "Two guesses.\n\nThe cynical side of me (which is the stronger side) is that Jordan is gaslighting you - real, actual gaslighting, not internet gaslighting. He's creating this narrative that you've been in a romantic relationship - or at least that you've been \"leading him on\" - in an effort to convince you that you really did have something that you are obligated to act on. \n\nThe...less cynical side is wondering if maybe something is very odd with Jordan - perhaps he's not good at social skills and signals, or has some sort of psychological disposition to read way too much into everything.\n\nEither way, it kind of doesn't matter. You never dated, you don't love him, and you don't want to marry him. If he truly thought the relationship was 'strong enough' to take you to the next step, then he would've talked to you about it! Proposals are not supposed to be surprises.\n\nPersonally, I would text him back with exactly what you said here (so you have a textual record, and so that you can lay it all out). We were never in a relationship, so there was nothing to break up. You did not publicly humiliate him; he humiliated himself by asking you to marry him out of left field when you were never in a romantic relationship. You never had a remotely romantic or sexual relationship with each other, you've never talked about marriage before, you've never even kissed him - why on earth would he think you were dating, much less close enough that you were ready to get *married?* \n\nAlso, fuck those people who were giving you dirty looks. A woman is not obligated to marry a man just because he asks in public, and they have no idea what's going on.",
            "The guy is clearly delulu. Sorry, the friendship is over. From here, he's going to either completely disappear from your life, or he's going to make up lies about everything to save face. I hope for your sake it's the former",
            "Sounds like he was fantasizing on one hand and with the best friend and living together he had confirmation bias that you had also felt the same way.   Maybe in time you guys will have a friendly relationship again but right now just need reality to get through to him",
            "This seems really weird.  Were you FWBs?  In the 2 years that you were friends, did you ever date other people or talk about people you were attracted to?  \n\nTrying to understand why he had assumed you were in a relationship.",
            "Please stay with your parents, you are not safe atm",
            "Is he from a patriarchal culture? Have you had any relationships or flings while you guys were roommates? And what was his reaction to that if so?",
            "Wow, I consider most of what I read on this sub to be fake and even if this is too, I'm hooked. Can't wait for the follow up",
            "Well\u2026 this interesting. He\u2019s delusional. There\u2019s no way a sane person could assume you were together. Try to be safe, as he might be unpredictable once you talk with him. Start making arrangements to change roommates. This sucks big time, I\u2019m so sorry.",
            "He isn't well. You did nothing wrong, and he turned it into something it wasn't. This is like stalker behavior. I'm worried about your safety. Don't talk to him alone, always have someone with you. Cut your trip short and go home.",
            "Don't feel bad for hurting his feelings. \n\nHe didn't even consider yours when he decided to publicly propose in your hometown knowing this could unfairly pressure you to saying yes...and then what?? \n\nHe made you feel uncomfortable and now he just ran off leaving you worried. \n\nThis is manipulative behavior and might not be the friend you thought he was. He doesn't seem like he's in his right mind and hasn't even had one conversation with you about anything.",
            "Plot Twist: you're the delusional one and you're mentally blocking out all the memories of being intimate and in a relationship with this guy for two years and Jordan is totally hurt and confused (basically Jordan's perspective).",
            "the fact that you guys are sleeping in seperate hotel rooms should have told him something",
            "It's wild that he went from you guys being roommates to that meaning you are in a serious enough relationship that he proposes! You sleep in different beds, you have zero affection. How could he possibly think this would have been a good idea?! I hope he comes back so you guys can talk this through. I'm interested in hearing his train of thought.",
            "I had this happen twice when I was younger. \n\nThey have created an entire imaginary relationship in their heads that never involved me in reality. Both times it was a total shock to me as I thought one was the boyfriend of my flatmate, and the other just a guy in our friend group (I didn't even know the correct name of the second guy when he proposed in front of all my girlfriends).\n\nNeither time it happened to me did the relationship continue, both guys never spoke to me again. The friendship, from my point of view, was just a lie - they were only in it for the imaginary girlfriend/wife experience.  It made me very wary of ever being friends with men again.",
            "Shame on the people giving her dirty looks. A woman who is proposed to in public has every right to say no. Imagine being put on the spot like that. My fiance proposed on the sidewalk. Some guy walked by, but that's it. I'd have been so scared if there were a bunch of strangers watching, and I wanted to say yes.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. I second every person who has told you not to meet in any private place like your hotel room. \n\nI would come up with some things to mention to him about how YOU see a romantic relationship (i.e. being asked if you want a relationship, basic physical touch, more intimate physical touch) so that he can see your criteria for a relationship and his are not matching up.\n\nI would even mention that marriage isn\u2019t something you take lightly and that you have quite a lot of milestones you would need to reach with someone before a big decision like that. Make it clear you have not had those milestones met by anyone hence the confusion. And if he\u2019s such a good friend of yours then you thought he would talk to you about it before jumping in. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should do any of this so that he will think he has a chance but more so it can be a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d to protect you until you and he are FAR away from one another. You being alone with him is THE WORST thing for you so any way to speak to him gently when he\u2019s being delusional and get out of this situation without him getting aggressive is the way I\u2019d go.",
            "I just want to say I\u2019m sorry OP. \n\nIt hurts to think someone is your genuine friend and then to find out that had ulterior motives the whole time. Or to find out they\u2019re apparently fully delusional.",
            "You need to tell someone you know and trust, just to be safe. Don't let a bunch of strangers on Reddit be the only people who are aware of the situation. But also update us so we don't worry, ok?",
            "Do you know how many/how strong his friendships are outside of you?\n\nI think both the \"psychotic break\" and the \"sheltered/genuinely thought this was a relationship\" options are both on the table.  What would lean me more to the latter is if he doesn't have a single friendship that comes close to the level of emotional intimacy that the pair of you have had.\n\nTo quote the great Dr. NerdLove:\n\n\"Part of the reason for this is entirely social; men, specifically are socialized to equate emotional intimacy with romantic and sexual intimacy. From toddlerhood to puberty, boys tend to be gloriously open-hearted; we love and adore our friends and think nothing of it. But almost from the moment we hit puberty, we\u2019re bombarded with lessons that teach us that the sort of open-hearted, freely expressive sort of affection we have for our friends \u2013 especially our male friends \u2013 is bad and wrong and signs of weakness or \u201cbeing girly\u201d\u2026 or worse...So when straight cis men become close friends with women\u2026 it feels entirely different than a lot of male friendships. It\u2019s frequently more expressive, more emotionally intimate in ways that we have been taught to associate almost exclusively with romantic love\u2026 or at least with the possibility of sex, in any case.\"\n\nIf he is your only source of emotional intimacy, he's been too bought in to this socialization, and he's generally kind of sheltered (which coming from Northern England he absolutely could be), then it's totally possible he mistook \"a healthy and emotionally fulfilling close friendship\" as \"romantic interest\" straight up.",
            "what happened when you met his girlfriends?  \n\nwhat happened when he met your boyfriends?   \n\nthis has been going on for 2 years.  long enough to know better but short enough to move on and learn from it.",
            "This is a wild story! I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re in this situation. As others have said, speak to him about this over text or in public. There is at least some level of delusion going on here. Stay safe and keep us updated!",
            "What on Earth? Are you or he super religious where you don't believe in even kissing before marriage? I honestly don't know how someone could think they're in a relationship with someone who they've never kissed or even held hands with. I know people are jumping to him having some kind of mental break, or brain injury or something. He had a ring so this obviously wasn't spur of the moment, which honestly makes it scarier. He fully went out and bought a ring and waited for what he thought was the right moment to propose. Yikes. Be safe OP.",
            "I'm sorry OP but I think you need to end this friendship. I guess you could try to salvage it but this guy seems really strange. I've had guy friends declare their love for me when we weren't dating, so I know they can get feelings, but those guys knew we weren't dating and I guess were shooting their shot. I guarantee your friend thought you'd been on numerous dates as I had guy friends refer to us hanging out literally going to McDonald's as dates so in his head he thought these were undeclared dates. \n\nIt sucks if you lose a close friend but idk that behavior is just so strange and delusional to me. It does not seem like someone well would act that way. I really think I'd just distance myself from him.",

He was my friend so I did, and I ended up having to house him, feed him, and reject him all over again in person a second time (first time we had ever met irl). Was very awkward when I dropped him off at the airport and he begged me to let him stay. We hadn't spoken in those two months so he had no idea when he came to my city that I was seeing someone else, with whom I am now engaged. Haven't talked since.\n\nSome men do just be a bit confused, I think.",

            "Not to be dramatic, but this sounds like a beginning of a true crime show. I know everyone posting here has already given you warnings, but really try to be extremely cautious with him. Talk to your other close roommates about this too, not only so they know but also so you can get perspective about what he has said in the past when you\u2019re not around.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if you have this kind of closeness, but are you aware of him ever having any mental health struggles in the past? Or when he retells stories that you were present for, does it ever seem like he\u2019s adding in details that weren\u2019t true? I forget the term, but there\u2019s something brains can do where they rewrite memories/mix up memories and the person believes the mix up is true (similar to what happens with a lot of alien abduction stories). \n\nOverall I\u2019m just so sad this happened to what seemed like a really close, trusting friendship. It reminds me of a friend my sister had in college\u2014they would do everything together but never had any flirting/physical touch/romantic communication. Then in her sophomore year she started drinking more and going to fraternity parties. He literally sat her down like an angry parent, told her she had really disappointed him and that she had no value to him anymore because there was no potential to be romantic partners because she had a drink every so often. She literally had no hint that he was interested in her and she definitely was not interested in him that way.

Do you remember moments he ever got mad at you hanging out with other guys or anything where it felt he was possessive over you?  The best thing for you both is for you to lay it out to him and that you just don't have those feelings for him and didn't know he had feelings.  Just now this could wreck the friendship as he might not accept no as an answer.  He might also agree to just be friends but continue trying to make you love him.  He also might just end the friendship.  Unfortunately this happens and you cannot control his actions.  I can't see anything that he could have misread.  At the moment let him cool off and pout.  The more you text/call and worry the more it strengthens him.  You ever seen (or experienced) those videos when young kids threaten to run away?  If the parent cries and begs the young child then the child has gotten the reaction they want.  When the parent responds with \"well take care,\" and goes back inside the Child immedialty abandons that idea.  Currently you are giving him the reaction he wants.  I would stop searching and let his phone go silent.  That silence will allow him to calm down and make him come back to the hotel.  Good luck",

You need to be direct and say that you never thought of this as a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship and ask him why he assumed it was. Most likely. He viewed things as dates that you didn't.

And you will eventually need to do damage control with your social circle, but think of a way to put it that kind of gives him a chance to not be publicly mocked.\n\n\nHe's really quite delusional but it is a romantic thing to think of marrying your best friend. If he's very shy or sexually uncomfortable one can see how he might have built something different in his head than what is reality. Oh, it's really sad!\n\n\nBut yeah.

            "As far as him not having any other place to go but back to the hotel... No. There's a lot of places he could go. Most of them aren't good, so perhaps you should check some hospitals.\n\nI'll say this: I had a friendship with a girl when I was younger that I *thought* was a relationship. We were each other's number one. We hung out daily. I was a year older and when I went to university, they would call me almost every day to say hi and tell me they missed me. We said \"Love you\" at the end of every phone call. We were never intimate because, as I thought at the time, we both wanted to wait until we were ready. We kissed on the cheek but never more than that. \n\nI came back for holiday and my friends were going to have a little birthday party in my honor. She showed up with a guy. I didn't really know what to think or what was going on. \n\nShe told me that this guy was her boyfriend and they had been dating for a month. Prior to this moment, she hadn't mentioned him *at all*\n\nI was humiliated. I had saved up money and bought a very pretty necklace with her birthstone in it. I had planned a surprise trip to a resort town a few hours away where I had reserved a romantic cabin in the woods and I wanted to finally be intimate. It all just ended immediately. I left my own party, avoided her for the rest of the break, and spoke to her only twice more. Once, when she called me to clear the air and another when she came by the next time I was home so that she could return my things.\n\nLooking back, I see now how I misread so much but in the moment, it was my delusion coupled with her need for adoration that made me think we were a slow burn romance.\n\nI don't *not* believe you. This does sound a lot like someone grossly misread the situation but the glib tone with which you're responding to people here might indicate that you maybe aren't the best at empathy or being particularly thoughtful of other people's emotions? Maybe you always knew, deep down, but it was comforting and fun to have a shadow boyfriend for moments when you'd have otherwise been alone? If you had hookups that didn't go anywhere, it seems like you either couldn't form a romantic relationship or didn't want one. If you had someone doing for you everything that a boyfriend would, excepting intimacy, maybe you had a little more responsibility in this than you think?\n\nAt any rate, the best thing for *both* of you is to hard stop the friendship and go your own ways.",
            "I must admit it's kind of strange that he'd propose without even having dated or kissed you.  Perhaps he's very old-fashioned, in which case it might be out of turn as far as he's concerned.  All you can really do is explain to him that marriage isn't your goal and not what you want.  It will probably end your friendship and that's unfortunate but that's really all you can do.",
            "he might be delusional to a degree obviously, but i think this happens more often than people realise between younger people. i think if you decide to take this stance of him potentially being dangerous based off on this advice, then it's better you just cut him off completely imo. \n\nhe's gonna sense and tell, the next time you meet, if you are scared of him. it's just gonna break his heart even more and make an already, clearly, confusing situation worse. \n\nclearly, us guys have a responsebility to pick up on and interpret signals and communication correctly from you girls. but honestly, i dont really buy into your story that you never picked up on him sending you ANY signaling of being into you romantically before this happened. if that's true, then you are clearly somewhat delusional as well, and frankly, a bit immature and naive. just like him.",
