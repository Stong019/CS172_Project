But internet has been my best friend in old age and I frequent this subreddit regularly. \n\nI have two sons and a daughter (51, 50 and 44). I haven't talked to my sons in about 25 years and my daughter in 20 years. They chose to cut me off permanently and I respected their decision. With my history of mental illness they had every right to do that. I had problems with narcissistic personality disorder and anger which took many decades for me to overcome and I'm still fighting my demons to this day.\n\nI'm living the final months of my life. I have terminal cancer and will soon be gone from this world. I promised them to respect their wishes and I have for 25 years but deep in my heart I do wish to see them again, maybe to apologize for one last time before I'm gone. I don't know if I am being selfish as I can also apologize in my will. I want to do what is best for them. Will they be interested in seeing me before I die? There are considerable assets that I have which I am leaving all of it to them so they will hear about my death. \n\nIf you can provide some advice about my situation I will be grateful. You're all closer to my children or grandchildren's age and can see things from their eyes better than I can.\n\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I'm dying and have not spoken to my children in 25 years per their request. I am not sure if I should let them know that I'm dying.\n\n---\n\nI never expected so much advice and love from you. I thank you all and I'm reading everything to come to my final decision. ",

            "I will start by saying: For children to cut off a parent, that parent has to have done something that really, really upsetting, something so hurtful, so unforgivable. And for them to maintain that silence for 25 years reinforces just how bad it must have been. So, whatever happens between now and your death, or between now and them hearing from the executors of your will, you need to accept that they may never forgive you, in this world or the next.\n\n\nThat out of the way:  Write a letter to each of them. Apologise. Tell them you love them. Ask for forgiveness. Explain what you have done in those 25 years to try to become a better person. Apologise again. Maybe ask for one last meeting or some photos or a letter in return.\n\nBut do not make excuses for whatever you did, because that will immediately put them off you forever - whatever you did to make kids abandon you for 25 years, my guess is that it is inexcusable. \n\nAnd don't wag a will at them. Any bequest should be a surprise and a bonus. If you mention it now *even if the intention is to demonstrate your contrition*, it will look to them as if  you are trying to buy their love back.\n\nGood luck. \n\nAnd if they don't reply you must respect that and leave them alone their new lives, without re-opening old wounds. Maybe just a quick call from the nurse as you are sinking.",

            "OK so my aunt died last year.  She was estranged from her kids for 25 years because she was an alcoholic and put them in a lot of dangerous positions.  Her boyfriend was her health care proxy and he told no one she was in the hospital until she died (cirrhosis and pancreatitis).  When we told her daughters, they both said they would have gone to see her in the hospital.  I would at the very least let them know, write them a letter or something. ",
            "[deleted]",
            "I'm 42.  The last time I saw my dad I was 15.  Over the years he tried to contact me via my mom a couple times.  I never contacted him back.  I felt no need to have him back in my life.\n\n2 years ago, while I was traveling, I got an email from his brother.  My dad had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and given 3 months to live.  I was returning to the US in a month and his brother told me that my dad realized that he'd been a shitty parent had had no right to expect anything from me but that he'd like to see me and apologize before he died.  His brother asked me to consider visiting my dad when I returned to the country.\n\nI'll be honest, it was a shock.  And I struggled a bit with the decision.  For all intents and purposes, my dad had been dead for decades.  So hearing from him out of the blue was a bit of a shock.  I told my uncle that I would think about it and get back to him in a day or two.  I talked to my mom and some friends and ultimately, I decided to see him.  Not really for me, I was kind of ambivalent about it.  But I felt that if it would give him some peace at the end to apologize, I would do that.\n\nI sent an email to my uncle the next day.  He received it about 3 hours after my dad died.\n\nI don't really regret not seeing him.  I wasn't doing it for me.  The only thing I regret is that he died before finding out that I'd agreed to see him so he didn't get that peace.\n\nSo, take that for what you will.  If you have an intermediary that won't harass them, perhaps ask them to make contact on your behalf.  Just tell them that you'll be gone soon and you'd like the chance to apologize.  Let them know that you know you fucked up so you accept and respect their decision if they don't want to see you.  And make sure whoever is contacting them doesn't pressure them at all.  Then let them make their decisions.  If they don't want to see you, respect that.  Then write them your letters and leave them with your estate to be delivered upon your death.",
            "A letter is good because it gives them options. It can be read, left unread, or thrown away. If it is read, the reader can decide, in privacy, whether to do something in response. In a situation like this, it is the most respectful way to reach out, and I think it is acceptable given your terminal condition and the possibility that an apology and the chance for a last visit or call may be of benefit to one or more of them.  ",
            "Ma'am, I am sorry for the pain you have experienced in your life, and I hope your passing is as painless and as peaceful as possible. I myself am not religious, but if you are, I hope the other side is as wonderful as they say it is.\n\nAs for your children, would you consider video taping an apology/goodbye message to be played for them by your lawyer when they are asked to the reading of your will? That way, you can say what you want to say without breaking the No Contact they asked for in life. ",
            "I think you should be clear that you are apologizing and not asking for forgiveness. \nI think there is a distinct difference between the two. \n\nLay it all out there, speak your bit and face the notion that they may not respond. \nThis might not end up with the resolution you wish. \nBut I do think they deserve to know about your health. \n\nI had an estranged Grandmother. All of us put up with her awful shit for years. Narcissistic  verbally abusive, lying...never took any blame for her actions.\n\nHad she actually aplogized and taken the blame for her actions without demanding anything...I would have been stunned and willing to speak with her. \nThat never happened. She went to her grave being an awful person. \n\nOP, I commend you for taking responsibility. \nI'm sorry about your illness. I hope you find a peaceful end. ",
            "> maybe to apologize for one last time before I'm gone.\n\nwill it be sincere?  From your heart, with no expectations of forgiveness or even answer?  An apology that indicates that you *actually* understand what you did wrong and why they don't speak to you?\n\nIf not, if this is you gratifying yourself, then don't bother.\n\nI think letting them know is fine, IF:  you do it through someone else, and place no pressure on them.  For example, if there is a relative that you know they still speak to or a family friend, just pass on the news of your diagnosis.  Then leave it up to them.\n\nQuite frankly, we (I) don't trust deathbed reconciliation, confessions, or apologies.  too often I've seen them used as one final, manipulative jab at the 'disobedient' child.  The ultimate version of punching someone, then running away so they can't hit back.  At best, they tend to turn into one last chance for a lecture from someone who never really understood the problem in the first place.\n\nSo:  go ahead and give them the information, but don't expect anything, and don't be surprised if they choose to do nothing with it.  Don't use this as a reason to push for anything.  If there's not anyone who you can go through, OR if the person who still talks to them would pressure them into reaching out, don't.  The only way this works is if there's no pressure AT ALL.",
            "I have cut off contact with my own mother for many of the same reasons that you provide here. Like many here, your post strikes a chord with me as I face the possibility of my mother passing away. \n\nI don\u2019t know the details of your situation, but for me, a situation that uses illness or impending doom to manipulate me and create a need for contact is something I have dealt with before. Also apologies. Like many who have already responded, this history would make it difficult for me to receive a \u201cend of life, clear my conscience\u201d letter from my mother without feeling manipulated, confused, sad, angry, etc.\n\nSo, here\u2019s my honest opinion. If there is some value to you in a last-effort to reach out, apologize, and potentially connect, do it. At this point, you cannot control how they react. You\u2019re doing it for yourself. Acknowledge that.\n\n1.\tDon\u2019t pressure or beg them to see you/contact you. Put the situation out there without expectations or emotional strings and let them do what they want to do. I.e., \u201cI have received X diagnosis and am told that I have about 3 months left. In the time that I do have, I want to express to you that I take full responsibility for the many mistakes I have made as a parent and apologize for the negative impact my choices have had on your life. These things weigh heavily on me as I look back at my life and I do not want to go without extending to you a final, sincere apology for the things that I have done which have caused you physical and emotional harm.\u201d\n\n2.\tPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t belabor individual points, apologize for specific actions while leaving out others, or get into justifications, ways you\u2019ve tried to make up for it, etc. I\u2019m not saying those things aren\u2019t true or part of your own story of how you deal with your choices/life, I\u2019m saying that I feel sometimes that \u201cpackage\u201d can be so emotionally burdensome that it defeats itself.\n\n3.\tI would not discuss what property you are leaving them. They\u2019re going to find out once you\u2019re gone and it comes to them. If you include that discussion, it will feel like (and be) an emotionally manipulative strategy to get what you want from them and it will likely taint the gesture that you are making by leaving them your property.\n\n4.\tPersonally, I hate the \u201cI\u2019m so proud of who you\u2019ve become, I will always love you more deeply than you can ever imagine, you were always such a wonderful child\u201d shtick, but, I mean, only you know if you\u2019ve overused that in the past. If you feel like you really want to say something like that, keep it to your feelings. \u201cI want you to know that I love you.\u201d Not \u201cYou will never understand how much I care for you.\u201d Not \u201cNo matter if you ever speak to me again, I will still love you deeply.\u201d Just own your own feelings & let them have theirs!\n\nThey are adults & probably not totally dumb, so they will realize that this is their final opportunity to connect, forgive, or receive some kind of closure. If they want that, they\u2019ll be able to figure it out.\n\n\nLast, but not least, I know it\u2019s probably tough, but with this gesture, let it go. Grant them the autonomy to make their own decisions, respect where they are, & know that you did what you could to clear your conscience by offering a final, sincere, no-strings-attached apology. That is all you can do at this point to make amends, probably. \nFill your remaining days with meaningful things that don\u2019t involve your kids. I have a lot of complex emotions when it comes to my mother, but I would want her last days, with or without me, to be filled with clarity and peace. I would want her to do things that bring her joy and to find ways to fill her life with beauty, even if I don\u2019t necessarily want to be part of that. \n",
            "Irrespective of what has happened in the past, I would want to know if my mum was dying.  I'd make my decision from there.\n\nI would write them a letter.  Tell them how you feel, the progress you feel you made and the struggles you still have.  Explain the situation and say you don't expect them to want to visit, but you would love to see them.\n\n1 letter each.  You can respect their wishes beyond that, but give them the choice of how they deal with the situation.",
            "I'm 44 and have been NC with my parents for years. When I found out my father died last year, I didn't care. Even if he had written a genuine letter of apology, I still wouldn't have seen him because I didn't just close doors, I welded them shut. I cannot, mentally, revisit some paths, I just can't. Write letters if you like, but be prepared to get nothing back. Children of abuse just can't go back sometimes.",
            "First off, I'm sorry you're terminal, I hope your end is quick and not painful. \n\nI haven't spoken to my own mother in ages, for the same reasons you state above. I'd rather not heat from her again. However I would make an exception if she reached out to say that she is dying. This I would want to know and hear from her, not a go between. I wouldn't let her back into my life necessarily, but I'd offer some words of support and hopefully hear an apology. Email them, let them know, and take their cue, let them make contact after that.\n\n",
            "Many people here have said not to ask your kids for forgiveness. That's right on. You have no right to ask them for anything. But if you are offering something (an apology), maybe write them a letter. I was raised by toxic parents, and for years I longed for an apology. Some acknowledgment that how they treated me was wrong and I didn't deserve it. That may give them some peace. ",
            "One day my mom will be in your position and posting this question.\n\n\nAll I can think of, imagining this scenario, is why in gods name would you wait until now to apologize?",
            "I am currently estranged from my mother so I think I may be able to help you.\n\nThis is gonna hurt - but don't contact them. If you can have a family member who you can trust to not guilt them let them know of your condition and then wait. If they want to approach you they will. \n\nBut \" imma die so talk to me\" is probably how any attempt at contact will sound . If you want to safeguard a way to say good bye I'd recommend a handwritten letter (if you can) or a video. \n\nAnd when you apologize remember - you need to be sorry for the actions that drove them away. Not that they left. Leave any phrase like \" I'm sorry if I hurt you/ I'm sorry you feel this way/ I'm sorry I wasn't good enough\" at the door. They don't accept responsibility or the gravity of the role you play in their relationship.  And then you have to actually own what they are upset about.\n\nOther than that you just have to prepare for them to not respond.",
            "I'm 39. I recently disowned my mother. The conversation that led to this action was enlightening to me. I've struggled with crippling depression, suicidal tendencies, eating disorders, and PTSD. I thought that my struggle had begun roughly at puberty, but I found out that she'd thought I was depressed as a young child. She never did anything about it. When I had an eating disorder for three and a half years, she never did anything about it. \n\nExcept tease me. Make snide comments.\n\nWhen I came out to her as bi, her immediate, knee-jerk reaction was, \"How can you be in a monogamous relationship if you're attracted to other people?\" \n\nI'd been married for 16 years. \n\nI never came out to her as poly- my sisters did that for me.\n\nShe's hurt my children similarly. \n\nOur last interaction, the one that made me cut her out, she involved my children. She didn't respect me, my wishes, my children, or my spouse. \n\nYet, I'm the one in the wrong, according to her and my youngest sibling.\n\nWhile I have a lot of hurt and rage still, I hope that if she ever sent me a letter of apology I'd at least consider a reconciliation. Were she on her deathbed, I'd probably give it a bit more consideration. \n\nI am only human, however, and I don't know if 30+ years of neglect, abuse, and patent disappointment in me could be forgiven without therapy (with her, as well as private) and some sort of action that would engender trust from me to her.\n\nI truly hope that your children will respond to you, if you choose to act, but I also really wanted to give you perspective from the other side.   ",
            "Reaching out is fine, but do it in a way where they don't feel forced to respond (letter).  You can choose to reach out, and they can choose to either reach back or ignore.",
            "Here's my perspective - as a child who cut off my parents in my 20s.\n\nWho is your current family?  Who have you surrounded yourself with to be your support network?  \n\nWhen I cut my family out of my life, I accepted that I needed a different support network and I built one out of friends that I trusted and respected.   I now have a large happy healthy thriving network of people that I can rely on.  Who do you have?\n\nIf that answer is no-one, you may not have done enough work on yourself.  \n\nBecause your kids are just an accident of your gene pool.  They didn't choose which sperm and ovum created them.  And that sperm and ovum have no bearing on their support network.  And shouldn't have any bearing on yours.\n\nI'm fairly certain that my father passed away about 10 years ago.  I don't know for certain, because I hadn't spoken to him in about 15 years at that time.   So yes, that's 25 years since I last laid eyes on my father (I'm in my 50s).  And you know what?  My kids are better off not knowing him.  They didn't need the crap that he would shower on them.  They are better off mentally and emotionally never having to deal with a narcissist grandfather.  \n\nIf you have a will, you can leave a letter in the will for each of them.  \n\nA counselor or priest can help you ease your guilt and pain.  Because the only concept of closure comes from within.  \n\n",
            "Are you sure you are not using this as an excuse to bring them back into your life? Do you really regret all you did or do you just want people to think you are sorry? I'm asking because I got one of you as a mother and have been NC for two years and I plan on keeping it that way. I don't believe in her apologies (the few I've gotten from her in 37 years). Just do them a favor and spare them the trouble. They have moved on. You brought this upon yourself. If they cared about you they would have tried to make contact with you in all those years. You shouldn't have had kids if you knew there was something wrong with you. ",
            "Respectfully - death is the eventual outcome that we all share so that in and of itself is not unique. Equally for kids who have gone no contact - death might be one of the things they've been waiting to have happen - without knowing or judging you we don't know what kind of hell they believe you put them through.\n\nBUT -- you might want to afford them some opportunity to wrap things up -- **not through you reaching out to them** but say through a neutral 3rd party at least letting them know the end is coming for you then leave it up to them to make an overture or not.",
            "I think /u/deep_sighs said it best. Write each child a letter. Don't mention the will; don't ask for forgiveness. Name the things you did, don't justify them or try to minimize them; tell them why it was wrong and that you're sorry you did it. You may get nothing in return from them; it may be too little too late. But it's worth doing anyway. It may be something that they very much need to hear before you die.",
            "Mental illness blows, doesn't it?  I'm sorry about your cancer and your situation.  I don't think that it could hurt to reach out once to them.  Just once.  Make it clear, but concise, the reason that you're contacting them.  After that, it's up to them.  Like you said, you can always say more in your will since they will learn of your passing.  I hope that you can find some peace and comfort with the time you have left.  \n\nSide note:  I have a biological dad who doesn't speak to me.  I reached out one last time a few years ago and he didn't return my call like he said he would.  But at least I tried.  It's up to him now and I'm mostly good with that.  I just throw this in here because even with everything that's happened in the past, they might like to hear from you while you're still here.  ",
            "OP no one can give you good advice without knowing the scope of how bad you were. I noticed you did not give any specifics about your bad behaviour which is typical of narcissistic estranged parents.\n\nWhat have you done to them, what were the points that made them decide no contact? If I was talking to them, what do you think they would say is the worst thing you did to them?",
            "I'm on the other side of this.  I had cut off contact with my father, who was very physically abusive *and* openly hated me, and he became terminally ill.  I honestly couldn't have cared less.  I wasn't happy about it; I wasn't sad about it.  I gave him the same consideration that I'd give a stranger off the street.  \n\n\nThe illness lingered for many years before he finally passed away.  After cutting him out of my life, I got somewhat of a \"courtesy call\" the day that he was really dying.  I got in my car and drove several hours to see him one last time.  He couldn't say much and I'm sure that he was barely aware that I was there.  I don't regret going, but I'm not happy that I did.  I was surprised that, in the moment, I did want to see him one last time while he was alive.  \n\n\nI say contact them and let them know.  I'll be honest, for all three of your kids to cut contact, you likely did some horrific stuff.  But a lot seems to have changed in 25 years, and it would help them make sense of things if you were to discuss the issues frankly.  \n\n\nThey may be no contact with you, but they'll never forget you.  If things were so terrible that they'd cut off contact, it's likely that they're still working through issues and trying to figure things out.  \n\n\nAbuse (of any type) can make a person feel worthless.    *If the people taking care of me don't love me, what's wrong with me?*  Acknowledging that what you did was terrible and that you value them for who they are will probably help them come to terms with what happened.  What I went through was never even acknowledged, and still to this day, years after my father's death, I would love some sort of explanation for things, to know that I wasn't a worthless object to be hit.  \n\n\nIt takes courage, and they may reject you (and even enjoy rejecting you), but you're going to be a part of their lives again when they get the news, and you don't want your legacy to be that you didn't think they were worth enough for you to sacrifice the discomfort of admitting that you failed as a parent.  \n\n\nP.S.  To keep it brief, I left out a lot of details.  If there's any confusion, assume I meant well and don't be afraid to ask!",
            "Growing up, I dealt with a father who was a violent alcoholic who went on to tear my family apart. Upon reaching adulthood I decided to cut him off until he changed his ways. He never did.\n\nI didn't speak to him or see him for the last 10 years of his life. I found out from a third party that he had terminal cancer and was given months to live. I passed along my contact information and waited.\n\nHe never called, never wrote, never even passed along a half-hearted apology. Never bothered to even say goodbye. It's been eight years since his death and despite every bit of new age advice I've heard about forgiveness and letting go of the past, at times I still hate him. Sometimes even more than when he was alive.\n\nYou should contact them and apologize, or at least wish them well. They'll be here long after you, and aside from salvaging some kind of legacy, you might be able to give them the closure that allows them to get on with their lives.",

            "To give you some perspective I am estranged from my mother for six years now. I'm 27. It was my decision for exactly the same general reason that your kids did. I don't know their personal accounts of the trauma you no doubt inflicted upon them, but if you're anything like my mom I don't blame them. And I assure you it wasn't as easy as you think. To this day people look down on me for cutting off \"my own mother\" but they had a real mom that gave a fuck about them or anything more than herself so really they will never understand and I'm glad they don't get it. It just shows how lucky others are because to me it was a no brainer. Once you see other peoples families and you realize oh moms aren't supposed to be like this?? It changes everything. Anyways. I'm on a tangent.  Idon't assume you are anything like my mother obviously I have bias and I don't presume to know you, mental issues really latch onto different people differently. I suffer from my own no doubt inherited if not that then just from the lack of normal parenting. I digress. I can 100% say I made the right decision in cutting off my mom. I have no regrets and I wish I did it sooner because the scars she has left me have influenced who I am and I will never get a chance at that again. That being said. I'd see her before she died if she told me she was dying. Would I think it was a ploy and maybe a lie? Of course. Idk if it would be a morbid curiosity but if I knew for sure it was fact I would see her. Her Being a narcissist, I would almost feel like she just wanted more attention as a gut reaction, a last hurrah but since it's the end I would probably just give it to her. As much as I resent my mother, I do understand that she has no control of it,it's who she is and that's that. But that doesn't change how she made/makes me feel. Much like being punched in the face on accident repeatedly, it hurts the same whether intentional or not. I feel like in a lot of ways I'm a bigger person than her so I would honor a last wish, at the very least I would do it selfishly tospare myself from feeling any guilt from not doing it later on. Oh and don't mention the money at all I would sooner rip a check in my mothers face than cater to that bullshit. Oh also my mother would neverrrrrrr admit fault although you say it took decades so maybe just not yet. Eitherway though you saying that make sure your kids know that you know it's all your fault. Put it in writing so they have something to look back on thats positive if it were me it would bring closure because a part of them probably will never know if they did the right thing.If you haven't ever said that they might not realize you know.

If she showed up at my door claiming to be on her deathbed and begging my forgiveness, I'd slam the door in her face and feel immense satisfaction in doing so. \n\nAre you prepared for that kind of response? I mean, showing up after all this time might rip open old wounds for them that they've long since put to rest. It's *hard* to disown a parent. I know unequivocally that I did the right thing but it's still excrutiatingly painful sometimes. I have issues stemming from my relationship with her that I don't think will ever go away. \n\nI feel like asking forgiveness at this point is entirely selfish, and entirely unfair and you really may not like the response you get.

            " /u/Tristine8 , I'm going to go with some practical advice, I hope that you see this. \n\nFirst of all, I'm so sorry to hear about your situation. I worked in Hospice care and had a few cases like this, where the family wanted nothing to do with my patient. I cannot imagine what you're going through. \n\nHaving said that , I'm not sure if this has been said or if you've taken advantage of this (I hope the answer is yes either way) but I am hoping you're receiving Hospice care. It's a matter of quality of life for you at this point, and if you're 74 years old, you qualify through Medicare with a physicians diagnosis. If you're low-income, you qualify through Medicaid. You need to preserve your comfort. This isn't about giving up, it's about receiving quality of comfort and attention from people who respect the culmination of your life enough to treat you well and end as much pain or psychosocial suffering as they can. Hospice nurses are some of the best people I've ever ever met. Rarely do I see someone so passionate about a career and field. \n\nHospice care provides a social worker who is trained in counseling, a Chaplain who can also provide guidance no matter what your religion or beliefs, and volunteers who are trained in being a good companion. This alone may help you find peace with your struggle. It's also, from my experience, worth seeing if your counselor or volunteer could help be a mediator to your no contact family. Sometimes it takes someone else to reach out and make the situation much more \"real\" to get results. This may sound cheesy, but one of my favorite movies of all time \"Magnolia\" covers this theme very well. A passionate professional advocate of yours who isn't just a doctor or someone seeming biased, someone who specializes in spiritual and psych guidance may be able to bridge the gap. \n\nIf you aren't receiving Hospice benefits, call any well rated Hospice agency in your neighborhood and tell them you're on Medicare/Medicaid/ Insurance and they will find a way to pair you with a case manager. If you have hospice, bug then and bug them and bug them until they've told you they can do all they can to try to incubate a new relationship or line of communication. \n\nI hope you find peace. ",
            "In my opinion, why not reach out to them, just let them know the situation and how you're not asking for anything but a chance to apologize. 25 years is a long time, but I don't really see any harm in trying to see if they want to see you again.\n",
            "I'm sorry for what you and your family have gone through. There's no doubt that was painful for everyone.\n\nIt's likely that your children have already mourned you when they cut you off. If you haven't had contact for a long time, you shouldn't reinitiate without considering all the impact it will have. You want to see them again. That's understandable. It may be painful to go without having seen them, but you won't have to live with those feelings for very long. Your children, on the other hand, may live many years with the consequences of whatever you choose to do. If I were you, I would write your feelings in a letter addressed to them, but never send it. Get your feelings out without involving other people. If you really need to cause drama in someone else's life to feel at peace and understood, you haven't yet mastered your narcissistic personality.  ",

Forgiveness may not involve your children ever being in your physical presence again, if you were ever physically violent towards them.

            "Hi OP. My grandmother treated her children horribly and was undoubtedly a narcissist. The amount of abuse my mother endured for decades definitely left an impact on her. My grandmother has been dead for 14 years and my mother and her sisters still deal with the residual pain left over from their childhood. Though she was never cut off from the family for long periods of time (though she should have been), I often wonder if it would have helped my mom in the long run had she had an apology from her mother...for anything. I'm not so sure that it'll necessarily open old wounds if you reach out to them, because trust me, they live with whatever happened to them every single day. I guess it's just nice to know that maybe some people with shitty personality traits maybe do feel some remorse. It makes me feel like my own grandmother maybe regretted a few things.

I had problems with narcissistic personality disorder and anger which took many decades for me to overcome and I'm still fighting my demons to this day. \n\n> I am sorry if this letter causes you pain and sorrow.

If you would be interested in seeing me before I die, you can (whatever mechanics of visiting, telephoning, or emailing).  \n\n> If you fear that this is yet another manipulation and do not feel comfortable with responding, I completely understand. It's ok, I promise. \n\n> I love you very much and I am sorry that I was not the parent that you deserved. \n\n> I sincerely hope that you have found the happiness, peace, and love in your life. \n\nEdit to suit. If you have a therapist, have that person help you with the wording to as to remove any possible whiff of hurtful language. \n\nIt would be good to give them the option ro email or telephone you first.

If you are leaving them life changing amounts of money, hopefully you have consulted a tax lawyer about structuring their inheritance so as to minimize any tax headaches.

I got home and saw my stuff in the living room only to learn she kicked me out and took my sister and her lesbian lover and 2 friends to mardi gras in New Orleans. \nNeedless to say, my experience with her would be much of the5 same, eventually leading to me moving her to my house in Dallas to get her off crystal meth and a clean start in the tech industry.\n\nShe would end up being kicked out of my house and me not talking to her for years. \n\nFinally i had business in Little Rock AR so i took the time to visit her since she claimed to be clean and healthy and remorseful. \n\nIm glad I did, but 8 years after that i had to deal with her wanting to move back to dallas after being threatened with eviction. I refused since I had my son to take care of and letting her in any position to hurt or disappoint my son was the last thing i had intentions off. \n\n30 days later, she was murdered and i got the call while leaving my clients office that afternoon, which was Disney World in Orlando, FL. I had to leave the next morning back to Dallas, then drive to Little Rock, and take care of everything. \n\nI think about the times she showed zero ounces of give a fuck, the multiple countless times i let shit slide because she was my mom, and realize she got exactly what she gave. \n\nShe died on her knees, in a trailer full of junk, lonely and wishing shed cared less about partying, drugs, and pussy and more about the kids that would see her in her olden years when the other stuff didnt matter much. \n\nId say call them, tell them why, dont tell them about your will, and see what happens. \n\nAs a side note, dont leave them anything. Talk to an atty and create a trust. Set the trust up as a way to help your childrens children or even great grandchildren when they turn 18. \n\nYour children are more likely to spend it or see it as a windfall and as a payoff. \n\nHelping their children and further down will say far more about you to your lineage than what your kids might.  \n \n",

Let them know that you understand why they needed to end their relationships with you, and respect the decision they made, but that you wanted to let them know, before you die, that you are truly sorry for the harm you did to them.\n\nDO NOT ASK FOR FORGIVENESS. Forgiveness is theirs to be offered, but asking for it is presumptuous. When my own father was dying, he sent me several cards, all asking for my forgiveness, and each one made me angry. I'd long since come to terms with my childhood, but his repeated requests that I give HIM peace of mind were simply infuriating to me. It wasn't my job to let him die with a clear conscience, and I deeply resented his efforts to coerce forgiveness from me.\n\nDO NOT MENTION THE WILL. Mentioning that you intend to leave them your estate will only seem like you're trying to buy their affection. Make sure your lawyer/executor know your wishes, and leave it at that.",

            "Oh, I kind of have a parallel experience from the child's point of view. Of course my experience is different, but there are some similarities.\n\n\nI was a daddy's girl when I was young. My father was my world. My first memory is of my dad standing over me in my crib, taking meat out of my mouth (I was a weird kid who chewed up and sucked on meat...) My parents divorced when I was 3. But I still saw my dad on the weekends. My dad was also an alcoholic. He kind of dropped out of my life at 7. I didn't see him again until I was 17(1998), telling him I was going to college and asking him to pay the application fee. We spoke for about 5 minutes before I got mad and left. Then I didn't see or talk to him again until 2003 at my brothers funeral. At some point he had gotten sober, so good for him. We still had no relationship. Then 1 angry phone call. Then silence until 2014 when I was ambushed with him showing up at my half sisters baby shower. Then 2015 I saw him at her wedding, but he didn't say a word to me. And I was glad. \n\n\nFebruary this year, while I was pregnant, he had a massive heart attack. My brother and I went to the hospital, to hear the worst, but he started making a turn for the better. Maybe I was sentimental because I was pregnant, I don't know. But I went to visit him several times in the hospital. He was not in his right mind most of those visits. Talking about women he has been with and my mom. Not acknowledging my pregnancy. Not making sense. Then he was going into heart surgery, and I saw him before he went back. He had a tube in his mouth so he couldn't talk, but for the first time he was coherent. He saw me, and lit up. He patted my belly, and mouthed \"baby\" over and over, and tried to get out of the bed. \n\n\nHe survived the surgery, but was out of it again. Like an angry alzheimers patient. Then I got a call from my half sister. Things had gone south. He died while she was screaming into the phone at me asking what she should do. \n\n\nSo now the point of this and advice. Regardless of the awfulness he may have put me through, I still had love for him. I choose for my last memory of him to be that sweet moment before his heart surgery. He touched my son for the first and last time at that point. And he was that daddy that I loved and adored. When he was wheeled away after that moment was the first of 2 times I cried from start to finish of this all. I forgave him. Even if we couldn't really hash anything out. And when I thought about it, I was sad that, even though the chance was slim due to me being unreceptive and him unwilling to admit to anything, I was sad that there was now no chance of reconciliation. It was now final. It was now done, and I had zero say in that. I was lost because the chance that lingered with me from 7 years old was now definitely gone. I grieved what could have been, not what was, and the few moments we spent together when my son was 7 and a half months in my belly. I am so glad I got that chance. I am so glad that I got that memory. \n\n\nWhile I am unsure that your children would be receptive, I would advise letting them know about your situation. If there were any happy memories, they may want to meet you after so long. Just to say goodbye. I am thankful I got that experience with my dad, even if a year ago I would have said I wouldn't care. While that one nice memory doesn't wipe out the bad, it is wonderful to have it to pull up when I look at my son and can see some of my dad in him. \n\n\nI am so very sorry for your situation, and regardless of what you choose to do, I hope you find peace. But please give your kids the option at least.",

To ask forgiveness of people in the wake of extremely egregious behavior, always strikes me as offensive-- it shifts yet another burden on the ones who were traumatized. Forgiveness is an internal cost-benefit analysis they will have to weigh on their own. They don't need or want your permission or prompting in order to do that-- they have to find value in it for themselves (and frankly, forgiveness is not always essential or vital to people who have suffered) \n\nYour letter should contain a heartfelt apology and be specific, but avoid dredging up long lists of past hurts. Realize that the only substantive thing you can do at this point is facilitate their continued healing after you are gone, by allowing them to understand how much they mean to you and by offering an acknowledgment of how your actions ruined so much. There is actually something noble in the finality of relinquishing the hope of ever being reconciled to them and focusing on letting them know-- however feebly it is said in writing- that they were loved.

            "Your story echos painfully in my heart. I haven't spoken to my mother in almost two years. I keep expecting my father to contact me and tell me she's finally overdosed or otherwise killed herself. I wouldn't feel sad, but happy isn't the right word. I would feel relieved that the pain is finally over... She struggles with unseen demons. She is extremely narcissistic and abused any substance she could get her hands on. My dad escaped through his career and left me and my siblings to fend for ourselves. The trama and abuse she bestowed upon me during my childhood years was very hard to overcome, the healing is incomplete and will always be incomplete. I will carry her marks to my grave. I will likely never be able to form a lasting relationship. It is a source of unending anguish. I only attract women as fucked up as she is. Through countless hours of therapy I've come to understand that my loving and trying to help these broken women is just a representation of my helplessness. If I could help just one woman, it would make it ok that I couldnt help my mother.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd yet, if she ever did make it to a point where she was on her deathbed and she reached out to me I would go and hold her hand and tell her that I love her nonetheless. Forgiveness is the most beautiful thing in this world. It's unfortunate that so many people are incapable of forgiveness, for others or themselves. \n\nI wouldn't write letters or leave notes. It's too late to say you are sorry. It's too late for you to ask your children for anything, especially forgiveness. A note or letter has too much potential to be taken negatively. Letters would only serve to open old wounds that your children have obviously healed over 25 years. It doesn't mean that you should leave this world with a legacy of pain. Your children deserve to know that the life, of the one who gave them life, is ending. Simply say \"i'm dying\" and leave it in their court.

I would not forgive, though. Too late for forgiveness.\n\nReach out and let them know where you are but you understand if they do not want to acknowledge what you have sent etc etc, just that you hope an apology is accepted and you are happy with what they have done with their life - i presume you have some sort of updates??",

I believe that you've damaged your children similarly because cutting your parents out isn't easy, so most people don't do it unless they really really need to.)\n\nHow did you realize you were wrong? How did you gain self-awareness? The thing about narcissistic personality disorder is that it doesn't change, they people can't see themselves and their behavior. Holding out hope that my mother will change is fruitless and harmful for me, but I can't ever let it go 100%. How did you realize just how wrong you were? And how did you fix yourself?",
            "Damn. Even if a parent did something so bad that it hurt me, I would still at least keep in touch. Anyway, do you have any means of contact with them? ",
            "I would perhaps recommend trying to discuss some of their specific grievances here first (maybe in a new post). Perhaps the community can help you understand your childrens' side and what is the best way to approach them if you're planning to apologize.\n\nGood luck to you. I hope you get a chance to see them again.",
            "Most of the comments here are from children of narcissist parents. I can't relate at all but I do think you should reach out  to them. I hope that they will consider seeing you and maybe can develop a few fond memories to remember you by. I really hope that they will meet with you but you have nothing to lose by trying. I wish you peace and hope you do not suffer.",

But when he was on his death bed, and my sister, who had some contact still told me if I wanted to see him before he was gone that I had to come THEN.\n\nI got on a plane from Australia and flew to the US two days later.\n\nMy father was an abusive drug addicted drunk. I didn't go there for him. I went there for me. \n\nNot saying your kids will want to see you. But one might. Or they all might. Not for you.\n\nFor themselves.\n\nThat's all I got.\n\nGood luck.

I wish my dad would have reached out, wish he showed some regret. Instead I'm the one feeling absolutely shit about a person that was awful to me and that I haven't had contact with over five years. I don't regret putting that distance between because it was what was best for me. But it also doesn't seem fair\n\nSorry if this doesn't make any sense, your post really touched me and also not a native English speaker.\nWrite your children letters.",
            "I'm very sorry about your diagnosis and mental illness struggles.  If you have their mailing or email address, I think that is the best route to contact them.  Apologize for everything you have wronged them for and explain your current situation.  Say that you respect their decision of no contact but you would like to see them again if they are open to it.  Do not, I say again do not, guilt or blame them in any way, or confuse an apology with an excuse.  Sending a letter or email leaves it open to them in my opinion.  If you call or show up that could make them immediately defensive and not want to hear what you have to say.  \n\nIf your children prefer not to reconnect with you, you can leave individual letters for each of them with your will.  Use that opportunity to say your peace and ask for their forgiveness.  Good luck with everything!",
            "Honestly, yes, I think you should contact them. As others have suggested, write each one a letter, apologize for your behavior and treatment of them, and explain your health situation. Don't bring up your will or inheritance issues - that will definitely come off like an attempt to bribe or manipulate. And don't use sneaky phrases (like \"I'm sorry if you felt hurt\") that essentially place the blame on them rather than you. \n\nGiving them the option is the best gift you as a parent can offer at this point. If you don't let them know, you're basically removing their agency in the last interaction they'll ever have with you. Whether they get in contact or ignore you, giving them the information is acknowledging their right to make their own decisions.",
            "Wow it looks like some people are projecting their own parent issues on you here.  The top response is really quite excellent though.\n\nAs yet another person in this thread who is estranged from their parents, It never hurts to try and write something heartfelt if it is honest.  You have to be prepared for the reality of receiving nothing in return.  My mother recently emailed me after 10 years of no contact, and I decided not to read it, but I sent her a response saying that I bear her no ill will but I did not read her message, and I am not planning to read her messages in the future.  I'm sure this was quite hurtful for her, which makes me sad.  I do not resent her reaching out after all this time, but I would prefer to invest time into my other relationships or make new ones without this baggage.  I still feel this way knowing that that email she sent me could have been one like what you plan to send.\n\nI don't know if my reaction to receiving something like this helps or hurts, but I hope more information is better.  We can not change the past, but we can make the present us the best we can be. Don't die with regrets.  If this situation pains you, send that letter, and at the very least, you can pass knowing you did all that you could.\n\nBest of luck.",

You're dying; you've got nothing to lose.  And if the hurt goes too deep for them to address the past with you in person, at least they'll get a head start on dealing with the emotions that's going to raise for them.",
            "I agree with the letter idea. Make sure it's worded in a way that truly respects their choice not to see you. \n\nI suspect that whether they hear of your illness prior to or after your death, it's going to stir up old feelings. Be prepared for fact that you could be met with a great deal of hatred and that they may not forgive you. \n\nI suggest sending by certified mail to be sure it was received and then leave it alone. \n\nI also think you should either address them as a group (Dear Mark, Pat, and Jane), or else try to write letters that are obviously personal to each one - and not just copied and pasted, which could seem insincere if they compare notes. \n\nFinally, if you want to run a letter by me privately or post to the group as a whole. I'm sure I/we will help as much as possible. ",

He'd had cancer for a while and was awful. He couldn't speak and looked terrible.\n\nAlthough my Dad and I had a strained relationship I still wanted to see him and say some things to him.

Don't guilt trip them though.\n\nI echo the poster who said write a letter.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your cancer and I hope you're not suffering too much.",

Just a simple statement of your condition, an acknowledgment that you made mistakes in the past (and try not to make these acknowledgements excuses). Maybe acknowledge that they are welcome to come see you if they'd like, but you respect their decisions not to. And then the information they need to know about your will and what not.

            "Let me start by saying that I understand this situation on a smaller scale me, 21(m) My biological father died a couple years back from terminal cancer(lung) and at that time I had not spoken to him in about 5 years or so. He was a very bad man. Very abusive over the years to myself, my siblings, and my mother. I was the only one with the gumption to get out of it. So being a young man that was raised by great man and a fantastic dad (step dad) when I heard the news that  my bio father died from cancer I was completely crushed. Even though for most of my life he was an abusive piece of shit I still was completely destroyed. At the end of the day there was so much I wanted to say to him (good and bad) I always had the hope I could repair the situation and one day have a relationship with him. So despite the fact that I already have a great dad I still had those feelings.  My advice to you OP is no matter what at the end of the day you are still their mother. Yeah the relationship wasn't perfect but what I have learned in my short life so far is that living with regret is one of the worst things you could ever do. Pease reach out to your children, say what you need to say. Tell them you love them. ",
            "Own up to everything. Be very specific. \"I'm sorry I hit you. I was a bad mother.\" Or whatever it may be. Don't justify your actions or try to explain or defend yourself. And don't use martyr language. Be plain and simple. Acknowledge that you were a shitty mother to them and you fucked up and if they choose to contact you, you should be grateful as all hell. \n\nSeeing a therapist during this time may be helpful to prevent you from slipping into old behavior patterns with your children and help get you some closure if they don't decide to lift the no contact. ",
            "I'm not sure what happened between you and your kids but I don't think that is selfish at all. I would contact them right away, asking them to visit. If they have no wish to visit then you should respect that as well. \n\nI hope everything works out and you get to see them one last time.",

            "Hello. As far as advice on what to do next, I believe that u/deep_sighs has the right idea, so I'm not going to expound on that. I just wanted to talk to you.\n\nI am sorry that you are facing the prospect of your death alone. I am sorry that you have been burdened with mental illness. I am sorry that you have been without your children for 25 years. You have my deepest sympathies, and for what it's worth, as one stranger to another, I would not hesitate to wait with you in your hospital room and hold your hand as you pass beyond.\n\nI am proud of you, as well. It must have taken a lot to respect your children's wishes for so long, and it is a testament to your maturity that you can accept your own responsibility in the situation you find yourself in. Regardless of what your children decide to do, know that at least one person on this earth will not think of you unkindly when you leave the rest of us behind. \n\nNone of us know what happens when we leave, but I hope that now, in the twilight of your life, you can at least look back on some things in your life with fondness. The first time you held your children, maybe, or how it felt when you heard them laugh. The way in which you met the great love of your life, if you've been so fortunate as to have one. The kindness that others have shown you, no matter how rare. Hold on to those thoughts, and express them in turn to those around you in the form of as much kindness and compassion as you can muster. Let them be a shawl around your shoulders, and cast off your regrets. They are far too heavy to be brought along on your next great journey. ",

I think a letter or a phone call could be helpful to you and them just to see if they're willing to come see you. I believe enough time  has past where regret over past decisions can encourage dialog between you and them. But here's the thing. You Should not mention a Will at all now here's why. If they are willing to see you knowing about your condition then try to just be happy with that. But if they don't want to see you then. I agree with a nurse calling them when your about to expire will be OK. If no one shows up my advice would be to lovingly forgive them  and forgive yourself and let any regret go as holding on to it doesn't help you. Remember your loved and trust that. Because there was a time where they loved you and that's worth holding onto. God bless you.\n",

A lot of people cut others out of their lives for extremely petty reasons and then when something tragic happens, they realize how stupid they were being. Or time just passes and it becomes the norm, and it's easier to just continue that way. Now I'm not saying this is your situation, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions and say you were an awful parent.

Perhaps a letter/email that explains that you respect their decision for no contact, that you acknowledge that they had every right to do what they needed to do because you were fighting with your demons, and that ultimately you would like to have an opportunity to apologize to them in person if they'll allow it.\n\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't immediately bring up having terminal cancer because guilt is a tool that many narcissists use and it might help the case to first establish your desire to reconnect because you want to and not because of limited time. That knowledge will become known anyway, but it can take away from the conversation if they perceive that it's only being told to them in order to guilt them into breaking no contact. (Not saying that you would mean it that way, but it's a common problem.) I wish you the best, and hope for all of you that some peace can be found during this time.   \n\n\nETA: Since I'm being downvoted for what's apparently an unpopular opinion, might as well add that my advice comes from someone that has gone no contact and has dealt with the \"are they genuinely remorseful\" feelings and managed to rebuild some kind of relationship. It is possible to reconnect in some instances and in my opinion, a heartfelt attempt to apologize is a good start if you're wanting to try. ",

I don't know the details but she is a pathological liar and is verbally abusive.  Despite her flaws we will be taking care of everything when she passes.  I don't respect her decisions but I respect her as a person.  Let your kids know that you still respect their decision.  You seem to know where you were at fault.  I would certainly come running to your side if I was aware of that it was the end of your life.  I hope that at least one of them does the same a puts you to rest in an appropriate way. "

It was super hard cause I sat in the seat he always sat on and I just broke down crying. I am forever grateful for both my step sister and step mom cause we all just had a group hug on her couch while I bawled my eyes out. It ended and we didn't open presents but just talked. We had brunch and it went well tho I was holding in tears for the whole thing, this was the first time I could see they actually do care for me and I care for them. They are my family, I didn't stay the night cause I def couldn't do that but I left around 11 at night. This was the first time I ever felt like a full family unit and not the bad kid who fought with my step mom was just wasn't the nicest to my step sister. I thank them so much for not holding a grudge when I went through my teen rebel phase. I hugged them both goodbye and went home, I feel like me giving them a shot and going to my dad's place helped me realize that these are the people who have always been there for me. I mean they were the ones who didn't give up on me when I was a troubled teen and I love them both for it. I talk with my step sister almost daily now even if its just a good morning text and I call my step mom a bit too now.\n\nThank you all for the comments and making me realize that I should go and how it would do wonders to make us all closer it helped!\n\nTL;DR: went to my step mom's place for christmas and we all bonded more than I thought",

Her father died first and that brought them closer but her step mother was really there for her when her mother passed (her mother had had health issues for years which meant her and sisters ended up being carers).\n\nNow 10 years the two families are completely blended, they all have kids and her step mother has thrown herself into the grandmother role for her step-grandchildren.

It had got to the point where my bf said his mom has overheard our arguments and he said she thinks I treat him like shit. (Im not sure if this is entirely true as his mom has always been absolutely lovely to me) Regardless i was so mortified to hear that, embarrassed and ashamed,  so I said that is a prime example of why we shouldn\u2019t be together. He said it didn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks and he wanted to work through things. In my mind though things had gone too far and we needed to split.\n\nI told him in person yesterday when I was at his house that we needed to break up , that the arguing was too much and it wasn\u2019t good for either of us . Id brought his belongings that he\u2019d left at mine and I tried to be as nice as possible. He turned on me and said \u201cno way, you\u2019re not doing this to me you fucking idiot. How dare you come round here with the intention of breaking up? Are you mental? Are you sick in the head?\u201d He called me the most disgusting names. \n\nI said I needed to leave and I was sorry but he locked the front door and wouldn\u2019t let me go. It was only us two in the house at the time. I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn\u2019t. Instead he started to interrogate me about the reasons I wanted to leave. Kept wanting to know if I\u2019d met someone else and was I leaving him for another guy. I couldn\u2019t get to my cell phone as it was in my purse out of reach so I couldn\u2019t call anyone for help. Then he changed tactic and said  we can work things out, backtracked on the thing he said about his mom, said he loved me and didn\u2019t want to break up. In order to keep myself safe I kept him sweet and I agreed to stay together; he had calmed right down by then and I felt relieved. \n\nLong story short I\u2019m still with him. He said he wants to come to see me later and make things up to me. He said he will buy us takeout and we will have a nice evening together. I don\u2019t know why he is so intent on wanting to stay in such an awful relationship. He tells me I\u2019m a complete pain in the ass all the time and how he\u2019s had enough of me so why the hell wont he just let me go.\n\nTDLR: tried to break up with my boyfriend but he turned nasty ",

            ">I still haven\u2019t left him\n\n>Long story short I\u2019m still with him.\n\nLet's adjust your perception here.\n\nYou did break up with him.\n\nIn response, he imprisoned you in his house.\n\nYou had to play along for your safety.\n\nThat doesn't mean you didn't break up with him. You did. He didn't take no for an answer. That doesn't mean **anything**. You're not still with him. You merely pretended like you were still with him because you were taken hostage. You don't need his approval to break up with him, break ups don't work that way.\n\nYou are in an abusive relationship, and your judgement is extremely clouded. You should find a way to cut all contact with him **immediately** and find a secure place until all this gets resolved. You may need to get a restraining order against him and have what happened in record. You are in danger. Maybe you don't realize but you are in *real* danger. Locking the doors to keep you from leaving the house is **not** normal behaviour. It is abusive, and it is a crime. You were imprisoned against your will. Despite what you might have been led to believe, this is not something done out of \"love\". This is not something a sane partner does to their other half. You need to leave immediately. Don't go to his house ever again, and don't let him into your house either. **Under no circumstances you can be alone with him ever again.** You can get imprisoned (by him, again), beaten, raped or worse. Thousands of women get harmed or killed each year by people just like your ex. Please understand the severity of the situation and please take the appropriate measures to protect yourself.",
            "You're in an abusive relationship. That is why the relationship has felt bad and toxic. This is why he wants to stay with you even thought he calls you terrible names. \n\nA common feature of abusive relationships is the abuser escalates when the victim tries to leave the relationship. He escalated yesterday - he held you hostage in his home and abused you until you agreed to stay with him. \n\nThis is really concerning behaviour. You need to end this relationship and get away from him. Please reach out to your friends and family for support, and read the book 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft. He might escalate further into threats of violence and stalking when he realises you are serious about not being with him and you need to have your friends/family there for you. ",
            "You don't need his permission to break up. You're in a abusive relationship. He held you hostage and locked you in his house. That is illegal. You've given him his stuff back.

If you do, he will try this bs again.",

He tried to plead with me, he said he loved me and that we can make it work but I just said no, it\u2019s over and put the phone down. I blocked him on everything and have now changed my cell phone number. \n\nI\u2019m staying with my best friend for the rest of the week to be safe.\n\nDespite all of this I do feel embarrassed and ashamed about how the relationship panned out. There was a lot of arguing and I do feel like I was a psycho girlfriend - I\u2019m just re reading all the comments on here and trying to drill it into myself that this was abusive/he was gaslighting me but I think I need to see a therapist to really understand that for myself.\n\nThanks again guys x",

No matter what argument he makes--talking circles around you, talking you out of it, blaming you, shaming you--you can NEVER go back or be alone with him again. I would also add never be anywhere NEAR him again. Please. I'm sitting here on the other end of this story because of grit, police, friends, G-d and blind luck.

His emotional manipulation (claiming his mother thinks you're cruel, for example, and probably many other, smaller things you haven't noticed) and not 'letting' you break up with him are pretty classic. Also gaslighting you by saying you must be 'crazy' to leave and that sort of thing. You need to get out of that, it's not healthy and could get very, very bad. Also, try to tell people who he might use to get close to you (friends, family) so they don't inadvertently help him, too, I've had friends keep it close to their chests and then their parents try to get them back together because the abuser acts like it's some rocky period and they're nice to everyone else, so no one guesses how awful they are.

            "Reading this brought flashbacks to when I was in a very similar situation 3-4 years ago. My ex would prevent me from leaving by locking all the doors and holding me down while crying and begging for me to stay. When I tried to get out through the window, he blocked it as well. He would then start threatening suicide and would grab a pair of scissors and threaten that he\u2019d kill himself if I left. I cried a lot and asked why he would do these things and his dumb abusive ass response was \u201cI love you\u201d and shit like \u201cI\u2019m nothing without you\u201d. It took me months to leave him and I contemplated suicide a lot of times during those last few months. \n\nI wanted to leave so badly and when I thought I had successfully dumped him, he would start hitting himself in front of me and even ended up giving himself a black eye. I stayed out of fear he would hurt himself more. \n\nMy mental health drained and I felt so alone. I hit my friends up and they all took me out and I started to see how much I had to get away from him and be around people that made me feel good not trapped and on edge. I dumped him. Ignored his calls and texts. He\u2019d show up every night drunk and bothering my family. He apologized profusely and I told him to get out. After awhile, he stopped.

            "Hey op I was in a similar situation with my ex, though not quite as intense. She and I had been dating for a month, I felt like we were incompatible and wanted to break up. \n\nI knew she would make it difficult in person so I tried over the phone. She wasn\u2019t having that and said if I wanted to break up I had to come do it in person. That I had owed her that.\n\nWhat I wish I had done is say that \u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to end a relationship, it\u2019s over\u201d. What I ended up doing was driving over to her place, and getting talked out of it. \n\nThis situation repeated roughly once a year. I would try to break up with her because I was unhappy in the relationship, she would talk me out of it. Usually she would say that I don\u2019t really want to break up, I\u2019m just angry and when I get angry I just try to completely pull away from the situation. This went on for 6 years.\n\nFinally, a little over a year ago I got up the courage to do it for real. I told myself \u201cI\u2019m not going to end up married to this woman and spend the rest of my life unhappy just because she throws a fit.\u201d So I wrote a note that firmly and clearly stated that I\u2019m out, I do not want to work on it, and there\u2019s nothing to discuss because it\u2019s done. I sat there while she read it. It was really hard but finally with that note we were broken up. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t all bad for those years. I loved her and would totally be friends if she also wanted that but I just couldn\u2019t be in that relationship anymore. We\u2019ve both moved on. \n\nThis turned into a long story about me but what I\u2019m saying is you don\u2019t owe him anything, and breaking up is literally the only thing in a relationship that you don\u2019t need the other person\u2019s consent to do. Tell him you\u2019re done over email or text, and don\u2019t listen to him if he says he doesn\u2019t accept it. It\u2019s difficult but you have to picture where you want yourself to be in the future. \n\nAlso be sure to save any conversations you have with him just in case you need to get a restraining order.

He beat her up so badly that she required surgery to put plates her head and to repair her face! \n\nLuckily, she was on the phone with my friend when the fight began. She thought she'd hung up, but hadn't, so my friend heard it. She and her husband raced over there and pulled her out of there before he killed her. \n\nThen all of her friends rallied at every council meeting to get him fired. Eventually, it worked and he stepped down. But during the trial process, she went back to him! His mother went to her explaining how he didn't mean it, he needed her, and how this was so hard on him. She bought it. She's now convinced herself that all relationships have problems and they're both at fault. They're \"working it out.\" WTF? \n\nThe longer you stay, the more your view of reality, sense of self, and understanding of healthy relationships erodes. Please leave now and get counseling. You are valuable and worth so much more than this! ",

He doesn't think about it that way because he's not a normal person. It's extremely common for abusers to insist that their victims are bad people who make them miserable, yet also insist that the victim can't leave the relationship. That's because the \"You're a bad person who makes me miserable\" stuff isn't an objective statement on the reality of the relationship; it's a statement made to make you feel bad about yourself. You feeling bad about yourself means you're less likely to leave (if you're such a bad girlfriend, who else would want to date you? thus you're stuck with the abuser) and you feel like you need to go out of your way to be nicer to your abuser (after all, you've been such a bad girlfriend to him...) \n\nThe takeaway is that you shouldn't listen to anything this guy says.

            "You send the following text:\n\n\"X: I just wanted to make it clear, as I said yesterday when I went to your house before you imprisoned and threatened me with violence, that this relationship is absolutely over. I want no further contact with you in any capacity, and you are to never approach me  again. Due to the gravity of the things that transpired yesterday, I've gone and filed a report with the police. If you don't honour my wish to be left alone, I will call them without a second thought, as you have already threathened me with violence.\n\nAnd then you block him from everywhere. Then you go down to the police station and file a report about what happened yesterday. It may or may not be enough for a restraining order, but you need a paper trail in case he escalates and you need to get one in the future.\n\nAnd if you live alone, it's a good idea to spend a few days at a friend's couch, or have someone stay with you.\n\nAnd then truly, never, and for any reason, allow yourself to be reeled back in. You reached the right conclusion when you decided to leave him, and now he's shown you you weren't mistaken.\n\nThis is not a game and you are in real danger if you keep engaging with this person.",
            "I was in a similar situation when I tried to break up with a guy a few years ago. He blocked the doorway and wouldn't let me leave until we talked it out. I got really stressed and even though he was a gentle giant, I was scared because I couldnt push past him. That small memory has stuck with me years later and I still get very panic-stricken when someone tries to block my way. Even though he wasn't touching me I still felt so angry and uncomfortable.",
            "Ghost him. Don\u2019t talk to him, don\u2019t answer calls, don\u2019t answer the door if he comes to your house no matter what he says, go absolutely no contact. You tried to break up with him, he proved himself to be dangerous, and there\u2019s no reason to put yourself in danger again. \n\nCall the police and notify them so that they have it on record in case he pulls something else later (and it\u2019s likely that he\u2019s going to). Ask them about a restraining order. Do NOT block his number, don\u2019t answer him, but save every single text he sends you so you can file a harassment claim and have stronger defense when something happens. It\u2019ll be easier to file the restraining order as well if you have proof he\u2019s making unwanted, repeated contact. I\u2019d also recommend for the next few weeks staying at a cheap hotel, AirBnB, or with a friend/family he wouldn\u2019t know a lot about/suspect. ",
            "Send him a message that the relationship is over and his behavior makes you feel unsafe so your blocking him and need him to stay out of your life otherwise you will contact the authorities. (Be harsh. No words like \" I wish this could have been different \" )\n\nSince it sounds like he will escalate , Don't block his email, and if you use fb messenger his messages will still come through and then you'll have more evidence for a longer restraining order , but block him from everything else.\n\nIf he has a key to your place tell the landlord so that it can be changed and so I'd you have security he can be on a not allowed in list (or posters ect).\n\n If you have any pets, see if someone can watch them for a bit and and also try to stay at a friend's house. The amount of times I've seen and heard of men break into houses or apartments is insane . \n\nAlso Goodluck, you deserve better ! And I'm sorry this is happening to you",
            "Call the police. Yes, really.",
            "You are broken up whether he admits it or not. Ghost him. Change your locks. Stay with a friend or family for a few days to make sure he doesn\u2019t turn violent. He is abusive, violent, and frightening. Stay far, far away. You\u2019ve brought him his things and told him it\u2019s over so you do not owe him any more communication ever ever ever for any reason at all. \n\nIt takes 2 willing participants to be in a relationship, but only one person to end it. Doesn\u2019t matter how much he insists otherwise, you have already broken things off and that is that. \n\n",
            "What is actually keeping you from leaving if you don't live in the same house? If he comes around, lock your doors and call the police  as you've already asked him to leave.\n\nYou should've called the police the minute you left his home as he had no right to keep you there by force, that's called kidnapping.",
            "You absolutely DID break up with him. You are now single. Lock your door, and don't let him in when he comes over for takeout.",
            ">  he locked the front door and wouldn\u2019t let me go. \n> I begged for him to let me leave and he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThat's called kidnapping (or false imprisonment). \n\nIt's a crime. \n\nYou understand that, right?",

            "Out of all of the replies on here this is the one I keep thinking about: \n\n*I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you two are terrible to one another and are not right for eachnother and after a while plenty of people will lash out just in retaliation. Abusive relationships are often not one-sided, people seem to want to extract their pound of flesh from one another. Just because she is nice to you doesn't mean she thinks the two of you are good for one another.* \n\nThis is how I feel about myself and the relationship: that I must be abusive as well and my bf lashed out because he has had enough of me and my bullshit",
            "I agree with everyone here. Also is there anyone you can call to have them stay with you for a day or two? He isn\u2019t going to go away quietly. Call 911 if you need to. Have a friend/family stay with you if you can. Block his number cut off all communication. Tell everyone you know that you broke up with him. ",
            "Tell him it\u2019s over, over the phone. Then go away for a few days. He\u2019s not safe to be around.",

If you have any material things over there, you CAN get the police to escort you or with at least TWO friends. \n\nBut he's so close to edge of violence with you. Be super cautious! Im sorry this is happening to you :-(.",
            "Hi-I'm around your age. I was married to an abuser-I left him.\n\nDo not go near him. Tell him that you wish him the best, that you have ended the relationship, and that you do not wish to remain in contact with him. The end. If there is any rage texting, calling, or visits--you call the police. People like this become unhinged very quickly. You made your decision-stand behind it. Intuition is real. ",
            "If he did not let you leave (coerced you to stay until you did what he wanted) I'm pretty sure that's a crime.\n\nIf it's as bad as it sounds in your post, my first stop would be to the police to see if I could get an order of protection or something like it.\n\nThis guy is an abusive psycho and if I were you, I would not feel safe being around him by myself.",
            "Get out now! The next time he does this, and he will, you may not come out alive. Save yourself and leave him.",

            "You\u2019re not still with him!  You gave him the message it\u2019s his fault for not listening.  Disgusting behaviour on his part!\nSend him a message clearly stating again it\u2019s over and say you will call the police if he contacts you again.  Then block him everywhere.  Do NOT enter into any form of conversation.  If he turns up at your house call the police.  That is what I had to do.",
            "Please do not let him into your house. He manipulated the situation and prevented you from leaving his place, if he vomes over to your place theres no telling what he can do. Id be concerned about him possibly doing something so having a friend around today or being prepared to call the cops couldn't hurt either.",
            "Do not let this guy into your house, call him on the phone tell him you thought it over and you still want to break up. If he dares to drive to your house or where you work tell him you will call the police to have him removed. There is no reason you should be forced into staying with this person. ",
            "Tell your closest friend or family member, and make sure they are with you in case he shows up. This is deeply unstable, abusive behavior and you have every right to be afraid. The gaslighting (telling you his mom thinks you're bad news, and calling you an idiot) is just the beginning. Please be sure you're not alone with him again anytime soon, and prepare to keep him out of your life as much as possible. Leave your things behind if you have to, don't give him any more reason to be around you alone going forward.",
            "DO NOT stay with this person. This is an abusive relationship. He called you demeaning things and held you against your will. PLEASE do not let him see you. Block all contact and call the police if necessary ",
            "Call a local women's abuse hotline or women's shelter. They will have resources and can give you advice on how to proceed. You don't have to break up with him again (meaning you don't have to speak with him *ever again*) You don't owe him an in-person breakup and after the way he's behaved, you don't owe him any kind of communication. You might appease him with a few texts while you work on a safety plan, but figure out what supports are available in your area, they will help you get in touch with police, etc. ",
            "This reads like he might hurt you. I would break it off via message, not in person, and avoid all contact. Pursue a restraining order if he continues to contact you. He locked you in his house and refused to let you leave. Even if he never has been violent before that\u2019s a form of kidnapping and a HUGE red flag. If I was you I would consider staying somewhere else for a while to be safe. ",
            "Sorry to hear this, sounds like a very challenging situation. I would say it's time for you to introspect and find out why you would be attracted to this guy in the first place, and why you would stay after he used the threat of force to keep you in the house. This isn't putting \"blame\" on you, or even him, but the idea is to get out of this relationship having learned something so you don't repeat the same mistakes with the next guy.",
            "You are broken up. Your ex boyfriend's refusal to accept that and his attempts at bullying you into staying with him don't change that. You told him you're through with the relationship, so you're done. A break up is probably the one single thing in a relationship that doesn't require the other party's consent or acceptance.\n\nHis outburst is not only unforgiveably, it is concerning. He not only insulted and disrespected you, he threatened and intimidated you to a point where you felt you couldn't safely leave his apartment whenever you wanted. Obviously I don't think you should even consider meeting him, but if you do, be cautious do not meet him at home or anywhere private. If you meet him, do so in public with other people around.\n\nAs for the why? Look at what he said. He said: \"How dare you come here with the intention of leaving me.\". He has more than clearly expressed that he thinks he is entitled to you and your love. Him backtracking on his mom supposedly complaining about you at the very least indicates that that was an attempt at controlling you by making you feel unworthy of him, but that he, the most Gracious and Merciful that ever lived, wants dear old you still. That's a classic and frankly unoriginal emotional abuse tactic. \n\n1. Partner A actively undermines Partner B's confidence and self worth \n2. Partner A makes Partner B believe that he's doing Partner B a favor by staying with him \n3. Partner B attempts to leave Partner A and Partner A loses his shit because how dare unworthy partner B even think he is a position to leave such a grand prize as partner A. \n\nReally not much mistery there once you allow yourself to take what he says and what he does at face value, instead of trying to make excuses for him by thinking he was emotional/hurt/lost his temper.",
            "You don't need his permission to break up, you just declare it and you are done.  That is what you did yesterday.\n\n\nI would highly recommend informing friends of his irrational behavior (essentially keeping you hostage) and your concerns about it.   \n\n\nYou can google \"domestic abuse hotline <your city>\" and/or \"domestic abuse resources <your city>\".   Given how he behaved I think that is a great reason to tap some experts into helping you navigate this (it looks like there are some great comments here already but these peeps deal with this type of crazy daily).   At a minimum they will advise you on precautions to take but likely will help you understand things like restraining orders.\n\n\nPlease do not take his actions from yesterday lightly.  They show he has no respect for you and is willing to get angry when things don't go his way.  He might think he loves you and \"would never hurt you\" but you don't call people you love disgusting names do you?",
            "You let him come around, do not let him inside. You should have someone with you to keep you safe (they can be in another room or whatever) but you tell him \"We are breaking up. Do not contact me ever again. There is no further discussion. Take care.\" and lock your door. Call the police if he stays too long.",
            "I know it's hard, but you really need to stand up for yourself. Invite a good friend over to hang out in the other room if you invite him over. He seems unstable and kinda dangerous! Please be careful. Do not feel bad about calling the police if you feel he might be violent or overly aggressive toward you. \n\nI was stalked by a man that didn't want me to leave him. I regret not getting a restraining order when I had the opportunity. Please be careful!",
            "This sounds like my relationship with my ex. Maybe not as bad..but very toxic abusive relationship. It wasn\u2019t just him, both of us were not good for each other. Great first year or so but became so terrible..get out ASAP. I know it\u2019s very hard but the end result of not being in that is worth it. ",
            "Don\u2019t let him come over. He knows you want to end it, and, as far as i\u2019m concerned, if one person wants to break up you\u2019re broken up. ",
            "I broke up with someone who scared me and I knew it would need to be in writing and I should offer no explanation or things to debate. I stated I would not be answering any of his messages. He proceeded to message me and come by my house that night. He hid when he knocked on the window of the front door, I had been sitting right there and I didn\u2019t see him. Any normal visitor would have been visible. I called some guy friends to come over and they called the police. Scary stuff should be documented. They ended up patrolling my house that night and used my phone to call him. They told him to never contact me again or they would get him for harassment and trespassing. I never heard from him again but he did try to contact my brother. I was embarrassed by the situation but I was glad to not be dealing with it on my own. Get the police involved, they don\u2019t care, they are here to deal with this stuff. You shouldn\u2019t have to. ",
            "Dont let him guilt trip you. \n\nIf it was love, it wouldnt be this hard. Trust me, i know. \n\nMy ex tried cutting himself with the broken pieces of his favourite watch that he smashed dramatically when i tried ending things with him. He made himself out to be so pathetic and weak without me. 2-3 weeks later he was being arrested for attacking me in our shared apartment.\n\nIf he loved you, he'd let you go. If he cared about anything else than himself, he'd listen, learn, and let you go, not turn on you. \n\nDo. Not. Let. That. Boy. Control. Your. Decisions. Ever. (or anyone for that matter)",
            "I would say block him on everything, but this may also trigger him. Write down somewhere about his obsessive behavior so that if anything happens there\u2019s proof. You probably don\u2019t have enough to get a restraining order but I would still look into it. The behavior you described is totally abusive and you need to remove yourself from that situation ASAP.",
            "You are in an abusive relationship. This may be difficult to see from the inside but it's painfully obvious from the outside. Bear in mind that it doesn't need to be violent to be abusive. I mean he locked you in his house so you couldn't leave. That's illegal and creepy as fuck to be honest.\n\nSimple solution. Dump him. You don't need his permission to dump him. That's not how it works.\n\nGiven his extremely concerning behaviour you don't even need to be polite about it. \n\nText him to break up, dump his shit out the window for him to collect. If he get violent or refuses to leave, call the police.\n",
            "This is downright scary and dangerous. You have the right intentions and you\u2019re not crazy; you need to break up. I\u2019d suggest making it clear to him one last time that you\u2019re done and then taking any and all safety measures I could think of: changing locks, blocking his number, maybe carrying pepper spray, consider a restraining order if he doesn\u2019t stop, and most importantly, TELL SOMEONE WHAT\u2019S GOING ON! Good Luck,\nOP. ",
            "I very much echo what others have said; call the police, explain what happened, get a restraining order. You broke up with him; him refusing to believe you and trying to bully you into staying doesn't mean you're still together, it just means that he is abusive and dangerous. Please take steps to protect yourself ASAP, including a police report, restraining order, and locking down all your passwords. Tell everyone you know that you are broken up and that he may try getting information from them to get to you. Consider getting a camera for your front door, they are very inexpensive now. If you can have a friend stay with you, or if you can stay with a friend or family for a few days, that would be a very good idea.",
            "For this type of relationship, I think if u end it abruptly, no way the guy will go for it. Instead he might go for a rage. Maybe keeping distance from him steps by steps before ending it for good?",
            "I've been in the same situation and honestly, you have to break up with him via text and block him on all channels that he can access you (Phone, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, anything he can contact you with). Also, stay safe in public places because he'll try to eek his way back into your life by 'bumping into you'. My ex told me I was sick in the head because I broke up with him, too. When we got back together, things escalated to physical and I blocked him, but he turned up at a gig I was playing and tried to suggest nothing happened. My heart goes out to you. \n\nAfter you've broken up with him, make sure you take really good care of yourself and do not let any doubt enter your mind. He probably gaslit you the entire relationship so you're apt to doubt your decision, your mental health, everything. It took me a long time to remember who I was after that relationship, but it gets better. \n\nStay safe, hun. ",
            "That's a very abusive relationship.  Break up with him.  Be strong.  If he traps you like that again, dial up the 911 operator and report him for kidnapping.  This guy is an asshole.  ",
            "If you say it\u2019s done, it\u2019s done. Tell him not to come over because you are broken up and if he shows, you\u2019re calling the police. Make sure you have a friend or family member nearby to witness anything that might happen. \n\nThis is an abusive relationship. Lying, gaslighting and verbal abuse all count as abuse. It may only be a matter of time before he gets physical. You need to get away. ",
            "Honestly call the police if he does it again and have a guy friend or multiple female friends over when he comes. He is crazy.",
            "No this is abuse. You don\u2019t actually need any reason at all to break up, but he\u2019s giving you about a million.\n\nDon\u2019t get into an argument/discussion about this. Tell him by text that it\u2019s done and then filter all future messages (or change your number). I\u2019d recommend blocking but he sounds like the type to get different numbers to call you on.\n\nAnd maybe have a big male friend stay with you for a few days or you stay elsewhere because locking you in is very very problematic.

            "Please get out. I tried to end my abusive relationship after six months. It took 14 years to get rid. If he tells you he will kill himself if you leave, he\u2019s either lying or unbalanced. If he tells you he will tell all of your friends/relatives XYZ thing, he\u2019s either lying or unbalanced. At the end of the day, they\u2019ll figure out pretty quickly that he\u2019s the one with the problem; not you. Those are the two things that I was told constantly.

I went through this same crap with an abusive, psycho ex.\n\n- Do not meet with him.  Do not talk with him.\n- Tell whomever you live with the situation, that he's not welcome, and to call the police if they see him.  \n- If he has a key then change the locks.  \n- If you live in an apartment building, let your building manager/doorman know what he looks like and that he's not welcome.  \n- Once you've taken care of those things, text him and let him know that the relationship is over and that if he attempts any further contact, the police will be called. Any of his property left at your place will be mailed to him.  Keep it brief and to the point.  Don't engage with him.  Once you've sent the text, block him.\n- Take photos of anything you do mail to him so that you can't be accused of theft later.  Get a tracking number.\n- If he does show up, don't hesitate on following through with calling the authorities.  Stress that he is abusive and that you're afraid for your safety.

            "The most important thing here is your physical safety. He obviously has a temper so if you feel like he might cross the line, bring a friend with you or go back when you know you're not alone with him, or don't go at all and just cut him out completely and never go back. That decision is going to be based on the nuances of your relationship and isn't something a stranger on the internet should tell you how to do. I went through this exact same situation (the freak out, the accusations, and locked door), except his mom heard us fighting, and came up and begged me not to leave her son... It was mortifying and I backed down and ended up staying with him for another couple weeks. The one thing I had to keep telling myself was that NO ONE was in charge of what I decide to do and it wasn't about him \"letting me go\" it was about be getting the fuck out. The day after giving myself that pep-talk, I sat outside his house in my car for probably an hour or so trying to muster up the energy to do it all over again, and I did. While he ranted and screamed I packed up any stuff I had at his house that seemed important (anything else could be replaced and wasn't worth staying there longer than I had to) and put it in my backpack. While doing this, I made sure the door to his room stayed open and unlocked (I managed this because when he yelled at me, he liked to yell right in my face meaning he had to face me, so I kept my back to the door so that if I felt unsafe needed to get out, I could turn around and run before he could get to the door) and after I'd packed everything of mine I  walked out without looking back. It takes a lot of strength to leave someone even if they're terribly and toxic, which doesn't make sense when you say it out loud, but thats the reality sometimes. You need to do this for your own well-being.  You NEED to break up with him. Speaking from experience, someone who talks to you that way and then frantically backtracks and traps you against your will is incredibly unstable and it will get worse if you stay. ",

My stomach sank at first because I thought she was going to encourage me to talk to him, but she said just the opposite. Without even hearing my side she told him that I don\u2019t have to talk to him if I don\u2019t want to. She also said she won\u2019t be booking us on the same shows anymore, and that the staff knows not to allow him into the building on nights I\u2019m performing. She said she wants me to feel safe at the club, and she\u2019s got my back. What a win for sisterhood!\n\nAfter that, he tried reaching out to my SO who also shut him down and told him to leave us alone.

Get evidence so if something else happens it doesn\u2019t turn into he said-she said. Get your manager or other female employees to report his behavior and get it all together.

We live together with one other friend near the college we go to together. He came out to me when we were in high school. It didn't change anything. When we got to college, I came out as bisexual.\n\nLast night we were hanging out with some friends and I had a bit to drink. When we were walking home I could tell he was nervous so I asked what was up. He asked if I wanted to go out with him. He literally said \"do you want to go out with me\". I don't know why, but I thought he meant as friends. Thinking back he made it really obvious it was a date, but I'm an idiot and I was still a bit drunk. I said yes. He suggested Saturday night. I said yes.\n\nI left to go to the gym before he got up so I didn't see him. While I was at the gym, the friend we live with texted me that Noah was really happy this morning and she didn't know we were going to go on a date. She congratulated me and said we make a cute couple. This happened literally six minutes ago. I'm panicking right now. I don't know what to do. I love him but he's like my brother. I can't go out with him. How can I tell him I'm not interested without embarrassing him more than I have to? I don't want to mess up our relationship. We're supposed to have lunch together in a few hours. What do I do?\n\ntldr: I'm an idiot. My best friend asked me out. I said yes. I didn't know it was a date. How do I fix this as easily as possible for him?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you guys so much for the advice. I only saw the first 30 something comments until just now, and I'm blown away by how many people have commented to give me advice. I tried to take a lot of the advice I got, but some of it was contradictory so I couldn't do all of it. Thanks again to everyone who gave advice, even if I didn't see it until after we talked.\n\nI texted Noah and asked if we could skip lunch and go home instead so we could talk. I tried not to make the conversation dramatic. I apologized to him for misunderstanding him, and told him I knew it must have taken a lot of courage for him to ask me out. I told him that he was my best friend, I loved him, and that would never change, but I had never thought about a romantic relationship with him. I apologized for fucking up and getting his hopes up. He asked a few questions, like did I really not know he meant it as a date. He apologized for \"fucking things up\" between us, but I told him that I wasn't uncomfortable with him feeling that way about me. I told him that I understood if he wanted space to process it, and I would give it to him if he wanted, but I also told him how important he is to me and how much I love him. He said he didn't think he wanted space. He just wanted to try to move on with the secret out.\n\nWe've always been totally open with each other (well, except for him liking me I guess) and he said he was happy he wasn't keeping his feelings a secret anymore. We had a cheesy moment where I told him he could always talk to me, about anything. It was like straight out of a romcom. We talked for a long time after that. Apparently he's had a crush on me since before he came out in high school, and after he had a few drinks last night he decided fuck it, why not try. By the time he had to leave for his class this afternoon, things felt normal. I don't feel weird knowing about his crush, and he doesn't seem to feel hurt or anything because of my fuck up. Maybe just a little sad. I'll definitely keep an eye on how we interact and how he acts for a while. A few people warned me against accidentally flirting with him, and I'll try to keep anything like that in check.\n\nI guess this is a happy ending. I know there are still things to be aware of, but right now it looks like the conversation went pretty well. Thanks everyone for commenting and supporting. It helped me not just with advice but also with calming me down when I was really panicky this morning.",

            "There's no easy fix. Contact him and clarify: \"Noah, did you ask me out on a date or are we going out as friends?\" It's going to hurt him regardless. The less time you allow him to dream about this, the fewer fantasies he can build. Likely, rejection is the end of your friendship, but it's more fair that way than him sticking around to think he'll eventually have a chance. ",
            "Be direct. Tell him you need to talk and in person let him know that you don't have romantic feelings for him. Do it as soon as possible so he doesn't keep telling others.",
            "Apologize for accepting the date and let him know he\u2019s like family to you and you don\u2019t feel that will ever transition to something romantic. \n\nI mean it might be rough on him but really you need to shut down his romantic interests ASAP if you want to continue your friendship.  \n\nMake sure to ask him if he needs some space to process this. Maybe spend a bit less time together temporarily that way he can move on mentally. ",
            "This happens often, best friends fall for best friends, especially people who are same sex attracted. I had an intense crush on my best friend when I was your age and she didn't reciprocate and I knew that, but she was kind and respectful and loving to me and we are still great friends today. We both feel very fortunate to have gotten through that nicely, it can happen. \n\nIf I were you, I would call him and say hey, I didn't know you were asking me on a date. I consider you a brother and not a romantic prospect. You are an awesome person and GREAT people will date you, but that's not me. If you need some space take some space. \n\nI'm guessing he will need space for a while and that will be good for both of you. This doesn't have to blow up anything, just let him heal and turn his attention to other guys who do like him back and most likely it'll blow over, as long as you keep treating each other kindly. ",
            "&#x200B;\n\nI'd say something along the lines of, \"The relationship we share right now is one of the most important relationships in my life. I love and care for you so much, but I don't want to take it in a romantic direction. I hope that's okay with you.\"\n\nThis would let him know you value him highly and lets him know the reason you don't want to change the quality of the relationship.",
            "I would just say something like ,\"Noah, I wish I would have been more sober when you asked me, because now I feel bad, but i have to say: the idea seems really nice. but I've given it some thought & the reality seems like something I can't go through with. I just can't stand the thought of losing you as a friend and seeing as we're roommates.. I don't want to complicate things. you've been around my entire life, I cannot envision a future without you. dating you puts that relationship at a risk that I'm not willing to take, I'm sorry!\"",
            "One thing to consider is that as he potentially starts to get over his crush on you, you may have to start taking on more responsibility for \"maintaining\" the relationship. I have had a few friendship survive unrequited feelings but have also had a few slowly fade. The biggest thing I realized was that, whether consciously or subconsciously, the friend had been doing way more for me in the friendship than I had been doing for them. Which makes sense, if you have a crush on someone even if its something you keep a secret you still on some level want to impress them or make them likeable or be the best version of yourself around them. But once a crush fades, you typically don't strive as hard to always prioritize them, even if you are still friends. And if this has been going on since high school, it may be that you have fallen into a routine where Noah carries more of the \"work\" that is involved in your friendship, whether that is emotional labor, logistical labor, time spent, etc. ",
            "Hey, I've been through something super similar. I was basically in love with my best friend and I told her, and she didn't feel the same. She quite explicitly told me she probably never would. \nWhich sounds harsh (and it was) but she was equally explicit in telling me how much I mean to her, and how much our friendship means to her. I was super scared of losing her because she would find it too awkward to be friends with me, and I don't really know if she did find it awkward at all (Unrequited feelings are always awkward for everyone involved, I feel like) but ultimately I left that conversation feeling sad, but really really happy. I felt like our friendship and our bond was affirmed and even deepened by it!

My best friend literally JUST texted me like 12 times while I was writing this, lol. We're closer than we were before, and even though you and your friend are two completely different people than my friend and I, I think this could be what happens. Just be honest and clear but loving, too. Your friendship has survived things before, and it can survive this, too! ",
            "Okay, so, I think the least hurtful thing you can do here is *not* tell him you thought he asked you out \"as friends,\" because that'll just make him feel like he's so horribly unattractive you couldn't even conceive of the possibility when it was put bluntly in front of you. \n\nInstead: Tell him you said yes because you like him a lot as a person and were optimistic you could build a romantic connection, but once you went out on a date you unfortunately didn't feel any kind of spark at all and you think you should probably not go on any further dates. Assure him he didn't do anything wrong, you just love him like a brother and so it felt weird and uncomfortable when you actually tried a date and you're really sorry and etc.  ",
            "Go on the date, see if you feel something and then if not tell him you don't think it would work out. ",
            "Please read to the end of the post.\n\n1. Apologize. Things happen.\n\n2. Explain how you actually feel about him\n\n3. Tell him that you are very sorry for the mistakeand that you don't want to lose him as a friend, That you really value your friendship, and that you want this to be as easy on him as possible. \n\nYou could offer to have the two of you just like in case anyone asks. Say you went on th date but both decided friendship was more your thing. \n\nI do just want to say that this is likely the end of your friendship. He has developed romantic feelings and those don't just go away. He has probably been wanting to ask you out for a very long time and didn't have the courage or didn't want to ruin things.\n\nIt is very likely that his feelings won't just disappear because you explained you aren't into him that way. \n\n**This is the perfect example of the ending of a relationship where no one did anything wrong.** You may not believe me but even if you turned him down the same result would happen. His feelings won't just disappear.\n\nNo one did anything bad. No one is wrong or right. No one acted a way they shouldn't. This is just a case where two people's desires do not meet in the middle. No one is at fault here.",
            "Oh man, that is tough.  Maybe to spare his feelings go on the date, but for future dates...\"it didn't work out\".\n\nWomen do this all the time.  Give them a shot but if it doesn't work out that's fine too.  It allows you to let them down without leaving them feeling like they didn't even get a shot.",
            "After lunch just explain how much you value your friendship and would rather cherish that than turn it into a romantic thing. It will hurt him but at least you can sit face to face so he knows you're sincere. \n\nI feel like telling him you misunderstood him about the implications of going out might make things awkward but honesty can be the best policy ",
            "Hes a person you already like. \n\nDo you find him hot?\n\nIf the answer is yes. Go with it.\n\nIf the answer is no. Dont go with it. Take him down a gay bar and be his wing man.",

            "I hate all of this \"I see you like a brother\" stuff. Probably because I've heard it before from a friend crush. I think it would be better to hear, \"I value our friendship, but I don't see you romantically. I know that's disappointing to hear and I'm sorry for that. I hope that we can continue our friendship and I understand if you need space for a while. Let me know if and when you're ready to hang out again.\"",

            "I know I'm commenting late, so I'm probably not being helpful, but it's ALWAYS just best to be honest and straightforward. You guys have been great friends since second grade! Just tell him you misunderstood what he meant, and while you love him as a friend, you don't feel romantically about him. Or however it is that you feel. That's totally natural, and while it won't feel great for him, he will get over it, he's a resilient, strong person.\nIt's always most important to just be honest I think. ",

I\u2019m really sorry, and I\u2019m panicking because I love you but I can\u2019t date you.\u201d  \n\nHowever you say it, do it now. It\u2019ll probably come out like that but that\u2019s fine.

That is like, one of those most common ways to ask someone out that I've ever heard of!\n\nJust apologize and explain that in your drunken stupor, you couldn't comprehend exactly what he had said. Tell him you love him (like a brother) and that you'd never risk messing that up. He's going to be hurt, but it's better than prolonging this. Goodluck :)",

I'm really flattered, but I see you as family.\n\n I don't want to lose your friendship so if you need space or to pretend that this never happened I'll help in what ever way you want. \n\nI'm really afraid of hurting you but I also know that going along with the date on any level is going to hurt more, because I'm not being honest about my feelings. \n\nI think you're an amazing person and you deserve someone who feels the same way about you that you do them, who respects you loves you and is able to be 100% there.

            "Can you provide an update.  Have you talked to Noah.  This kinda happened to me but more my best friend told me he hated that I hit on other guys and nothing ever happened between him and I.  It didn't end well.  ",

Try to brush it off as no big deal, and maybe make a joke at your expense like \"wow you must be really lowering your standards if you're considering dating me.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you chicken out of that text message and end up going out on the date (or you realize you might want to date him, though it doesn't sound like it), I think after the first date you should tell him something along the lines of how you think it's kind of weird and that you see him like a brother and can you guys please just stay friends.  And pay for everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck.",

Be reassuring that you still want to be in their life but that you respect that they might need time to sort out feelings.  But you will be waiting as life long friendships stand the test of time and that is what you consider them.",
            "You can certainly date him, a great friend is a great opportunity ... would a stranger be better??  Nooooo....",
            "OP, I'm sorry that this has happened to you both; this is a no-win, shitty situation. Here are a few things to bear in mind as you go forward:\n\n1. There is no such thing as \"the friend-zone\", and no one should make you feel as though your friendship is a consolation prize. If anything, there's a \"girlfriend-zone\" where *he* has put *you* (but this is not a permanent state of affairs!)\n\n2. The sad truth of the matter is your relationship is different now, whether you like it or not. You cannot un-know what's been revealed: he does not perceive your friendship in the same way you do. To deny that and try to make things \"go back the way things were\" is to be willfully ignorant, and cruel to him. \n\n3. You're afraid of losing him, but you may have to for a while. It's scary. I know how that feels. I've been in your place (and his place) before too. One of them was with my very best friend through high school, with whom I was completely besotted! It took some years of on-and-off friendship, but we're in our 30s now, and still relatively close. Of course, we each have our own partners and lives which occupy most of our time, but we still catch up, hang out, and talk shit.\n\n4. Respect what he chooses to do. He'll probably act weird for a bit. He's hurting, respect his healing. You'll hurt too, it sucks being put in the position you're in, but neither of you is \"at fault\". It's not his fault he has romantic feelings for you, and it's not your fault you don't see him in the same way. What stokes our fires is different for everybody at different times in our lives. Be gentle with yourself and gentle to him too. It will be hard not to feel selfish or resentful in the next little while, but I believe in you! ",
            "Tell him you thought about it some more and really don't want to screw up the great friendship that you already share. And maybe pivot that conversation into how the two of you can be each other's wingmen.",

In that case, you\u2019d almost certainly be ending the friendship because the idea of getting serious or committed wouldn\u2019t be an option to you. This is all assuming a shit ton and I realize that. I have no idea what you want in life, but that\u2019s all I can think of that gives a very firm reasoning without making it about him or you. \n\nI did this exact thing with a girl I dated but it was genuine. She didn\u2019t want kids. I\u2019m at an age where I don\u2019t date without the possibility of marriage.

            "Males will not be \"just friends\" with females unless under very specific and rare circumstances, this is not one of those. You're going to have to be honest and tell him that you were not thinking clearly and are not sexually interested in him and will never engage in a relationship that goes past the dreaded \"friend zone\". After that he'll probably get upset, be confused, and wont want to talk with you for a while, which is to be expected. Maybe he'll be your friend still, maybe he wont. But if you don't buckle up and nip it in the bud the situation will only become more painful for him and you in the future. "
