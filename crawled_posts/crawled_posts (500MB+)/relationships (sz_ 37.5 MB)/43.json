        "selftext": "**UPDATE: First, I want to thank each and every one of you who have given me advice, offered me an ear to rant/yell to or offered me a shoulder to cry on. After my first edit, many of you messaged me and asked me not to drink/that I was better than that/that this wasn't the thing to do. I sincerely appreciate that. My friend and his sister took me out to dinner to try to get my mind off of everything. At first, I wasn't really up to going, but I figured that it would be better to try to focus my mind on something different. My friends called up a couple of my other friends, and the 6 of us went out to dinner. At first, I wasn't really into it, I was kind of down, but my friends did anything and everything that they could to cheer me up. I can honestly say that I love my friends and everything that they've done for me.**\n\n**My best friend's sister (Emily) went through all the messages on my phone from the both of them and deleted anything that didn't need to be on there. She texted both of them from my phone telling them that it was her that was texting, and told her that a friend would be by at a certain time to pick up my stuff tomorrow, and she told him that I would be by tomorrow to grab some things and that I was going to try to get out of the lease by talking to my landlord.**\n\n**I want you all to know that I've read through each and every one of these comments, and that I've read through every message that's been sent to me on here. I plan on replying to a couple tonight or tomorrow (I'm really tired, but wanted to let you all know how much you've helped me).**\n\n**Finally, to the people that have been in the same position as I'm currently in, or to those that have been in a situation even relatively similar, I have a couple things. First, none of what your ex-SO did, says anything about you. It tells what kind of person THEY are; your reactions tell the kind of person that you are. Secondly, all of you are MUCH stronger than you realize. Many of you have given me such amazing advice, and you know exactly where I'm coming from. Talking about it isn't always the easiest, and many of you did to try to help an internet stranger, so thank you. Finally, many of you have much greater things to look forward to. Like one of old teachers said, \"it's like moving on to the next book in the sequence. Yeah, you may have to wait a little bit for the author to release it, but it's worth the wait.\"**\n\n**Also, to the kind individual that gave me gold, thank you. I plan on donating $5 tomorrow to a charity because of you. For anybody else that would like to, pick your favorite charity, and donate, or just do something nice for somebody else, it can have a huge impact on their life.**\n\n*EDIT: I'm at my best friends house. Him and his sister have been super awesome to me. Their doorbell rang about 5 minutes ago. It was her. His sister bitched her out. I wanted to go yell at her, but I started drinking fireball instead. It's going to be a long couple weeks until school gets out.*\n\nThrowaway, my girlfriend and roommate reddit.\n\nMy last class of the day was cancelled, so I decided to come home and surprise my girlfriend. I went to the store and grabbed everything to make her favorite meal (lasagna). I was carrying the bags up the stairs and put them down in front of the door to fish my keys out of my pocket and then I heard my girlfriend moaning.\n\nI thought that she was \"taking care of herself\" because I know that she likes to do that sometimes when I'm not around, so I didn't have a sudden \"ah-ha\" moment or anything. I walked in and there were her and my roommate on the couch.\n\nI opened the door and kind of just froze when I saw it. She looked up and me and he turned around and saw it was me, and I just saw red. As much as I wanted to, I didn't kick his ass. I just dropped the bags and walked away.\n\nAs I was getting into my car, they both came running out and yelling at me to stop, but I just floored it and got out of there as quickly as I could. I called my best friend and talked to him about it. He offered to come kick his ass, I told him no. I didn't want him to get in trouble from it.\n\nI even had the engagement ring that I planned to use to propose to her this summer when we went on vacation. It's in my safe that I keep in the closet, so I know that she doesn't know about it. But I planned to spend the REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER! Why didn't I see this coming?\n\nMy last class was supposed to start at 12, but since it was cancelled, I was home by 12.30. So it's been 4+ hours. My phone has been blowing up from both of them, I haven't looked at any of the messages or answered any of the calls.\n\nI called my bank and made sure that she wasn't on any of my accounts for anything. I'm going to go back later tonight and pack up all of her stuff and drop it off at her place tomorrow. Then I'll probably take a bag of clothes to my friend's house and stay there until school ends (3 weeks).\n\nWhat do I do next?\n   \n**tl;dr**: Found girlfriend having sex with my roommate. I left. Already made sure she wasn't on my bank accounts. Had no contact with either of them. Have a place to stay until school ends.",

            "7 fucking years.\n\nHonest advice: you are going to experience a tremendous amount of emotion in the next few weeks. Stay in no contact with them no matter how angry sad dissapointed you feel. Secure your things, make arrangements to stay somewhere and start healing now.\n\nBright side: You could have wasted more time dating her and being friends with him, and this could have happened after you invested in marriage.",
            "Thank god for that class being cancelled or you could have been stuck with her for much longer.\n\nNow is when you begin to heal. After you drop off all of her stuff - be sure to go no contact with her. Block her on all social media, block her number. Make sure your friends know to not relay any information about her to you.\n\nThen you need to keep yourself busy with school or work. Dive into your hobbies or find new ones. Start working out, take cooking classes, go to yoga. Surround yourself with friends and family. Try to fill up all your free time as much as possible. It'll be hard at first, but it gets easier with every day.",
            "Sounds like you have it covered. The only thing I can think of, which you've probably thought of anyway, is make sure that you have a friend with you when you collect your stuff from your flat. \n\nOther than that, this is a horrible situation and I'm sorry for you.",
            "With your age and the amount of time you've had, I can imagine your devastation. You were probably each other's first everything... and you've basically had her as a girlfriend for 1/3 of your life.\n\nThe relationship is over.\n\nWhat she did to you is unforgivable. To betray you in your own home with someone you live with is devastating. For you to catch her in the act is something you will never be unable to see.\n\nYou must know that this is over.\n\nYou also must be prepared for her to use everything she knows about you, knowing that she knows you better than anyone, to try to get forgiveness or even for you to take her back.\n\nYou must not worry about revenge. You must not worry about their feelings. Don't worry about her family, your family, etc.\n\nYou must only worry about yourself.\n\nEveryday remind yourself that you deserve better. You did nothing wrong.\n\nHell, you had extra time and went to make her something special. She had time when she thought you wouldn't be there to bone your roommate on your couch.\n\nYou didn't do anything to cause this and you deserve better.\n\nChange her name on your phone to \"Don't get back together\" and be strong. Don't worry about the tears. You're going to cry. Real men cry. It's ok. Let it out... then stand tall. You are the good guy.\n\nYou found out before you had kids. You found out while you're still in your prime. You were extremely lucky to find out when you did... so take this as it is... focus on yourself.",
            "Make sure that your soon-to-be-ex-roommate is not there when you go to pack up, or take a couple of friends with you.\n\nBlock both of them on everything.  Phone, email, Facebook, everything.  Make it so that they can't contact you.\n\nIf either of them tries to ambush you in public (like after your classes or at your job) just walk away.\n\nTake some time for yourself.  You've got 7 years of mental habits that center around her.  So find some new ones.  Take up a new hobby.  Get a gym membership.  Go on a trip.\n",
            "Its simple never talk to her again. Never even give her a chance to explain. Let her feel like crap for the rest of her life. She doesn't deserve another minute of your time. I wouldn't even talk to either one of them. I would just move on like it meant nothing and never look back. \n\n",
            "this is going to seem odd, but get yourself set in your mind as to what you saw.\n\nWhat the hell am I talking about you ask?  Well, believe it or not, sometimes these people will look you straight in the eye and say 'it's not what you think'  - they will seriously try and convince you 'you have it all wrong'...  It's called 'gaslighting' and cheaters can be shameless about it.\n\nYou know what you heard and saw.  Don't allow yourself to be manipulated in your emotionally confused and vulnerable state into questioning your own sanity.  Believe it or not it can and does happen.\n\nVery sorry this happened to you, I know it is a nightmare.  Best of luck going forward.",

            "Nothing more to do. Be the boss.",
            "Sorry to hear this man. My ex wife (together 7 years, married 2) did something similar. Things I learned:\n\n- revenge can have life long consequences. Be the bigger person.\n\n- there is NO substitute for family and good friends. I found out who my true friends were when I was in need. I had one guy who I was only casual friends with drop everything and stay with me for 3 weeks. He's now my best friend.\n\n- this too will pass. You will cry, feel better, cry, feel angry, and cry some more. Don't worry, it's normal and you're not going crazy. \n\n- time heals all things. It's been 4 years since my ex and I split up but I'm with the love of my life now and very happy.  \n\n- and here's the strangest one: you probably will always feel something for her. I can honestly say I hate my ex for doing what she did to me....but sometimes I find myself thinking back to fun times we had.  \n\nStay strong brother, lean on everybody. People love feeling needed and most people will go out of their way to make you feel better. ",
            "As terrible as this is, try to look on the bright side. 1. You figured out what kind of person she is for the price of a lasagna. 2. You found out before you proposed, or, god forbid, got married. Just keep focusing on school/work and continue to kick ass. \n",
            "Make sure to change the netflix password! Fuck that dude and her. **She ain't streaming a mothafucking thing!**\n\nAlso, idk how you kept your composure as they ran out to your car as your left. I would have been tempted to Suge Knight somebody.",
            "This is going to sound horrible but my ex of 1.5 years did something similar, and this post made me feel slightly better because at least it wasn't 7 years close to engagement. I'm here if you need to talk to me man. :/",
            "Something similar happened to me 3 weeks ago. My girlfriend of 7 years left me for my best friend since the 4 th grade (our roommate). She had been cheating on me for awhile with him and came clean, leaving me for him. I had no idea. I'm glad it all happened though because otherwise I'd still be a sucker - living there thinking everything was great. It's gonna hurt for awhile but things are starting to get better. Just remember NOTHING you did, could EVER warrant what they did to you. It's not your fault and your going to become better from it. It just hurts right now. ",
            "What do you do next?  Rebuild your life and start a new.  I want to say, I commend you for being level headed and not doing anything rash, keep that mentality going forward.  \n\nGet your things, move out and go on your separate ways.  There really is nothing to be gained by talking to either of them.  Now after a time, you get to start a new relationship with a girl who wouldn't do something so disrespectful and hurtful to you.   Better you found out now than after you were married.  Also return the ring.",
            "Ouch, man.  Sympathies.  Have a friend get your stuff back.  Don't cause any drama or violence or have any caused.  Have the friend relay a message (don't contact you, whatever) and stay far, far away.  Lose yourself in something.  The gym or school work or something that'll keep you busy and your mind off of things.\n\nDon't let her get to you emotionally.  Not beyond what you have to deal with to let her go.  Don't do anything stupid.  Don't listen to any lies.  ",
            "You sound like at least you have your head on straight. Kick her to the curb, drop your roommate and move the fuck on. I know it's heart breaking for you, but she made this choice not you",
            "I was cheated on horribly and was emotionally abused/manipulated without knowing.\n\nWas this your first break up? I know it sounds weird but I didn't realize how insane my brain went after I found out my SO that I trusted so much was cheating on me multiple times and online. In retrospect, I was very unwell even though I never acted crazy.\n\nThe crying and pain does get better even though that hole feels never ending. You'll ask if it was your fault or if you should've seen it but it's not your fault for giving your love to someone.\n\nNow it's been almost a year since the break up and I found the best person ever. Way better than my ex. I'm not saying you have to find someone else but you will find someone better! ( I wasn't even looking but it happened)\n\nI had a lot of healing to do. I went to free counselling and I spent time alone.\n\nYou'll get a lot of people who say \" Have you talked to your ex?\" Whatever you do, never talk to them again. Nothing good will come of it. Breaking up is like a drug addiction. People also gravitate towards drama then sometimes leave your life after that drama is gone. Stick to your friend who let you stay at their place. \n\nFrom the story of how you were going to make her favourite meal, you sound like a nice guy with a good support system. Never talk to those assholes again and you should be all good.\n\nIf you want someone to vent to feel free to message me. ",
            "I'm sorry that you're going through this. Best thing you can do is just get her possessions to her and ten go permanent no contact. Don't let her suck you in, of suck yourself in with any closure bullshit. You got your closure when you walked in. There really isn't anything else she can say.",
            "Don't talk to either of them. She'll find any excuse in the book. I would not just block them from every social media, but also delete her number. I can't tell you how many times that helped me. Pick a friend you know you can call when you're having a hard time instead of contacting her. \n\nYou're still young! You will learn so much from this and one day look back with a weird sort of appreciation. I promise! I've been in similar situations. \n\nHope things get better sir!",
            "Thank god you are 22.  You have your whole life ahead of you and you found out before you got married.  Sell the ring buy yourself something to take your mind off it.  After you heal get out there and meet the right one.\n\nI know it doesn't seem like it but you will get over it, it will be hard at first but you will be happy again.  Hang in there.  ",
            "7 years..BUT.....only 22m!  Look on the brightside...welcome to the prime of your life!",
            "It's simple really. Fuck her mom and then fuck your room-mates mom then never speak to either of them again.",
            "I've never understood why people who are caught cheating try to immediately explain by calling or texting or even right there, in person, literally with their pants down. It's like something in their brain short-circuits. Why would both of them be calling right now? What could they possibly say to help the situation?\n\nMaybe she was just there to meet up for some kisses...",
            "Hey, GTA V just came out for PC. That's like a few days of gameplay to take your mind off this.",
            "Sell the ring for whatever you can get.  Send one message to the roommate that you're going to be by to move your things at such and such time and to not be there during that period.\n\nYou're doing a good job, these people want to talk to you, but fuck them.",
            "First off, let me say that I think you've handled this *exactly* as you should so far. No need for yelling, fighting, ass-kicking, or any sort of ill-advised revenge attempt. Just cut them both out of your life completely and try to move on as best you can.\n\nIt sucks that you planned on marrying this girl, but consider yourself fortunate that this happened when it did and not ten years down the line with two kids and a mortgage. You get a clean break and a fresh start here.\n\nIt sounds like you've got good friends you can rely on, so take comfort in them for now and just try to keep moving forward. I had something similar happen when I was about your age and goddamned if it isn't awful, but trust me when I say that you'll get through it.",
            "I had the exact same thing happen to me 15 years ago. It crushed me, but now, I am happily married with two beautiful children, and she is still single and miserable. It'll get better. ",
            "I'm sure this has been said, but if possible have someone else take her shit to her place.  She'll probably try to talk to you, give you a million excuses why she did what she did, but the best thing to do for yourself is to stay far, far away from her.  ",
            "Upvote especially because you said they're both redditors. I hope they see this so much. Fuck you both.",
            "Thank god your class was cancelled, otherwise this probably could have gone on for far much longer and it would have been much more painful (though I'm sure it's pretty damn painful as it is, shit).\n\n> But I planned to spend the REST OF MY LIFE WITH HER! Why didn't I see this coming?\n\nYou didn't see this coming because it's not like people who cheat have a flag over their heads that says, \"I am a jerk. I will cheat on you. Tee hee.\" Cheaters usually hide their tracks, and the good ones can get away with a lot. \n\nMake sure all her stuff is out of your apartment. If I were you, I'd call the landlord immediately and ask him politely if you can pay your way out of the remainder of your contract. It's very possible that your landlord might even just let you move out no questions asked depending on how much time is left on your lease. My parents are landlords and I'm positive they'd be lenient. It never hurts to ask. \n\nKeep your self busy with school and work. Tell your friends you want nothing to do with her and don't want to hear any news of her. Go no contact: it really works. Block her on social media, block her number, block everything associated with her. \n\nIf you need to, absolutely surround yourself with friends and family to keep you busy. When my ex cheated on me, it probably would have helped if I surrounded myself with people who loved me but I tended to go inward and that was VERY damaging. I wouldn't recommend doing that!\n\nThis is harsh, but if you feel like contacting her just remember that she was enjoying herself and likely would have continued to pull the wool over your eyes. She is not a good person and you deserve so, so, so much more. Best of luck. You got this.",
            "You're a better man than I.\n\nI knew of a guy who found his wife in bed with his best friend.\n\nHe took the term **Scorched Earth** literally.\n\nKilled his wife. Killed his friend. Then burned the house down.\n\nI would've tied him to his bed until he came back to reality if I knew he was that crazy...\n\n(And no, it wasn't me.)",
            "Noooooooo contact.\n\nThat girl running around isn't the girl you spent 7 years of your life with. That girl is her evil twin, and she killed the girl you were in love with. It's impossible for you to reach the woman you loved, because she's gone. Her evil twin will pretend to be her, though, if you let her. So don't let her. She's nobody. \n\nNo contact.",
            "Im sorry man. On the bright side, you seem to be handling this well. Don't talk to her ever again, move on, kick ass in school, become your own person, live an amazing life. Fuck that noise, you deserve better man ",
            "Sorry to see this man. As others have mentioned, better to have found out now rather than later when you're engaged or married. It's going to hurt and there will be a roller coaster of emotions - stay strong! Just wanted to add: the best \"revenge\" if you will is to go no-contact completely in all aspects of your life as much as you can (I know your lives must be pretty intertwined at this point) and continue living a damn awesome life. Take some time to yourself obviously since this is raw and fresh, but I hope you heal as time goes on.",

Who knows how long this has been going on... and chances are she'd do it again, she'd just be more cautious next time.\n\nI'm so sorry you're dealing with this, but it sounds like you've got shit together. You'll get through it, and make sure the next one is worth your time and effort.",
            "Hey brother. Just wanted to tell you I know how you feel. I was cheated on by my wife who was also my first. Half my life I knew her. Difference was that I married her, had kids and took her back. That was a mistake that ended up wasting more of my life. Stay strong. Also wanted to say that others her day that you'll find someone else better soon, that's probably true but don't give yourself a time limit to be in a relationship by. Take all the time you need. Here I am 2 years divorced and still single, but I have truely awesome friends. Good luck!",
            "If you feel the need to reach out to her, sit down and write letters to her by hand. Get out your anger, frustration, grief, depression, all of it. Get it out but don't bother contacting her. It'll be better if you just keep it no contact.",

            "First of all, you've got this. It's going to be okay. 7 years is a long time, but things will be okay, I assure you. You need to realize it wasn't your fault, you did nothing wrong. It was them being some severely messed up individuals.  \n\nEverything will be okay, you just do what you want now.  You're still hitting the gym, why not find something else to focus on too? Something you have always wanted to do. Be good to yourself. I'm here if you wanna talk.",
            "Next?  Well, first you have to come to terms with this.  Second, you need to tell your parents what happened so they don't blame you.  Third, start getting psyched for grad school!  \n\nWhat she has done is unforgivable.  You can never trust her again.  Anytime you think about taking her back, have that image of them screwing in your mind. Be upset.  Shit, be angry!  Absolutely tell your friends and family what she did and how you already had the ring.  It'll get back to her and break her heart even more.  Good!",
            "Ahhh crap. Sorry mate\u2026..Well old mate all I can say is move on. Keep your self respect and DO NOT TAKE HER BACK. This was a sign for the future. This girl is not for you.

Do not trade contact details them, just go out with one thing in your mind a few times over a few months and have guilt free, baggage free, no strings attached sex.\nI swear it turned my life around.",

            "Hey man, I just wanted to say that I have been through this as well and that your gonna be better in the end. To elaborate, right now I am sure you are broken. Confused and lost. \nBut in the end you are going to come out stronger. MUCH stronger. \nTrust is a funny thing, to truly trust some1 you must make your self Vulnerable. Vulnerable to every shitty thing possible. When you completely trust your SO it is like letting go of fear. Letting go of anxiety that doing this thing (Trusting) could actually go wrong. Letting go of stress, and letting love and trust replace it. \nThis is why it is so painful for one to take advantage of that. To take advantage of the one thing that was hardest to do, letting go of the fear and anxiety that come with trusting someone. \n\nIts the ultimate turn around, The ultimate slap in the face. \n\nJust when you think that you have trust, and with trust, the freedom from anxiety and stress, She replaces it with pain and regret. \n\nThis is the part where you become strong while she becomes sucked into darkness.\n\nWhen you fall asleep at night do me one favor, think hard about how this happened. It is NOT YOUR FAULT for trusting, and loving. \nIt is HER fault for taking advantage of your kindness, trust, and love. \nI know this thought doesn't seem that bright now, but find solidarity in it. \n\nIt is the truth. \n\nHer actions will only haunt you as long as you let them. \n\nWhile Her actions will effect her for the rest of her life. She will have to fall asleep knowing what she has done. She will have to fall asleep without the solidarity that it was her SO that fucked up, because it was her. \n\nWhile you may feel regret, She will feel guilt. And guilt will eat her alive. \n\nIn conclusion this comes from a redditor that has been cheated on. \nMy best and pretty much only friend was fucking my GF of a year, that i had given a place to live when every1 she knew dropped her. \nEven WORSE my only 2 other friends (the crew if you will) KNEW...\nThey decided not to tell me for over a month. Each of them hanging out in my house. Eating my food. Smoking my weed. Laughing at my jokes. \n\nWhen i found all of this out i was broken, and alone. No friends, No Girlfriend.

She ended up dumping me, likely cheated on me, and told me she never loved me.  It took me approximately 2.5 more years to get over her, forgive her, and in the process, become somebody whom 18 year old me would be proud of.  I've since forgotten the pain (though there was a lot), but I do keep with me the mental toughness and growth that got me to where I am, and retrospectively I am thankful that I was forced to go on this personal journey.",

I would get gradually better and not talk to her for a while. I could see my mood and outlook on life improve and actually feel emotionally and mentally at a better milestone that before. Then she would contact me or I would contact her in a moment of weakness. It was like bumping a deep cut that just scabbed over causing it to open up completely again. \n\nWhen you keep contact it's so easy to feel like you did when the relationship was going but then you are reminded of all of the shit done to you and how you aren't with them because of their selfish moves. \n\nYou will never be with this woman again. How can you? You know this. The both of them have shown you what they are capable of doing when you trust them. Seriously. Listen to me. I ended my relationship about 2 years ago. I was a fool and kept contact and I can honestly say that it took me almost 1.5 years to actually realize this and ever since I stopped talking to her things have gotten exponentially better.

Only one is going to work. Loving each other will be the baseline, the starting point, there will be many girls you love. It doesn't mean you should get married. There are literally millions of women you can come to love, and that means there will win millions of women you love but it just won't work with them. Don't force shit. ",

            "Jesus Christ... seven fucking years. Why would you throw that away for a quick fuck?\n\nAlright, well, I'll just agree with what others here have said. Take her shit to her house, remove her from any social media you have, and just try to move on from it. I've never been in a relationship so I'm not an expert or anything, but I do know pain. The bottom line here is that this is just a bump in the road. A large one, yes, but you can get past it and find someone who truly deserves you. It might be hard to trust again, but someday you'll be able to.\n\nI'm not really gonna preach or tell you just how much she can go fuck herself or anything. You obviously loved this woman, and she betrayed you. That's not okay, but she's still a person. So I'll just say, be mature about it. If you *have* to contact her again, do so in a professional manner. No name-calling, no insulting, nothing like that. Just get the interaction over with and leave it at that. Obviously, you'll have to settle this somehow. Just set up a meeting or something, tell her that the relationship is over and that you don't want to be friends. If she cries, let her, don't go soft.

That said, be good to yourself. You're young and have your whole life ahead of you. And as cliche as it sounds, time will heal this and you will be a better, more empathetic person once it's said and done. \n\nTwo things that helped me through the worst break up of my life: (1) writing; and (2) giving myself time to grieve. As for writing, I just started to write my thoughts out in one single word document. I would write whenever my thoughts built up. It felt like I was vomiting emotion on the paper, but it helped get it out of my system, especially when there was no one to talk to. As for giving myself time to grieve, one of the toughest things for me was to stop thinking about it. So, I allowed myself 30 minutes right before I went to bed each night to dwell, feel bad, ponder, etc. once the 30 minutes was up, I shut it off. It was hard, but it was helpful to know that I could give myself that time. After awhile, I didn't even want it.\n\nGood luck. And again, be good to yourself right now. ",

Since then, it's just me and my little sisters, although I get help from our grandparents and aunt as well. It's not been easy but I think we're fine in general and we're all a happy family. I tend to get advice when I need it and this is when I need advice. \n\nWe live in a moderate place (not US), it's not the most liberal area but also not the most conservative area either. My sister came out as a lesbian last year and it's been a very smooth process actually. People close to us are generally very understanding and people who aren't really need no reason to be close to us. She hasn't had any problems at school about this until yesterday.\n\nShe's dating a girl (very nice girl, I know her parents) and apparently the sports coach noticed this. She asked if she's the girl who lives with her brother, and when my sister said yes, she basically said that \"poor you, things like this can happen when kids don't have proper parents\" in front of some other students. She was shocked and said her if she can elaborate. The coach said \"it's not your fault honey, when you don't have a mother figure shit like this happens. They shouldn't give hothead boys custody of teenage girls. A real family should have adopted you when your mom died.\"\n\nMy sister was angry and said in front of everyone that she should try to be a better mom herself before making comments about other people's parents, that they all know her daughter is a junkie and give guys blowjobs for a joint. She kicked my sister out of the sports class. I have confirmed that this is happened from a couple of her friends parents (that's exactly what my sister told me as well).\n\nI was planning to call the school today but they called me earliest thing in the morning themselves, asking me to come in person to discuss my sister's \"behavior\". I'm genuinely pissed off that a school staff made such a comment to my sister, let alone making comments about the quality of parenting that my sisters are receiving. I don't know how I should approach this issue. Any help is much appreciated.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Homophobic sport coach said my sister's homosexuality is because of \"lack of proper parents\".

            "Get your cousin involved. Go to the meeting. Introduce your lawyer and say you are here to talk about teacher's misconduct. Redirect any conversation away from your sister and back to the teacher. Do not engage about your sister. You should also consider going to the press if your sister is okay with it.\n\nEDIT: People are saying a lawyer is overkill. Here's why I suggest it. When you go in there, there will be multiple people from the school, and you. Your situation is sad and seems to be well known. \"Backup\" will give you confidence and reduce the chance of you getting bullied and intimidated down from addressing the teacher's behavior. It will also increase the likelihood of them taking your seriously instead of treating you like a child (they may see you as a child/peer to your sister, not an adult/parent).",
            "- Always be calm. Show some concern over the teachers methods and other students in school. Be approachable and reasonable to the school, even if teacher repeats what she says. Be the calm adult in the room. Principal might side with you to avoid conflict if you're the best in the room.\n\n- Describe yourself as legal guardian\n\n- Mention other parents have confirmed to you what happened. Schools listen to parents more than students. If the other parents are on your side use it, schools hate parents opinions being against them.\n\n- As your sister shouted you can apologise for that but only if they accept the teacher was unprofessional and action will be taken (if they get dickish about it). Stand your ground over how unprofessional the teacher was when treating a student. Express a teenager will have difficulties being personally attacked first that way esp mentioning your parents in such a way. A teacher in a childs care should know better. You'd expect those comments from a student, not a teacher. She failed in her duties and emotionally harmed a great student.\n\n- If your sister has done anything good for the school or has good grades mention them. Say this is out of character and it must have been provoked (teacher talking about your passed away parents in such a way and homophobic comments). Show concern over your sisters well being.\n\n\n- Check or even ask if they have any policy on LGBT students, bullying or all students being treated equally. Ask if they're willing to express this policy to prevent future incidents. It always good to come with a solution which will make you and your sister happy.\n\n- See what any LGBT support groups or national are like. Any advice, legal or how to deal with schools etc. [Stonewall](http://www.stonewall.org.uk/at_school/education_for_all/initial_teacher_training/default.asp) UK has resources for schools on LGBT issues. If it is UK there are anti discrimination laws, but they might spin it to say your sister was trouble student and its not LGBT issue. \n\n- Like people said maybe go with a lawyer, worst case look up for back up schools or home teaching if it becomes bigger deal. Your sister still needs to get her education. There are risks, maybe for second meeting if it escalates. \n\n- Ask your sister first, if she wants to go back into sports after x amount of time or wants to be removed from class or join another with different teacher. If school doesn't move teacher off coaching or class. Then at least get teacher to sign document saying she'll refrain from comments about your sisters personal life and will treat her fairly like any other student. Keep safe for any other incidents.

So you've got a little balancing act to follow here.\n\nFirst of all, I think you should sit your sister down and talk to her yourself.  Number one -- validate her feelings.  If she felt shocked and offended it's totally natural.  The coach singled her out for shaming in a totally inappropriate way.  Number two -- talk about how she reacted.  If this was my daughter I would tell her she was wrong to say such hurtful things to the coach, especially if they're true.  She should have just told you or complained to another teacher or administrator about the coach's behavior.  I think this is a really important message for your sister.  But don't overdo it.  All your sister did was say some hurtful things, it could have been a lot worse.\n\nAnd then you have to deal with the school.  This is where your sister needs to see you going to bat for her.  They may have asked you there to discuss your sister's behavior, but you can just ignore their agenda and substitute your own.  Specifically, you are there *first and foremost* to discuss the coach's inappropriate conduct towards your sister and to ask what is going to be done about that.  Once they have acknowledged that behavior was wrong, you can discuss how your sister reacted.  Once the coach has apologized for her behavior, your sister might apologize for her own hurtful words towards the coach.\n\nIf the school officials try to deviate from that agenda, you just say \"I'm not ready to discuss how my sister reacted until we have discussed the context in which that happened.\"  Just say it over and over if you have to.\n\nOnly make threats, for instance of legal action, in the worst case scenario.  Most particularly, if they try to suspend or expel your sister over the incident, particularly without the coach facing any discipline at all.  ",

They probably just called you in as part of their usual process when a student is dismissed from a team/class, and I doubt any real punishment will happen as your sister and the coach both said inappropriate things and it's also a he said/she said type of altercation. They probably just want to clear the air.

            "Hey, man. You're probably getting a ton of responses that tell you to go nuclear, or get a lawyer. I think there are certainly reasons to call for that. But I don't think you can afford the time or the money to deal with one just yet - You're basically a single dad with two daughters, and a realistic approach would probably work better. I'm going to offer a couple of ideas, not advice. If you're interested, reply to the comments or message me, and I'd be happy to listen. \n\nSo, first things first, I was a high school teacher, and I've seen this happen a couple of times. Any ideas I can give you are based on my own biases and reading of your situation. I don't want this upvoted, and I don't want karma for it: What your sister has gone through is shitty and sucks really badly, I just want to help as I can. \n\n\n**Talk To Her**\n\nBefore anything else, it's a good idea to start with talking to your sister. You and she seem to have a great rapport, so it would be a good start to communicate with her to find out how she feels, and what she would like to do moving forward. Use your life experience and maturity to *HELP HER* make the right decision. All too often, in the face of injustice we feel powerless, and nowhere is this more true than with teenagers. Use this as a learning opportunity for her, and help her deal with the injustice. Also make it clear that it's up to her to call a halt to the proceedings if she feels uncomfortable - Nobody wants to be swept up in a tide of shit, and I'm pretty sure she wants it all to disappear.\n\n**Be the Older Brother**\n\nYou've got ten years on her, so you know how to respond to ignorant people - Yelling and insulting them is not likely something you do on a regular basis. With that in mind, point out to her that there are other ways to handle ignorant people. Your sister very much sounds like an intelligent girl who got caught up (rightfully so) in the heat of the moment. But with that said, she now knows what kind of issues getting caught up in the moment can bring. When you sit down with her, discuss possible alternative ways she can react. This is not a school issue, but a life issue: People will hurl the most hurtful invectives at each other - I've been picked on for my weight, my ethnic background, and my vocabulary. While that's not what she encounters on the everyday, I've been able to choose my actions carefully to avoid immediate conflict. The cool, levelheaded approach works by a far majority of the time in scenarios to get what you want. This is also something you can emphasize with her in your dealings with the school, the board, and the teacher's union: Keeping a cool, levelheaded and persistent approach is *much* more likely to get you somewhere than frothing at the mouth and screaming.\n\n**Should You Take Action?**\n\nDo you want to take action against the school? It depends on whether or not there's an alternative education scenario for her. Are there other schools in the area that are equal or better? If so, understand that she will be moving there, because taking action against the school will make it hard for her to learn in that environment. If there are no other schools in the area, then I would suggest sitting down with the principal first, and expressing that this isn't something that you've ever experienced with the school, that you know this will be resolved, but you would like to see action taken to ensure that the teacher doesn't do this with other students.  You may also want to sit down with the principal and the teacher, and explain your side. Hopefully, this will allow you to reach a reasonable solution - Your sister can be moved to another class, or can get an academic credit for the class while doing another term project or other work (volunteering at the library, for example, or with higher-needs students in the school) to get her away from this particular teacher.\n\nWhether or not this works out, I would recommend filing a complaint with the teacher's union alongside working with the school. What happened to your sister is unacceptable, and no-one should be made to feel lesser or excluded in an environment where they are supposed to learn. The added pressure will provide a much more productive environment for all sides involved to negotiate a positive conclusion. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHere's where I'll depart from reddit in my ideas: Lawyering up immediately won't help. It will make all other parties turtle up and get defensive, and will drag the situation into the courts where it may not help. There are a number of avenues to mediate the issue, and they will all use less time and effort than a lawyer. With that said, do your best to take notes of every phone call and meeting with staff and union members: Come in with a notepad and file folder, and take notes of what they're saying. If the school, board, and union are not receptive to your concerns, then you will have an excellent basis to have a discussion with a lawyer. Until then, there's no sense in killing a mosquito with a sledgehammer, as it were.\n\nI sincerely hope this helps. If you have any questions, or just need to discuss, please don't hesitate to message me and vent. I promise I will listen.",
            "I'm really not okay with the amount of people telling OP to lawyer up or go to the press or some shit. The sports teacher was completely wrong in what she did, and needs to be punished and put through sensitivity training, but give the school system the chance to actually do that before you do something as damaging as what's being suggested. Schools in many countries are under enough political strain as it is without huge legal kerfuffles, and you can wind up doing more harm than good if your first response is to bring out the big guns.\n\nAlso, I'm going to disagree and point out that saying something shitty to somebody who said something shitty to you isn't really the right path. This is not defending the teacher at all - it's clear that nothing about what that teacher said or did was even a little okay - but it might be a teachable moment for your sister, as well. ",

Have your sister write down what was said, get written witness statements from other students, and bring them to the meeting. How the Principal/Dean (whoever you are talking to, probably both) reacts should partially guide your way. It may be that no one else KNOWS what this staff member said and the more logically, clearly, and calmly you present it, the more it will be accepted and truly reviewed. \n\nPeople keep saying \"lawyer\" but I'm not sure what good a lawyer is going to do for your sister unless your sister is facing something like a Level 4/Expulsion or Suspension (without the ability to makeup work) exactly.

Moving your sister out of the class is basically exactly what you'd ask the school for, as well as an investigation (which would follow whatever procedures the district has in place), due to this misconduct. I mean, you could go to the media and get farther, but that's up to you. If they investigate the teacher, you won't be involved, except the information you gave - they'll follow their district procedures, like any employer. It doesn't sound like they've penalized your sister in any way that could contribute to a suit (changing classes is not necessarily considered a punishment, and most districts' policies give teachers and administrators - usually admin - the right to do this to kids at will; and would you even want your sister put back in the class with this coach?). A legitimate suit with damages isn't really popping up to me, but consult your cousin if that's your jam. \n\nCan I say that I don't think what your sister did was OK either, and I hope you communicate as such. I completely understand it. But, really she brought the coach's daughter into it and spread malicious, hurtful gossip (true or not) about her as well, and your sister should not have done that. I totally understand why she did it, but I also understand teaching her to react with the high ground is important as well. Someone shoving you doesn't mean you deck them and so forth, which is what verbally happened here, basically. The fact that the shover was an adult who was supposed to be responsible for her well-being not tearing her down sucks big time, but I still would tell her - if she were my kid or my sister - that there are better ways to handle herself with assholes in the future.

If the school is unwilling to address these concerns and perform some kind of substantial self-reflective \"audit\" on their policies, I would threaten to take the story to the media as such, focusing less on the single crime (you don't want to drag your sister through that) and more on the complacency and apathy of the school in dealing with issues of gender and sexuality.

The important part is handling the bigot of a teacher, but you should keep in mind that your sister absolutely responded inappropriately.

Neither of them should get away with what they said.\n\nYou should talk to the school about the teacher's comments, but honestly your sister still deserves whatever punishment they impose.  It's important that your sister knows you're on her side and that her sexuality is not a bad thing (she seems to know this, but encouragement always helps), but that doesn't give her permission to explode on a teacher (or anybody) like that.  She will get in trouble every time, and controlling her emotions is always going to work out better for her in the long run.\n\nWhen you talk with the school, don't argue against punishment if they push for it.  Your argument should be prioritizing firing, suspending, or otherwise punishing the teacher who spoke that way to your sister.  The school is not your enemy, that singular teacher is.  If you go in there pretending your sister behaved perfectly then they are much less likely to see your comments about the teacher as reasonable.",

Everyone wants the coach's head on a platter, but I think that if this situation is handled properly, it could smack some common decency into her and she might actually realize how shitty she was when she sees what will and could happen to her professional life.

So cheers for all the advice and all that stuff.\n\nI spoke to my mum's and told them I was thinking about not skateboarding again. They told me that's good because they're not letting me. There were a few suggestions that I ask them to come watch me. When I floated the idea, it was shot down immediately.  I went to my doctor and she told me that she doesn't want me skateboarding again. She expanded on my condition after the accident to me and told me another fall like that isn't going to go well for me. She said even after I get this thing off, I'm going to need to go to therapy to build strength again. \n\nMy mum gave my board to charity after we talked about it. I know they sound kinda mean, but they're really good mums. They're just very annoyed I did something very stupid. My girlfriend is annoyed me with me as well when she heard I heard I wanted to skate again. So overall I'm not skating anymore. \n\nTL;DR: I'm not skating anymore.",

            "Your mums don't sound mean, they sound like they love you. You're smart for listening to your doctor, it must really suck to not be able to skate if you love it but it's not worth the risk, especially since you're still healing. We all feel a bit invincible at 15 but don't push it, a lifetime in a wheelchair or worse isn't worth it. You sound like a sensible young man with great parents. I hope your recovery is swift and your strength returns.",
            "I fractured my neck when I was 16 sledding, and it\u2019s been almost a decade later and I still have back and neck issues from it, neck and spine injuries are a big deal. I\u2019m not saying you should never skate again, but for the next year at least you should be focusing on healing, another fall could seriously injure you more. I\u2019d recommend talking to your parents more about it, you have to think about how scary it must have been for them as well. Maybe you can pick up skating again down the road, but you need to slow down for awhile and focus on recovery.",

            "Hello, former roller derby skater here. I know it's not the same as skateboarding but I just wanted to share my story to let you know you are not alone.\n\nI had a bad fall about 8 years ago during training and broke my leg. Now when I say I broke my leg, I really shattered it. 5 breaks in total, spiralling up around my leg. I had to have pretty serious surgery on it and get two plates put in, one of which runs from my ankle to my knee. It was horrible, and took nearly a year to get myself back walking properly again. And I still have a slight limp and lots of scars all these years later.\n\nMy mother wasn't too keen on the idea of me returning to skate but as I was in my 20s she didn't really have any control over the situation. So I re joined a small local derby team and started skating again, because it was all I could think of as I lay there for months waiting for my leg to heal. I was desperate to get back skating. However, I found once I had strapped my skates on and started moving that I just didn't have the nerve for it anymore. Falling is a big part of any skating, and every time I slipped or stumbled I nearly vomited in terror, and all the memories of my leg break came flooding back.\n\nSo I skated for a few weeks with the team but ultimately the fear only got worse the faster and more competent I became. So I quit, but it was my decision so I had no bitterness towards anyone. Sometimes you just have to be mature and tell yourself that regardless of how fun something is, it's not worth getting a life-changing injury. You sould like you're handling your situation very maturely, so fair play. Best of luck with your recovery, and I hope you find a new hobby that you love just as much as skating.",
            "I broke my C6 vertebra in a car accident, so I get the shock and awe of a new life post neck injury.  In my case, it was an undo burden to no longer drive - plus it\u2019s still relatively a safe activity (so long as you don\u2019t get run off a highway and flip your car on a cliff). \n\nHowever, my neurologist made it veeeeerrrryyyy clear that I was to not take unnecessary risk, like skiing, skateboarding, sky diving, or anything else that considered falling down at a fast pace or high altitude. I can\u2019t even ride roller coasters anymore. It\u2019s a total bummer as an adrenaline junkie. Thankfully, a lot of water activities are still on the table as ways to find adrenaline, exercise, or sport.\n\nBe warned, if don\u2019t take your therapy seriously now and your neck heals weird, you\u2019ll at best be in pain all the time and get migraines and at worst need tons of surgeries. It\u2019s not worth it when you\u2019re 30 and feel 60 due to your neck/shoulder pain.",
            "I used to stay out really late at night, hanging out with friends, girlfriend, etc. One night as I snuck in, my dad was sitting up reading a book. Scared the hell out of me, and I thought I was done for. All he said was, \"Your mom and I never really sleep until you come home. And when you're really late, we're always afraid that the car pulling in is the police, coming to tell us something horrible has happened.\"\n\nWhen your parents love you, that fear of losing you is always there, in the back of their minds.",

I decided to keep n playing after my first surgery, and ended up needing another surgery after getting injured again in college.\n\nAlthough I look back at those times fondly, I am in constant and unrelenting pain. Having a chronic injury sucks, but if its in you spinal column its so much worse.\n\nPlease take care of yourself, being in constant pain really takes a toll.",
            "You're being very sensible. I can tell you love skating. I'm really sorry this happened to you and that you've had to give up something you love to do. However, I can completely understand your parents point of view. If you ever have a kid yourself in the future, I think you will understand even more - it hurts at an *incredible* level to see your own child in pain and I really believe they just want you to be safe... they're in no way doing this to be \"mean\". Please do give yourself some time to grieve the loss of your hobby and I truly hope you can find another outlet that you will love as much. I hope your neck heals well OP.",

            "I dated a guy who was a near professional snowboarder. He was being vetted at 15 for big deals and major companies would come out and watch him shred in competitions. He fell and had a major spinal injury and the doctors were pretty blunt: this can\u2019t happen again if you want to not be a paraplegic. It\u2019s tough but your mamas are just looking out for your later quality of life!",
            "There's a saying that when one person tells you that you're drunk but you don't feel like it, then you can probably ignore them. But when 10 people tell you that you're drunk, maybe it's time to sit down.\n\nNo, your mom isn't mean. Welcome to the cusp of adulthood. Your actions have consequences. By your own account, you did something stupid that led to you breaking your neck. The repercussions of that choice are that you should not ever get on a skateboard again. In fact, a lot of sports and other active hobbies are going to be out of your reach from now on. It doesn't mean that you can't live a fulfilling life.\n\nHowever, you need to realize that the risk centers in your brain aren't fully developed, and won't be for over 10 years. So if you have any inkling to do something dangerous or risky, you need to learn to help your brain understand the risk. Go the other way. You BROKE YOUR NECK. Understand the severity of your issue. Listen to your doctor, because he probably spent about as long in college, medical school and residency as you have been alive.\n\nGoing to skate was COLOSSALLY irresponsible. You really need to unpack this and get your head on straight.",
            "Good choice, prioritize your health and recovery. Maybe in a few years the doc will give you the ok to start skating again",
            "Take the passion you have for skating and focus it to your recovery. Toe the line with healing. Give your body every advantage you can to rest and recover properly. Set yourself up for the best possible outcome and best set of tools to use in physical therapy.  Once you get to physical therapy, that should be your focus. It's extremely expensive, your time there is very limited, and chances are you can only go for at most a few dozen sessions. You should treat it like going to an elite trainer. They teach you the exercises and stretches and the outcome is on you. If you do the work at home you will be their favorite client, I promise. When I was in physical therapy I saw so many people who treated it like a gym membership and only did their exercises there. Their progress was extremely limited and they didn't get to graduate to more involved, complex, and challenging exercises. \n\nI know I'm making a big deal of this, but you only get one chance to heal properly and one chance to go to physical therapy and get better.  Once you're 'better enough\" you don't qualify anymore. \n\nMost young people do not understand that they have to advocate for their own health. Your moms care about you, But you're the one that owns your body and you are the one that owns your time. It's your job to use your time and your body to make the most good for yourself.",

            "To me, it doesn\u2019t seem at all strange or foolish that OP wants to skate again. How many people have a car accident, but keep on driving? Or fall off a horse but keep on riding? Or get hit by a bus but keep leaving the house anyway?\n\nActually DOING it against a doctor\u2019s orders would be stupid as hell, but I can certainly understand still WANTING to.",
            "Good for you. When we're young we don't realize how fragile the human body is and how horrible life is without your health.\n\nYour mums are taking the best decisions on your behalf and even if it feels sucky at the moment some day you'll thank them for bing the loving adults in this relationship.\n\nBest of luck to you with finding new hobbies. Now you have something else to look forward to.",

            "When I was 23 I broke my left leg, the big bone while skating. The doctor asked how I could break the strongest bone in the body, it's just as strong as concrete he said. I told him I disagree because I landed on concrete. \n\nI will always have the metal stuff in my bone and hip hurts a little time to time. I decided to quit skating, pools and stuff like that. 6years later, the only thing I do now is a little longboarding to get from A to B. Not even fancy stuff with it anymore. Also nailed up my old board on the wall as memory token.",

I know it doesn't seem like a big deal given how resilient people are at your age (think back to this comment when you're in your 30s ;) ), but the long term implications of your injury DO matter. It may seem lame but take it seriously, take all of the steps and time you need to get better. Your neck is kind of a big deal, and the better you take care of it now, the better off it'll be in the future. Be careful, be safe, and hug your moms (and your gf lol.)",

Those kids loved her because she made things accessible to them and gave them a chance when no one else would. The administration and other teachers hated her for wanting to do better and be better. \n\nYou will find more passions in life, and lose some of them, and rediscover some of those many years down the road.",
            "I\u2019m not surprised at the reactions of the people around you, you went through a major trauma that could\u2019ve killed and maimed much worse, another accident may not fare well for you. They are looking out for you and it\u2019s for the best to find a new hobby. You are very lucky to still be here.\n\nMy boyfriend was around your age when he broke his knee(s?) from flying down a hill on a skateboard and hitting a solid object at high speed. I can\u2019t remember if he broke both but he snapped his kneecap vertically up the middle, straight to hospital for surgery to fix it, inserted pins into his leg. It was a long recovery, crutches and physio, he had to give up skateboarding and playing rugby after - which is always sad. Little over 15 years later it still affects him, sometimes he\u2019ll be walking around and suddenly hisses in pain because his knee crunched, it jolted weird or more often than not the tendon twangs/gets caught over his healed kneecap.",

For me, it was a heartbreaking decision to finally leave the game. In some ways it felt like I was no longer great at anything and I had to find a new identity. That said, I\u2019m dealing with a ton of damage with my joints that still ache/have issues despite being \u2018fixed\u2019. Unfortunately your neck injury was a huge injury and you will not get the opportunity to taper off of your sport. It might feel unfinished and you may have a lot of conflicting feelings over the next year or so. I tried to come back after the last time, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I played like I was scared for my body, and my body didn\u2019t do the things I would want it to do.\n\nLeaving though has given me a new opportunity. New time has opened up for creativity and relationships (friends and bf). I can focus on working out in new ways that are helping my body rather than breaking it down further. I\u2019m no longer mourning the sport and I can see with clear eyes that this was the right decision. You\u2019ll have hunger pains to skate again, but in time you\u2019ll know you made the right choice too. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk about missing the sport.

The best advice I can give you is to take your rehabilitation seriously. This includes doing all exercises etc to improve your muscle strength and posture. It is possible that if you can show you have learnt, done your rehab and rebuilt your body you can re-start the discussion on your sports choices, but the injury you have is potentially life changing so you might have to learn to love something else.

I was a competitive rider on a collegiate team and it was my whole life but one fall with the spinal fusion and I'd be toast. So I gave it up and I've found other wonderful hobbies.

Then 2 years ago, I had another accident that ended up way worse. Taking it easy, but still probably going 30-40 mph through some fresh snow and there was a hidden snow blower hose under the snow. Well my skis go under, I go over. I got a concussion that gave me a headache for 3 months straight, tore muscles in my back, and messed up my lower back indefinitely. I had to do physical therapy for it. But I got back on the slopes this year. My advice is this: it\u2019s difficult to stop doing something you love. People get injured worse or even killed for doing much less. You\u2019ll eventually pick it back up because it\u2019s something you just can\u2019t replace. But for now, you just have to suck it up and make everyone happy. Close relationships are more important than extracurricular activities",
            "Chin up OP, There\u2019s tons of other hobbies you can devote that energy into.\n\nJust think how you\u2019d feel, if it had gone worse for you this time, and you couldn\u2019t skate or do anything else.. You got a second chance to go out and do any of a ton of other things. Maybe you could take up hiking, or blacksmithing, or.. Well, nearly whatever you want.",
            "I know I'm late to this, but I broke my hip skating a concrete bowl when I was 22 and invincible. It took two years of surgery, PT, crutches, and a cane (which was kind of rad) to walk without a limp.\n\nMy wife, parents, surgeon, friends, and everyone that knew me told me not to be a dumbass and skate again. The surgeon was pissed everytime he saw me and told me that only old people get this kind of fracture. I was his youngest patient and he could not resist telling me that I'm a fucking idiot. \n\nI'm 35 now, and I kept all of the metal they put in me, and then TOOK OUT, as a reminder to not be so into myself and my past hobby.\nNow I just cruise around in a parking lot and indulge my other interests.\n\nNow everyone is happy and my body learned its lesson. Sometimes you have to shift gears, and that \"sometimes\" for you has happened.",

            "Why do you don't skate anymore? Don't you love skateboarding?",
            "Look. Everyones saying dont skate again. I say do. The fact that youre thinking about skating again straight after the accident means youre probably really passionate about it. And i say get back to skating. Maybe just take it easier. Less ramps (or none at all). Maybe just cruise around, use the skateboard as transport rather than tricksport (that was me trying to be funny... Ignore that). Have fun, just be careful. Obviously, you shoukd think about what happened and be really cautious, but do what you love. Dont let it stop you",

            "Ok I point out really quickly that I'm 16M and therefore I really feel called out on this one.\n\nI know people who love skating and would be crushed by leaving it behind. I personally love playing guitar and if I had to stop playing it I don't think I'd ever be that happy again.\n\nI think it would be no problem to start skating again one day, but it depends on you. If you REALLY REALLY like it, then I think it's worth it. But you'll have to wait a long time anyway.\n\nElse, just try finding a new hobby. Learn a foreign language, learn how to play a musical instrument, maybe how to cook. I even learned a couple of programming languages during this summer, you can find a lot of free courses on youtube.\n\nWhat matters is that you heal as much as you can before possibly starting again and of course you'll need your parents' and girlfriend's consensus, which you'll achieve only by handling the situation very carefully.\nAlso, should you restart, you should do that very slowly, like making sure you can stay on the board without falling, ect\u2026\n\nYour parents sound like they're just very caring, which is simply good, and you sound like a smart boy by listening to them and valuing their advices and opinions. You could have got paralyzed (I'm italian, I have no idea how to spell it), it's natural they got so scared.\n\nFor now think to heal and while doing so look for other hobbys or passions to potentially replace skateboarding. There really is not limit for that, I hope you'll be able to pursue your passions and stay happy even with a broken neck in the middle of a pandemic. You sound like the kind of guy who can.",
            "Fuck your parents , skate or die",
            "This is going to sound silly, but kids fall and break stuff. You seem to be doing quite well considering what happened. I would just do what you like to do but be aware of the danger's. Skating can be dangerous but it doesn't have to be as extreme as what happened to you.\nYour mom's definitely seem nice they just do what every mom does and it's kinda overprotective, but completely understandable.",
            "I don't think you should quit. I know plenty of people, myself included, who transitioned from handrails to flat ground ledges and rails as they aged. Skating gives you a resiliency and coping mechanism that will keep you healthy as an adult. You're not going to break your neck skating flat ground. That said, every mom and every doctor in the world is of course going to tell their baby/patient that they shouldn't skate. My parents tried to do the same thing to me when I was growing up.",

If you deem that risk too high then thats ok too! \n\nI had a near fatal climbing accident last year and was hospitalized and ended 4ft off the ground during a 30ft fall head first. It took alot of contemplation but i got back on the sharp end. For me, i love climbing and its worth doing it regardless if others are scared. Ill just be a but less bold and more careful in the future.\n\nDeath can come at any time, driving a car, walking across the street, covid, a random health incident.

            "In reality, skateboarding is no more dangerous than any other popular american sport. As soon as you are physically capable of any other sport, recommended by a doctor, there is absolutely no reason not to skate. If you think you should never skate again, you probably shouldn't ever play football, or basketball, or soccer, or ride a bike, or lift weights. Breaking your neck on a skateboard is not commonplace just because it happened to you. I hope you heal well and get back on a board when your body is ready again, and really learn to bail/fall when you're trying harder stuff.",

My best advise would be to strengthen your body, with more muscles you'll be more resistant. With man it can arrive soon like end of teenage years or later like mid 20's. Stay safe anyway, try to find a similar sport but less dangerous!",

She wasn't the one who took my blood for the test and as far as I know, the nurses don't actually do the lab work. \n\nAnyway, I got a call from my sister a few days later saying \"Tina\" told her my TB test was positive. Now, due to the nature of my grad school subject I know that sharing medical information is HIGHLY prohibited and she could get fired or worse. I don't really care if my sister knows my test results, but apparently she was talking about this at a party. It just really bothers me that someone from the clinic I go to would share my information like that. \n\nInitially my sister didn't want me to say anything because she doesn't want to cause drama with her friend, but now she's conflicted as well. Apparently someone else they knew came into the clinic recently and requested not to have Tina as her nurse. After that, I guess Tina deliberately searched for this girl's test results and information because she wanted to know what she was hiding. Neither my sister or I really want someone like this working at our clinic, but at the same time, I don't want to ruin her life by getting her fired or possibly blacklisted from working in nursing. \n\nThoughts?\n\nTL;DR My sister's friend shared my medical test results. Should I say anything to the clinic?\n \nOh and regarding the TB, I had further testing done and it's latent. I'm going to get treated for it but it's not active or contagious. ",

Even if it was not it is a huge ethical breach and here in the US we are bound by a code of ethics and you can ALSO report this to her board of nursing who can subject her to discipline.

My husband made sure that the hospital did not have permission to release my admittance information to anyone. The ER nurse told my aunt which in turn told all my family overseas. She loves to gossip about others but, not about her own daughters. Then proceeded to visit me in hospital even though she was not authorized to do so. When I got better, I lodged a complaint with the hospital. The parents of the ER nurse told my parents I should never have done that she could have lost her job. What about the privacy and dignity I lost and can never get back. This intrusion added to another level of stress to my recovery. This scared the ER nurse and things have not been good with my aunt. My aunt feels she did nothing wrong. Things will never be the same between us. \n\nMy advice is to report it and to take control back.",

For instance, I'm intersex, and as such I can be subject to a lot of discrimination and legally-permitted abuse (my country doesn't have protections against discrimination for transgender or intersex people). There are many millions of people like me who potentially could be put at genuine risk by the actions of this nurse, and I absolutely think she should be blacklisted from ever working as a nurse again. When you become a nurse, part of your position is that you have a legally and ethically sacred obligation to NEVER EVER share the details of what people tell you in confidence.

She *deserves* to be fired. *And* blacklisted from nursing. This wasn't a one-off fuck-up (her sharing your test results with your sister was extremely bad judgment, but perhaps something you could overlook), but a repeated issue (her going digging through someone else's medical records for 'secrets').

What she is doing is really not ok. You are feeling minimal impact but her behavior could in an extreme situation cause other people a lot of problems. Imagine for example someone who is keeping a pregnancy secret from an abusive partner, or someone's terminal illness becoming public knowledge before they were ready to announce it.  \n\nNot to mention the damage people like her do by making others afraid to be honest with their health professionals. Knowing of some horribly embarrassing symptom or habit might be the difference between diagnosis / treatment and suffering.\n\n*You* won't \"ruin\" her life by reporting her. One she can get another job etc. Two, she's really done it to herself by doing something she absolutely knows is not acceptable. When she made the choice to look up and share your results, she accepted the risk that it might come back to bite her in the ass. It's not a case of *if* someone complains about her, but a case of *when* someone complains. So it might as well be you.",

            "Report her. You don't fuck around with someone's medical information, and I'm sure this is one of the first things they are taught.\n\nOn a side note, there is a woman at a local pharmacy that made sure everyone in the store knew I was taking Vicodin. She grilled me about it as well, like I was seeking out the pills. I had just had ACL replacement surgery and was walking with crutches. My mother was with me to pick up cancer medication, as well. This lady knew my mother, and decided to make a big deal of the fact that she had cancer in front of the entire store (oh my God, when did this happen, etc etc).\n\nThis stuff is embarrassing, and there's rules set up to prevent that embarrassment. It's their fault if they don't follow them. ",

She's deliberately, searching for people's information. She shared yours, and who knows what other informs about patients without their consent. You should report it and she should be fired. ",
            "I want to point something out... if you dont report it and they find out later, but also find out you knew about it and didn't report it... there is a chance *you* could get fired as well.\n\nMost places dont take a HIPAA breaches lightly and while Im unsure if there is a legal precedent here there might be a chance you are required to report it.  \n\nI would cross post this to /r/legaladvice and check with them if you are required to report this kind of thing.  Because if you are and you do not... but they find out later... you could be in trouble as well.  Definitely worth looking into. ",
            "I get it.  You're an empathetic person and it's easy to minimize the mistake so that you don't run the risk of someone getting fired.  \n\nThe sad reality of the situation is that this woman will likely find a way to place the blame on others or minimize the event in her own mind, so her long-term behavior is unlikely to change.  A verbal warning won't change anything.  Getting fired may not either.  The learning experience will be mostly for those who witness the process.  ",
            "I wasn't sure, but after the part about her searching for what the other person is \"hiding\" you definitely should report it. The thing is you aren't ruining her life. She took these actions more than once and will do so again. This will actually help her if she is able to realize the significance of what she has done and is able to get another chance, or it will help her before she invests years of her life into a career for which she is not suited. She can't just keep doing this. It will catch up with her. \nGood luck with your treatment. ",

They both let off some steam by posting on Facebook about having to take care of him and they included just enough information about the patient without naming him that you could figure out who he was and they were reported. One nurse admitted her mistake and was apologetic; she was able to keep her job after receiving extra HIPPA training. The other nurse said \"It's my Facebook, I can post what I want.

He also constantly makes fun of our father (because he\u2019s very conservative) and jokes about him every time he gets the chance to.\n\nI\u2019m really busy with school, but on a good month I\u2019d probably hang out with them (at their place mostly) once a week. Me and my sis are getting along just great, have a lot to talk about and I love her a lot. \n\nEver since I met BIL he started making fun of me in a way that made me really sad, like \u201cwhy are you so shy/ skinny/ sad? Nobody will ever like you. You have no friends because of x thing.\u201d In a somewhat jokingly manner so that if I ever said he was being mean, he would say \u201coh, I\u2019m only joking, don\u2019t be so sensitive\u201d.\n\nFor a couple months now he started making fun of my appearance- \u201cyou have Dumbo ears\u201d, \u201cyour nose is like a skiing slope\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re as fat as a cow\u201d (I gained a little weight but nothing serious). I think I\u2019m fairly good looking but his words really bring me down and I start questioning it. He also started pulling pranks on me- he painted my face pink when I was about to head to a party with my other sister, and because he is much heavier then me I couldn\u2019t get away and had to redo all of my makeup.\n\nYesterday, I was hanging out with my other sister (18F) at their place. My BIL\u2019s wife was at work and he came home to grab something. He enters the house and says \u201cyour belly looks like Jabba the Hutt when you laugh, you\u2019re so fat OMG\u201d. I didn\u2019t say much thing back and just started packing my bag to head out. When I\u2019m about to put on my shoes I notice he has written my dad\u2019s name all over them in red marker. \n\nFor the first time ever, I got really mad and yelled at him. I told him that it is too much and very mean of him. So he started rubbing my shoes with alcohol and the writing is gone, but they\u2019re still red from the marker and look like shit. I just grab them and tell him \u201cI never want to see you again, I hate you\u201d and left.\n\nWhen his wife found out, she texted me that she\u2019s sorry for what he did- but I just didn\u2019t reply. I\u2019m so mad about it all. I still want to be around my sister (especially since she is pregnant and their other son always asks to see me +I love them so much). \n\nTL;DR: my BIL makes fun of me and has pulled a really bad \u201cprank\u201d on me. I still want to see my sister, but not him.",

He would never treat them bad because they are MY siblings,  which makes them his siblings too. He is always helping them out and doing things for/with them. \n\nYou need to talk to your sister. She needs to put her foot down on how he treats you (and her).  If she won't then start saying something to him everytime he is mean or rude. Tell her you won't put up with it and you are a human being who deserves respect. Remind her that her kids are going to see how he treats people and is that how she wants her son treating his siblings. Is that how she wants her husband to treat their son?  No one likes to be talked to like that. It's only funny if both people laugh,  if only one is laughing... Its not funny. Point all this out to her.

Tell her you love her and want to have a relationship with her, but you cannot be around her husband 1) alone, ever again; and 2) unless he makes a very meaningful apology and follows through with his behavior. If he slips up in front of her, you can tell her that you would like her to immediately tell him, \"Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.\" He should also send you money to purchase new shoes.

That he damaged your property rudely. That you won't continue to hang around if he is going to continue his behavior, and that makes you sad because you value your sibling relationship.\n\n- Talk to your parents. Make it aware you are NOT okay with his behavior - I'm sure they may share your feelings and the family can defend one another and help you uphold your boundaries.\n\nHe's not being a clown, he's being mean and downplaying it by saying he's \"joking\" which is no defense or excuse at all.

Sure, you can tell your sister *why* you're doing it, but cut them off. He isn't going to apologize,  since he thinks of himself as \"just being funny,\" \" just joking\".

            "This does not excuse your BIL's behavior: I personally believe people who make fun of others were probably made fun of themselves and are super insecure. If you wanted to completely emotionally destroy him, you could bring up every single flaw he has, from his incapability to be a good father (because bullies are NOT good parents), his weight, his physical features (especially if something is not \"perfect\"), to his intelligence, tiny dick, job/income, and other things that are ego driven and based on pride. I, personally, would not recommend that route if you would like to continue having a relationship with your sister, but just so you know, it is there. When I wasn't comfortable at verbally setting boundaries, I became very good at finding people's insecurities and absolutely destroying them (eg. I once told a bully in front of our entire class that no one, not even his so called friends truly liked him and his parents never loved him, because he was such a fuck up. He never bothered me again and I knew part of the things I said were true since he was a rich kid who was always in trouble). It's not emotionally mature, but it can sometimes help weak bullies, like your BIL, stfu. \n\nI'd also like to say the comments he makes about you being sensitive tell me that someone has said/done that to him too so he thinks it's acceptable behavior to excuse hurting people with covering it up as a joke. You can set up boundaries with your sister and your BIL. You can tell them that no one is allowed to make comments about your physical body, your intelligence, or to physically touch you/your things and if these boundaries are ignored/trespassed, then these are the consequences \\[insert your consequences here\\]. Maybe it means you don't come over to their house anymore. Maybe it means you see your sister and your nephews/nieces out in public and the BIL is not allowed or welcome to be present. There are so many consequences you can set. I just wanted to let you know that you have the power to tell someone they can't talk to you in a certain way and that they can't touch your things or you without your permission. You're not being made fun of, you're being bullied and your boundaries are being crossed. You're also not being sensitive. Your BIL never had the opportunity to make his bullies responsible for hurting him emotionally and so he is now doing the same to you. \n\nLastly, I hope you're being kind to yourself right now. These comments he's making have nothing to do with you and everything to do with a deep wound in your BIL. When we see things in people we don't like that usually means they are also present within us. Nothing is ever personal. People are always acting out of old egoic structures that were created in childhood and never corrected or questioned as an adult. Of course, your emotions and pain are valid. I just want you to know none of the things he says about you are true to who you are. You don't have to take this behavior from anyone, especially not a family member.",
            "I have a buddy who's like that. It gets exceedingly tedious. The trick is to just agree with them briefly and then ignore them. It really shuts them down.

            "I would tell your sister that his insults really hurt you and that it's not funny to ridicule people's looks or likes. You could also talk to him privately and tell him clearly and sternly that what he says is hurtful and not funny and to please stop. After that, I'd just start to call him out every time he says something like that. \"You think it's okay or funny to put other people down?\", \"You know what you're saying is hurtful, right?\", \"I don't appreciate being made to feel as if I'm not good enough, please stop saying things like that\". You're the bigger person here and the only way people like this will stop is if they get called out on it and are made to see what their behaviour does to people. Reflect it back on him by asking him what happened for him to be like this. I hate cheap humour like that, as soon as someone thinks being funny is ridiculing others then they're  just a sad, insecure person. Good luck and you sound like a very sweet person, I hope it all works out!",

That's assault, not a prank. I've been in social groups where people draw sharpie on people's faces who pass out with their shoes on. I was never a big fan of it then, and now (that I'm a fair amount older) I would not tolerate that from anyone. While I most likely would not press charges or attempt some sort of small claims civil tort suit, I definitely would not associate with that person again.\n\nYou might be able to get him to replace your shoes (or pay for them to be replaced), though that's a pool of money that involves your sister as well.\n\nRegardless, I hope others have suggestions in the thread for interacting with his verbal nonsense. Can he take it if you dish it back? I normally recommend the high road, but this seems like a perfect time to just cut someone down (verbally) as hard as you can.

To expect your sister to fight your battles, or make demands of her time, is ill-advised. But its amazing that you stood up for yourself. I think the far more difficult and necessary next step is to continue to be very firm, and clear, about what you do not like. Over time, if you are consistent, the logic will be clear to him and others around him. he will learn, and you will have gained a friend. I don't see another option. He needs to change his behavior towards you, and it should be you to teach him, otherwise you'll leave him guessing as to whats right and whats wrong and he'll continue to be a pest. You cannot simply snap your fingers and make this go away, avoiding is easy but won't fix the problem. You're an adult, you got this. Be clear. Be precise. stand your ground.",
            "Another thought. Jesus said to ooor heaping compliments into someone like this. God owns the judgement. By complimenting you are really heaping hot coals onto his head. Can you imagine this- he says your belly looks like java. You say, you have a really nice smile! I wish I smiled like that!!!! Or some other turn around. When ever he says something insulting you come back with a thank you, I\u2019m working on that and then say something really nice to him. Just think this through- what reaction would it bring????",
