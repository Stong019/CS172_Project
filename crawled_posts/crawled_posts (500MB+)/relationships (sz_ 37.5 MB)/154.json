            "I love happy updates! I think most people have a highly unrealistic expectation of what romantic love/marriage should be. The best and most loving marriages I have witnessed (and my own goal for my marriage) have been between best friends. They communicate well, have common goals(often confused with common interests, but it's where you are going more than where you are or have been), mutual respect and a protective instinct. ",
            "This is one of the best and sweetest updates ever. ",
            "Aw, this is so sweet :) :)\n\nI hope you get to internalize the idea that you're not \"ugly\" because you're \"tall and dark.\" that makes me so sad. Not because my culture values those attributes (I'm 6'2\" and pasty and I get what it feels like to not be what you've been told you should be). Not because your husband loves you (though it was so sweet and heart warming to read your update! Yay!) But because you are complex and interesting and kind and open-hearted and whatever else you are (I don't know you that well ;) and that's the kind of thing that will last :) you are a great partner and you deserve the same.\n\n(although if you find a way to get shorter, PM me ok? ;)",
            "FWIW, I tell my boyfriend of 4.5 years he is in the middle of the ven diagram between \"cool people I like to hang out with\" and \"hot people I'd like to +++.\" Friendship is the essential part of any good relationship and it is so often dismissed or not looked at as seriously as \"romantic love\" even though it is stronger, more long-lasting, consistent and the best basis for any thing more serious. \n\nMy boyfriend is unquestionably one of my best friends. I tell him absolutely everything (within reason) and he knows he can do the same with me. We constantly screw off and joke around and fist bump each other. There is a time and place for mushiness, but constant displays of \"romantic love\" are often forced or phony. But the mutual respect, interest, trust, and support of friendship isn't. ",
            "That is WONDERFUL !!!!!!\nMy husband was my best friend before we both told each other of our feelings. Mine wasn't under the best circumstance - drunk in Thailand (yes we holidayed together (like a couple, and lived together) with him holding my hair back while I was vomiting (Tequila shots in Thailand was about 40 cents Australian). I said it - the L- word) a few times that night, once he cleaned my up and showered me and cuddled me to sleep). In the morning I remembered but I kinda didn't mention it and neither did he. It was our last day, so we packed and off to the airport for an evening flight, arriving home at midnight and a few vodkas he asked if I remembered the Tequila night and I confessed and we went to bed (same bed as we always had since we moved in together 3 months after we met. ) \n\n\nThe next morning we were taking our pooch to the beach across the road from home, he said that he thinks he loves me too. Everything was normal as it had been before, accept some hand holding and way more kissing and sex than before).\n\nWe were in Sydney on a business trip (yes we worked together as well-I was his boss), and went up to an old observatory tower and just took in the views of the harbour bridge and Opera House, and we had the 'talk' . When we met he had just come out of a toxic engagement and came to my country to study (we met at uni, and talked online/texted constantly as soon as we met and had a very strong physical desire and personality qualities that complemented each other). I had also just left an abusive husband for good (this time!)\n\n\nDuring the 'talk' he admitted he was scared, that all the issues that he had would again surface once we were a 'couple' . He thought it would mean his quirky things (that I love about him - like drinking a beer in the shower after garden work), would put me off and he didn't want anything to change once we were a couple and even married. I told him the same,that weird things about me (like a sandwich has to be made properly - like cheese first, cheese always touches the bread, then protein and salads with lettuce at the top then condiments like relish can go between the bread and cheese, other condiments, like dressing/mayo go on top of salad then bread.... and yes I will deconstruct a pre-maid brought salad or sub and put it together the way a want it), might make him cringe. \n\nBut we both agreed we had seen the best of us and the worst of us, thus we are comfortable and already in a real relationship. We were engaged about 6 months later and,married the next year. Ten years ago but it still feels like yesterday!\n\nAll the best for your future :-)",

            "Wow I think your tl;dr: update is great, and everyone on this update is clearly happy for you.  I am too. But, you need to now go back now and reflect on all your knee-jerk reactions to your initial comments and figure out a game plan for how not to react with so little self-confidence again, --  and for not trusting your best friend who loves you and for doubting your own trust of and love for him. You need to develop a clear plan for trust and love and more importantly, communicating that from here on out.  Keeping silent instead of speaking out initially, festers the communication process and no good comes from that.  Make a point of communicating daily.  Sometimes having a 15 minute recap of the past 24 hours is easier than trying to voice new things out of the blue.\nI just want to end this diatribe with a response to your initial post comment, \"But I don't think he loves me. He's ex wife was pretty and I'm not, I'm too tall and too dark\".  Everyone on this is Earth describes themselves as \"too\".  Stop it. And Stop it Now.  Even if you perceive yourself as  \"too\" tall and \"too\" dark.  So what?  I am \"too\" small and \"too\" white.  It doesn't matter!  Love sees through our exteriors and into the hearts of our interior selves and loves us.  Your SO loves you, don't second guess it.  Be honest and straight-forward in all things.  ",
            "See? Not as bad as you thought. Still consider working on your own self worth. You sound like an amazing and very charming lady and apparently your husband and his family think so too. Your mother probably did mean well and culturally, what she did is pretty normal but nonetheless, she was still wrong. I wish I was tall lol. And there's nothing wrong with not having light skin, either. ",

            "Some people show their love in different ways. Your husband values you as his wife and best friend, and now you know how he views you because you communicated. You are an upgrade, you're intelligent and you communicate. That's big. For example, it's possible that his ex wife cheated because she schedule at communicating with him and as a result felt she was missing something, that's just a possible example. But you had a problem. And you went to him. You guys are and will be great. ",

It also shows that the best way to find out how things really are is to really communicate with each other. \n\nAnd I bet you're actually prettier than you think you are. You are certainly pretty to him why would he tell you otherwise about \"the upgrade\". So sweet and it is to help you see your beauty. ",

You'll find some gorgeous and confident dark women with this hashtag, go check it out!  Embrace your dark skin!\n\nAlso, my husband and I don't cuddle before bed either, it's just not some peoples thing.  Neither of us can fall asleep if we are cuddling, so we only do it on the couch or if we are having sexytimes.  ",
            "It sounds like you've ended up with a really nice partner. Make sure to work on your communication to keep the relationship healthy; not only tell him when you're feeling hurt or confused, but make sure to express your own feelings of affection as well; you say he wasn't at the top of anyone's list - is that still how you feel about him?\n\nSince your self-confidence is so very low, you should work on that too. I'm sure your partner doesn't think of you as \"not attractive,\" an undesirable wife, \"too tall,\" or \"too dark.\" Consider seeing a therapist for support in this. You don't want to risk your very nice-sounding relationship to turn sour due to co-dependency.\n\nSince your self-confidence is so very low, try to find the courage to tell your partner this. And make sure not to let it turn into fishing for compliments. Ultimately you need to be happy with how you see yourself, and not how you think others view you.",

Me and hubby do that as he's a hot water bottle and I'm cold as, so I can snuggle, get warm, then move away. Even though I'm pregnant I still love him snuggling through the pillow and stroking whatever part he can touch :) ",

Brought up past relationships of mine when I was with \"more alternative people\" and called me \"vanilla.\"  The whole exchange left me seething for  a myriad of reasons beyond the original discussion.

I know a lot of people don't sleep as well without their SO but sometimes our partners do go out of town, grow the fuck up and deal. I don't have any problem believing the dude is gay or think anything sexual is going on but the whole \"I could have a full-on emotional relationship with someone else with no sex\" would be kind of worrisome to me.

This morning she has done a 180, apologized for disrespecting my boundaries and assured me this will never happen.\n\nI brought up many of your points to her this morning.  Opened the conversation about whether or not she felt there was intimacy missing in our own marriage. She emphatically said no to this.  I told her how disrespected and belittled and \"shaken\" I was over the whole thing.  She said she felt badly and apologized again.\n\nShe *was* drinking last night. I will say her demeanor changes quite a lot with alcohol.  I wouldn't call her an alcoholic, but we do drink many nights a week. Socially like most people do.\n\nAs far as moving forward, I'll continue to be open and honest with her about my feelings.  I will continue to call her out when I feel as though she's disrespecting my feelings.  And yes, I'll be watching the situation closely.\n\nThank you all again for the advice. And for the validation.

I wouldn't want to cuddle with my girl friends, either, all that stuff is reserved for husband only. \n\nI also think that my gay friend would find such a request equally weird. \n\nYou are not being unreasonable at all, and it is very unfair of your wife to blackmail you into being alright with it by calling you \"vanilla\". She even told you outright that she wants to have an emotional affair with someone else. Did she actually ask him already? What did he say? If he's actually gay and doesn't secretly fancy her he'll probably think her request is crazy, too. ",

One day his ex-wife came home and told him she wanted a divorce, things weren't working out.  \n\nShe moved her \"gay\" best friend in the next week, and they got married about 7 months later.  They are now in the middle of a divorce, because he finally decided he likes men more than woman, but it didn't prevent him from breaking up a marriage first.\n\nTL;DR: my husband's ex wife married her \"platonic\" gay best friend.  Sometimes you are paranoid for the right reasons.",

            "Gay guys do (rarely) have sex with women from time to time, sometimes to see what it's like and other times because they are very slightly bi and met a woman who struck their fancy. They're adults with sexual urges (urges that do almost exclusively point towards other men, but which don't *have* to) not eunuchs. And that's assuming he actually is gay and that that's not just a lie she's telling you to get away with having her boyfriend stay over.\n\nSo... Not only has she told you that she's down for an emotional affair, she also has ridiculed your very valid concerns about her doing this and doesn't seem to respect you as her partner. This doesn't sound good at all.\n\nHow long are you going to be away for, anyway?? What kind of weirdo can't spend a few nights sleeping by themselves? She sounds ridiculous.\n\nI suggest you consult a lawyer now in order to minimize your losses in the case of a future divorce because it sounds like she will eventually cheat on you in some fashion (if she isn't already doing so) and you won't want to also suffer financial ruin over this.\n\nIt could be that she's just suffering from the idea that having a gay best friend who comes over to watch Drag Race is what sassy women have to do to be cool, but that doesn't generally include sleepovers or emotional affairs so I'm skeptical of that.\n\nBy the way, most gay men aren't out there hoping to have sleepovers with women. What is with this guy that he'd agree to this? The most physical attention an average gay man is going to want to give a woman is a curiosity squeeze on her boob because he doesn't normally touch them, or a friendly hug when they first meet up at the wine bar to catch up on their friendship chatter. \n\nYou'd have to be a pretty hopeless gay man to choose regularly cuddling with a married woman over finding some hot guy to spend the night with.

If this guy had been a friend since childhood, really was like a de-facto brother, they'd shared a bed chastely in their pyjamas watching TV as little kids, that sort of thing. You'd still be within your rights to say no, but her wanting to would be understandable. And if you were secure enough with both her and him to be comfortable, you might also reasonably say yes.\n\nBut this isn't a pre-existing brother figure. This is a new acquaintance and she wants to encourage physical closeness that oversteps the line and intrudes on intimacy that's meant to be just with you. That's way out of line.\n\nHonestly, I think she's hoping to start something emotional and/or physical with this guy, regardless of him identifying (apparently only recently) as gay. But even if she is just hopelessly naive and thinks him identifying as gay means he's \"safe\" and will never get a boner for a lady again, she clearly doesn't view exclusivity as holistically as you and most monogamous people do. Not only would I say no, I would also want some serious discussions about what exclusivity means to her anyway.",

            "I'm a woman in a committed long term relationship. My best friend is a married gay man. We live in separate states and meet up about once a year, and have done many trips and long weekends, just the two of us. When we travel, we often share a bed to cut down on hotel costs. However:\n\n1) I always make sure it's ok with my boyfriend, and if it made him uncomfortable we would immediately spring for a second bed. The fact that your wife is pushing this shows she doesn't care you're uncomfortable with it.\n\n2) we don't cuddle. We are friends. I don't cuddle with female or male friends because it is a physically intimate activity, and I reserve all physical intimacy for my partner. \n\n3) my friend is married and I have known he was gay from day 1, he has never made a romantic pass at me and he has no reason to. It's troubling that you say your wife's friend used to be straight--that's not how homosexuality works, it's not a choice, you don't roll out of bed one day and say \"I'm sick of the ladies, So starting today, I am gay.\"\n\n4) I have known my friend for more than 10 years. We share a bed on vacation because we consider each other family and it's often cheaper to get a single king bed v. two doubles. Your wife has met this guy 4 times? It is truly bizarre she would find it appropriate to invite him into her bed at all, but it's even stranger that she barely knows this guy.\n\n5) my friend and I share a bed to save money. Your wife wants to share a bed with her friend for emotional intimacy. This is a huge difference.\n\nHonestly, from the point of view of someone who does sometimes share a bed with my gay friend, it seems pretty clear she is planning to cheat on you with this guy. She's hiding in plain side by making you aware he will be in your bed. You need to revisit this, put your foot down, and tell her you need to set up boundaries for emotional intimacy with other people. If she wants you in her life, she must respect those boundaries. \n\nLast thing--she is clearly in the wrong here, but you may want to explore WHY she feels the need to get intimacy elsewhere. She sounds like she requires a lot of affection, which is ok. When you talk to her, ask her if there's anything you can do to better meet her needs for intimacy. Do you guys cuddle, even when sex doesn't come before or after? I'm not trying to justify her actions, but it does sound like her emotional needs are not being met. Maybe this crazy idea is a passive aggressive move on her part to show you she's not getting her emotional needs met by you. Good luck, don't give in to this highly inappropriate request.\n",

To use it as an insult is a very obnoxious thing to do. \n\nThe past relationships aren't relevant in any way, since it's your *current* relationship this is taking place in. (And to bring them up at all is very childish of her, and does nothing but shut down communication.) Not wanting her to have that kind of level of intimacy with someone who isn't you - you know, her *husband* - is not unreasonable, it is not vanilla, and I'd wager it's a pretty darn common sentiment shared by people in a monogamous relationship. \n\nUnfortunately, there's not a lot you can actually do if she refuses to see your side of it.

            "I don't know what you're next actions would be, but if I'm building an intimate, monogamous relationship with someone I love, there's three pieces of attraction I need to have with that person:\n\n-Emotional Attraction - trust, confiding myself in them, stability\n\n-Physical Attraction - health, physical beauty in my eyes\n\n-Chemical Attraction - instinctual reaction of being drawn to them\n\nThese are the legs to my relationship stool.  Without one, it falls.  And all of them need to be at 100% attraction, otherwise the stool creates a slant which makes it easier to fall, and makes it easier to rock the relationship.\n\nShe sounds like she's invested herself in a mental/emotional attraction to this man, and regardless of his sexuality (or anyone's), she is sharing intimacy with which she shares only with you now with another.  AND, because it involves an intimate spot and activity (bed & cuddling), that makes anything physically attractive amplified.  At some level, I can only think she has been drawn to the man due to some chemistry she thinks may be there, which will only make the other two traits that much easier to take advantage of.\n\nThe only advice I can give is if she doesn't connect with you if you tell her how you feel, maybe tell her to talk to someone that she & you trust (parents, most likely).  If she won't talk to them, it seems like she doesn't want to listen to logic because her emotions have overtaken the logical side of herself, and if that happens, you may have to cut ties.  I don't like to tell people that, but if you say \"yes\" to her on this, you'll grow to regret her and distrust her opinions, and that's what a relationship is - and that's what that relationship won't have.  Good luck, Atlas.",

            "Heh my take is that your marriage is on the way out the door.\n\nYour wife is either a complete fucking idiot, or she *thinks you* are a complete fucking idiot.\n\nEither way, cuddling my ass. There's a real problem that she would suggest something so silly, whatever the problem is... it's gonna fester, and it'll grow... and she's gonna bang the shit out of someone if you two don't figure out what is going on.\n\nJust my opinion but, seems fairly obvious.",
            "I think you have much deeper problems in your relationship than this one issue and you should definitely seek couple counseling as your feelings and concerns are not being heard and if she's seeking emotional support and attachments with ANY one else of any orientation, that's a problem to me.",
            "Is she stupid? Mate, get her a stuffed animal and tell her to deal with it. ",
            "One of the reddest flags I've ever read.  Something has either happened, or will in the near future OP.",
            "As someone who would be totally fine with my wife cuddling with a gay friend, I'd like to say that your wife is way out of line. She wants something that's apparently not that big of a deal to her, but makes you very uncomfortable, and you have communicated that fact.\n\nThat should be sufficient to end the discussion, unless she can communicate why it's more important to her to have a cuddle-buddy than it is for you to feel safe and comfortable in the relationship. Maybe she's afraid of murderers or aliens coming for her in the night (this is why my wife might need a friend to sleep with). If she can't explain her reasons in such a way that you understand why you should put her needs above your own comfort, though, she shouldn't expect you to do so on faith.\n\nThat's not how to bring her around, though. My advice for the conversation with her is to be self deprecating. Tell her that this makes you intensely uncomfortable, and that it might be silly to feel that way but you do, and you really need her to not do this. \n\nA lot of commentators seem to be framing this as \"if she does this, she doesn't care about you or your relationship\" and advising you to discuss it under those terms. That's not how people work, and it's not how relationships work. Say the thing that will get you what you want, not what will make you feel right.",
            "The fact that she is pushing this issue raises a red flag for me. \n\nYou said you don't really know the guy and you'd never guess he was gay. Do you think he's actually gay? Or is you wife trying to get some on the side.",
            "Sorry dude, but I think your wife might be looking for a chance to cheat on you. \n\nCalmly tell her how you feel. Tell her this is non-negotiable for you. If she persists in the \"but hes gay. he wont do anything\" argument, then ask her how she'll feel when you cuddle up with a lesbian while you're out of town. \n\nAnd whether or not she agrees not not invite her \"gay\" friend over I would suggest you strongly consider setting up a few nanny-cams in your bedroom while youre away. I am very confident that she is, or soon will be, cheating on you.",
            "It doesn't matter whether you're unreasonable, (you're not), your wife does not consider your feelings and lacks any trace of respect for you. She seems to get away with a lot, and at some point, this has to stop. You have tried reason. You have tried pleading. You have tried analogies. It didn't get you anywhere and she keeps pushing the issue. If I were you, I would lawyer up, get tested and hit the gym immediately. And that's because it doesn't look like you have a loving wife anymore. Not at all. Don't tell us this comes out of the blue. There has to be a long pattern, a parade of red flags leading up to this. Take a good long look in the mirror, that's what I'm saying.",
            "Why the hell does she want him over to sleep with her while you are gone so badly anyway? \n\nLike I can't imagine why this is worth fighting for so hard after just meeting him that makes me think there is something else going on. \n\nWorried the \"gay\" friend isn't gay, and she's known him longer than you think... I hope not man. ",
            "It's all fine and good as long as she doesn't mind you inviting that cute lesbian woman over to cuddle with you, while you are out of town.\n\nAnd failing that, you let her know that no, you are not okay with that, and if she does that she will be single very quickly.",
            "You've already updated below here, but if she wants cuddles inside a monogamous relationship, I'd tell her to look into group cuddling. I don't know if they're available in every area, nor how much they would charge, but it can give you a feeling of closeness without the private setting.",
            "Beyond weird. I've got a fair number of gay male friends that I've know for years and I can't think of one that I would ask to cuddle with me in my bed...it's just odd and definitely inappropriate in this case!",
            "Anybody who tries to shame their partner for being uncomfortable is being massively disrespectful, and demonstrating they don't really *care* how their partner feels.  They just want to do it and have there be no consequences.",
            "Are you sure this guy is gay if you've only met him a few times? Sounds like to me your wife and he know each other better than you know him. Saying she's going to hang out with her \"gay\" friend is the oldest and most overused trick in the book. If you don't know this guy well and haven't met his significant other, or heard from very reliable sources that he is for sure gay you might want to start snooping.",
            "You are absolutely right. No man gay or not should be in that bed cuddling with her but you. That is so wrong on so many levels. There are just certain things you do not do that should just be part of the bro code. ",
            "Show her this thread, let her see how ridiculous she's being.",
            "Man. I really thought there would be at least one post like, \"I don't see what the big deal is. I'm 17 and cuddle with my gay cuddlebuddy all the time. My bf doesn't own me.\" I'm rather disappointed.",
            "I'm going to be as moderate as I can be here. It is possible to want to cuddle with a *friend*. Or even a stranger! It's also possible to have an *emotionally intimate* relationship with someone other than one's significant other. My wife has an \"emotionally intimate\" relationship with her best friend, and I wouldn't care if they wanted to cuddle. It's nice, she provides emotional support and enjoyment that I don't. I take it on faith that they aren't looking to have sex with each other. But I know both of them very well and have a lot of experience to understand where their boundaries are.\n\nBut what your wife is suggesting sounds completely different because, it sounds like, she doesn't think of this as a completely different thing than what she gets from your relationship. It sounds like she's asking to have a polyamorous relationship, using words like \"vanilla\" and \"alternative\" in this context, talking about different modes of relationships. It sounds like you're not cool with that, and you don't have to be. So have a conversation with her about what the intimacy you two share means to you, and in what way the exclusivity of that arrangement is important to you. Tell her how different scenarios feel to you! Tell her your fears! Then listen to her needs and hopes and work it from there.",
            "My best friend of five years is gay and when he stays over or I do we share beds. We do NOT cuddle. That's weird as hell. You have to feel some sort of attraction to someone to want to cuddle with them. And if you do, obviously something's wrong. ",
            "Her \"gay\" friend who definitely doesn't swing both ways.\n\n\nHonestly she sounds horrible.  ",
            "Divorce her ass.  \n  \nYou're not weird.  \n  ",

            "I would definitely show her this thread. She is absolutely out of line on this. Stay strong man.",
            "What really worked for me in my previous relationship was a mutual understanding that you don't have to be open to everything. It's okay to not be comfortable with something. There's a fine line between distrust and lack of understanding, and legitimately not feeling comfortable with certain things. Especially if those particular issues are intimate.\n\nAnd the more intimate a particular subject is, the more important it is to understand that you *don't* have to force or change things you're uncomfortable with.",
            "Why in the world is wrong with people? I know I'm not helping here but go get a hooker and pay her some money to pretend that she is gay, and cuddle with her in front of your wife.",
            "I wouldn't want anyone cuddling with my partner.  Gay, straight, asexual, castrated- doesn't matter.  That is seriously odd.  I don't mind the whole \"this is my best friend forever and we cuddle on the couch while watching a movie\", but cuddling in your bed while your gone would not be cool with me.  To be honest, this sounds off.  I hate to say someone that identifies as a gay isn't actually gay, but in this instance something seems odd.",
            "He's bi and she wants him to stoop her.",
            "No. I don't cuddle with anyone besides my husband. This is super weird and out of line.",
            "Yea NO! I would not even buy into that. I'm a woman and that's your bed and your wife... The thought of another man in your bed should make you cringe gay or not.",
            "please be troll, surely she is not that stupid",
            "You seem to have some misconceptions about how being gay works. If he was \"straight most of his life\" then he was either deeply closeted or he is bi. Under the circumstances, I'm guessing the latter.",
            "You are not being unreasonable.  Physical intimacy isn't just about sex.  Cuddling in bed with someone is pretty damn physically intimate - there is a huge level of trust in falling asleep around someone in your own bed.\n\nShe can bring up your \"vanilla-ness\" all she wants - which has no bearing on this argument by the way - it is an intrusion on the intimacy that is at the core of your marriage.  She's inviting a third party into it, and expecting you to be happy about that.  You have a right to NOT be happy about it.  It doesn't make you lame - it means you aren't into a relationship that involves more than two people.\n\nAnd if she's throwing up business travel as the reason?  Please.  My husband and his former colleagues all had intense travel schedules.  Not a single one of the wives considered inviting a gay man into our bed to cuddle while they were gone.  It's not really SOP.",
            "Why does your wife want to sleep with another man while you're out of town?",
            "Your wife is weird and she needs to know that.\nIt's not normal for her to request this.\n\nAlso I highly doubt that he is fully gay, is he claiming that he has absolutely no attraction to women?\n\nAnd if so, he went his whole life being straight and just out of the blue decided women were gross?",
            "The first comparison that jumped to my mind would be asking her if it would be OK for you to hire a prostitute to cuddle with. I mean, she wouldn't develop feelings, and it would just be about the physical comfort. When you marry someone, you are their physical, mental and emotional partner. You don't just pick and choose and say only one of those matters. at least that is my opinion. ",
            "She's feeding on your pain. ",
            "In the town where I live there was a bit of a scandal when the local optometrist's wife had an affair with a gay man. For some reason he decided he felt like \"a bit of vaj\" (his words) for a bit. So just because one is gay doesn't mean he's not gonna poke the bear. Therefore yes your feelings are totally valid.\n\nTo be fair, even if it was a man with no dick or whatever your feelings would still be valid. Cuddling and sleeping together can be even more intimate than sex. I would suggest marital counselling cos from your post it sounds like wifey is a bit bored. Sorry man :("

You'll be happy to know that my girlfriend is now my ex-girlfriend, she's gone, its over, I sent her home. I won't be seeing her again. \n\nFirst thing I did was apologise to my sister and tell her how sorry I was for having been a shit and useless brother. I should have been there for her but I failed her by giving my girlfriend more chances even after how cruel she had been.  I told her how ashamed I felt and how I had failed her as a brother, and I promised her I would never do that again. I swore to her that I'd never let put her in a situation where someone can do that to her again, I made a promise and I really do mean it this time.\n\nShe forgave me and told me how glad she had honestly really been hoping that I break up with her and send her home, but she didn't want to push me about it, and she reassured me that I am in fact a good brother, and I shouldn't be too hard on myself and call myself a shit brother.  I told her it is honestly what I am because I failed her when I should have been there for her.\n\nI explained the entire situation to my parents and told them everything that had happened and how my girlfriend was no longer my girlfriend because of what she had done, we are now through.  I explained to them that the remaining two weeks we can all spend together as a family and I am really looking forward to that.  Both my parents supported me and told me I'd made the right decision, I told them I should have made it earlier and I failed my sister by waiting too long, but they forgave me thankfully and were understanding.\n\nAlso, some people had mentioned the shorts I had bought. You are right, I was totally sending her the wrong message by getting her something she can wear that will cover up the scars.  I told her those shorts I bought are just if she wanted to use them, but I don't think she needed them, and I don't think she should use them. I told her in my opinion she had nothing to be ashamed of from those scars, I think those scars are very beautiful and I think she is beautiful with them, she should be very proud of herself because she struggled through an immensely difficult period and overcame many hurdles throughout her life and she ended up on top of it all as a winner. I told her in my opinion she is a hero and she will always be my hero, the strongest and bravest person I've ever known.  She was really happy to hear that and so were my parents,  she said she's not feeling as bad about those scars as she was the previous days and she's ready to go to the beach again.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Broke up with my girlfriend, she's gone, apologised to my sister and family for having been a shit brother, they forgave me and now I look forward to spending the remaining two weeks with them.",

            "Your sister is going to remember that you made the right choice in the end.

Your sister's brave and her scars are absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. They're battle scars. I have some too. All they are is proof of how strong she is that she came out on top. \n\nIt sounds like you guys are gonna be fine. Good on you, OP. ",
            "I love it when toxic voices are immediately silenced!  I really do believe the \"hear no evil see no evil...\" saying goes a long way.  It's amazing how many little comments can add up and really alter a person's life course. You just took a bat and knocked them all away out of the park and fixed what damage was done.   A part of me becoming semi mute was from one kids comments being the straw that broke the camels back and I wonder so much how different life would be without him (DRAMATICALLY INSANELY better, because he did way more damage afterwards because I put up with him since he ended up being the best friend of my bf, who I had to move in with to escape my abusive mother)   It makes me happy imagining the way things could be if I didn't cut someone out, and then imagining how it will be now that I have.

I told her those shorts I bought are just if she wanted to use them, but I don't think she needed them, and I don't think she should use them. \n\nOP -- While I understand the point those people were making, I think they judged you a little too harshly about the shorts. And before I get downvoted straight to hell, I want to point out that I used to self-harm regularly (cutting, burning, etc) and I still have prominent scars on certain parts of my body. So this is something I understand via experience.\n\nAll that being said, I think OP should get a pass for the shorts. OP was not the one who said \"You shouldn't go to the beach,\" or \"you should really cover those scars up.\"  Those thoughts and comments came from the sister's own mind. When a person has given up self harm, they can feel *very* self-conscious about the scars of their past . There are tons of judgmental people out there. And since the scars are actually representations of deep (emotional) pain, and one's difficulty in dealing with that pain, she might even feel that they're a sign of weakness and shame, being worn on her skin, impossible to remove. \n\nWith most people, you can't see any of the pain and misery of their past. With a serious self-harmer, their emotional pain is written on their skin, for everyone to see.  \n\n*She* was the one who suggested she was uncomfortable with ever going to the beach again. OP buying the shorts was merely a kind-hearted instinctive reaction to prevent that. He had no intent to send any kind of message -- he just wanted his sis to stop being sad, and wanted her to be able to enjoy herself. \n\n\n\n",

        "selftext": "For the past five years, I've volunteered for a mental health hotline. I'm deeply passionate about the hotline's work, and I've devoted huge amounts of time and energy to answering calls, training new volunteers, and fundraising. I've become close friends with many of the people I volunteer with, and I get a lot of joy out of helping people who don't have a lot of other support in their lives. I love this organization; I can't imagine my life without it.\n\nToday, the head of the organization sent out an e-mail announcing that they've hired a new volunteer coordinator: the girl who relentlessly bullied me in high school and made my life a living hell.\n\nI was completely blindsided. I moved across the continent after graduating from high school, and I have no idea how or when this girl moved to my city. I doubt she applied for this job to deliberately antagonize me, since we've had no contact since graduation and all volunteers are anonymous. So it's just a terrible coincidence, but it still means I'm going to have to be working with a person who was unbelievably cruel to me.\n\nI really don't know what to do. Obviously, all of this was a long time ago, and it's possible she's cleaned up her act since high school, but I still hate the idea of even being in the same room as this girl. I've had her blocked on every platform for, wow, over a decade now. It looks like my only options are to, a) tough it out and deal with this person coming back into my life, or b) quit the hotline after five years of service.\n\nTL;DR I've volunteered at a mental health hotline for the past five years, and they just hired a girl who bullied me in high school as the new volunteer coordinator. I definitely don't want this person in my life in any capacity, but I also don't want to quit the hotline. What can I do?\n\n**Update (Friday, 7:43 PM EST):** Shortly after making this post, I went for my regularly scheduled afternoon shift at the hotline, and the girl just happened to be there for some kind of orientation. I wasn't expecting her to be there, so I initially just kept my head down and ignored her. A little while into the shift, she came over to introduce herself, and genuinely didn't seem to recognize me. (I've cut my hair and gotten glasses since high school, so that could have been it.) It was a very brief interaction, and I didn't say anything to her in return, just nodded and smiled. \n\nAfter she left, I asked my shift supervisor if I could speak with her privately. I followed some of the advice here - just letting her know that I have a history with this person and I'm not comfortable working with her directly. The shift supervisor was very understanding and said that she could arrange for me to only serve shifts when the girl isn't supervising. She also offered to let me schedule my shifts through her instead of through the girl, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, it seems like there will be an unavoidable level of casual interaction, given that the girl is working in the facility on a full-time, 9 to 5 basis. I think I'll be able to stick it out for now, but we'll see. The shift supervisor did ask me what I wanted to tell the girl, vis a vis an excuse for my not wanting to be on shift with her, but I couldn't think of anything to say, so I left it up to her.\n\nThanks for the kind words and the good advice, everyone. Much appreciated.",

            "So, the first thing is probably to identify a different hotline you could volunteer with, and then speak privately to your contacts at your current hotline and ask if they are willing to serve as references etc. Get that set up so that you have a way to continue giving back--obviously this is important to you, so you need to find a way to continue doing that work.\n\nThen I'd talk to whoever your usual manager is (unless it's this woman), and say that you need to resign as a volunteer, you have the utmost respect for the organization and you have really loved your time there, but that the new volunteer coordinator is the woman who bullied you in HS, and even if she's changed as a person, you can't work under someone who used to bully you.\n\nYou are not bluffing when you say this, btw. Your plan is to leave. They will not fire an employee because of a volunteer's unwillingness to work with her. You have to look out for yourself here. She may well have changed for the better, but that doesn't mean you need to be around her at all. I'm so sorry, but I think the best possible thing for your own mental health is to find a new organization to dedicate your time and energy to.",
            "You could privately talk to your manager about what you went through and how bad it was.  Maybe they could make sure that you're always working different shifts?  I wouldn't quit without trying to talk to someone about it. ",
            ">it's possible she's cleaned up her act since high school\n\nI was going to say this because people can change a lot from high school to their mid-twenties. Honestly, I think there is a third option other than the one you laid out which is try to use this as an opportunity to improve your own mental wellness by seeing if you can't get some closure. Forgiveness is incredibly tough, so I wouldn't blame you for saying \"Fuck that\" but it could be such a healing moment if you were able to let her know how much she hurt you and seek to forgive her if she is willing to apologize and show remorse.

Either way, it's a lot to throw away for the sake of uncertainty.",

But you need to learn how to be around this and not let it disgruntle you. You can learn confidence and a lot from this experience. I wish you the best of luck ",
            "I ended up working very closely with a guy who used to bully me relentlessly in school. He would spread horrible rumours about me, follow me around shouting sectarian abuse at me, and once he saw me walking back from my friend's house and actually went and bought tomatoes and eggs to throw at me and chased me for about a mile with them. He was a big part of the reason that after my exams I went to a school where I didn't know anyone away from all of my friends.\n\n\nWhen I saw him enter my workplace that Monday morning I felt so angry. Before I had a chance to say anything he was paired up with me so I could show him the ropes. I could tell that he was very uncomfortable with this, and we just spoke about the job very formally for about 20 minutes. \n\n\nThere was a bit of silence when I was showing him something on a computer and he said 'Do you remember me? From school?' I said I did. He asked me what I had been up to since school and if I still saw anyone from school. I answered politely and asked him the same. It turned out he had been through a lot since school and he'd had a hard time. He had very few of the same friends. His whole manner shocked me because he was being very polite and professional.\n\n\nIt took me a while to realise that he wasn't a teenager with his gang of assholes who had his back anymore, and that I was a woman who knew everyone in a place where he was a stranger. We were two adults who had grown and lived a bit of life and developed emotionally and mentally. \n\n\nWe became friendly with eachother. We weren't best friends but we could chat to eachother at break time and added eachother on social media and that sort of thing. We knew a lot of the same people so we could catch up with eachother on what they were doing, and even though we hated eachother in school we were there for a lot of the same things so we had shared memories and funny stories. \n\n\nI wouldn't have ever asked him as an adult for an apology because he wasn't the same person he was and the time for an apology had passed. I just took him for who he had became rather than who he was when he was less intelligent and didn't have the same empathy skills. I did a lot of things when I was younger that I'm not proud of now, but at the end of the day I was a child. ",
            "It\u2019s possible that she\u2019s changed. The social environment in high school is tough, and once people get out of it (and the brain matures) some people change. I don\u2019t know if I was a bully, but I was a head of a little clique in HS for awhile and kind of kicked a girl out of our group. It was mean and I\u2019ve regretted it a lot as an adult. I saw her after college and apologized to her. I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t mean anything to her, but I tried to make amends and if I were to work with her I\u2019d probably make it one of my missions to be as kind as possible. I wish we could\u2019ve been friends, but I moved out of state so we\u2019re just Facebook friends now. I learned from that situation and think I\u2019m a pretty nice person now. High school wasn\u2019t a picnic for me either. While I was being snobby to her, a whole host of other people were being horrible to me, I was in an abusive relationship, had a toxic family environment, and I was trying to stay afloat as well. I wasn\u2019t even mean to her because I didn\u2019t like her. Someone told me that she had a bad reputation and was ruining our group (I was new to the school and didn\u2019t know anyone), and that\u2019s why I stopped talking to her in HS. Which is SO dumb, haha. I actually really liked her, but my desire to not be outcasted overruled me at the time. Anyways, sorry for my long drama...if she doesn\u2019t apologize to you, or show with her actions that she wants to be friendly and make it up to you, then I\u2019d wonder if she\u2019s still the same person. She could just be really rotten to the core still, so be careful. But, you never know.... I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this, OP! ",
            "Whatever you decide to do is an absolutely valid decision, there are no wrong moves here. Whatever makes you the happiest and most comfortable is the right thing for you. You are under no obligation to forgive her\n\nI just wanna point out that volunteering for a mental health hotline is a really big thing, most normal people don't think about that. Someone that bullied you relentlessly probably had severe mental health problems and probably worked them out, in part, because of you. It's not right or fair but it's entirely possible that the guilt they feel when they think about it now is what has compelled them to move in this direction\n\nYou don't have to like them or even forgive them, but if you did, it might help you with your own mental health issues. Personally, forgiveness has helped me come a long way. That said, those people are still cut out of my life, but I have a great deal of acceptance and understanding, if nothing else. I don't feel hurt and angry and upset when I think about it anymore. Forgiveness for me it like the emotionally vscant feeling of \"it is what it is\", wouldn't it be nice to get to a place where your day isn't ruined every time you are reminded of the fucked up shit you went through? This is what they mean when they say that forgiveness isn't for them, it's for you. When you've reached that point where you even feel sad for them for being what they are, that they can't be better.\n\nForgiving someone and refusing to share space with them are not two incompatible actions, it's possible to do both.\n\nGood luck, OP",

Time to grow, learn and forgive and let go. That to me shows real maturity. Running away shows nothing. ",
            "I'm with others in this thread to consider option #3: this girl has changed since a decade ago, and may actually be volunteering to ty to undo what she did in the past.\n\nShe has no way to get in touch with you (since you've blocked her everywhere) and she didn't seem to recognize you. What if she is deeply sorry for what she did, is doing this work as her form of amends, and has no idea how to get in touch with you to apologize?",
            "That\u2019s horrible and I\u2019m sorry you have to go through this. I wonder though if your bully has some kind of child abuse type past which motivated her to work for a mental health hotline, it isn\u2019t really your typical job. Sometimes bullies lash out because of problems at home.",

            "Speak to your manager about the situation. If this girl is still a bully to any degree, they shouldn't want her managing hotlines for mentally ill people. You would be doing them a service by informing them of what she has done to you. If you had to go so far as block her on every platform she's likely got behaviour that goes straight up the stalker list as well. ",
            "I don't think any option is wrong here, I think you literally can pick any of them!  I would volunteer with another organization and not give her another thought.  It would annoy me too much giving her a daily thought as I walk in the building.   I'd rather take my kindness elsewhere.  But no choice is a bad choice her so you can feel her out if you want. \n\nPS, it was not \"a long time ago.\"  You are completely justified in feeling weary, apprehensive, and doubtful of any changes she's made to herself.",
            "Put your big girl pants on and deal with life.   You can't avoid something because it makes you uncomfortable. ",
            "That's the sad thing about bully situations.\n\nThe person who was bullied, remembers the bully for the rest of his or her life.  The bully, on the other hand, probably barely registers all the people he or she bullied, and could have moved on without even remembering.\n\nEither that or like you said, she was not expecting to meet you, so even a person with the same name but different look, she could not expect it is the same person.\n\nBut I hope you will be able to work through this. \n\nIt is very possible she began this field of work to atone for her past mistakes in judgement.\n\n",
            "Has she started work yet? If I were you I wouldn\u2019t do anything yet, just see how she reacts when she sees you. Act normal, do your thing, it sounds like your well established at the organisation. Give it some time to see how your both interact with each other knowing you have this past. If she volunteering for a mental health hotline, it must be something that is important to her so maybe she\u2019s had some issues in her past. Hold your head up high, this bullying was back in high school, it sounds like your doing really well. Just see how it goes, if she hasn\u2019t changed and starts to show some of her old behaviours, go to your boss with your concerns, but you never know she might be completely different. ",

            "People can change but I totally understand your worry. Since you used the phrase \u2018relentlessly\u2019 about the bullying, this has clearly impacted your life in a big way at some point. And maybe it has also contributed to why you are working for the mental health helpline because you want to help others going through that! It\u2019s just a suggestion and it might be unlikely, but maybe she did see the error of her ways and maybe that\u2019s why she is also working for the hotline now too. \n\nShe will eventually recognise you or see your name and     realise who you are, there\u2019s no avoiding that and it\u2019s up to her if she wants to apologise for her behaviour. I hope she does, regardless of whether you accept an apology it would be nice to hear at least. I\u2019m sorry you were bullied, I absolutely despise bullies and hate to hear the impact it has on the victims of it. \n\nYou sound like a lovely person, and volunteering at the Hotline is a wonderful thing to do. I hope whatever happens next is positive, and at the very least you will be able to avoid her if that\u2019s what you want to do. It\u2019s nice that you have an understanding manager too!

            "Honestly, I would have told her who I was, and asked what made her decide to work there. If she apologized, I would accept, but be wary, and offer to talk about it and her deciding to pursue that line of work. If she is truly remorseful, I wouldn't hold it against her, as long as she did apologize and understood what all I went through because of her. After this was sorted out, I would just speak casually to her. You never know, maybe she's completely turned around and is a very kind hearted person now. ",
            "Sometimes people change a lot between high school and adulthood. Maybe she realized bullying was wrong. Has matured. You state that she politely introduced herself. Maybe her days of acting like an a##hole bully are over. \n\nI had an arch enemy i went to school with from 4th-9th grade. He tried to bully me and i fought back. I got kicked out of school once for trying to stab him with scissors. . . fast forward 25 years. He looked me up on FB, contacted me. He was going to be in town on business, would i like to meet up. I figured \"why not?\" So we met, had a blast, got along fabulously as adults. We tried to figure out WHY we hated each other so much as kids. Neither of us could figure out a particular reason. He lives on the west coast, i live on the east coast but we chat periodically. I'm actually very grateful he contacted me after 20something years and are now friends. ",

The *single best thing* I ever did was stay strong, and not let them impede or alter the course of my life because they happened to be around me.  \n\nYou know what happened?  Every single one of them apologized and asked for forgiveness.  The hardest thing I ever did was be the bigger person and give them that forgiveness.  \n\nMy advice to you is to let this person know exactly who you are, and remind them that they absolutely do know you.  You don't need to be friends with that person, but knowing you were on the receiving end of them being a shitty person (While they are trying to be a good person) - will likely cause a moral conflict with them that'll result in an attempt for them to clear the air with you.\n\nDon't back down.

They don't seem to recognize me, or if they do, they don't care.\n\nIf you really feel you can't work with her, then  I would find another place you could volunteer at.

I wonder what her story is. Did she try to kill herself? Did she drive someone else to do that?

You are a volunteer and she is a full time employee, so the organization will probably go with her.

It may turn out that you really can't handle being around her. Or it may be she falls apart and apologizes sincerely, and you feel better. \n\n\nIf you leave over this, that isn't her winning and you losing.

She was able to get the security footage from the grocery store to the police who had enough evidence to book and arraign my ex on assault and battery charges. It's currently in the hands of a junior DA to see how they are going to proceed. I have a victims advocate working with me to keep me informed along the way. Also a restraining order is in place...she is not allowed to contact me in anyway or Come near me. The security footage is really bad--it shows her beating the crap out of me and me trying to get away. I don't even it remember the incident being as bad as it looked on the video. It totally shuts down her accusations of me abusing or hitting her. \n\nI haven't spoked to ex even once. I assume the judge spoke to her at the arraignment because apparently (im 100% no contact with her) took all the desparsging stuff about me off of her social media. I believe it's part of the restraining order that I'm not to be mentioned, tagged, etc... On social media. I don't believe she had a retraction of what she said Rather just deleted it. \n\nAttorney also helped me with breaking my lease with campus housing without losing any money so I'm living at my friends place which is cool but I now have to commute to school which kind of kills my schedule but I'm dealing.\n\nI can't add much detail on the campus counselor but just say it's being dealt with by the appropriate people.\n\nAnyways I just wanted to give an update because everyone is super cool and I don't think I would have had the guts to leave had I not made that original post. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Left an abusive relationship with my ex-GF thanks to r/relationships ",

I no longer could justify going back to my apartment in the middle of the day for naps, TV, etc., so I actually ended up spending a lot more time on campus studying in the library and computer labs, and my grades subsequently improved a lot. I also spent a lot more time with classmates and made friends I probably wouldn't have otherwise. While quite a bit of time was lost in traffic, I was much better at managing my time, and when I was home, I could relax a lot more since all of my work had already been taken care of on campus.
