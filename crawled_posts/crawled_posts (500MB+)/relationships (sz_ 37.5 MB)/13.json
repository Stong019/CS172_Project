It made me feel terrible. I brought it up with her and here's what happened.\n\nI brought up the topic and she was super cool about it. She was surprised and she said that it was just friendship on her side. However, she went up to the guy and asked him if he saw things the same way. He said he didn't -- he was actually into her. So, she told him that she's with me and that they need to stop hanging out. It was never an issue after that -- we still met him at a few parties, but it didn't make me feel bad at all.\n\nReading the old post made me smile. It felt like a big issue back then, but she solved it so swiftly. I'm really thankful to her! We've had the most wonderful relationship since then (and even before then). We're 33 years old now and still going strong together. We moved in together a couple of years ago and it's been amazing living together, traveling together, being together all the time. She's still so sweet, I love her with the bottom of my heart, and it's obvious she loves me too.\n\nYou never know how these things will turn out, but ours is a story to fill your hearts with hope and love!\n\nPS: now I'll delete the password to this throwaway and any reference to it on my computer. It feels nice to close the loop :).",

            "I love getting an update and realizing the original post is from 5 years ago.\n\n Your GF did such a wonderful job resolving the issue. Congratulations to you both, you sound like lovely people, both of you :)",
            "I hope you no longer feel your prime years were your 20s! Welcome to the over-30 club, it rocks here",
            "I've just read the old post and I thought it's totally friendship from her side but not his. I've had friendships that were most definitely friendship from my side but not the men. They were just using the \"friendship\" to get in my knickers. I always had male friends but stopped because it was too much trouble/drama and it was always twisted into being the bad guy.\n\nSo glad you got things sorted by just speaking to her about it. Followed by her having a conversation. Lovely to hear you still together and very much in love",
            "I feel like it\u2019s really interesting to note that someone in the original comment section called what was going on emotionally cheating basically because the friend was a platonic support system for her. That\u2019s not what emotional cheating is, otherwise my bisexual self would be constantly \u2018cheating\u2019 on my husband because every single one of my friends is a \u2018potential romantic interest\u2019. \n\nFriends provide support, emotional support. The idea that you can only receive emotional support from your spouse or partner is incredibly hard to live with. We are social beings and if the only person you can lean on is your spouse that really limits options if you\u2019re going through a time when your spouse needs to lean on you and it would be unfair to lean back. Look up the ring circle of venting if you don\u2019t know what kind of situation would call for this.\n\nEssentially, we all need friends. It sucks that OPs GF had found a friend with an ulterior motive but we should all be open to the idea that friends do come in all shapes and sizes and are incredibly valuable for us. Your spouse cannot be expected to always provide the brunt of emotional support one may need. It\u2019s unfair and unrealistic.",

            "So happy to hear about how things have gone in the 5 years since!\n\nSomething you wrote in your prior post struck a nerve with me though and I wanted to respond. The ending of a relationship does not make that relationship a failure. Nor does it mean that time was wasted. If you are loving being in that relationship, then enjoy it for everything that it is while you are in it! And take those thoughts and feelings into future relationships if and when that one ends.\n\nThis was one of the greatest realizations I ever made about relationships. You can have a wonderful and fulfilling relationship that ends. And that's okay too!",

            "Absolutely amazing to see one of these posts end the right way. She didn't call you insecure, controlling, etc. She heard you out, asked the guy and **actually ended the friendship** when she realized it wasn't healthy for your relationship.\n\nAfter seeing people rake various OPs over the coals for having concerns about their partners friends over the years, people refuse to cut friends off who have feelings for them, etcetc it's so refreshing that you guys communicated and handled this the way two adults who love each other should.",

            "Congrats on being able to look back and see how far your relationship has come. Communication is so so so important to a healthy relationship. I think your story is a great example of explaining how you feel to your partner and them making your feelings a priority. I feel like I've seen this same story, but instead of confronting the 3rd party, the partner dismisses OPs concerns.",

            "\nHer immediate and concise action is actually what a lot of relationships should be about.  We *don't* want to seem like we're controlling our partner but if we have a problem and the partner can do something about it, there should be a decision/compromise made about it.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean the compromise works out but there should be some change.  For example, if her choice had been, \"OK I won't hang out with him anymore outside of work, but at work, we still eat together and share at work the bakery treats or food that we cook\".  It's not cutting him out cold turkey but it is setting up a new boundary that is still a compromise.\n\nIt shows that the friendship is work-related only, meant only for at work, but outside of work, there is no need to meet up or text or call etc\n\nHowever, that's just one possibility. The possibility you said here, is just as good.\n\nYour update shows that there's good chances for a relationship if the 2 people communicate and that fact that it was a Long-distance relationship that worked out and you two closed the gap.\n\nGood luck!",
            "Great communication! And kudos to her for listening and working with you to resolve the issue together.",
            "Good to hear man.\n\nI find it strange how na\u00efve some people can be when it comes to this stuff. I made it quite clear I was interested in a girl I worked with some time ago, and when we finally hooked up a guy we both hung out with said \"finally,\" and she had absolutely no clue what he meant by that. He said it was painfully obvious I was into her, and she was genuinely shocked. Meanwhile she had been saying how annoying it is when guys don't make the first move. Funny how that works.\n\nAnyway, happy to hear you guys are going strong and things are working out. I love looking back at issues I had in the past and laughing at how insignificant they really were.",

        "selftext": "Original post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8q10gs/my_20f_friend_21f_is_going_to_great_lengths_to/\n\nSo I posted a few days ago about my housemate Emily who had made it her life\u2019s mission to try and make me see that my long-distance boyfriend, Sam, was cheating on me.\n\nAfter posting my original post I sat Emily down and told her that I would not be engaging in conversation with her about Sam at all. She tried to claim it was all in my best interests to listen to her, but did reign it in. Drama over.\n\n\u2026 Until it all blew up. I got a very angry message yesterday from Emily\u2019s boyfriend calling me every name under the sun, including a \u2018home wrecker\u2019. I asked him what the hell was going on, and he said that he knew all about how I\u2019d been cheating on Sam and how I\u2019d convinced Emily to do the same to him. It turns out he\u2019d found out that Emily was on Tinder and was talking to guys, and had even met up with a couple and done whatever. I had no clue she was doing this - whenever she left the house for the night, she always said she was staying at her boyfriend\u2019s. I told him in no uncertain terms that I had not encouraged Emily to cheat on him, and I was not cheating on Sam. He then tried to claim that Emily had told him that I was away getting with some Tinder guy on a specific evening that I wasn\u2019t in the flat\u2026 I was celebrating Sam\u2019s birthday with him in his city, and had the timed and dated photos to prove it, and of course Emily knew where I really was. I have no clue whether or not her boyfriend believes me, but I haven\u2019t had any other messages from him since.\n\nEmily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can\u2019t say I saw anything, but I also can\u2019t say this was a definite lie) and she was scared about his reaction so she said I was involved. She then said that I would understand her position if I had broken up with Sam like she wanted me to. I\u2019ll admit, that got my attention. I asked what she meant, and she said that she had wanted us both to be \u2018free\u2019 from our partners but she knew I wouldn\u2019t cheat on Sam so had tried her best to convince me that he was cheating so I would leave him. She got the door slammed in her face. Even if she did want an escape from her own \u2018abusive\u2019 relationship, her non-stop attempts to persuade me to leave my boyfriend just for her own gain is enough for me to just cut her off.\n\nI didn\u2019t even wait until Emily woke up this morning to put my plan to move out into action. The landlord has been contacted and is very understanding (we\u2019re very close to the end of our tenancy anyway) so I\u2019m breaking my lease, and I\u2019m going to spend the night in a friend\u2019s spare room before making my next move. I might write her a goodbye note, but she hardly deserves it. I\u2019ve been wondering for a while whether or not I should move to be with Sam, I think this is now going to be a big part of my decision.\n\nAlso a lot of comments in the original post were suggesting that something had happened between Sam and Emily while he was still living in this area, and she was trying to make me see that without coming clean. I didn\u2019t reply to any comments because I know the sorts of responses I would have got to \u2018I know he\u2019s not cheated on me with Emily\u2019, but I do know he didn\u2019t. He never contacted Emily privately, and was really only friendly to her because she was my housemate. Sam was just as unlikely to cheat with Emily as I was with any of his friends, family or housemates. I know some of you may still think that he could still have cheated/cheat in the future and I can\u2019t definitively say he didn\u2019t/won\u2019t, but I\u2019m not going to ruin my relationship with \u2018what if\u2019 style thoughts.\n\nTL;DR - Housemate who was trying to prove to me that my boyfriend was cheating was actually cheating on her boyfriend and wanted me to \u2018join in\u2019 by convincing me to dump my boyfriend. Found out from her boyfriend, who had been told that I was the one telling her to cheat on him (I wasn\u2019t). I\u2019m moving out as quickly as my legs will let me.",

You don't want her or her ex going to him spouting these bullshit lies.\n\n\nMy advice would be to ghost her. If you can move out when she's not there so she can't cause any issues. Also if you can have your landlord tour the house the same day, preferably before you leave so she can't trash the place and your be on the hook for damages. ",

First she was lying about Sam, then she was lying to her boyfriend about you, because she's a fucking idiot who can't keep off tinder, so she throws you under the bus in hopes that somehow she can convince her boyfriend that this is all someone else's fault. She uses you because you already shot down her and told her you weren't going to hear it. You're not willing to play ball, so you're a threat and tries to o discredit you. When that didn't work, she is now doubling down to try to get support from you because she's totally fucked herself over. I'd cut this woman out of my life if I were you, she's trouble, big trouble.",
            "Man, I did not see that twist coming.",
            "\"Emily was wailing my door about 10 minutes later, saying that her (ex) boyfriend had gone insane and she only cheated because he was abusive (I can\u2019t say I saw anything, but I also can\u2019t say this was a definite lie)\u2026\"\n\nOf course since you know she was lying to you in a very hurtful self-serving way and lying to her boyfriend in a way that also hurts you and now she's making allegations that would hurt her ex-bf, perhaps you should not be so even-handedly suspending judgment.  Innocent until proven guilty isn't the gold standard it's made out to be, but in this case, considering the source...  ",

Take pictures and lock your room! If your landlord is cool with it, get a stronger lock.

Find a friend with a garage and ask if you can store stuff temporary while you couch surf/get a storage unit.\n\nVideo your apartment and room before you leave.

            "Wow, Emily is a manipulative piece of work. Of COURSE her BF is abusive... that totally excuses her cheating on him... *huge eyeroll (yes of course there are abusive relationships, but banging random guys on Tinder doesn't sound like the kind of escape tactic dating an abuse victim might attempt. They usually end up in fairly serious relationships where they can get meaningful support to get away from their abuser). \n\nAt least this way she's out of your life. I wouldn't leave her a note if I were you, and certainly make sure you don't give her any room to worm her way back into your life. She will probably try and crawl back to you with some sob-story about what a victim she is and how she's changed and grown. People can change and grow of course, but if someone is willing to pull the kind of long con she attempted that actually was intended to ruin something good in your life, that's not forgivable.\n\nAnd good on you for not buying into the whole \"If he hasn't cheated on you yet, he will!\" this sub tends to have a boner for cheating and instant dumping. Sam sounds like a good guy, I wish you both the best in the future.\n",

            "Her bf is an idiot. Even if you did encourage Emily to cheat on him, it isn't YOUR fault that she actually decided to. She's an adult who can make her own choices.\n\nI'd just say good riddance to her without a note.",

            "I had a boyfriend do a similar thing!! He was trying to convince me to be in an open relationship by saying that our other friend-couple were in one and loved it, but they weren\u2019t, and I later found out he was just cheating and wanted a free pass to not feel bad about it. ",

            "I don't think Sam cheated on you either OP (and didn't after reading your original post). I think Emily could go Single White Female on you though, cause she's got some issues. Make sure to document ANYTHING weird she does while you move out and after and please take pictures of all your belongings and the house before you move out in case she damages anything and tries to blame it on you. ",
            "I've dealt with a few of these types and have to commend you for dealing with it very maturely.   It's really easy to get sucked into crazy drama.  The best thing you can do is document EVERYTHING. Takes many pictures before moving out.  Prepare your case in the event you need it.  If you don't need it,  just stay away.  Avoid both of them like the plague. Cut ties completely or you'll just be pulled back in.  Run and enjoy your life. \n\nOn a different note,  think long and hard if moving in with boyfriend is the right choice.  Sometimes when couples move in together because they \"have to\" (for lack of better words), it can cause future arguments if one or both parties didn't feel completely ready to take that step.  You'll know if it's the right choice. ",
            "I have had a \"friend\" do something eerily similar.  She tried to wreck my (still ongoing!!) relationship with my boyfriend any way possible. Outed me very AGAINST my terms and wishes about a sexual assault, and a month later said the same thing had happened to her (after we had fallen out of friendship because DUH).  I rushed to meet her at the hospital and... she wasn't assaulted.  I won't go too into detail because she very much uses reddit, but she is SEVERELY mentally ill.  2 years of NC and she made social media posts randomly calling me out for supporting abusers...  The girl has Borderline Personality Disorder and psychiatrist hops so much she never gets proper treatment.  She is a clear and obvious detriment to the personal lives of whoever she gets close to, and it's slow.  It starts as friendship, then mimicking, and like an abusive SO, slowly isolating.  Cut off all contact.  Block on all platforms.  Immediately cut anyone who sympathies with her out.  It is in YOUR best interest.  I'm sorry you have lost a friend, though, I know that truly, truly sucks",
            "That Emily chick is sick in the head. I'd almost wonder if she didn't have a thing for OP and that's why she wanted her to be \"free\" with her. At the bare minimum she is toxic for trying to drag OP into her bs. If she really was being abused by her bf, that's horrible and she needed to get out but how does hooking up on Tinder achieve that? And why try to slander OP to her boyfriend? This whole thing reads like some \"Single White Female\" stuff and I'm glad OP is getting out quick.",
            "oh look she's crazy ~*suprise*~",
            "Wow. Sounds like she was continuously trying to project her problems onto you, in one way or another. Wanting to build her own made-up narrative about how your relationship with your BF is just as broken as hers is. ",

I had a housemate scandal like this last year although it was the person cheating on their husband. It was dramatic and annoying and finally she listened to me when I told her to leave (for the 3rd or 4th time, it was my place and they weren\u2019t on the lease anyway I was doing them a temporary favor they took advantage of.) it\u2019s not always easy to cut toxic people out but I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t hesitate with this behavior!

            "I don't know you or your friend personally, but she sounds toxic and manipulative. \n\nI had one of those friends. My best one in JH/HS, to be exact. She also tried to convince me that my then-boyfriend-now-husband was cheating on me, too. Her stories didn't add up on multiple occasions, often citing times when I was with him and she just didn't know it, and eventually HER boyfriend jumped on the phone with me and cussed me out, calling me a stupid bitch who was too dumb to know she's getting cheated on. I dropped her like a hot potato. Fast forward 11 years, I'm still with the boy and I'd be lost without him... meanwhile, she's had 5 kids with 4 men, lost all but 2 of them to welfare, went to prison for felony possession.... etc.\n\nIt took me until that point to realize how manipulative she was.

I got some very dramatic texts/ yelled at in person by this dude, but I had zero concrete proof so yeah...\n\nI basically avoided them for the rest of the lease, and then the remainder of graduate school.

        "selftext": "[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/cysbos/apparently_im26f_too_perfect_for_someone_like/)\n\nI wasn't going to bother linking the original post but I guess I have to. It only attracted the attention of 2 people, one of them probably has a lot of throaways judging by my karma. Still, it's a happy ending and a teachable moment I would love to share with the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a nutshell- I met a guy I liked, found out there was an incident involving him, ran away cause I lost a close friend to a similar situation and that was too much for me to handle. A year or so later I looked him up to see if he even survived, we got back in touch and became friends. Over the years I caught feelings, he started yet another relationship. He went through a hard time and crashed at my place. We kept living together, he got better emotionally and started showering me with affection. Then I got hit by a drunk diver and got off with no complication and very easy recovery (compared to what could've been in that particular situation). While I was in the hospital he told me the incident left him disfigured. He fixed that, it's barely noticeable, you literally have to know about the remaining scar to see it but he can't stop seeing himself that way. Once I left the hospital, those tiny signs of affection got progressively bigger, to the point there wasn't a moment without physical contact. One night we were cuddled up on the couch and I went for the kiss, he shut me down by saying I'm too perfect to be wasted on someone like him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe actual update- The next day I went to work, he pretended last night never happened, I was freaking out cause I wanted to have the talk but didn't want to push it. Had the talk anyway and now we're together. We opened up about a lot of things. He had no idea why I ran away when I found out about the incident. He thought I knew about his injuries and didn't want him like that. I haven't spoken about my friend with anyone but a therapist, I finally told him and he understood. He said he was jumping from relationship to relationship to numb his feeling for me cause he thought I would never be able to love him back. The night I tried to make the move, it was the kiss itself that freaked him out. Turns out that sexy cheeky slightly crooked smile is nerve damage and an ex told him he's the worst kisser in the world. He's not. He's also brilliant in bed. In that one night we became closer than in the past 7 years. And I told him acting like my housewife/babysitter won't fly no more and he toned it down but he still pampers me to an extent. Right now we're like teenagers, glued at the lips, making up for lost time. He was my best friend for so long and I know he's the one for me. This felt like a relationship for months before it even started, now I got the good stuff on top of the perfect partnership we already had. So people, talk to your loved ones ffs! We wasted years beating around the bush, learn from our mistakes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR- Communication is vital. Don't be like us, talk to the people you love, no matter how hard it is. Yes, he was that insecure. We're together now and we're making up for lost time. We will work on our issues together.",

Early on in our friendship I asked him if he was interested in being more than friends. He said no, but it turned out that he was just insecure (I would learn later). Two years later we \\*finally\\* got together after a story similar to yours, minus the \"disfigurement\". The first night we got together we were already talking marriage. We've been together now for 13 years, we have 2 kids, and have the best relationship of anyone I know because we are truly friends first. Congrats! Sounds like you're in the same boat.",

At some point they fall for each other, already having been best friends and already bonded in a way that many romantic couples still haven't experienced even by the time talk of marriage (or some other huge step) comes up. Yes, I like that sort of story a lot. \n\nIt can't be reproduced by anyone else wondering how to find the right person. It cannot be planned. And yet when it happens, it tends to work out wonderfully since you already know the person sooooo well. You didn't go into it trying to impress each other without even knowing each other (as is the case with so very many relationships). You didn't commit before even knowing what or who you were committing to. \n\nIt's just lovely. <3 Good for you both.",

I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t reply to every comment, reply, or PM that I got, but I woke up to a locked post and over 100 unread messages. I promise, I did read through every one of them. Each perspective was incredibly helpful and made me look at the situation in a completely different way. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. \n\nI spoke to Max this morning. I told him that as terrible as I feel for Caroline, I don\u2019t want him living over there until February. I suggested that we brainstorm some sort of schedule that allowed him to continue visiting her, even postponing our honeymoon and using that money to fund his plane tickets. Several commenters brought up her moving over here for treatment, so I mentioned that as well, offering up our spare bedroom. I emphasised that I didn\u2019t fault him for wanting to help an old loved one in what could be her final days, but that I couldn\u2019t help but feel marginalised, especially so close to our wedding. \n\nMax didn\u2019t speak very much, just listened while I rambled on. When I couldn\u2019t think of anything else to add, I asked him to please say something. \n\nSo he told me the truth: Caroline was never stage 4. She was stage 2. \n\nHe assured me that the rest of his story is true. Caroline asking him to be with her, the initial surgery being unsuccessful, her chemo treatment plan, etc. But apparently her chances of survival are *far* greater than he led me to believe. \n\nMax said he lied because he felt it was the only way I could understand his need to be with her. He thought that if her situation seemed less dire than literal life-or-death, I wouldn\u2019t agree to him essentially moving across the country for her. \n\nHe admitted to telling her that our wedding had been postponed to next August, giving her the impression that him being away until February would be no problem. He has also been the one insisting on remaining by her side. After her surgery, she had given him permission to return home, saying that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to pressure him into living with her throughout her entire chemo treatment, as much as she would have liked him there. He refused to leave. He told her that I supported this decision fully. \n\nMax swears that he\u2019s not in love with her still, but I just can\u2019t believe that. He lied to my face. Before she visited our apartment back in May, he warned me not to mention her being stage 4 as she was still \u201cextremely sensitive about it.\u201d  And I completely bought into that lie. I trusted him. \n\nHe put his past with her over his future with me. I\u2019ll be spending the next few months apartment hunting and cancelling wedding plans. \n\nThank you all for your kind words. \n\n**tl;dr: Confronted fiance. He misrepresented his ex-wife\u2019s illness so that he could spend time with her. It\u2019s over.**\n\n*Edit:* I'm blown away by the outpouring of support I'm receiving. I wish I could respond to each of you individually. Thank you so, so much. This is a wonderful community, and I truly appreciate all of your thoughts. ",

Maybe you should let her know what happened, and thank her for being reasonable with it but that your ex-fiance was being a dick.

Your lying, probably cheating ex-fiance does not deserve the same.\n\nPlease don't let this make you too calloused, or too cynical.  There are plenty of men out there with whom you can have the awesome relationship you deserve.  Best of luck OP.",

And she should not be asking him to come to her aid. Its pretty shitty of her to do that and shitty of him to jump to her call and lie to you. Both of them have little consideration for anyone but each other and to that end, they deserve each other. She has family and she needs to reach out to them, not her ex. He has a right to support her, but not in a way that causes him to put his life with you on hold. He's too emotionally involved and that spells trouble. ",

Max was an ass and if I were in your position I'd be sure to inform the ex-wife what he was doing, if she has any sense she'll send him on his way too and he can be alone like he deserves.\n\nTake care of yourself.

He knew what he was doing wasn't a good thing and that you would never have agreed to such an arrangement had he told you the truth.  He played on your good nature and your sympathies to get what he wanted.  It wouldn't surprise me in the least if he did this to see if he could rekindle the relationship with her.   Good on you for breaking it off with him.  Since he lied to you about this god only knows what else he would lie to you about.  I know your heartbroken, but know this one thing please.  It's a good thing that you found this out now, before you made a lifelong commitment to this man.  It's much harder and way more expensive to get a divorce than to just merely break up.  I've been there and done that.  Too bad I didn't have this kind of wake up call before I married my ex husband.  Thankfully we had no kids or shared property so the divorce wasn't complicated and I didn't have to have any further contact with the ex once the papers were signed.  ",

It is a lie, it is not reality, you can not understand a situation if you do not know the truth. But you know the truth, fortunately you are not as susceptible to delusion as strongly as he is. I can understand acting out irrationally because of being very emotional but when one goes to such lengths of absurdity to defend lying to the two women you love most it's difficult to empathize.

Him lying to you about all this is fucked up.\n\nUnfortunately, major issues like divorce and cancer fuck people up. Those aren't easy things to deal with and he's probably dealing with all kinds of weird fucked up emotions.\n\nI'm going through a divorce and we want nothing to do with each other, BUT I still have a soft spot for her. If she were to go through something like that, part of me would hurt deeply and desperately want to help her. I would probably find dormant feelings that I didn't know existed anymore.\n\nIt doesn't excuse his behavior and know this must be painful, but the very dim silver lining is that none of this happened AFTER the wedding.

Some places may let you. If not, either throw a \"Fuck The Wedding\" party, or see if somehow you can donate the space to someone else. Finally, I want to tell you to not let this douchenozzle break you. You're not an idiot for trusting someone that you had every reason to trust. Don't let him destroy your ability to trust or your faith in love. If it means anything, this internet stranger is rooting for you! You seem like a very kind, intelligent woman.

I really was giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one because it sounded like such a heartfelt thing to do. I'm so sorry this happened to you and it sucks that he lied but it is actually good that all this went down before you married him. Imagine contemplating divorce right now on top of all this. At least you can make a clean break and a new start while he's playing house across the country. \n\n"

I told him that I feel like she's undermining our relationship. I gave him a few examples of the stuff she said and done that I didn't appreciate. He still doesn't think she's into him. He's convinced that she's acting this way because she probably feels like they're drifting apart as friends because he's in a serious relationship now. Which frustrated me a little tbh because its clear to me that she wants him but being subtle about it.\n\nHe said that regardless of her intentions, if her actions are making me uncomfortable. He'll have a talk with her about it. I was really happy he said that, because I was really nervous and anxious to see how he'll react. I was afraid he'll take her side.\n\nHe can be a dummy sometimes so I was worried that he'd bring it up with her in the wrong way. Like saying \"my girlfriend doesnt want us talking anymore\" and stuff like that but he nailed it. He told her in a text \"Dude, I noticed some of the stuff you've been saying in front of my girlfriend lately and I've been wanting to talk to you about it. It's mad disrespectful and uncomfortable. We're cool, but just stop that s\\*\\*t\". Naturally, she acted all innocent and confused. She was like \"what? you know I'd never do anything that would upset you\" \"I think you're misunderstanding\" and stuff like that. He doubled down on it though.\n\nI could tell he felt somewhat guilty telling her off like that and I don't know if he's convinced that she's trying to undermine our relationship or not, but I'm so glad that he had my back in this. I'm honestly kind of glad this whole thing happened. It gave me a better idea of what kind of man he really is. He even said he'll stop hanging out with her alone if it makes me feel uncomfortable. He was also, lowkey mad at me for waiting this long to tell him I was uncomfortable around her.\n\nSafe to say that the best possible outcome happened. He really put her in her place and ngl it made me feel real good. All I could think of was \"I WON!!!\" lmao. Thanks to everyone for encouraging me to tell him because even though I knew that's what I should have done I was still scared to do it for some reason. I even thought about potentially just avoiding her for good. Which sounds ridiculous now that I think about it, because I shouldn't have to hide from her. I guess I'm just not good at confrontations.\n\nThanks for the helpful advice everyone.\n\nTLDR: I told my boyfriend that his friend's actions were making me uncomfortable because she's clearly into him and she's undermining our relationship. He let her know that she has to stop and totally had my back during the whole thing. All and all everything turned out pretty great. Thanks to everyone for the great advice.",

            "I was dating a guy with a nightmare best friend. I thought she was into him. But I think she was just in the \"girlfriend space\" for so long because he had been single so long, that she was having a hard time adjusting to a new person in his life. He also had horrible boundaries. We ended up fighting pretty bad, and I said some mean things that were personal and went beyond what she did. She took the high road and apologized which shocked me. I'd never had someone admit they'd done wrong before. I apologized as well and we actually got close after that. Maybe it's a similar situation for you and will end up better in the long run I hope. Either way. That's good that your partner has your back. Regardless of her intentions or feelings, it's her behavior that is out of line.",

I do have to say that whenever longtime friends introduce someone each other is dating that there\u2019s friends are A little protective of their friend, so I do think on some level she just wants to make sure her friend doesn\u2019t get his heart broke, which typically makes people a little defensive or aggressive trying to weed out poor partners.

            "I had a situation with my SO, his best girlfriend would text all the time, send memes, they had a big group chat all there other friends talked in.  NO Big deal I\u2019m a secure over 40 women.  But whenever I was around she never acknowledged me, I\u2019d say Hello no response.  On a couple different occasions she would come to my home(we weren\u2019t living together at the time) say Hello to mutual friend of hers and my SO and act like I wasn\u2019t there.  We went out to watch a band (pre COVID) in a bar she had him order her drinks because he knows what she likes.  Another night she was at my home again we were all babbling around the fires not a word was spoken about politics she opened her mouth we had opposing views.  I asked to change the subject,  she refused.  Everyone in our party didn\u2019t like her views and started to leave.  That was straw that broke the camels back!  Had a little toe to toe with her about her views, normally I was cordial with her.  Went in the house and didn\u2019t come back outside to the fire.  When my boyfriend came in I gave him examples of what she says and does, and he even asked mutual friends if they noticed which they did.  He respected me and now keeps her at arms length and doesn\u2019t talk to her as much as he had.  Mind you she is married with three kids.  But he had been the constant fun guy in her life since before high school.  My SO needed to understand I\u2019m not going to say don\u2019t ever talk to her again!

It sounds like there is definitely a chance she has feelings, but it also sounds like she was a great friend to him through a tragedy. There is definitely a strong bond from that type of thing. I think it\u2019s reasonable to question their relationship and speak with him about your concerns, but not be happy that you \u201cwon\u201d. Sounds super toxic. You are pretty young... you will hopefully learn through more experience that a good relationship is formed around trust. Trust you partner, and you will be happier.",
            "I don't know. Sounds to me like what you're describing in your last post, and this post, is a good friend that's insecure about drifting apart when a girlfriend comes in the picture, not necessary someone who wants him. I agree she's obviously viewing your bond as some sort of threat to her bond to him, but that doesn't mean she wants him for herself and is moving in on him. If that were the case, she could've moved in on him long before you were in the picture but it honestly sounds like it's the emotional closeness that she's had with her friend, that she's afraid of losing.\nAs the new girlfriend, it's normal that this rattles your feathers, but I'd still recommend you try to step back a little and do your best to avoid drawing conclusions. At the end of the day, it's not a competition. He chose you as his girlfriend, after having been her friend for years. You don't need to be worried.",
            "I was the boyfriend in this situation a few years ago.\n\nBoth my girlfriend and bestie we're pissing me off because they couldn't play nice / couldn't give me solid reason to hate each other. Bestfriend was \"you never have time for me anymore\" and girlfriend was like \"she's into you\" meanwhile she had years to act on that so defffff not.\n\nUltimately, I had to cut the friend because her reasoning wasn't \"just my girlfriend\" -- I'd also graduated, got a full time job, so I had way less time for everyone (and gf was priority for free time). IMO worked out choosing girlfriend because in hindsight the friendship wasn't that valuable (just being the ear for her to whine about boys being douches) and I'm still with the same lovely girl as my partner.",

            "I have a bff that is a dude and we're very close.  Like sending gifts to each other and talking daily even if it is for 2 seconds. I would never come between him and another girl.  Never have, never will. Even when I wasn't dating anyone (just got married in January).  However, when I knew a girl wasn't good for him or was using him or something like that, I put my foot down with him and told him how I felt.  My husband used to get jealous because we are perverted and my bff thinks I'm attractive but he respects my husband as long as my husband is treating me right.  \n\nThat being said, no man will come between me and him and no woman will come between him and me.  He saved my life.  I owe him my life.  He was once talking to a woman he was interested in and telling him about our friend group.  He told her that no woman would come between us no matter how he felt about her.  She basically told him \"bet.\" And he put her in her place then and there.\n\nIt is very possible for two people of the opposite sex to be friends.  I was with OP til she said she felt like she won.  If you are right and she did have a thing for your bf and she was undermining your relationship, I'm glad your bf said something.  However, if she was just his friend who helped him through one of the worst things to happen in his life, you may have successfully ruined a great friendship that was in no ways a competition for your relationship just so you could win, that makes you a terrible person.",
            "Okay. So..... what do you mean, \"do.\" Why would you do anything.",
            "OP, I was in a similar situation but with flipped genders (me a guy, my ex-girl, and her best friend) and an opposite outcome.\n\nWhat made my situation different was that the guy friend in question had a history of going after girls that were 'taken'.  My girl I was with at the time had a history of sleeping with her friends when things were a bit rocky with her current boyfriend.\n\nPutting the above aside, I was pretty happy my girl had him in her life - somebody to go to the gym with, spend time with outside of work, improve her mental health, etc.\n\nHowever, there were a few times which seriously hurt my feelings, including:\n\n* she would share my personal insecurities about myself with her best guy friend;\n* she and her guy friend were a lot more emotionally close together than I was with her;\n* she trusted him a lot more to be there for her over me; and\n* she expressly said that if it came down to it, she would choose him over me (this is unprompted - I didn't ask her).\n\nOne time she got drunk and passed out, she was in an inappropriate position with her head on his crotch.  He smirked at me when I saw this.  He also groped her infront of me.\n\nI brought up my feelings to her and all I did was ask her to hold space for and prioritise  my feelings - I didn't tell her I wanted to spend less time with her friend.  I also never did anything like check her phone or where she was - I trusted her.\n\nShe responded by telling me that I was paranoid, insecure or that my feelings weren't valid.  She kept prioritising hanging out with him which clearly indicated to me that she didn't care much for our relationship.  I was distraught for a while and my self-confidence was absolutely shattered..  After a year of therapy, I felt a lot better.\n\nI'm happy to see what normal, healthy couples look like and I'm glad you didn't have to go through what I did!",
            "The people commenting here about the \"I won\" have clearly never been put in that position.

Everyone keeps saying we're gonna get back together (we were together for 9 years and have been friends since grade 6) but we are both very well aware that it will NEVER happen and i cant stress that enough.\n\nWe also dont sleep together which doesnt complicate anything or make anything weird.\n\nWe have great chemistry when it comes to joking around and having fun, which makes people think other things, but we just arent made for each other in a loving, sexual relationship kind of way.",

When she'd say disrespectful things and I'd express my feelings, my boyfriend would brush it off. Finally he agreed to say something...except this is basically what he said to her: \"My girlfriend felt some type of way about what you said. But you didn't mean it that way, right?\" I wanted to smack him for that.  \ud83d\ude44 \n\nWhen she kept doing it, I told him it pissed me off, and he flipped out and decided to block her on every possible platform to appease me. But it didn't, because he never told her why. So she's constantly texting his brother and asking him to tell my boyfriend to message her back. And my boyfriend refuses to unblock her and tell her what the problem was to begin with, because he 1) still doesn't see an issue with how she spoke to me/about us, and 2) doesn't want to seem like the bad guy, and would prefer to blame me, like he did with the first \"talk\" with her.\n\nIt's so frustrating and I can't make him see the light, and he's 5 years older than your boyfriend! I'm glad your boyfriend addressed the situation properly and it all worked out!

Is that it? \nBasically, you are jealous of a girl who is too afraid to act on what you think are some feelings she's had for your boyfriend. And even if those feelings were true, you don't trust him.\nOne question. Would you give up a friendship with a guy friend who your boyfriend might be jealous of just because he told you to without blaming him?\nAm I crazy for thinking it's not ok for you to choose his friends or who he hungs up with?

That's good and I hope things will go on smoothly with you guys.\n\nI read your previous post and it reminded me of how my husband's (then bf) ex used to behave around him when we started dating. My husband remained a good friend with his ex when we started dating and I had no issue with it.\n\nI even hung out with her and thought she was great in the beginning. I actually liked her otherwise. But after she kept popping up when we're going out (on dates) and said the things she said (similar to your bf's friend), like I'm this 'newcomer' and I knew nothing about my bf and other snide things, even to tips on how to pleasure my bf (now husband), it got really weird. I didn't mind at first, but she became snider so I had to say something to my bf (now husband). \n\nI didn't know if it's because she still had feelings for my partner or what. My husband chose me though in the end. He didn't see any value in continuing friendship with her (and she did other really malicious things to him after he told her to cool it with her comments toward me).",

            "Managing friendships with the opposite sex while in a healthy relationship take work. Recognizing and bringing up improper actions to your partner should not be met by hostility, blame shifting, or denial. It is great your boyfriend validated your feelings in the end and called out his longtime female friend. You never told him to cut all contact, but that he needed to have a blunt conversation with her. His friend may not have been aware of what she was consciously doing because your relationship with him is a threat to their friendship/closeness.  If she is a good person and didn't really intend on causing the rifts, she may apologize to you. She may not because she is embarrassed. You can just continue to be watchful of her actions, but at least you know your BF has your back. He spoke his peace with her and set boundaries, so that is good for your relationship. You don't end up the villain in this situation, and you won the \"battle\" for your man, even if the other woman claims not to realize what she was doing because she may have been denying her own feelings for your BF for a looooong time. If she tries to get snarky with you again, you just can smile and say \"Snooze you lose, chick\" ;)",
            "Great on him! He still needs to cut her out though. She does not have his best interests in mind. In her mind he is the \u201cjust-in-case-no-else-works-out\u201d option.

Because he had to be forced, not voluntarily like your man. It had caused me such resentment between us and I hated him for it, but I\u2019m glad you went through a happy and positive experience.

I felt I was going crazy or maybe conjuring up what felt like animosity. I must have asked 20 or more times if they had a history I didn\u2019t know about. \n\nWhen I finally told my boyfriend how I felt about her and my thoughts on their friendship lacking serious boundaries he spoke to her about it and she threw a temper tantrum. And really showed herself. The things I saw my partner began to see because she didn\u2019t have access to him and his resources anymore. He never withdrew his friendship but it became clear that outside his stuff and of course this need to have great power and influence in his life, she didn\u2019t care.",
            "good for you and a good lesson learned, OP! you can trust your boyfriend enough to talk about something that makes you uncomfortable and he\u2019ll be an adult and address it. in the future, if something is bothering you, just talk about it right away. letting things stew can end up with feelings of resentment toward your partner, with the partner not even knowing why you\u2019re upset.",
            "I remember your original post. It resonated with me because I went through something really similar. My husband had a longtime female friend who crossed boundaries. It was super obvious to me that she liked him, but he just could not see it. Whenever we interacted, I got a really nasty vibe from her. She would say things and imply that she knew my husband longer and better and that they'd done things I wouldn't be happy to hear about. Finally, it was driving me crazy and I did the same thing as you. I had to tell him how I felt. I tried to be her friend, but I wish I'd just addressed this sooner. The next time she called, he confronted her about it and she's blocked us now, so thankfully we don't have to worry about her anymore. I'm so thankful it worked out for you.

He handled this really well: reinforce that for him. This is absolutely the best outcome here, and he was prepared to go even further and stop hanging out with her if you wanted. Mad respect to him. And good on you for facing your fears and talking to him about it.

And you're amazing for not wanting to separate them until she became fastidious, and even after, you were mature enough to let them continue being friends as long as she respected.\nI say this because I had been the friend. I had this male bff, and we were inseparable. We had nicknames (not exactly pet names) for each other, but we were never ever interested romantically on each other. Hell, I was his wingman, I introduced him to girls, all his girlfriends were awesome with me, and it was cool. Until he met this girl he's married to now. I really dislike her because she never gave me a chance. She just saw me and was upset, and then he told me she didn't like me calling him his nickname, I was ok, let's all 3 get together so she knows nothing would happen. She didn't want. He went with me one time to Ihop and she called him while he was driving, \"is she on my seat?\"  He was like well, she won't be in the back like if this was a taxi, and she was furious. He ghosted me. I was heartbroken because he was my best friend and I expected him to defend me as I had done nothing wrong. And he was the type of man that thinks they can't be told what to do. Well, she did. Just like that he threw our friendship in the trash. I didn't communicate because I though that he wasn't worth it as a friend then and I would cause issues if I contacted him. I saw him a couple of years back in the supermarket, he was trying to hug me, she was there, so I stood back and said, no, don't want any misunderstandings. He told me they were married. I said congratulations and left with my heart hurt because we had made the promise that I'd be his best man and he my maid of honor. So it can suck both ways.",

Even if the person doesn't act on it, it's really awkward and uncomfortable for the person who's in a relationship with the person who has a platonic friend with a crush.

There are a few rare examples but 90% of the time men are friends with attractive females and its not because of their unique personality I'll just say that... When I'm in a serious relationship I will tell my female friends that I am going to be not around is much because I am going to focus on my girlfriend and out of respect for my relationship I don't need to be so close to other women.  If you are serious about a relationship being very close to the opposite sex will only cause harm think of all successful marriages in how many of those men are best friends with other women? Zero and thags because they are serious about their relationship.... Saying you should hold him to the same standards as a husband but if he does want what's best for the relationship he really shouldn't be hanging out with other girls especially if their very attractive which usually all guys have are attractive female friends because guys rarely have friends they don't find attractive. May I suggest that you don't try to boss him around or say what he can or can't do but try saying something like this \n\n\"Baby our relationship means the world to me and you are my #1 and I would step back from any guy I was very close to to make sure our relationship has the most fertile environment to become as strong as possible. And out of respect for the man I love I would never invite or create a situation that could put doubt in his mind if If it's something I could avoid. And it would mean alot to me if we could work on this together.

And you two can discuss what those boundaries need to be and come to a conclusion that works best for the two of you. I wish you the best of luck sweetheart.

I felt guilty for even going even though I did nothing wrong. \n\n\nI blocked her and we haven't talked now in maybe a year and a half. And honestly I feel guilty as she really was a good Freind.

(I would flirt with my friends as a joke but he never once mentioned that he was uncomfortable with it and instead he did the same thing with his), I can't remember whether we broke up or not but our relationship ended that year.
