        "selftext": " \n\nHere's the link to my original post here : [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j7ftmw/boyfriend_has_stopped_being_romantic_completely/)   \nBut the TL:DR : Boyfriend (18M) has completely stopped flirting with me(18F) and I'm not sure if I'm being needy while he's at school and how I should approach him about the issue.\n\nI just want to say thank you to the original people who commented and reached out to me, I was very emotional at the time and needed some sense talked into me.\n\nThat day I made the post, I was supposed to hang out with my friend and her friends, so I had sat down with them and asked for advice. They basically said the same thing everyone here did and I guess seeing their in-person reaction to me explaining everything that had happened made it click that something was really wrong. After getting over my fears of me being right, I asked him if he still wanted to be with me. While he didn't say no, he said he enjoyed his newfound independence from school and not having to worry about anyone else. This confirmed what I already knew and I knew he wouldn't directly say he didn't want to be with me anymore, but I still got my answer in a way. While I'm hurt, I think I had already grieved the relationship during it, since I spent a lot of time crying and wondering what had happened between us. At least now I can move on instead of holding onto every small sign that he might still like me.\n\nI wish he could have just been up front sooner, and just told me he didn't want a relationship when I kept trying to flirt or be romantic instead of just ignoring those moments, as it just left me confused, and I wish I could have avoided this completely but I suppose it's a lesson learned. I deserve someone who's going to reciprocate my feelings and affection, so I'm excited to see what happens now. Thank you guys for the kind words and advice.",

Being direct is so important and saves so much pain in the long run, even if the experience isn\u2019t pleasant (aka is devastatingly sad) when it\u2019s happening. You\u2019re better off and you\u2019ll be just fine. Be gentle with yourself and focus on self-care and having talks with friends or finding little distractions.",
            "One lesson I wish I had learned earlier in life (I\u2019m 36 and happily married now) was that if a relationship is \u201cconfusing\u201d it\u2019s not working. When in a happy functional relationship you won\u2019t feel confused. People are often cowards when it comes to breakups. They are afraid to hurt your feelings so instead they lie and conceal how they feel which ends up being even more painful. That\u2019s why you feel confused. Realizing this will make it a lot easier to know when to move on in the future and probably save a lot of heartache <3",
            "It's a coward's breakup. Act distant and unavailable until she breaks up with you. I've definitely been on the receiving end of it, and it shows someone way too immature to be in a relationship.",

I hope you reach out to your support system during this time, and you might even want to seek a few sessions of counseling, just to help you work through it. \u2764\ufe0f Hang in there.",

They barely talked to me for a month, and after weeks of having to beg for basic attention and constantly worrying that I was being too needy, they dumped me over text :/ \n\nIt really hurts to not get even basic respect at the end of a relationship, but don\u2019t let it mess with your self esteem. You can and will do better! Go enjoy your new freedom now that this coward isn\u2019t holding you back \ud83d\udc9c",

Your grief over being treated like that is completely valid.\n\nI did want to say that getting to a place in my life where I was with someone who I could trust not to do that to me was an amazing feeling. I promise you will come out of this stronger. I\u2019m so sorry that it happened to you.",

It must have hurt, but it's for the best. As least you don't have to suffer from his mixed signals anymore. Stay strong! It might not be easy, considering you've done so much for him, but you can get through it and move on. Don't be too hard on yourself,, it's not your fault. Do what makes you feel better, like eat tubs of ice cream or something hahaha. I hope you overcome this like a queen!! Take care!!",
            "Boys never know what they want and what they have until its gone. Good for you for getting out of that relationship, you don't deserve to be treated that way. Please don't be hurt over why he did the 180 flip on you, it's not because you're not good enough. It's because he's not mature enough to realize you are. \n\nEvery single guy I've dated under 23 has done a 180 flip on me after being extremely sweet to me for a period of time. Some dudes just can't deal with commitment and usually they happen to be younger- sorry but it's true :( I'm sure there are genuinely nice and mature boys out there, but I haven't met one and don't plan on dating boys ever again as I have luckily met someone who truly loves me and hasn't suddenly woke up one day and told me that commiting to a relationship is too much.",
            "Seems like I need to take all these advices.",
            "This is what men do instead of actually breaking up with someone. It\u2019s like ghosting but they think they aren\u2019t being an jerk because they are still technically talking to you. He is hoping you will just stop messaging him because then it will\nBe like you broke up with him. Some men. Not all of course.",
            "Oh man I wish I saw your original post. I was in a relationship like yours for far too long. He started ignoring me on anniversaries but I thought it was just him being depressed or something. Turns out he was as checked out as I was, so we split. After 2 days of crying about being on my own again u began embracing it. I was liberated and traveled with friends and made time to care for myself, not do another person's laundry. Now I'm dating the man I plan to marry and we're currently looking at houses. Everything will work itself out. Stay strong and lean on your friends if you need to.",
            "good for you. you\u2019re still young and have all the opportunity in the world to find someone worth your while. he sounds very immature if he can\u2019t even handle being upfront and honest about how he feels in a relationship. you dodged a bullet hun , best of luck \u2764\ufe0f",

            "Girl, you deserve way better. I read your original post and him telling you \u201cyou should just kill yourself\u201d - WTF??? Never settle for someone who treats you the way he does - find a man who supports you and loves you for who you are (and vice versa).\n\nAlso glad to hear you are working out; I find it to be truly a great confidence booster! Keep building that confidence and practicing self-love! Your future is bright!",

            ">I wish he could have just been up front sooner, and just told me he didn't want a relationship when I kept trying to flirt or be romantic instead of just ignoring those moments,\n\nGirl, I have SO been there! It\u2019s easy to give yourself permission to keep trying when they don\u2019t explicitly tell you to stop. A better man would probably have handled the situation better. But he\u2019s young and still learning, too. The bottom line is that you must take responsibility for your own wellbeing.",
            "1.  \"I spent a lot of time crying and wondering what had happened between us\" -  sometimes things don't work out. It's nothing you or he did wrong. it's just not right.  This is really hard when both people are good people and it needs to end as neither one want to hurt the other.  It is important to reflect on it, to learn, and to grow.\n2. I was in a similar relationship where he'd be very active on the phone and sending me silly memes and then when we'd hang out he'd refuse to touch me, hug me and basically acted weird.  This got progressively worse and then he started bailing on dates and plans...the worst being one time when he went gambling and missed a dinner with my parents....he wanted to stay over when he was finished and said something like \"if you wanted something, you should have shown up when you promised, not 6 hours after a game of poker.\"  Later on, it turned out that he'd been video chatting another woman (who he's no married too, no joke) but it all started with lack of affection. To this day, he still tries to pull sway with me and many of my close friends.   \n3. Be assertive moving forward and make you sentiments vocal.  You deserve a relationship where you can be honest about your feelings and needs and vice versa.",
            "Ugh. People like this are awful for not just wasting your time but wasting your heart and affection. Onto bigger and better things!",
            "I\u2019m sorry. Y\u2019all are still so young and it takes a lot of time to get the communication thing right. You deserve better. Some good lessons I learned were: Don\u2019t settle for anything. If things start feeling wrong speak up and if the other person dismisses your feelings, leave that\u2019s a red flag. Even if they don\u2019t agree you can still talk about it together.",
            "Sending virtual hugs. It\u2019s so tough being that age and being involved that way. I am so proud of you for coming to this realization and being mature enough to walk away and know you deserve better. YOU GO GIRL <3",

            "One of my guy friends explained this type of break up strategy to me where one party does what your (ex)bf was doing to you. I immediately understood how often this had happened to me. Pretty sure I told him how fucked up that was. Pretty sure he still does it to people.",
            "Holy cow he's a coward and to just let you do all the labor of worrying is so trashy. Good riddance. Take care of yourself, and congrats on losing the deadweight \ud83d\udc97",
            "that\u2019s a red flag and honestly your bf is a coward for not talking to you about anything he is feeling or not feeling. flirting should never stop in either end it keeps the romance alive, and if he doesn\u2019t feel the \u201cspark\u201d in the relationship anymore he should simply talk to you and maybe the 2 of you break up OR work on things to fix things. regardless communication and talking to one another is key.",
            "you\u2019re better than me because i would\u2019ve just moved on as if he never existed, since he wanted to ignore you whenever he was in town. you were quite generous to give him the privilege of closure & talking it out.\n\nmight sound childish, but indifference is a drink best serviced ice fucking cold. nothing hurts worse than being ignored & uncared for.",
            "Lots of guys are like this. While the truth sucks it\u2019s so much easier to get it.",
            "I'm so sorry the outcome wasn't what you were hoping for, I wish I'd had even an ounce of the emotional maturity you appear to have at 18.\nYou deserve so much better, your former boyfriend didn't have the decency to be upfront with you and probably hoped things would just fizzle out.\nYou are going to make an amazing partner to whoever is lucky enough to come into your life. As the old saying goes 'you have to kiss a few frogs until you find your prince'\nBest of luck to you.",
            "This happened to me two years ago when I was your age too and I'm now happier than I've ever been in a relationship with a wonderful guy. Know that you've got so many years ahead of you and you sound lovely. I'm sure guys will be falling head over heels for you so yes girl get excited for the future!",
            "Being direct and open is absolutely crucial. As a guy I can vouch that most of us are idiots and will never pick up on and sorts of hints. Odds are he isn\u2019t doing this on purpose but rather he\u2019s just busy and his energy is being distributed to a lot of different places rn.",
            "Sounds like ghosting.  When I was 21, I did worse in a relationship by outright cheating (which I regret), but it seems like he wants to be single but wants you to break up with him.  Sounds like he just wants out but wants you to dump him first.  Spring the trap and dump him, he obviously is neither attracted nor respectful.  You deserve someone who will be more mature than that.",
            "you also deserve someone with the emotional maturity to be able to say when they want to break up, to continue the vibe from your last paragraph. \n\nthanks for posting your update and hang in there! i heard on a podcast once that only 15% of humanity (at most, since not everyone would admit it in a survey) manages to avoid heartbreak - and most of those are people who are in one serious relationship their whole life. think of all the love songs you've ever heard - and realize that even rock stars get their heart broken. it feels inevitable for us ordinary folks. \n\nwhen i got older and looked back on my relationships i remembered them almost entirely positively - even the ones that ended poorly.",
            "Can I ask a completely irrelevant and off topic question? You mentioned he was nasty and discouraging regarding what you are going to school for. May I ask what it is you are going for? \n\nI'm just curious. \n\nI'm glad you are able to now move on! No one deserves to feel unwanted or undesired!",
            "Sometimes... guys are really dumb. I had a similar experience when I was in High School, I was dating this guy for about a year when he ended up changing close to out 1 year anniversary. He didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore, and he stopped being affectionate and romantic as well. And it left me in a bad spot emotionally. We finally broke up about 2 months after our first year anniversary, and when we were both in a better place I asked him why he didn't just be upfront with me about it, he said that he didn't want to hurt me, so he didn't want to break up because that's what it would do. I told him it hurt much more that he was essentially forcing himself to stay with me and he apologized. Sometimes guys just kinda think like that. Idk why",
            "User name checks out",
            "What a coward!! I\u2019m glad you got your answers and can finally move on from his silly ass",
            "I stumbled upon this thread by accident and I was so incensed by this asshole thankfully ex boyfriend that I signed up. Never get into anything again with someone like this- his initial personality wasn't his true self- his real side came out with the withdrawal and destructive comments. As soon as you see that- run! Someone like this will eventually break your spirit. He is disgusting with the kill yourself comment-I wouldn't say that to an enemy- feel sorry for the next person he cons. Only ever go for someone who you have chemistry with who is kind, fun, mutually supportive and be in a relationship where you genuinely try to make eachother happy.",
            "This happened to me a few years ago. My first real relationship lasted about two and a half years. And for the last 4 months he didn't really want anything to do with me. Not mention he knew he didn't want to be with me but he had my buy a $400 plane ticket from WA to PA so we could visit his family and then told me he didn't want me to come a few days before and that he would not refund my money. We were both assholes, mainly I just hope both of us have grown up more since then.",
            "Stay strong , we're proud of you sis",
            "When you\u2019re reflecting on this, PLEASE be your biggest champion for continuing to put yourself out there with him and making the effort. I feel like so many people do this, get burned and then close themselves off in the next relationship. You continued to put forth the effort and for that you should be proud of yourself. When you find that special person soon, you\u2019ll know it will be worth it.",
            "Hun that boy ain\u2019t shit \n\nI\u2019m only a few years older than you but you got a lot of the world to see especially if you\u2019re still in high school. \n\nTo be honest, when I got to college I was still taking to my highschool summer fling and one week into school I told him I didn\u2019t have the same feelings anymore. \n\nHe was wrong for beating around the bush and telling you to off yourself. \n\nHe couldn\u2019t grow a pair and break up with you. He\u2019s trash babe\n\nI wish you the best!",
            "Good riddance to him. He was trash. Girl, you deserve better. Much better than that.",
            "I'm glad you got your answer, I'm kinda annoyed at how indirect he was tho",
            "You do deserve better op seriously! That was not the best way for him to break up with you quite cowardly tbh but look everything happens for a reason, also look on the bright side you're finally free from the torment and the anguish you had due to this, just know that it's not gonna rain forever, if you need to go get therapy go for it, but yeah just know you are valuable and worth it op, don't ever let anyone make you feel like you aren't. Hope in time your wounds heal take all the time you need before you find someone else. Best of luck!",
            "Girl, good for you.  I stayed in a relationship similar to this for 6 months.  We hung out, but only because I asked. He  said multiple times to my face he rather be somewhere else.  I always thought something was wrong with me, but there wasn't.  It was him.",
            "Are you literally me omg this happened to me too!!! I spent so many times crying too but it gets better once you don\u2019t have to care about what someone is thinking anymore. Boys are such terrible communicators, but once you find one that wants to, it\u2019ll be so great :) hope you\u2019re doing well!",

            "Sigh OP, I know this all too well and was the reason of my last break up with my college boyfriend of two years. I wasn\u2019t as strong as you were to end things and I admit I let the relationship drag on too long  to the point where it has really fucked up my self esteem and view of love.

Randomly, she said \u201cI love you\u201d, and explained how grateful she was to be with me. She told me I was making it a lot easier to grieve her brother\u2019s death, and she wouldn\u2019t know what to do without me. She said I was the best boyfriend she could ever wish for and my company alone was helping her tremendously.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe my girlfriend. She'd witnessed her brother die, was still grieving his death and yet could still find the strength in herself to make my day a little better.\n\nI turned soft -- I felt something inside of me\u2026 something I\u2019d never felt before. My eyes started to water. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was going to cry. My girlfriend saw this, and she couldn't believe it either. That was my trigger. I started bawling. For the first time in my life, I cried. I was embarrassed.\n\nShe started crying too, we embraced each other. I cried with her until my tears ran dry. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her because of my lack of empathy. I told her how unfair it was for me to put my emotional distress on her. \n\nMy girlfriend was very receptive. She said it was okay for me to be emotional around her. She said helping me find my lost emotions was the most meaningful thing for her in the world.\n\nMy understanding of life has changed for the better ever since that day. I feel like a *real* human being. I\u2019m able to understand what my girlfriend is going through. It took me 8 months, but I\u2019ve finally started mourning the death of my brother. \n\nMy girlfriend has been a lot happier these last few days. She says it\u2019s a direct result of me finding my emotions. This couldn\u2019t have been possible without her. I'm so grateful to have her be a part of my life. My love and undying gratitude for her can't be translated into words. She's the only woman that gave me a chance after hearing about my \u201ccondition\u201d, and the only one to help me with it. I couldn't ask for more from my girlfriend. I love her. \n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch together. She said she loved me and gave me compliments for being a great boyfriend. My eyes watered and I cried for the first time in my life. I told my girlfriend how afraid I was of losing her. I told her how much I missed my brother. I told her how unfair it was for me to be putting my emotions on her when she's in a time of need. My girlfriend reassured me. She said helping me find my emotions was the most meaningful thing in the world for her. \n\nMy understanding of life has changed since then. I feel like a real person now. Someone who can express the full range of emotions that a normal human should be able to. This all happened because of my girlfriend, I love her so much. I can empathize with what she's going through now, and fully support her in her time of need.",

            "Very happy you\u2019re able to connect with your gf in a meaningful way :)  \n  \n  Just a head\u2019s up, there\u2019s a chance that the reason you haven\u2019t been able to feel things is because something (very possibly the death of your own brother) sent your brain into panic mode where it felt completely overwhelmed by the circumstances and responded by damming up all of your emotions to prevent them from flooding you.  If this is the case, then you finally crying means that dam has broken, and you may find yourself being inundated with very intense versions of emotions you have little experience with.  This can be scary for everyone involved, and it can\u2019t really be stopped, you can only prepare, warn others, and then weather the storm when it hits.  If you start getting disproportionately angry or sad about stuff over the next few months, you might want to talk to a therapist about getting in touch with your emotions.  \n  \n  Wish you both the best of luck with whatever comes next <3",

            "This is such a great update, you have really helped each other out. I\u2019m so glad that you found an important part of yourself and had someone so supportive with you while you went through the experience. Love this post.",
            "Hey OP, I've read both your posts and some of your comments now. If you ever see this, I'd be happy to talk to you about some of the things you will continue to go through. As I read your posts, I related on a level that is extremely uncommon in my experience. I've said some of the same things as you and continue to wonder \"what's wrong with me?\" as I deal with people I care about experiencing loss or grief and can't empathize. Anyway, this is as much a request as it is an offer, because I still deal with this even after I've successfully gone through similar situations and I find it very helpful to talk to people who relate, of which there are very few (again, in my experience).",

Ur doing better than me or maybe my job is trained me to deal with death when it doesn't relate to me. My uncle passed away I unexpectedly about two years ago and I cried like I haven't since I was a kid. Emotions are a strange thing and can be triggered by any experience in life. I'm just glad i found out I'm still human and things affect me. ",

            "I'm going to touch on YOUR grief for a moment. A little personal anecdote-\n\nMy best friend (basically my sister) lost her brother (my dearest friend in the world) to suicide, then just over a year later, another to an overdose. She had no time to process the first before the second, and then her grandma who raised her died. It took a long time for her to finally break, but she did. \n\nEight months isn't that long (in the grand scheme) to go before it catches up. Your girlfriend and you both have been dealt a really shitty situation, and losing her brother was an opportunity for you to start to process your own loss, and to help support her in turn. \n\nIt's good that you (both) aren't pitting one loss against another. I'm glad that your girlfriend was able to see that you had your own loss to process and didn't hold you coping mechanism against you. \n\nI wish you both the best of luck with working through this crap year. Grief doesn't go away, but it becomes livable. ",

No matter what happens between you, this is a really powerful moment and I'm glad you're communicating and supporting each other. ",

            "This is a great update, but I would advise you to consider therapy.\n\nIt's all well and good now, but this could be a tiring \"responsibility\" for your girlfriend as time wears on. If you find yourself relying on her to embrace your inner emotions, that can be a problem. There end up being a lot of posts here from one side of the couple who the other partner relies on for emotional support/mental health, and that ends up being not a great dynamic.\n\nI'm not trying to be negative - I love this update - but this is all new to both of you right now so it seems very positive. But just make sure it doesn't eventually cause more of a strain on what sounds like a really great relationship.",

            "Gah, so it's onion season apparently. \n\nSo I read the original posting and the biggest thing that stuck out to me was the lack of feeling you had regarding the death of your brother/ even at his funeral. This is actually not uncommon as people block out these things as a self defense mechanism and it sometimes can take quite some time to confront these things. It was clear you had good intentions throughout and had actually done some self reflection. It's great that you could finally express how you felt about him which is always the start to the healing process. You and your partner bonding over this is pretty special as well. Happy for you m8.

            "Dude, congratulations on your insight and your fresh connection with your GF.\n\nLife is so much easier when you can laugh and cry at times. When you show your emotions to your SO, you allow her to be there for you as well! And yes, men cry too (it even gets easier when you get older, lol).\n\nShe sounds like a terrific person and i am sure this will only make you both stronger.\n\nCongrats OP!",
            "Something similar happened to me in the past year. My father passed away in July and I turned to my girlfriend for emotional support. She was very much like you, she had trouble empthasizing and showing emotion. She is on the spectrum and simply couldn't help it. However, her just being there whenever I needed and listening to me was absolutely enough. My love for her grew through that difficult time. This has been the worst year of my life and she has made it much more bearable. She is the shining light of my otherwise dark life.",
            "Buddy, that's awesome to hear. I read your original post and hoped that you'd be able to sort out\n\nI've been guilty of bottling up and stamping down my emotions too, and just being that logical, unfeeling robot. \n\nI've never felt so good as I have in the time I've had my girlfriend who, much like yours, has been a supportive receptor for my feelings, even whilst I've been there to help her through tough times as well.\n\nI'm so glad you guys have found this new layer to your relationship. I wish you all the happiness in the world. Give her a big hug from me, and pat yourself on the back. Keep on shining, you pair of diamonds. ",
            "Hey man just so you know, you\u2019re not the only one like that. I saw my brother get hit and killed by a truck when he was 8 years old and I was 10. We were very close and it was the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life.  I don\u2019t ever remember crying since then. I\u2019ve never been depressed in my life and I don\u2019t understand people who are. I love life but I really have no interest in most other people. I feel like I go thru life faking interest when I really just wish people would stay away for the most part. I\u2019m married with kids and my wife has told me many times that I\u2019m emotionally detached. She loves me and most people seem to really like me a lot. More than I want them to in fact and I don\u2019t really get why. I can be a pretty sarcastic asshole I think. Many fairly close people have died in my lifetime and I seem to very easily move on from it. Eerily, just as you said, I\u2019ve thought before that if I was diagnosed with a terminal illness, it wouldn\u2019t really bother me that much. Was interesting to see some of the things you said.",

I hope you learn to embrace your newfound range of emotions, they can be a pain but they're rewarding. \n\nJust know it's okay and normal to be overwhelmed and sad and stressed for days on end. That could take some getting used to if you haven't experienced it your whole life. Anywho, cheers! :D Merry Christmas to you and yours! \\^_^",

        "selftext": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9oqcoa/18_m_my_parents_found_out_i_have_a_girlfriend_18/\n\nMy parents recently gave me an ultimatum - break up with my girlfriend or face them turning their backs on me, prompting me to drop out of university. They are very conservative and religious (Christians) and they said I should only date when I'm done with school.\n\nGrowing up I wasn't allowed to date at all. Prior my first girlfriend, I had only kissed one girl. My parents have always been very strict and unrelenting in what they think is right and what they think is wrong. Sex before marriage for them is an absolute no no. I come from Kenya but studying for my BA in England. \n\nMy parents found out I had a girlfriend due to Facebook - yeah, I learned from that mistake, big time - and they flipped. My dad called me and told me to break it off, or else they would stop paying for my BA and I'd be forced to drop out and come home.\n\nInitially, my plan was just to lie them - they are thousands of miles of away and with me being much more savvy with FB privacy settings in the aftermath of what happened, the chances of them finding out I was still with my girl were slim. However, that didn't come to pass because I got very pissed off by what my dad demanded of me.\n\nHe required \" physical proof\" that the relationship was over. Over the weekend, he called and demanded that my girlfriend should record a video of herself, saying it was over. \n\nI'm a shy, reserved person who has always been obedient to my parents. But for the first time in my life, I stood up for myself. I've never spoken back to my parents before but on that day, I did. I told my dad that he wasn't living in the same universe as everyone else and that there was no way I would humiliate and degrade my girlfriend in such a manner. That such a proposal was insane. He then started screaming and shouting at me (characteristically so). I cut the line. He tried calling again - I answered and he continued shouting. I told him I wouldn't talk to him until he started acting in a civil manner. I hung up again and didn't respond to his calls.\n\nHe then sent me a string of angry messages, saying he will stop paying for my tuition and that I'm not his son anymore. My mum called me a few hours later and she imitated my dad's angry rhetoric. But I calmed her down and we spoke. I told her that I absolutely love her and my dad, and that I'm grateful for everything they have done for me in life. \n\nBut I stressed the fact that I'm 18, I'm a man living in a completely new country, absorbing a completely new culture and making my own way in life. And that I'm old enough to have a girlfriend. I told her my girlfriend makes me happier than I've ever been, that she got me out of isolating myself in my room during those first weeks, when I was too shy to meet new people and make new friends. She continued to object, and went to the extreme justification of her reservations - pregnancy. Going so far as asking whether we had slept together! I told her that respectfully, it's none of her business. \n\nAfter that she hung up on me. I didn't hear from my parents until yesterday. It was my mum. She said she and my dad will continue paying for my tuition, but that they are very disappointed in me and  they regret sending me off to Europe to study - that it was better for me to go to a Kenyan uni. She added they raised me to be a better man and that the path I'm going down isn't right.\n\nI was planning to go to Kenya for the Christmas break but with the way things are, I don't think I will. My older sister lives in Seattle and she said I'm welcome to stay with her over the Christmas break. But that will probably be too expensive of a proposition for me. My girlfriend is Norwegian and she said she would love it if I spent Christmas with her and her family back in Norway. Her parents would be cool with it. Norway is a much more realistic destination for me. It's much closer than the States and thus much cheaper.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nI'm not gonna lie, I kinda feel bad. I mean I'm happy that I stood up to them and it was such a relief. However, some of the things my parents wrote and said kinda stung. Was I wrong in my approach with them? And how should I approach them regarding our relationship, in the future?",

            "Good for you!\n\nNow, as a piece of advice, as someone who pulled something a little milder than what you did...\n\nIt is *imperative* that you do well in school at this point for approximately a million reasons.  If you do well, your parents (who clearly still care about your wellbeing, even if they're angry right now) will start to see that your relationship isn't interfering with your studies.  If you don't, you'll confirm everything they thought about you dating and may pull financial support regardless.",
            "Parents who demand their adult children remain obedient tend to be *very well practiced* (and very skilled) in using guilt as manipulation. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel guilty. You\u2019ve likely been taught (via negative reinforcement) that disobeying your parents comes with consequences. When you are under their roof, they can make you very unhappy if you disobey. Now, they no longer have that leverage, but you still associate displeasing them with a scary or bad outcome. \n\nIf they do withdraw their financial support or place any more expectations on you (\u201cswitch to a Kenyan school or else\u201d / \u201ccome home for Xmas or else\u201d / etc), please remember you are an adult and get to make your own choices.\n\nIt\u2019s possible you will not *have to* drop out university, and if they value their image above all else, they may prefer to keep you in school than to bring you back (implying you\u2019re an academic failure or unable to function without them). In that case, you hold all the cards.\n\nI\u2019m proud of you, btw. I\u2019m just an internet stranger, but rarely does Reddit see confidence and growth like this in such a young user. Your girlfriend has been a wonderful influence, and you are proving your independence.",
            "Hey, as someone who grew up with really strict, conservative parents... I'm really proud of you. Standing up to parents isn't easy, especially when they steamroll you with demands and ultimatums and yelling. The fact that you got your protests in and did it with civility and class (seriously, when you told mom that you and your girlfriends' intimate affairs was none of her business I nearly cheered) is great and I'm glad that it worked out, more or less, in the end.\n\nI hope your study abroad goes well, and I hope things with your girlfriend do too!",
            "Don't go back to Kenya this Christmas. There is every chance they will not let you leave. You did very well with this, this is the first step in taking control of your life. Do well in school and don't invest everything in your girlfriend - she sounds wonderful but you are young and things can happen. Keep your chin up if things go astray, continue living responsibly.",
            "As a Nigerian with very conservative Christian parents, their behavior is par for the course. You handled the situation as well as you could. Their words were meant to sting, its how they would try to influence and control you when not nearby. Continue to stand up for your relationship to your parents. Whether or not they change their stance is up to them but demand respect from them as you most likely gave them your entire childhood. ",

You\u2019d be broken up, there would be no incentive to go along with such a kooky scheme. I think you chose the better route but I wonder what would have happened if you called him back and said, \u201cI dumped her, but she\u2019s not talking to me now so I don\u2019t have a video.\u201d ",

You have learned that they are not willing to lose you over this, and that's great news.  \n\n\nStudy hard, keep your social media locked down, and play your cards close to your chest.

This was hard but a necessary step for you to be an independent adult.

But growing up they taught me to be terrified of sex, and men in general, by making me think that pretty much any man I get close with will rape me and/or ruin my life. I overcame that and started dating a very nice boy my age once I went away to college. We had sex several months into the relationship and used protection \\*diligently\\* every time. I was home for Christmas break when my mom casually asked me if I was sexually active. I'm terrible at lying to my mom- my face turned beet red. She proceeded to ask me if I might be pregnant. I told her absolutely not, and that I regularly take pregnancy tests just to be sure. She screamed for my father to come into the room and said \"tell your father what you just told me\". Which was humiliating. He started crying. My parents proceeded to shout at me, lecture me, for TWO HOURS while I sat there sobbing and feeling one inch tall. My dad ended it by telling me, \"you're not a lady.\" The worst part of it all, was that I didn't defend myself. All I could do was cry and apologize. That fact STILL bothers me.\n\nI think I will forever live with that humiliated feeling and it's been a very long road to learn to stick up for myself. I'm lucky in that my parents didn't cut off my college funding, and I'm lucky that they eventually got over it and we have a wonderful relationship now. We only have a good relationship because I told them how deeply they cut me, and they later apologized profusely. My point is, although it doesn't feel like it now, sticking up for yourself is the ONLY WAY you can hope to have a good relationship with your parents later on. It may take months, even years for them to get over this, but I am pretty confident they will come around. You absolutely did the right thing. I hope you're able to go to Norway and have an awesome time. <3",

As someone who stood up against his parents too, let me tell you a little secret: they almost always come around. \n\nMy story is that I dropped out to start an online business and things were rough for a year but I finally got things going and have been able to travel & work remotely from anywhere. \n\nAs soon as they see your successes, they turn around- and I've seen this happen in 99% of cases. \n\nIf they don't turn around then know that it's for better, however I'm almost certain they will. \n\nLike others have mentioned, just make sure to do VERY GOOD in school now, don't do any crimes or get in trouble, etc. etc. \n\nThey'll see that and come around. Even if they never fully approve of it they'll \"accept it\" and drop it. \n\nAgain, great job. I commend you for your bravery in standing up for yourself. It's especially scary with parents like that. \n\nThey care for you and just don't know how to respect you and your decisions. They *think* that controlling your life is good, even though that's wrong to you. \n\nKeep standing up for yourself and things will play out for better. They'll turn around, accept it, and you'll finally get to enjoy an ADULT relationship with your parents! ",

They just don\u2019t want your future to get derailed and they reacted in fear. They have a terrible way of showing it but they really do love you. ",

            "What are you suppose to do, not ever have a relationship that could lead into marriage? ",
            "Way to go. We all have cutting-the-cord stories, yours came early.\n\nHang in there. Parents really are capable of adjusting. Fair warning, it can take years. \n\nAnd you are right: Norway is a good place to spend the holidays. A bit colder than Kenya, but you'll get used to it.",
            "Parents can be essentially well-meaning but also be tied too heavily to their own biases and lack a lot of emotional maturity. One way or another, parents need to understand that their children are not children forever, and that they must make their own decisions with regards to many things - relationships especially. Whether they understand this on their own or are forced into it like yours were doesn't change this. I personally think you handled it pretty well.",
            "This hits home. I\u2019m in a similar situation (i\u2019m from Norway btw), only i haven\u2019t objected yet. My parents are conservative in the same manner, to the point that if i spend free time with school friends instead of church friends they get really worried and start a serious conversation (\u00abyou\u2019re not meant for that kind of life.. god chose us... etc.\u00bb). Anyways, i\u2019m 18(m) too now and i have no idea what i\u2019m going to do. I have 9 siblings, only one of which has already left the church, and based on their reaction after he left, i feel really stuck.\nI can honestly say i feel your pain, and i am happy for you. ",
            "Your parents have failed you absolutely. They don't deserve to be at your wedding, though if they don't want to be there just invite them since that will be pouring hot coals on their heads. If you marry this girl, I say do the opposite of your parents' wedding wishes. \n\nPeople from your hometown can be even worse than people abroad (as a foreign student in England I'm sure there is a lot of harassment there, but it has been shown your own home people are worse than English people. )\n\nYour parents are N-parents, go check out that subreddit.\n\nAnd one last advice, like all those redditors have said, DO NOT GO BACK TO KENYA. \n\nHaving similarly strict conservative parents I can foresee one thing: YOUR PARENTS WILL TAKE YOUR PASSPORT. They will seize it and not let you leave. They also can withhold your plane ticket and other paperwork you need to leave Kenya. It didn't happen to me, but my own parents once floated it as a possibility if any of me or my siblings went overseas for studies. I'm Malaysian.\n\nEven if your parents meant well, their method meant that you will never ever receive their message in a good way. They already showed by example how bad they are. May God heal the pain that your parents have brought to you in His name.\n\nYou were absolutely right. You had a pair and a lot of maturity, and I applaud you for that. ",
            "Hey dude, I'm happy for you! Hope you get the most out of this relationship :)\n\nAs someone who followed a similar timeline as you, don't forget about your friends, your studies, and think about yourself!",
            "You may be overlooking a larger inference on a smaller detail here, so I'll say it if no one else has: People of your class who are that controlling are usually never going to actually follow through with it. You're an extension of them, so why are they going to take that away from you? What would they tell their frenemies when they ask what their kids are doing?",
            "No two generations are alike. We will act differently to our kids as well. The difference is how people react and how they take change. You did a good thing standing up for yourself. Its their reaction and your future actions that mater. The same path is not the same for everyone. Some have other needs than others. Some need a boyfriend or a girlfriend. Some need more social interactions. Other don't. At the same time don't let this incident ruin your relationship with your parents and don't stray away from your goals. \n\nThe fact that your father is continuing to pay says that he sort of understands your decision. If he had \"disowned\" you or mock, or degrade you then it would be a different story. His reaction although harsh at first, like a typical father, changed into a mild reaction. He's giving you a chance because he understands you're a man now and you're in charge of your own decisions. (although he is still paying for your tuition)\n\nAs for you. Make good decision. Do well in school and stay focused. Use protection with your girlfriend. Parents, or at least most parents, want only whats good for us even if sometimes what they think is good, is not. Sometimes we have to stand up for ourselves a bit too.",
            "You called your parents bluff but altogether what you\u2019re doing is outright stupid. You risked free college over some girl you most likely won\u2019t know in 5 years. \n\nCreate a new facebook account and start thinking about controlling your parents perception as they are currently your life blood. \n\nOf course your parents are acting ridiculous but that doesn\u2019t mean you being right will make you get what you want. Bottom line, get your shit together dude. The fact that you have changed your relationship status on facebook knowing that your parents can see it and how crazy they are about that subject is absolutely foolish. Use your head. \n\nAnd by the way, stop referring to yourself as a man...You\u2019re 18 and live on the tit, can\u2019t even support yourself let alone a family. When you have a big boy job and your parents don\u2019t pay your bills you\u2019ll be a man. ",
            "My only reaction to this is wtf! In what world does a parent in the 21st century think they have the right to demand their adult child to end a relationship?",
            "Was in this exact situation. All I have to say is relationships at these ages are ephemeral and y\u2019all will break up. Make sure to always prioritize your academics no matter what. ",
            "You were standing up for what\u2019s right and not becoming what wrong, your parents are in a category 2 of incorrectness. You are an adult your parents have no legal authority over you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their head and how you had stated they Christians which is awesome but to me this doesn\u2019t  sound Christian-like. At some point you need to let your parents know you are an adult and you can go be free. Your still their child but your not their kid. I have a feeling this has to do with their thoughts of you growing up so fast and they don\u2019t want to lose you or something related to that and they possibly didn\u2019t know how to react and but because they had seemed the information of you Girlfriend they thought that was the most conclusive theoried answer, and in some cases is reasonable. Relationships and love is a big foundation part of our lives it\u2019s a wonderful thing and a wonderfu mentor. But understand this your parents were trying to protect you and in their minds they thought they were doing the right thing but they reacted so harsh is possibly because they are afraid to lose or see you begin a new life and those years they had spent with you just vanish like a NASCAR at a Racetrack so in their minds they were only trying to protect you but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a relationship with a individual. Though you are 18 years old, you don\u2019t need to listen to your parents. But continue this journey through college and the relationship between you and your girlfriend, especially your relationship, If I was left on a island with food and water and had one option to bring one additional thing that would be love. Love gets ya into trouble and out of trouble, it destroys you and it heals you, it excites you and depresses you, Love is the greatest gift upon the universe,  and no matter if your heart is broken or healed and you can learn from either view point, good or bad, but don\u2019t waste your time with girlfriend , cherish her love, her company, her personality, her everything, Love covers a \u201cMultitude\u201d of sins. But do whatever you feel is necessary and remember you are 18 years old. Go be you and have fun, explore the world, have a good time with the people around you. And one day you may marry this woman, you have children with her, you may have grandchildren, you may sit on the front porch on some rocking chairs sipping tea and grow old with each other. Good luck in life  and I\u2019ll pray for ya and good luck in college",
            "Dump her. Ok my bad just kidding.",
            "to be honest, you're not in an age or situation where you can stand up and say no, you're far fake it with the help of your gf, until you get financially independent then still be nice to them and do your stuff.",
            "Wtf?  People like your parents actually exist?  You sir would find some friends over at r/atheism.  If that\u2019s what christianity demands then it must be a cult",
            "Another black man turning his back on his race and Africa.  You are in England to study, not to immigrate to Europe. Africa needs you. Your girlfriend is only with you because you aren't white and she has a mental complex about being \"different\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNorway is not a realistic destination, you and all your descendants will be foreigners and minorities, you don't want that. It's much more realistic to be a professional in your field back in Kenya than to get your kicks off hyper leftist white girls. Not only is she a different race, she's also definitely going to be non-religious (probably anti-religious) too. Do you really want that friction with your family? You are 18, you are super young. There's a 90% chance your relationship will end no matter what you do, simply because of age and the fact that most interracial relationships don't succeed."

        "selftext": "Just the title sounds creepy... Me and my bf have been together for only six months but have been friends for about a year longer than that. We only ever hung out with a friend group and did dnd together and stuff, and I fell in love with him without really hanging out at his house or interacting with his kids. I knew he HAD kids (m7, f12), and he'd talk about them, but I didn't meet them until I was already in love with him.\n\nSome background: I came from an abusive household. Both of my parents were emotionally/psychologically abusive and my father was an angry drunk who threw things and punched walls. I've been in therapy for it throughout my life (when I can afford a therapist, yay USA) but am currently not.\n\nI've never really hung out around a healthy family with kids in it? I'm estranged from my extended family since cutting off my parents, and most of my friends either don't have kids or they're very small babies. The first time I went over to my boyfriend's house, his kid was acting up and I felt my whole body go tight waiting for him to get angry/aggressive with the child... and he didn't. He was kind and gentle. I was absolutely just... I'd never seen that.\n\nThe more we spend time together and the more I see him around his two kids... I keep having these sort of earth-shaking revelations like... This is what parents are supposed to do. This is what it's supposed to look like. My therapists had explained, verbally, what it's supposed to be like, but that's very different from actually SEEING a parent who genuinely loves his kids and treats them well. I love spending time over there because when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.\n\nTo be clear, I know what daddy kink/DDLG is... and this isn't it. It's not sexual at all. I just see the way he takes care of his kids and wish that I could just ... duck under that umbrella and be cared for like that too? One time he was telling me about the custody battle he went through with his ex-wife, who didn't want him around the kids, and how hard he fought to stay in their life and I just started crying. He was comforting and I tried to explain that no adult in my life would have ever fought for me like that. I told him \"I wish I'd had a dad like you\" and he said \"I wish you did too.\" Which was very sweet but I just worry this isn't something I'm supposed to want from my boyfriend, or feel for him...? He knows about my parents and we've talked about it a few times. He gets it because he didn't have a great upbringing either.\n\nIt's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy? There's just so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in his house and I want to just... wrap up in it like a warm blanket. But it's not mine... it's his kids'. And I probably shouldn't get the wires crossed like that? I don't know. If I hadn't had to change jobs during covid I'd talk to a therapist again but financially that's just not an option right now.\n\nTL;DR - Raised in an abusive household, now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? Do I talk to him about it?\n\nEDIT: Wow so many comments. Thank you all for your kind words and advice. I'm definitely googling a lot of the ideas and books and things everyone mentioned. I didn't expect so many people to relate to this. It's kind of sad and really.. heartwarming? I was worried I was messed up and that I should shove these feelings away and felt guilty for feeling like that, but a lot of you suggested it's just love. Healthy love, and it's okay to want that. Which feels like it should probably be obvious. I've decided not to make a big deal out of it or have any kind of Talk about it, but just keep telling him how much I appreciate him and the things I see in him. Thank you all again for so many comments and advice and ideas!",

            "I don't think you want him to be your dad, you just want to be treated with the empathy and respect he treats his children.\n\nSo tell him how you feel, just don't say \"I want you to be my dad.\" That'll probably spook him, but beyond that yeah tell him you've never seen a parent treat their kids right like that and it makes it feel amazing to be around him. And how much you want more of that. I'm sure he'll feel flattered for basically being called an awesome dad, and then he'll feel able to become more emotionally close to you.",
            "40 year old lady here.\n\nLots of people who had shitty parents look at their partners and friends and think \"I wish my parents were like that.\" Heck, people with good parents might still look at a great parent and think \"Dang, they pulled that off better than my dad!\"\n\n It's not that you want your partner or friend to parent you, it's seeing someone do good and wishing that you had it back then with your parents.  \n\nWhat you need to do is focus on what a good partner he is to you. And you need to start giving yourself the love you needed as a child.",
            "I think it's really normal to want to have a protective partner who's looking out for you. We all have to be independent adults, but it's nice when you can trust someone else to take charge. That's ok. Maybe not phrase it as 'Dad', but what are those qualities that you appreciate in him.",
            "I think it's pretty normal to want that kind of secure nurturing feeling from a significant other. I wouldn't worry about it at all, unless it detracts from your romantic feelings, then it could become an issue.",
            "I think actually you're kind of fine. I mean, not fine, because you're still healing from childhood trauma, but kind of fine for your path of healing. \n\nWhat I was worried about is there is a common response some people have who were mistreated, where they see others being treated properly and it is painful. You don't have that. you're responding positively to watching healthy relationships, which is great. And there's nothing wrong with that, as far as I know. \n\nAs for wanting it for yourself, well, part of healing from childhood abuse is mourning the loss of what you should have had but did not. You've already done a lot of that, but as with any mourning, sometimes something happens and it hits you strongly again. In this case, you now have a better idea of what you missed out on. So, you need to let yourself take time to grieve.\n\nBut I also think you need to keep in mind that while you are too old now to have a relationship with someone in the parental role who cares for you as a child, a loving partner is somebody you should feel safe and cared for with. And you actually can have some of that safety and concern within a healthy romantic relationship. I think the parts you really want are the parts you should be aiming to get, which is why I think this isn't as much of a problem as it seems to be to you. You're just not used to having it within any relationship, and now are witnessing it within the context of a parent-child relationship. But you aren't mentioning craving any of the parent-child specific parts of it. Just being safe, cared for, and treated with kindness.",
            "That feeling you are describing is love, the love within your new family absolutely involves you. Embrace it and enjoy it, you deserve it.",
            "I think wishing you had a good dad isn\u2019t a problem? My husband also has kids and is a great dad and I wish I had a dad like him growing up and he knows that, he\u2019s a parent and knows about my upbringing and how shitty it was and absolutely agrees.\n\nYou already told him that though so I\u2019m not sure what else there is to talk about with your boyfriend, it sounds more like you are itching to process some childhood stuff and a therapist would be a better outlet for this. Good luck.",
            "I think this is totally normal and there are more solutions than just therapy.\n\nI had the same thoughts about my husband - I saw how kind and patient he is with our daughter and I thought to myself, if he weren't my husband, I wish he had been my dad!\n\nWhile I would still rather have a dad like my husband, one thing that helped me shift my focus off of being parented was being a parent myself. The longer I have been a parent, the less I think about wishing things were different for my child self and more on making sure my daughter has the best upbringing I can give her.\n\nPerhaps as your relationship progresses and you take on that role with his kids or kids of your own, you will feel that way too. Further, just being in a safe, loving relationship is healing in itself, whether or not you become a parent.",
            "A bit different, but I feel this way about my uncle.  My dad is definitely involved in my life and he\u2019s a good dad, but he has a lot of flaws that make it hard for me to connect with him.  Really bad communication, doesn\u2019t pick up on social queues, doesn\u2019t have critical thinking skills, he gets irritated easily and doesn\u2019t know how to control his temper, he\u2019s not a very good husband...  But my uncle is the complete opposite.  He\u2019s very gentle and understanding, he is absolutely a critical thinker, we share a ton of interests, he\u2019s a great husband and father.\n\nThe more I spend time with my uncle the more I find myself thinking \u201cI wish he was my dad\u201d.  It causes me to be resentful of my dad for no reason.  At the end of the day I had to accept that they both have a place in my heart but are fulfilling different needs in my life.  \n\nMy point being that I think it\u2019s okay to recognize these good qualities in your partner, and it\u2019s okay to want to feel protected and comfortable.  I think you\u2019re on the right track since you already recognize that it\u2019s not healthy to think \u201cI wish he was my dad\u201d.  But it\u2019s okay to think \u201cI want someone special in my life who has these qualities\u201d.  He sounds very understanding and I don\u2019t think you have anything to lose by being honest with him.",
            "I\u2019ve seen a video from the School of Life YouTube channel that said in every partner we choose, there is something about them that either reminds us of how our parents treated us, or reflects our unmet childhood needs. I tried to find the video so I could link it here, but that channel has quite a few of these videos on dating and how parent-child relationships affect how we ourselves approach dating. It might be worth checking out some of their videos as a temporary self-help measure for now, since you mentioned you can\u2019t quite get therapy yet. Best of luck to you.",
            "I think wanting to be nurtured is the most natural thing in the world for anybody. But especially for a person with your background. If you\u2019re worried about it somehow ruining your relationship, or if it\u2019s otherwise bothering you, get therapy. But definitely don\u2019t hate on yourself for wanting to be nurtured by your partner.",
            "I think you need to stop worrying and questioning yourself. \n\nYou were abused and were not given chance to see unconditional love. \n\nYou\u2019ve not quite known before I think how to know if a man is genuinely capable of giving you the security and affection you deserve because your father let you down and failed to nurture you.\n\nIt seems that despite the pain you\u2019ve felt, you\u2019ve found the right man and are comfortable enough to let your guard down and feel safe without any fear :) \n\nYou\u2019ve suffered enough. Enjoy and soak in that family love. Be good to each other and those kids and go to bed with a smile x",
            "DDlg is not always sexual. \nThe feeling that you describe of wanting to curl up and absorb all of warmth, patience, kindness? That is very real and very tangible. You dont have to put a label on it either!\n\nId say it sounds like you were never really taken care of maybe and you just want to melt into the couch and be doted on. I think its totally normal :)",
            "DD/lg isn\u2019t always sexual, but I realize that with the prevalence of this kink increasing that some people get an icky feeling about it. To me it sounds like you want a caregiver type role in your partner, which to me sounds completely normal. I was abused as a child and I want a partner that takes care of me in certain aspects of my life. Due to my upbringing, I push myself incessantly to succeed, often times, ignoring self-care. This is where I like my partner to step in, who enjoys it, and cares for me. Your feelings are valid, I would communicate then to your partner and let him know how you\u2019re feeling.",
            "Awh bless you. This really made me feel deeply for you; you missed a healthy father figure in your life for so long, it feels like your boyfriend is filling in a missing puzzle piece. Especially when you wrote about wanting to duck under that umbrella too.  \n\n\nAs you said - it is not sexual or a kink. And it's certainly not wrong. You summed it up best when you said to him that you wished you had a father *like* him. I think that's the difference. You don't want you boyfriend to be *your* dad. You just wished you could've had a dad *like* him, when you were young and needed it most. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think figuring out these distinctions is important for your own peace of mind. It's okay. Your parents let you down deeply, and that leaves scars. You can have years of incredible, insightful and healing therapy that *will* do you the world of wonders, but sometimes I think certain traumas never fully leave you, but are like a bruise that heal slowly over time but never *fully* go away. You just find better tools to deal with the ache. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour boyfriend sounds wonderful. Sounds like a deeply caring partner, and a fantastic father to his own children. You're part of a new family now; and remember as the days pass, you're growing and healing and learning.   \n\n\nI know it's cliche, but definitely take this to your therapist when you next can see them. Iron out those creases. But you're not wrong or sick or weird for longing for a father figure to replace the one you never had as a child. As a kid, the very least you were owed was a good parent, and you did not get that. It's awful.   \n\n\nBut you are a strong, accomplished adult now. You've found love, you've found true family. You'll continue to grow, and soon accept that you never got the father you deserved, but you found love in different ways.",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice but I also feel like this with a guy I\u2019m dating. He doesn\u2019t have kids but is a leader in his community & I love seeing the way he teaches and guides people & I often wish that he had been my dad or something idk. I\u2019m just taking it as a sign that he would be an excellent father if we had kids someday",
            "The ways we love aren't independent from one-another.  The same man who treats his children with so much empathy, kindness, and patience is *the same one who is dating you*.  You don't need to be his child to reap the benefits of being loved by him, you just need to be loved by him.  Which, it seems like, you might be, so...cool!\n\nIf your boyfriend is as cool as you make him out to be, I'd think about a few key ways his behavior with his kids makes you feel so secure, and start trying to articulate them into \"When you  ___  I feel  ___  \" statements.  \n\nA good partner is supposed to help support and nurture you, right?  So he'd probably like to know how best to support and nurture you, right?",
            "This is a good thing! You have learned what positive healthy relationships are like, and have been welcomed to join them.

They just don\u2019t know how",
            "I would say this is pretty normal. Sounds like you found a keeper. Maybe, if you feel you need to express this to him, it's more like, I watch you with your children and it makes me so happy to see what a healthy relationship looks like, but it also makes me grieve for what I didn't have.",
            "Reframe it. You wish your dad was as good a dad to you as your boyfriend is to his kids. Does it still sound creepy to you?\n\nI think you\u2019re doing just fine, OP. Wishing you and your bf the best.",
            "I had a difficult childhood too, and my partner at the time had \"daddy\" vibes that I found very emotionally comforting. So I took an unusual route to exploring it.     \n      \nThere's a non-sexual form of DD/LG that is called r/ageregression here on reddit. I only spent like two or three months doing it, but it was very healing. I talked to my partner first about what role I wanted him to take for the roleplay sessions. Several evenings a week, I would make sure all my adult responsibilities were taken care of, then I would dress up in pajamas and pigtails, or whatever made me feel small again, and age-regress.      \n      \nI would watch Blue's Clues and other young children's shows to get me in the mindset, and would get a bunch of crayons or stickers or play-doh to keep my hands busy. I talked to my stuffed animals again, and acted out scenes with them. My boar plushie acted out my feelings of anger, my dragon plushie became the voice of reason, my spider plushie would speak kind encouragement to me. Suddenly I was just spending evenings re-narrating my own development.       \n       \nThe role my partner took in these sessions was a kind parental figure, who would respond to my raw emotions with compassion and love. I let my feelings come out as unfiltered as possible (bar actual violence), so that I could have the experience of someone in a position of care towards me show me acceptance and guidance. It revisited events of vulnerability the way they should have gone.       \n         \n       \nIt was pretty weird at first, but it was like going into very deep wounds in my psyche and repairing them. My therapist helped me integrate what I was experiencing into my healing as well. Overall, I'm very happy for the experience, and gained the ability to be much kinder to myself.      \n       \nIf you did take an approach like that, I would make sure to use terms that are different than what your partner uses for his kids, i.e. if they call him \"daddy\" then call him \"papa\" or something instead. Just find clear boundaries, have a safe-word for when roleplay needs to end, and communicate needs clearly.       \n     \nHope this brings some insight, whether or not it's something you try.",
            ">It's probably not okay to cross wires like that... I believe in  communication in relationships so I probably need to talk to him about  it. But how do I tell him so it doesn't come off creepy?\n\nI relate very strongly to this post. Except for the part about finally picking a kind, gentle and patient man to partner with. Seriously, good for you! I grew up with an absentee father and an explosive rage stepfather. I seem to only gravitate towards emotionally unstable men. When I see men treating their children (particularly daughters) kindly and patiently, I notice feelings of envy (bordering on resentment) building up. I am in therapy of course and have been for years.  \n\nAs it relates to the question of how to tell your bf... why do you feel like you need to? I am a chronic over-sharer (as are many people from dysfunctional households that lacked stable and appropriate boundaries) and one thing I've been experimenting with lately is keeping certain aspects of my self-awareness private. I realize your case may be different, but for me, so far, cultivating some emotional privacy feels good and self-affirming.",
            "It doesn't sound like you want him to be your dad, but that you just want to feel that type of love from him that you were supposed to get from your parents didn't. The empathy and the kindness. I don't think its a problem. And you should be able to duck under your partners umbrella. Thats not wierd.",
            "Get back into therapy. You do need a dad figure for yourself - but you are in danger of boundary crossing with him that can turn dependent and can elicit some behavior in your relationship that would be unhealthy. This isn\u2019t a link thing. \n\nIn therapy you can create a figure based on your partner to be your father figure. It would be a creation you can build for your internal self as a fatherly guide. So you can internalize\nSome of your partners behavior toward his children to build this internal figure so that you can stay partners and not become father daughter with your partner.",
            "One thing to keep in mind is you will *never* get that kind of unconditional love from him that he gives to his children. Parent-child love is different from spousal or romantic love. You may get that same sort of warmth and secure, protective and loved feeling from him but it's important that you remember being in a romantic relationship means you are never entitled to that love unconditionally and must not take it for granted. Sometimes thinking about what we have to put back into a relationship reminds us of that.",
            "I think it\u2019s okay to feel this way, but don\u2019t have him meet both needs as a father figure and a partner. You can feel the safety, security, fun and experiences the relationship offers but remember to keep that projection in check because parentifying a partner may lead to an inmeshed relationship- in my unprofessional opinion.",
            "I don\u2019t think this is weird or bad. I probably wouldn\u2019t tell him about it the way you phrased it in the title, because that would potentially weird him out, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s what you literally mean anyway. \n\nIt sounds like you found a partner who is a genuinely good person, and are getting an up-close view of what a functional, loving family can feel like for the first time, and you want to be part of it. And that is GOOD. You *should* want to want to be part of your partner\u2019s family! That\u2019s... kind of the whole idea!\n\nObviously at this stage you\u2019re an adult- you will always have a different role with more responsibility than being a child in any joint family unit you guys may choose to create. If you feel like you are struggling to differentiate those roles, more therapy to keep things clear for yourself might be a good idea. But it just sounds like you are in a really good relationship and it\u2019s inadvertently stirring some painful realizations about what your own childhood was like. That doesn\u2019t mean your \u201cwires are crossed\u201d and I imagine as the relative novelty of witnessing family functionality wears off, so will the confusing feelings about it.\n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t have an abusive father, but I did have an emotionally distant one. I lowkey expected my partner to be that way when we had kids, just because it was what I knew. But my partner is an incredibly affectionate and involved parent, and seeing him be so tender and engaged with our kids made me fall even more deeply in love with him. Do I wish I had had that as a kid? Sure. But more than anything, seeing it makes me realize I chose a good person to build a family with, and I\u2019m so glad that our kids will have *this* experience of family.\n\nSeeing ample evidence that your partner is a good and kind person *should* make you feel more in love with them and want to be with them. That\u2019s a healthy reaction!",
            "> now see how my amazing boyfriend loves his kids and I wish he'd take care of me/love me the same way, since nobody ever did. Is that wrong? \n\nYou're not talking about being his kid. You are talking about wanting someone to love you the way he loves his kids. That is fine. \n\nThat said, make sure you are not putting him in a place where he is responsible for you or he isn't getting the same support and love back from you that he would be giving you.",
            "It's totally normal to have a partner support you and encourage you as a good parent would. You should feel secure in your relationship. \n\nHowever, romantic relationships require a certain level of reciprocity that parent/child relationships do not. Your partner needs to be cared for as well, and you also have to take care of yourself.",
            "Things in life overlap sometimes and it's not necessarily bad. I think, at least in North American society, we can get caught up in labelling relationships in very specific ways. Your partner sounds very loving so it makes sense that it brings up a lot of emotions based on your past experiences. Do you think maybe you feel undeserving of it in some way? Or shame for wanting to be loved and cared for and respected? Because I don't think wanting those things is shameful, yet I could see how not receiving those things as a child might send you that message and make it feel more complicated now that you've met somebody so loving.",
            "I don\u2019t think you want him to be your dad \u2014 you just love being around him when he\u2019s a dad.

It\u2019s weird but I love being around you when you\u2019re in Dad Mode. I actually feel like it\u2019s healing for me to see a dad who\u2019s so attentive and gentle and loving with his kids. I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you letting me into your kids\u2019 lives. It makes me love you even more to see how you take care of them, and it helps me realize at a deeper level how parents should be. I wish I\u2019d had a dad like you.

            "Hey, OP! This is kind of the opposite situation, but my current partner is very much like my Dad. I have an awesome Dad and I wish that everyone could have had a Dad like mine. When I first started dating my partner I was weirded out because they were so similar (even have the same job) and I thought there is something wrong with me. I talked to my therapist and she told me that it's not that I want to date my Dad, it's that I've found someone who reminds me of him and that is something very comforting. There is something very nice about a man who gives strong Dad vibes. It's not a kink, it's just that nice comforting love that you can only get from a kind and caring man. Someone who isn't your father specifically, but who would make a great Dad. Then I realized that that is why I love my boyfriend, because he reminds me of my Dad and would make a good Dad... Nothing weird about it. It's nice to be taken care of in that way.",
            "\"I wish I had a parent like you when I was growing up.\" That's the highest of compliments to any parent, I think. You don't have to steal the umbrella to get under it too, just understand roles.",
            "There's a concept in therapy called \"reparenting\"--basically it's giving, as an adult, what you needed and didn't get as a child. Often we reparent ourselves, but not only--sometimes our partners help reparent us, our mentors, our friends, etc. I don't think it's weird or bad to recognize how healing seeing unconditional love and experiencing gentle and supportive love is. It might just be about how you frame it to yourself and your partner.",
            "You know I actually have been feeling the same way recently. My dad left after I was born, and I had no contact with him until I turned 13. Now I see my boyfriend taking care of his kids, and it makes me envious in a way. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy, and I really do like his kids but I don\u2019t know how to stop myself from wishing I had a dad as good as theirs when I was a child. I think I feel that way because I\u2019ve been so hurt by my dad and I know my boyfriend would never do that to me. I long to be taken care of in such a nurturing way because I\u2019ve never had that from my father. I can\u2019t really even put it into words.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird feeling, but you\u2019re not alone and judging by the comments it happens a lot more than you\u2019d think!",

            "I am not a therapist, doctor, or even versed in anything like this. But I just read the book Burnout, and in it, they talk about \u201ccompleting emotions\u201d to move past them. And I\u2019m curious whether your longing for what he brings as a dad keeps growing, or do you feel the more you kind of safely luxuriate in it, you feel calm and at peace, and need less over time? I\u2019m not even sure if you could tell. But their theory is stress comes from incomplete emotions, which often come from trauma. I think you\u2019re very self-aware to notice what you\u2019re doing, and how you\u2019re compensating. But I wonder if spending some time trying to complete those emotions would help you? I don\u2019t feel qualified to give advice on how, but exercise is one way they say it can help, breathing deeply all the way in and out several times, several times a day, crying, meditation. \n\nMy opinion is you\u2019re self-aware enough, and comfortable enough with boundaries, you might be able to find a technique and start working through the losses in your life you\u2019re realizing through him. Really mourn the shitty hand you were dealt, and appreciate how that has affected you and even how it\u2019s made you stronger, and a more compassionate and appreciative partner and friend. \n\nWhen I have emotions to work through, I like to go for a slow walk and listen to some music that feels open/calming and think about the emotion, and everything tied to it, and look at it from various perspectives. And I swear there is a moment where my body physically releases it, and I naturally am ready to move on. But I\u2019m doing stupid stuff like a coworker got me worked up. Or thinking about how I never dealt with a breakup. And even if you don\u2019t release it entirely, you might get 80% there. It actually sounds like you\u2019re doing this naturally, while observing. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m recommending it as an option.\n\nIf you want to know more for free, check out Bren\u00e9 Brown\u2019s Unlocking Us podcast from this week. They walk through these techniques, and I did buy the book, but the stuff I\u2019ve implemented came from the podcast.\n\nGood luck! I\u2019m rooting for you and hope you find both peace with your past, and joy and peace in your present and future!",
            "I felt the same with my husband.  Watching him with my kids made me Rea realize how faced up my parents were.. I also was totally different than my parents.  I talked to my kids about everything unlike in my family where we walked on eggshells around my dad and never got to talk about what you were really feeling.   You have a chance to be the mom you needed with his kids too.   Sounds like you got a good one.",
            "While I wouldn't tell him that you want him to be your dad, in those words, you should definitely continue telling him that you love how he's such an amazing dad.

People don\u2019t like to really examine it in themselves, but the archetype of what a good man is, whether they are your brother, cousin, friend, lover, mentor, dad, uncle, grandfather etc., naturally has lots of emotional connections and associations which overlap and in healthy relationships this is healthy...",
            "He does love you. Although not as a parent. I think you\u2019re just coming to terms with feeling loved but also maybe not 100% trusting it or feeling sad because love from a partner doesn\u2019t always seem as reliable, pure and constant as parental love. \n\nMy therapist said I\u2019d probably get some feelings come up when I have kids because it\u2019s a reminder of our childhood. However I don\u2019t think she realised this already happened because I have a much younger sibling. It sounds like things are coming up for you because of bf\u2019s kids.",
            "I mean, it sounds like the place it comes from isn't that different from those of us who have watched our partner with some else's kids and melted thinking \"he's going to be such a good father.\" And you should feel safe and protected and supported in a good romantic relationship. There's a difference between wanting someone who can do that, and wanting to be infantilized by a partner, in my opinion. I had a very happy childhood, so I can't really speak from experience. But it doesn't really sound like you've crossed a line.",
            "You already told him! When you said \u201cI wish I had a dad like you\u201d you said what you really mean. And if you want to explain further you can take an extract from your las paragraph:\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much positivity and warmth and unconditional love in YOUR house that I just want to wrap in it like a warm blanket\u201d\nAs you depicted him, he will understand",
            ">when he is kind and gentle to his kids, I like... passively absorb it, is the only way I can think to explain it. I feel safe and warm and protected in an extremely just, primal way? That I never felt in my own house or anything.\n\nNot even when you were living alone as an adult? Or maybe if you stayed with a trusted friend, did you ever get a similar feeling? While it makes sense it would be stronger with your boyfriend because you love him, surely you had other good people in your life that made you feel safe in some way. Or is he the first person you've ever felt safe with at all? \n\nIdeally if your mental health is in order, you should sometimes be able to achieve this sense of safety and warmth on your own, when you are living alone. But of course humans are social creatures so you're probably more likely to feel it with your \"chosen family\" of friends, boyfriend, etc. \n\nI bring this up because I worry that if this is the only source of warmth and safety in your life then you will put all your eggs in one basket, which is risky. You know how your boyfriend makes his household a warm, safe place? That takes effort and care, and you're right that he does it primarily for his kids but also for himself. If he didn't protect and care for himself then he couldn't care for his kids on top of that. So.... you can put in that same effort and care into your life and make your life a warm and safe place! For yourself! \n\nYou say you want him to be your parent, you want him to be that source of warmth. But that shouldn't be your primary source of warmth. He can't be your parent. Only you can be your own parent, I guess.  There's nothing wrong with enjoying the vibe of his household and wishing to be part of his family. But you need to avoid looking to him for answers to the issues in your life. If he can make warmth then you can make warmth, you can do it.",

            "You don't want him to be your dad. The child inside of you, who had to grow up far too quickly and deal with very awful things, is longing for the things she never had. You're grieving a loss, and you're also seeing the possibilities of what you could have and should have been given. And that's okay. It's normal. \n\nYou can talk to him. He probably knows. Definitely talk to your therapists. And talk to yourself. Talk to the inner child and reassure her. Those of us who had to leave pieces of ourselves behind to survive  -- we generally find, as adults, that we have to get back in touch with those pieces if we want to heal. If you want soothing, ask for it and accept it. If you want to play raucously, do that. If you want to cry, cry. There is no one right way to recover from an abusive childhood.",
            "I'm not a therapist, but there are some similarities here in how I feel about my boy friend. So let me tell you about those, and what i think of them. I love how my boy friend parents. I admire his parenting. He's kind, firm, principled, just a great solid dad. Now, whilst I also wish i had dad like him, I don't look up to him in a fatherly way. But i do very much respect and admire his parenting skills. There are similarities in how one parents, and how one can show care and love for a partner. And that's fine. Just because I feel protected by my boy friend, doesn't mean I feel that he fathers me, or that I play a daughter role in any way. I don't treat him like my father, I treat him, and see him as my partner. I take a lot of comfort in how he parents, because it does tell me a lot about him. I sometimes think about how good it must be to have a father like him, but I'm also at peace with my own absent father now, and we actually have a good relationship now. So I think with some time, you might just find yourself focusing naturally on your partner and his skills and qualities, rather than what was missing from your childhood. If/when therapy is an option again, this will be a topic for discussion that I'm sure a professional can help you along with in a shorter amount of time than some topics. Enjoy his qualities. And think about other qualities he has, that he brings to your relationship.",

But it's not mine... it's his kids'\n\nThis is where you're wrong. You DO get to get under that blanket. That's what we look for in a romantic relationship as an adult. As a kid, you hope you get it from a parent.

Maybe you've never been in a position to be vulnerable before? \n\nI think it's sad that you think that welcoming you into his family, he ISN'T offering the same to you. He is. It will look different (no punishments, no rules, more communication needed). \n\nGet under that blanket.

            "Not an expert, but it sounds like you are attracted (for lack of a better word) to his warm and protective nature.  There is nothing wrong with this.  While they don\u2019t exhibit themselves in the exact same way, the traits of a caring SO and loving parent are very similar.  It is likely that you fell in love with him for the same reasons you respect his parenting.  He\u2019s even tempered, open with his emotions, and generally speaking you feel safe around him.  Love (of any kind) often makes one wish to be vulnerable and open around that person, the same way that children are generally when they are young.  You\u2019re seeing his relationship with his children as an example of what happens when people are vulnerable around him.  Some people take advantage of vulnerability, but he doesn\u2019t.  I won\u2019t go as far as to recommend how to talk to him about how you feel, but words like \u201cvulnerable\u201d, \u201cwarm\u201d, and \u201csafe\u201d are probably a good starting point.

            "A counselor would be a very good idea. You could work out some of your trauma and such with them and come to an understanding that will help you cope with it and embrace your new found love and comfort.\n\nYou're now in a position to be a mature adult, even though you miss the childhood you could've had, the past cannot be changed. We can only adapt and grow.",
            "I haven\u2019t read that many comments so maybe someone already said this but I\u2019m going to put my educational background in clinical psych and ten years of personal therapy to use here. \n\nThis is not an abnormal want when you came from a traumatic background. When we grow up with developmental trauma (emotional, physical or medical neglect, any type of abuse, frequent invalidation etc.) and learn to perceive ourselves as unworthy of our parents\u2019 love, which becomes part of our significant relationship schema, a part of us can be stuck at the age where that emotional development was hindered. Though people may not realize it, affection, unconditional love and support, trust, a healthy level of boundaries and freedom, and the ability to both have individuality and acceptance from our family for it are just as crucial to meeting developmental milestones . those internal senses of worth and care and protection are incredibly important to later having a healthy relationship with oneself and with others.\n\nIf we lack that in childhood, we seek it in other ways later. Two of the most experienced, educated therapists I had through my life talked with me about this in my own therapy and we learned similar things in my grad program. I also have had clients in the past when I did therapy who struggled with these same issues. There is nothing wrong with you for the abused part of you to want to be loved - if a part of you froze developmentally because of that abuse and neglect, it wants the healthy love it never got. Because we are adults, we can\u2019t get that from another adult in the way we are wanting it. In adult relationships we are expected to be able to provide reciprocal care, support and demonstrate maturity and effective communication. So we kind of have to be a middle ground for ourselves - we are our parent now and we have to become the version of ourselves we needed when we were younger. We call this \u201cself re-parenting\u201d and the point is unifying that old trauma based need with our current self, becoming a \u201cgood parent\u201d to ourselves to meet that childhood need appropriately.\n\nI think there are ways you can explain how you feel to your significant other without it feeling weird and a good partner will understand where you\u2019re coming from. I explained it to my partners similarly to how you\u2019ve done here. \u201cI\u2019ve had a past experience growing up in an abusive household. This caused me to feel (however you perceive it to have impacted such as unworthy of love, anxious, etc. whatever applies) and I have worked on this in therapy in the past. Seeing how good of a parent you are is such a different image of what family can look like to me because it\u2019s the complete opposite of my experience. It makes me feel so happy that your children have such a good parent and are so loved and supported. Seeing such a positive relationship has brought up some feelings for me that I wasn\u2019t expecting and a part of me that never had that kind of love and support feels sad even though it\u2019s a positive thing to see. I wish I\u2019d had a parent like you when I was younger. I\u2019m working on coping with those feelings of loss (because it is a loss - realizing childhood you will never have that from your own parents is grieving a loss just like any other type of loss) from having to grow up without that, and I appreciate you listening to me talk about this because it isn\u2019t easy. I want to find a way to address these feelings and my needs related to this in a healthy way with you.\u201d \n\nEssentially that\u2019s how I approached it with my significant others and especially my girlfriend was incredibly understanding, felt it made perfect sense and times when I\u2019m hurting worse, we acknowledge it together and she tells me things I need to hear because my brain is defaulting to an old abused mindset. I am still able to provide support to her and we have a very healthy relationship with lots of communication. It\u2019s truly a process of grieving to let go of the pain and hopes and dreams of an abusive childhood but it gets better. My girlfriends niece has two amazing parents, amazing grandparents, and amazing aunts and uncles who all love her to the ends of the earth. I love her too and I love seeing how much she grows emotionally and intellectually with all of that support and I get emotional to myself sometimes at how happy I am she is so loved, that she will never grow up feeling unworthy or know what abuse or neglect feels like. I feel equally as protective and supportive toward her as my girlfriend and her family does. At the same time a \u201cfrozen\u201d part of me has a deep sadness that I never had that and how different should my life had been if my parents had just done their job? It brings up a lot of grief and anger but I deal with it privately when it comes up and process grief with a therapist, which I also highly recommend if you find the opportunity to see a good one. You can find lists of therapists on psychologytoday who have specific specialities like childhood abuse trauma and relationships. It will also list the insurance they take and other important info. \n\nGood luck with everything and just know you\u2019re not alone in this and it\u2019s not abnormal to want to be loved and supported.",

CGL is one of them. \n\nThere\u2019s a couple of things at play if you decided to approach it that way:\n\n- to heal from childhood trauma, you essentially have to envision yourself as an adult taking care of your childhood self. You may need to do this a few times depending upon how your developing psyche reacted to the trauma at different times. a lot of us with childhood trauma have \u201csplits\u201d - not \u201calters\u201d, but splits are sort of a Stamp that has stuck around that pops up internally (and sometimes externally, referred to as age regression). that Stamp of yourself has not yet processed what you were going through at the time, and taking care of that version of yourself the way you needed at the time is key. This is usually guided in therapy (I have a 12yo split of myself hanging out in a HUGE library with all our favorite snacks and my grandma and a big beanbag, and the library\u2019s encased in a huge, impermeable bubble of light; my mother was guided in a meditation session where she \u201cfound\u201d her past self in the place her abuser had hidden her and brought her out; etc), but there are a lot of ways to do this for yourself. write a letter to that specific version of you (is she 2? 7? 14?), hypnotherapy audios; researching \u201cinner child healing exercises\u201d may help. the difference is with people who grew up in homes like we did, we usually don\u2019t have one inner child, but many splits, so this will need to be done for each individual split.\n\nthis leads me to:\n- CGL or other similar \u201cscenes\u201d with a trusted partner can be very therapeutic. sometimes sex is involved, and sometimes it\u2019s not! either way you would speak with your partner about this. healing this part of you, it\u2019s essentially about *showing* yourself, and your splits, that you are worth being taken care of. in this case it could be as simple as setting aside a day/a few hours where you don\u2019t have to be an adult. his kids can be maybe with a babysitter, and you and him just indulge in whatever that version of you needed. being held? being gently guided for chores? whatever works for you. a lot of littles will color pages, collect stuffed animals, etc; some others just need time and space to Not Be An Adult for a while. this can be done without anyone else but the idea of CGL is that you have someone protecting/caring for you while you\u2019re in that state. there are a *lot* of people who non-sexually do this sort of thing for trauma, because it\u2019s really meant to be a healthy coping practice. sex isn\u2019t required.\n\nyou don\u2019t have to do any of the CGL/little stuff but I wanted to let you know if any of that resonated with you it\u2019s okay.",

And look for some other gentle male figure in the area to treat as being like how you think a father should be and that your BF is being like that father, but he is his own separate entity from that father figure.\n\nIMO your inner child is trying to attach to a healthy parent, which is fair for it to want to do that. But try to arrange for it to attach to someone else who is nurturing and for you as an adult to parent that younger part of yourself.",

My mum was physically, emotionally and psychologically abusive and dad had mental illness. The home was unstable and violent and I was in fight/flight mode a lot. It is understandable that having come from an abusive/unstable home environment that witnessing how a loving parent behaves, it will highlight even more the things that you missed out on - which can be quite jarring. I wrote out a bunch of stuff that happened in my childhood and read it to my partner, who came from a loving home, and it was so interesting and comforting to hear that from an outside perspective, some of it was really fucked up and it makes sense why I ended up struggling with my own mental health. There\u2019s a certain grief that comes when you acknowledge the adversity you experienced in childhood - make sure you acknowledge your emotions but don\u2019t make it mean anything about you. It\u2019s not your fault that your parents didn\u2019t meet your needs as a child.

Like, for exanple check my oil and tire pressure for me regularly, and that felt really \"dad\" and caring in a way that id never gotten, and then I got a little too used to expecting him to do that stuff on a way that made him feel overly responsible for me and led to some resentment, and resentment on my part for not treating me like an adult, even as other parts of me found being fathered a bit Soo delicious after being deprived of that my whole childhood.\n\nThat all said, it also can be so wonderful and healing to get a sense of family you build with someone in a way that you can really cherish because you know what it's like to not get those things, my current partners family is so warm and loving and respectful that it made me really, just feel a lot of grief at first for my childhood self, but also with time, so much hope that I can be welcomed into that and allow myself to feel deserving of that love.\nJust keep communicating, parentification is pretty common and it probably means you feel really safe with him, just keep talking to him and try and separate out your childhood feeling voices from your adult responsibilities to an adult romantic partner as best you can together .",

But when you grow up, you replace your parents with your partner and they become your new attachment figure. This is why so many people unconsciously seek out partners who are similar to their own parents, because they want a familiar attachment figure. You seem to have lucked out and found someone a much better person than your parents were, this is fantastic. Your concept of parental and romantic relationships is are dysfunctional from your past experiences. A partner should be kind, considerate, patient, and so should a parental figure. But that doesn't mean you want your partner to be your parent. I'm sorry that you didn't have the best parents growing up, and I'm really glad you have found someone who can show you what familial love is supposed to look like.

The people I know who have similar stories to yours identify as middles. They don\u2019t want to be infantilized, they just want to feel a nurturing parental energy and let their minds settle into a safe space where they color in pillow forts while blasting Disney songs and not think about Excel spreadsheets and bills and shit.

Slowly spend short amounts of time in that mindset. It doesn\u2019t need to be an elaborate role play or an all day event. Watch a favorite kids movie while sitting on the floor. Pile up some blankets and pillows, have him sit behind you, legs spread, and wrap his arms around you. Maybe make some snacks and he can occasionally feed you a piece or two.

I dont know if any of this makes sense, but I feel that same pull, and i think to girls like you and I, who havent really gotten that sense of trust from people in our early lives, its easy to equate it to that parental dynamic, (and sometimes it becomes a sexual thing as well).\n\nall this to say: you're not weird, and many people in this thread have put it perfectly. its good to love a good man, amirite?",

Seeing people who genuinely love each other and would go out of their way to help each other - I have been moved to tears by the inclusion I have felt from my SO's family. They have just radiated love because it's what they do, and I've soaked it up and have never felt guilty about it because honestly it's allowed me to recognize I am deserving of that kind of maternal love.",
            "I think your feelings are really normal in your situation. To see a person nurturing, supporting, and loving their kids instead of abusing them is really jarring. It feels really unfair.\n\nMy husband (and I) don't have kids, but I get really jealous and hurt sometimes when I see how his parents treat him. But then, he reminds me: I have that now too. His parents love and support me, too. His family belongs to me now too.\n\nWe've been together for almost 10 years and I still am not always good at accepting that they love me, or that they are not secretly toxic people, but I keep working at it.\n\nBask in the love of your boyfriend. His unconditional love isn't only for his children...I bet some of it is yours too.",
            "IMO: Don\u2019t talk to him about it. Just revel in the feelings of love, admiration, and feeling moved by his parenting. This is just something that\u2019s making you love him more. Go with it.",
            "Hey ik you said this isnt the ddlg/ daddy kink thing but it kind of seems like this is what you want, not all daddy/little relationships are sexual, it sounds to me like you want some one to take care of you the way a parent would and that's exactly what a daddy/little relationship is like.... And i mean there's no rules to what it hast to be like a big part of thoes kink relationships is the people involved get to decide what they want from it. All im saying is i think it's worth a try and not to shut that option out.",
            "The problem here is that you're an adult, not a child. He has different expectations of you and probably wouldnt like the idea of needing to care for you in that way but also it edges in on the amount of energy he can focus on his kids. He might even be hoping if things are working out, you would want to help care for his children, but instead he will be shocked if you want less of the parenting role and more the needy child. I'm sure he would understand but inside there is conflict. Why is the current position not enough? Usually women feel the same security as the children do in a household with a strong male figure whether it be a father, a husband, a brother, or a son, they have the same effect. I would think he actually does care for you the same way but it's going to show differently because he treats you like an adult and doesn't want to treat you like he treats his kids.",
            "I have this feeling when I hang out with people who have nicer parents than mine, usually the parents of someone I am dating. I want to spend time with their parents because I never had that. It makes me a little sad sometimes, though. Like how different would my life have been had I had better parenting. So it may be sort of the same thing as you see it in your partner instead.",
            "I completely understand where you're coming from and the number of upvotes you got just proves how many people able to sympathize and understand what you are talking about.\n\nI'm with my fiancee who comes from a completely normal family, was brought up to be an all-round excellent person and my life with him for the past 4+ years has been a lot like what you said in your post. I feel so grateful to experience normalcy, emotional stability and proper everyday reasoning and so in my thirties I've learnt life skills for which there used to be a huge gap.",
            "He sounds like a great person. Its okay to want your partner to give you care and comfort in a non sexual way. I didn't have the greatest family growing up. My boyfriend gives me some really sweet things that I've been missing out on, stuff that is just for comfort and not sexual. He bundles me up in blankets when im having a rough day, makes me cute breakfasts, encourages me in school, gets me treats like ice cream. It's not weird to enjoy a partner to give you more care and comfort, and totally understandable that your feeling this way considering everything you've been through.\n\nThat being said, I don't know if I'd phase it as wanting him to be your dad, but more just, wanting him to give you comfort and care.",

So, here it is. \n\nI had a long talk with my daughter Sarah that night. I sat her down and described the circumstances of the discovery. I explained that I was worried because it's a large sum of money and I didn't want her savings to be stolen. \n\nWell, turns out the elderly neighbor, Anne, has been giving her cash for the better part of a year now. Anne wanted her to have the money to help with college expenses, and told Sarah to keep it a secret from me because I've always refused to accept money from her. Sarah also told me that part of the money was her own. She had been saving up for my birthday present and didn't want to put it in the savings account because, well, she'd have to ask me and it wouldn't be a surprise anymore. \n\nLater in the conversation, I brought up the expensive clothing. Those were throwaways from her friend's mother. Her friend is really tall so she couldn't wear them and gave them to Sarah instead. They needed some slight alterations so she hasn't worn them yet. I apologized for snooping and explained that as a father, I was obviously concerned for her well-being. I also assured her that we are financially stable and that I've put aside enough money for her college expenses. I told her to keep an eye out for Anne, to make sure that her welfare is not affected by the money she's paying Sarah. Also, I asked her to write a thank-you card to her friend's mom and to include a present for her at Christmas this year.  \n\nAfter the revelations, I wanted to reward her for her savings habit, so I offered to start a checking account for her and we looked into the options online. Turns out, the bank I use offers a junior checking which I can co-sign (overdraft fees, etc) for her. It turns into her own personal account at 18. She'll have the use of a debit card, the bank also offers an online-based financial planning guide, so she will read that before starting the account. We're going to the local branch to set that up for her this weekend.\n\nSarah seemed to reflect well to our talk. She took the opportunity to reveal that she has been in a relationship for a couple of months. I've actually met her girlfriend a few times before, they go to the same school and I just thought they were good friends so that was a surprise. So yes, she came out of the closet to me. \n\nBeing a dad, I still verified the clothing story with her friend's mom. Overall, I'm happy it was just me dramatically overreacting. However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess. \n\nP/S: I didn't reduce her allowance but did encourage her to keep saving because it's an excellent habit. \n\n---   \n**tl;dr**: Money from neighbor, clothes from friend's mom, so she's getting her own checking account. She also disclosed she's in a relationship. Worst of all, my tortured soul is left wondering what she's buying for my birthday.\n",

            "YAY! I knew it would all come out in the wash. You handled that awesomely, OP, and I hope I do the same when/if I'm a mom.\n\nAlso, the whole revealing her orientation bit? Yeah, that wouldn't have happened if you'd gone charging in, all a flutter and ready to accuse of wrongdoing. So extra kudos to you for illustrating how calm and reasoned conversation reaps great benefits! :)",
            ">However, I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had. As a parent, it's astonishing sometimes how quickly your child grows up. Just another part of the learning process I guess.\n\nNever feel bad for caring for your daughter's well being.  You handled everything extremely well, and that's supported by your daughter trusting you enough to come out to you.\n\nTake care.",
            "You're an amazing dad or in general an amazing parent. Once you said you lived in a big city I figured those clothes had to be second hand. Also I was basically a lot like your daughter. Everyone thought of me as the house bank because I always had a great deal of money socked away.",

            "The minuscule amount the daughter's sexuality plays into this post is the correct amount.",
            "> I do feel rather guilty for the minor panic attack I had.\n\nDon't feel guilty, because your daughter didn't ever see that. All she saw was a Dad who loved and trusted her. She saw this so well she trusted you enough to come out to you. \n\nI have had plenty of friends whose parents would have immediately flipped out at them. You took a step back, calmed down, and thought about it. You approached her in a  calm manner, focused on helping her. \n\nPanic is a natural response, its what you do after the panic that really matters, and you did the right thing. \n\n",

            "You seen like a great Dad. That was really well handled. ",
            "You responded the way any parent who actually gives two shits about their kids would. You handled this incredibly well. Teenagers know their parents will go through their stuff sometimes, so it's great you apologized to her for it, but you shouldn't feel bad. You're her dad. It's not like you're controlling every aspect of their lives but if you don't find these things in the hiding places, you lose the chance to help them if you find something concerning. \n\nYour daughter sounds very level headed, I think it's great that you've actually extended some more responsibility to her rather than punishing her or being more strict. \n\nYou should invite her girlfriend around some time. Foster this relationship with your daughter, let her know that you don't care who she likes. Maybe make dinner or something. \n\nSeriously, well done. ",
            "All in all, this is a great resolution.  Nothing bad was happening, you and your daughter have talked about things you previously hadn't been, and you've built a stronger bond.",
