It ended up that we were lucky that his transgression (forging a document) ended up being mostly covered up except that he was fired... He didn't end up with legal repercussions at least.\n\nJay ended up starting a new career teaching in our field. He's doing so well that he has been promoted recently to an associate professor position at a well respected college. Everyone loves him as a teacher.\n\nThere are so many more stories about this that I'm writing a memoir (but damn, I'm not a good writer!). Like the person that first reported him ended up being in love with me and I had to get a restraining order against him...\n\nIn sadder news, after supporting him for two years as he got his life together, I've fallen into depression and alcoholism. Apparently this happens sometimes to caretakers? I'm still keeping it together at work somehow, but could definitely be excelling if it wasn't for the drinking... I'm working on it and have just started going to AA, but it's definitely something that we need to work on in therapy more (which we both go to). \n\nI hope to provide you a super happy update where we both are crushing it in the near future, but for now, this is where we are at. \n\nOpen to suggestions from those that have been through related situations.\n\nTldr: my bf messed up a few years ago and I currently feel the consequences. I need to forgive him. Looking for good experiences related to this.",

            "Hey OP!\n\nI cared for my (now ex-) girlfriend for 18 months while she had significant mental health issues, and also turned to alcohol as a way of coping. It went badly for me, and I stopped drinking just after New Year.\n\nI can highly recommend the /r/stopdrinking subreddit (are you allowed to link subreddits on this subreddit?), as it provided me with a lot of support and comfort when I was struggling.\n\nTherapy is always useful, but have you seen a psychiatrist too? You and the psych may decide to try a medication such as an SSRI (which I've been prescribed), and they can really help! Also, is the type of therapy you're receiving the most suitable for your situation? I'm receiving trauma-focused CBT, but could have gone for EMDR, as I was diagnosed with PTSD after everything had settled. Might just be something to think about!\n\nBest of luck with everything ahead - I hope your partner is supporting you.",
            "Getting sober *is* crushing it. \n\nYou might like r/stopdrinking...",
            "OP, congrats to the both of you for surviving that mess! And I'm sorry that you're now suffering from the ashfall. I hope he'll support you as you did him. Either way, you've shown a strength of character that a lot don't have. I believe in you, OP. It might take a long while before you recover but I think you're in the right path. With your persevering nature, I believe you can overcome anything. Hugs from Asia!\n\nEDIT:\n\nSorry, but I forgot to mention. My SO did me a doozy that took a long while to forgive, too. Not like the professional misdemeanor in your case, but a huge blow in my trust for him nonetheless. \n\nI struggled and became an alcoholic for a while, until that ate into my work performance and wallet. But I came around especially because he never left my side, apologized properly, and atoned for his sin in his own ways. Not immediately, and certainly not consistently, but slowly into a positive trend, I got back to proper working condition and cut the alcoholism to the social kind. \n\nUnfortunately, the revived smoking habit wasn't so easy to overcome, and I'm struggling with it even now. \n\nMental fortitude helped a lot, for the both of us. We needed each other after what he did, and that's what in the end, helped us most. Had we both been hesitant in our decisions and flaky on our acts of forgiveness, I don't think we'd have endured. Still, OP, whenever I remember what he did, a little bit of resentment ebbs in. In those moments I remember to forgive him, to remember everything good that came after the fact. And there's a lot of good. \n\nSo yeah, it's very important to invest in happy little memories and to restrengthen the bond after such a clusterfuck. You know, so you can create *new* pathways to happiness after the perfect one you thought the both of you would have, is no longer possible.",
            ">Like the person that first reported him ended up being in love with me and I had to get a restraining order against him... \n\nWait, did the person who reported him do it because he thought it gave him a chance with you?

When we have to keep it all together because the person we love is falling apart, that can lead to an unhealthy relationship and burnout, fatigue, frustration, loss of self and ultimately major strain on the relationship. I'm not saying that you have an unhealthy relationship right now, but you might want to look into it just to check and make sure that it doesn't develop that way.",

Does it kind of feel like he\u2019s been rewarded for his mistake and in some sense you\u2019ve been punished? I\u2019m not trying to attack you or be in your face, it just seems like there\u2019s a lot of potential for resentment on your part. Outside of therapy, I don\u2019t really have advice for you.

            "Hey, just wanted to say that quitting drinking is incredibly difficult, but absolutely doable. I just passed 2 years sober myself. You CAN do it, but you need to stick to it, recovery isn't a one time process, it's a lifelong process. Especially with drinking because it is a large part of culture and you will find yourself in situations where alcohol is around all the time. Go to AA (or CA, NA, CMA, etc), go to groups, find other people around you who are in recovery and build yourself a support network. Figure out what your triggers are, write them down and figure out ways to get yourself THROUGH those situations. Have people to call, find stuff to do in your idle time. Learn about thinking errors, this is a big part of recovery and STAYING sober. Also I second the suggestions to learn about codependency. It doesn't mean that you are just overly dependant on your boyfriend, it's much more involved than that, and is a really interesting topic to learn about.",

My dad had one for many years. Yet, you are even taking steps to attack that issue - professional help is the best thing you can do for yourself. My dad was able to successfully quit. He made a promise to me and my sister on the day before her wedding that we would never drink again, except to share a single beer with me on my 21st birthday. He went on to keep that promise for the rest of his life. If he can do it, I know you can kick the problem!\n\nI wish I had good advice for your other issues at hand (handling depression, forgiving your husband, etc) but I simply don't have enough experience with these issues. If you think these are really big problems in your life, I strongly recommend seeing professional help, in fact it's possible these issues are things you can talk about and address healthily in AA, so you might not even have to shell out for additional therapy. That help will likely be more valuable than anything you'll get on reddit.",

        "selftext": "My bf and I have been together over a year and living together about 6 months. He\u2019s an EXTREMELY light sleeper. We never used to have problems but I\u2019m now on medicine that causes me to have more insomnia so it\u2019s harder for me to fall asleep. Lately, we\u2019ve gotten into fights because he\u2019s being absolutely unrealistic about any noise in general. I can\u2019t clear my throat quietly, sneeze or even yawn without him grumbling, groaning, or yelling at me at how \u201cloud\u201d I\u2019m being. When I say yawn, I don\u2019t mean some exaggerated TV yawn, but literally the sound of me silently taking in and expelling air from my mouth 3-4x over the course of 2 hours sets him off. Sneezing is very rare and it\u2019s also quiet but if I have to make any noise, I do it as silently as possible, but it\u2019s not enough for him. When I was extremely sick with the cold, he made ME sleep on the couch because I was having a tough time sleeping without being able to actually blow my nose to breathe. But, when he caught it a week later, I gladly let him sleep in the bed and helped take care of him when he woke up in the night because he wasn\u2019t feeling well. \n\nI\u2019ve argued with him multiple times that it\u2019s unfair for him to expect absolute silence and be mad over the AIR he hears from a YAWN but he just shuts me down and tells me to be quiet because I\u2019ve disturbed him from being \u201cright on the edge of sleep.\u201d I understand that when you\u2019re half asleep you\u2019re particularly grumpy, we\u2019ve all been there, but it winds me all the way up that I already constantly have to cater to the way he needs tons of space (meaning I have to sleep pencil straight all night or on the side not facing him if I want to move my legs at all) and then this sound thing. I\u2019ve had previous bf\u2019s who were heavy sleepers that snored, made lots of noise and honestly that bothered me less than constantly having to be alert to his needs. \n\nHe says that ear plugs don\u2019t work and he only likes to hear the fan so white noise is out of the question. I don\u2019t want to go downstairs because then I\u2019ll just stay up and I don\u2019t want to keep taking melatonin every night but I\u2019m this close to not renewing our lease together next year if things don\u2019t change. It also makes me feel like if we got married and had kids he\u2019d just expect me to be up all the time dealing with the baby so he can sleep or complaining about his sleep or if one of us was to have a chronic sickness that we\u2019d have to sleep in different bedrooms because of how selfish he is. What should I do? \n\nTL;DR: bf is being selfish and unrealistic about any noise, no matter how quiet, that disrupts him from sleeping\n\nEdit: for now, sleeping in separate bedrooms would not be an option since we live with 2 other roommates until we graduate from college in May so the only other spot is the couch which would be inconvenient for everyone involved. Also, I\u2019m not the kind of person that wants to sleep separate from their partner if I can help it.\n\nEdit 2: WOW. This is my first post to have ever blown up. Thank you everybody for all your insightful responses! Truthfully, a lot of you are correct in the fact that his selfishness and gaslighting extends to many other parts of the relationship. There have been many times where we\u2019ve almost broken up but he always wants us to work out so it doesn\u2019t happen. Personally, I had life threatening blood clots in my lungs over the summer (hence the medicine I have to take to live which makes me an insomniac) that he was there for every step of the way. So it\u2019s hard to end the relationship after going through something like that with someone you love and worrying that the next person wouldn\u2019t get all the feelings that come with it. I\u2019m going to talk to him again and see what compromises HE can bring to the table. If not, I think it\u2019s time for a break.",

            "He\u2019s a bad partner. Not because it\u2019s difficult to sleep with, because he completely refuses to compromise with you. What else does he completely refuse to compromise about? What is it like negotiating with him generally?\n\nWe move through the different stages of a relationship basically trying to find somebody that we can form a long-term relationship with. Each stage of the relationship from the initial attraction, through to putting IKEA furniture together, or putting up a tent in the rain, teaches us something about the compatibility of that partner. \n\nSo it\u2019s not about your sleeping patterns, it\u2019s about the broader compatibility within a relationship where he is not prepared to negotiate a compromise on something which affects both of you. \n\nYou\u2019ve reached a point in the relationship where, unless he is prepared to change, you can go no further, because you simply don\u2019t have a functional partnership with someone who\u2019s not prepared to negotiate, compromise, or change. And if you can\u2019t do this about something as straightforward as sleep, then you are quite right - you cannot have children with him.

            "I\u2019m a light sleeper and my partner snores really badly. Like so badly, that when we shared a hotel room with friends, they couldn\u2019t sleep soundly and asked me how I deal with it.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve agreed on, is that I can lightly shake him, ask him to turn over, or even turn him on his side myself if he\u2019s not being responsive. It doesn\u2019t affect his sleep quality and it stops the snoring long enough for me to fall asleep.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t get to yell at him for yawning, sneezing, or making noise. That\u2019s absurd. And on the rare occasions he\u2019s just too loud, I get up and move somewhere else. I don\u2019t kick him out of bed.\n\nI think you either need to come to an agreement with your partner about what constitutes \u201ctoo much noise\u201d, what actions can be taken, etc. or get separate rooms. Right now he\u2019s being too selfish and frankly dramatic over normal human noises. And in my opinion, unless there\u2019s extreme circumstances the partner with the problem with noise should get up and move, not force their partner to sleep on the couch.\n\nEDIT: also I would think twice before having kids with this guy if you don\u2019t want to be stuck doing more than your fair share of childcare.

If you want to stay with this guy by all means get separate bedrooms, plenty of successful couples swear by it. However, you do not deserve to be talked to this way or treated this way, whether it\u2019s about sleep or anything else.

You aren't doing anything that would require compromise on your part. \nAlso he should speak to a therapist, because a big part of why I am a light sleeper is my anxiety (my guard is always up). Therapy has helped me with techniques. I don't think that's necessarily your bf's issue, but therapy might uncover something and also help him be less of a giant dbag.",

            "I am the light sleeper here. I was worried about spending nights with my boyfriend when we started dating in college because he is heavy sleeper. Somehow I just got used to it after a while. I slept over 1-3 times a week for 3.5 years before we moved in together 6 months ago. I am still a light sleeper but those small things like yawning or something don\u2019t wake me now usually, it just takes times but if he\u2019s fixated on it being a problem then it won\u2019t resolve. He\u2019s gotta relax about it a little bit. Then again I\u2019ve seen several stories about couples sleeping in different rooms and it makes their relationship better. \n\nThere have also been nights where I\u2019m falling asleep and he can\u2019t get comfortable which then wakes me up again and it\u2019s frustrating but they don\u2019t happen often. It\u2019s about communication and compromise but if something really can\u2019t change that\u2019s a bigger convo for sure.\n\nWhen I still lived at home and during hs I was angry like him regarding my family being loud. \n\nFans help drown out some of those smaller noises.",

She had problems sleeping at night(high anxiety) and any noise I would make (occasional snoring, breathing, moving, etc.) would trigger her.    \n\n\nShe was generally unhappy with her life and I believe this 'annoyance' was a symptom of that larger issue.  It sounds likes maybe this guy has some larger issues that he's projecting on you.",
            "My ex grumbled and made me fee guilty about my constant \u2018tossing and turning\u2019 in the night that kept him up. He insisted i control how I slept at night, like how does anyone do that? But I was stupid and wanting to please the man who was voluntarily unemployed and living off his parent\u2019s money I started sleeping straight jacket style and being terrified of disturbing him. One of the best things about the break up was not having to feel guilty about something I couldn\u2019t control. I guess what I\u2019m saying is your bf is a selfish idiot and breaking up with him is probably the wisest option.",
            "I'm a light sleeper/insomniac. He should try sleep med because anyway it's not a way of living, for 20 years I lived with it until its started to affect my job during the day (I'm working in a daycare, you have to be on alert all the time). Its just get worse when you get older(I'm 30 years old) so he will need help with it later in in life. \n\nI try 3 time to get meds, the first(19) and second(23) time the doctors totally refused, saying I was too young for this, its has really bad side effect and create a addictive effect. But when I stared to not functioning normally at my job and could not take it anymore, the third doctor finally said yes 5 months ago! A new meds was out by then, no side effect, no addictive effect. BRO ITS CHANGE MY LIFE, finally I can get now 8 hours straight of sleep without waking up! Only one thing, I can not take it every day, only 3 to 4 time a week or 24h delays between or else my body get use to it and stop working. So I take it only if I work the next day. \n\nIts ridiculous that he is acting like this with you because HE doesn't sleep well. I feel so bad when I have insomnia because i toss around a lot and I dont want to wake up my partner. Because you know its really feel awful to have sleep deprivation so I dont want my partner have it too, just logic here. If you are a young couple and he is already acting like that, it's not going to be better it's going to worst. He need to make compromise, see a doctor's, try to found a solution because he is the one having this problem, not you.",

I\u2019ve had partners like yours before, and that behavior was not isolated and was one of multiple red flags.",
            "I\u2019m the light sleeper in my relationship. Sometimes my fianc\u00e9 wakes me up at night and I can\u2019t go back to sleep, so I go to the couch. Or I take a Benadryl so I sleep through the shuffling noises and movement when he gets into bed. He compromises by coming to bed earlier so the shuffling in the bed doesn\u2019t wake me. He is considerate of my needs, and I also take ownership of myself when I know being a light sleeper is my problem and not his. I would sit down with him in the day time, in a calm environment, and talk about this one more time. He needs to take ownership of himself - be it through removing himself from the situation because he is the one with the problem, ear plugs, a noise machine, or medication. If he refuses all solutions except the one where you sleep like a silent pencil, ask yourself this - do I want to spend the rest of my life with a man who won\u2019t compromise with me and who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m suffering, too?",
            "He seems extremely unreasonable and is likely incompatible with you due to his douchey behavior. Sorry you are having to deal with that. \n\nFor the short term though, maybe try a white noise app on your phone that has a fan sound setting. I'm a light sleeper and insomniac, and I have an app like that so I can have the fan sound to drown out other noises without having an actual fan blowing air in the room.",
            "Okay so everyone here is pretty right, so I'll be lame and bring up earplugs. I thought they didn't work for me either BUT I found silicone putty ones that are amazing at blocking out sound. I work 3rd shift so I needed something comfortable and that works really well since I live in a first-floor apartment and the neighbor above me is a new mom + stays home all day.\n\nBut aside from that tbh I don't think the earplugs I mentioned would help because he sounds like he doesn't want to even try.",

He might need some therapy to work through building resentment over this issue.\n\n\nWe now largely sleep in separate bedrooms, which I understand you can't do but keep in mind for the future - it's really saved our relationship. \n\n\nMaybe develop rules - either the person who can't fall asleep goes to the couch, or the person who is sick always gets the bed, etc.",
            "So my understanding is that one person is caring (you) and the other person enjoys that care but doesn't return it (bf). At least in this way. Maybe he is wonderful outside of this. BUT sleep is so important for your health and even the relationship itself. \n\nYour bf should care about your quality of sleep the same way you care about his. This means he should be willing to compromise because clearly you have been, except it's less like compromise and more like letting bf get his way without him having any consideration of you. \n\nAnd making you sleep on the couch when you're sick... you deserve the bed when you need to rest and heal. \n\nI really hope you figure this out and maybe bf is going through something, but if you decide to end things that's okay too. Support all around as long as you do what's best for you! <3",
            "Run Forest, run as far away as possible from this type of attitude and lack of respect. Seriously.",
            "> Also, I\u2019m not the kind of person that wants to sleep separate from their partner if I can help it.\n\nFirst, let me touch on this. I'd bet that pretty much every couple who sleeps separately thought the same thing at one time. I did too.\n\nBut when you find someone who is otherwise an absolutely perfect person for you, kind in every way, 100% compatible.. sleeping apart is nothing. My boyfriend is without a doubt \"my person\". I'm the light sleeper (I was never rude/angry to him). It was cutting horribly into my quality of life and I was miserable. I was getting up after a few hours of horrible sleep and moving to the guest bedroom every night.\n\nOnce we finally called it like it is and I started just going to bed directly in the other room, my sleep improved dramatically. We occasionally sleep in the same bed -- when I'm drunk and could sleep through a fire.. or when we get a hotel. But even then, we get double queens if we can help it. (It wasn't so much the sound for me as it was the heat of sharing a bed)\n\nALL OF THAT BEING SAID -\n\nYour boyfriend is acting like a jerk. This isn't about sleeping together or separately. This isn't about each person's sleep patterns. This is about how he is treating you for something that you cannot help.\n\nIt sounds like you don't have a lot of options as far as the sleeping situation goes. So I'd say, in this order, I would:\n\n1. Talk to boyfriend and tell him exactly what you laid out here. Tell him he needs to look into ear plugs, white noise, whatever. They have soft headbands you can sleep in that have bluetooth speakers in them, even. Tell him he needs to consider melatonin (take 1-2 hours before bed, it is not a sleeping pill) or other non-addictive sleep aids.\n\n2. If the above does not work, it sounds like you have no other choice but the couch. You can't kick him out of the home (would be nice), nor can you just leave the home if you have nowhere else to go, so there's not a lot of option left. I'd tell him that if he cannot handle sleeping with you and wants you to take the couch, that needs to come out of his rent. No way should you be paying equal share to not have a bedroom. If he refuses, then he needs to go to the couch. If he won't, make him miserable enough to do so.\n\nI have to echo what others are saying as well.\n\nIt is too little too late, but you really shouldn't be living with boyfriends after only 6 months as college students. I'll even go further with what I am sure might be an unpopular opinion around here, but couples living together in a bedroom with multiple other roommates is a recipe for disaster. You have nowhere to go in the home to escape when you need it, because your home is shared with two other people. That is crowded and miserable.",
            "I dated a guy exactly like this when I was about your age. He would hear me snore and start punching walls and swearing and I'd wake up so scared and confused. I ended up getting nasal strips, which still weren't good enough. And then I ended up getting my tonsils out which still wasn't good enough. \nHe never compromised on anything either. We broke up, which was my decision but of course he somehow had me feeling like I was dumped. \nIt was all emotional abuse tactics and just straight up immaturity.\n\nHe needs to grow up, OP, and be a respectful partner , make compromises or sleep on the damn couch. Or you just throw the whole boyfriend out. But his reactions are meant to guilt you for something you can't even control. He needs to chill or GTFO. \n\nIf he won't change, seriously consider ending things. Because that kind of behavior isn't going to stay in just one part of the relationship and eventually one of you will end things - it's better for it to be you who takes on that power and not have him trample on you in that way too.",
            "There is a thing called misophonia. My partner has it. It's sensitivity to sound. Often to specific sounds. So for him it's chewing, snoring etc. During the day we are good. At night... well, if I'm snoring unless he's absolutely shattered, no chance. Sometimes even slightly heavy breathing will wake him and then he just zones in on it. It's not something that he can help. \n\nHe can help not being an asshole about it. He used to go to couch or spare bed when he couldn't get to sleep. He tried initially to power through, but he would end up tossing and disturbing me. Now we have our bedroom set up in one room, and spare bed in room next door so he doesn't have to go across the house to get sleep, and so that we can still be near. I go over in the morning for snuggles if he ends up moving. \n\nHe has never ever done any accusations about me ruining his sleep- he knows it's his head that's messed up. I try and be sensitive and use nasal spray etc. I also don't guilt trip him or throw shit fits about him sleeping separate (his exes did). \n\nWe have tried ear plugs, even the Bose white noise which were decent but he would often only need them partway through the night and would then have to turn on his phone, start the app etc. Plus even those aren't super comfortable long term. \n\nYour boyfriend is being a childish and selfish. If he can't sleep he can go to the couch. I would tell him that he's being unreasonable and selfish. And that if he can't sort his shit out that you won't renew the lease with him.",
            "I have the same problem as your BF: can only sleep with fan noise, will wake up at the SLIGHTEST SOUND. Earplugs DO NOT WORK. I also suffer from insomnia, so If I DO manage to fall asleep and I get woken up, it's game over.

There was alot of fighting and alot of nights with one of us on the couch. At several points, we even debated breaking up because we just weren't suitable. But I found sleeping headphones! And they work! I play a YouTube fan through the sleep headphones and it drowns out most noise. If I'm having a particularly sleepless night, I can put in earplugs under the headphones. I also started taking Unisom with Doxylamine instead of diphenhydramine. These two factors along with a regular bedtime helped me immensely.\n\nI hope you two find something that works for you.

Otherwise, **he** needs to sleep by himself because he is the one with the unusual behavior.\n\n\n\nAs an aside and perhaps more importantly, the way he is treating you is completely unacceptable. Next time, you should absolutely ***refuse*** to leave the bed and he can sleep elsewhere. \n\n>  Also, I\u2019m not the kind of person that wants to sleep separate from their partner if I can help it\n\nThis may be an incompatibility then, because unless he can learn to manage his issue, and yes, it is his issue, this is going to persist.",

Have you sat down and explained to him \"Look, I'm doing all I can, you have to figure something out for you to try if this isn't enough\"? Cause yeah, imagine what this is going to be like when there's a baby wailing almost 24/7 in your house and it's time for him to go to sleep.

When a lot of people hear a couple is sleeping separately their first thought is \u201cwow they\u2019re having problems\u201d or \u201cthey must not love each other anymore.\u201d The general notion in society is that sharing a bed with your partner is supposed to feel wonderful and intimate and safe if things are going well. But that\u2019s all just stigma. No one gets to tell you that your relationship is bad or failing because you don\u2019t meet their expectations of what a relationship should be. \n\nMy dad and my stepmom had separate bedrooms for their whole relationship (about 10yrs, he\u2019s passed away) and they were very happy with that arrangement. My stepmom went to bed pretty early. My dad was a night owl/insomniac who snored louder than anyone I\u2019ve ever heard. Every night my stepmom would go to bed and my dad would go tuck her in and they\u2019d cuddle and talk and then he would go back to watching tv or doing chores or eating dinner at 10pm like a weirdo. He usually had to be listening to something to fall asleep too, so them trying to sleep in the same bed really wouldn\u2019t have worked out well. \n\nIf you\u2019re really not happy, I don\u2019t want to convince  you to stay. But if this is the only big problem, I would try sleeping separately (when you can) and see if that helps. It sounds like neither of you have been sleeping well for a while and I know I can be really irritable when that happens. Just remember that your relationship is YOUR relationship. It is not less successful or happy just because it\u2019s not exactly the same as other successful happy relationships you see.",
            "Ahahaaaa I tend to be guilty of this (not yelling but grumbling). It sucks, but I really cannot sleep when my husband is awake. He'll snort his nose loudly, keep on turning, making all sorts of weird sounds. It pisses him off because he can't just be normal (according to him) in bed, he's feeling guilty for even the slightest movement, and it pisses me off because he's keeping me awake and that is not the best time of day to keep me from my physical needs. I'm not doing it on purpose, but the slightest sounds and movements wake me up and that's fine, but if they keep happening, I can't fall back asleep. The way you describe yourself sounds like an absolute nightmare for me to be in bed with.\n\nReally the only solution is to sleep in separate beds if either one of us has trouble Falling back asleep. (My husband is a light sleeper himself so fortunately he does understand why I keep waking up). So if one of us has a cold, the other one moves to another bedroom. And yes, I can imagine that if we have a child and I'll have to breastfeed at night, we'll be sleeping separately as well, to not ruin both our night's sleep. It does not however mean we love each other less, and when neither of us is stressed or has a cold, we can sleep together fine. It's ok to sleep separately if that's better for your health :)",
            "I am an extremely light sleeper, and I deal with it with wax ear plugs. It took me two weeks to get used to them, and now I sleep way better. \nCommunicate with your bf, and maybe suggest this solution. He might be irritable because he is tired but he can t expect you to tiptoe that much around him. This is not healthy in any relationship. \n\nAlso, he might want to go to a doctor, because there might be an underlying cause to this sleep problem (sleep apnea and so on).\n\nCommunication is the key, and if speaking about it does not work, maybe try writing, I find it easier to communicate about sensitive issues.",

            "My wife and I have a similar problem, we finally settled on using a loud fan in our room at night. (Literally bought a fan off Amazon that had bad reviews because it was so loud).

He will most likely leave all of the middle-of-night child rearing to you. And there\u2019s a lot the first few years at least. \n\nHowever, on the off-chance that his light sleeping and your insomnia can be solved, you should both go to doctors about those issues. Sleep medicines can be prescribed so that you are taking safe amounts and not just guessing with melatonin. And he may need some, too, because \u201clight sleeping\u201d like that sounds like there\u2019s an underlying medical issue.",
            "As someone who is also a light sleeper: get a Honeywell fan and have him turn it on high right next to him facing away. They are loud but smoothly loud so it's not distracting.\n\nBeing a light sleeper sucks, people who aren't light sleepers don't know how frustrating it is and how every little noise is like pins being jabbed into your skin. \n\nHe should try the fan though. And if you are sick he should sleep on the couch if he has difficulty sleeping.",
            "A fan is literally a white noise maker....that is literally the sound it produces.\n\nIt's not you that's the problem it's him. Maybe he should be taking the melatonin (which btw only helps you fall asleep not stay asleep so this might be part of the problem right there) so suggest to him if he's such a light sleeper that he finds a sleep aid that keeps him asleep(I'm a light sleeper as well but not this bad) maybe he needs a sleep study to show why he's such a light sleeper. Idk...but he's the problem NOT YOU.\n\nIde also talk to your doctor about maybe getting a different med. Having constant insomnia just really isn't ok, because the next day your body just has that much of a harder time dealing.",

You're walking on eggshells.\n\nWhat's worse? He refuses to do anything to fix it for himself. Earplugs WOULD work, but he doesn't want to. White noise WOULD work, but he doesn't want to. Both of these ideas are reasonable solutions. He just wants you to be silent or not there at all. That is the only thing that will satisfy him, and that is not a reasonable solution.\n\nHe's trying to control your behaviour instead of dealing with a physiologic problem effectively. Is that the kind of life you want for yourself? What about any future children you may have?\n\nI'm very sorry for you.",

You can be in love with someone and be in a long-term, monogamous relationship, but you don't have to sleep in the same bed. Not all couples can sleep in the same bed, sometimes it doesn't work (like if one is a light sleeper and one isn't!). I don't know the size place you live in, but if you've got another room or space you can turn into a bedroom, just get your own room, or make him get his own. In my own relationships where we've lived together, I've always had separate bedrooms. We can still sleep in each other's room when we want, but when one of us is sick, or struggling to sleep, or stays up later, etc., we have our own space. It's really not that big of a deal, and this sounds like it might just be better to toss out whatever archaic ideas we all have about what cohabiting relationships look like and do something different that's also awesome and helpful :)",
            "I had a husband like that, once.  It gave me lasting insomnia that I'm only now getting over.  I was snoring, I know that's unpleasant - but he was worse.  Every time I drifted off he'd push or shove me roughly to get me to stop, and completely wake me up.  Then I'd lay for hours, afraid to fall asleep and start snoring again.  I couldn't relax in my own bed at all.\n\n I went and got a cpap.  So, I stopped snoring, but then he complained about the sound of the machine.  I moved into my studio and slept in the daybed there.  He complained that I left our bed, so I felt guilty all the time because I couldn't do sleep right.  He refused to do anything about it but complain and poke, until I dreaded night time.\n\nFinally got divorce for other reasons, but ultimately it was because he was a selfish person.  I don't miss him at all and I sleep a lot better.\n\nYour guy is being totally unreasonable, OP.  This won't end well because you can't control how you sleep.",

            "I had a bf around your age who did the EXACT same thing. Honestly, it\u2019s something much deeper than \u201clight sleeper\u201d, usually either extreme anxiety or depression. It took years for me to figure that out, but it didn\u2019t get better and his demands for how quiet i should be just got out of control. I couldn\u2019t even open drawers to get clothes in the mornings when i was changing for work (when i say morning, I\u2019m talking 11am while he was still \u201ctrying to sleep\u201d, as he was unemployed). He wasn\u2019t a bad person, but i definitely started to resent him for it. Turns out it was depression changing him. \n\nYou have to put your foot down here. Set YOUR boundaries. We as girls often get gaslighted because we start doubting how reasonable we actually are when our partners criticise us. It\u2019s easy to get sucked in, so i recommend physically writing down what you deem reasonable. Sneezing - unavoidable, therefore reasonable. Yawning - natural, therefore reasonable. Shuffling around or tossing/turning when you\u2019re having a sleepless night - reasonable. Have you already compromised for him, or were you super stubborn (unlikely)? If you have tried to compromise, has HE tried to compromise to meet YOU halfway? Is HE being reasonable? Are YOUR needs being met? \nIf not, then practice putting your foot down. YOU have to be assertive about your needs, no one will do it for you. If you find him resisting coming to a compromise, ask him why. Tell him that you will absolutely not stop yawning as it is a natural human function. If he is so bothered by any sound you make, by the indication that you exist, then he needs to figure out if he can cohabitate with another human. You gotta set the rules. Let him know he has options - ear plugs are a lifesaver, i use them when my snoring ex slept over. The couch for HIM is another option when he can\u2019t sleep, etc. There are a million options, he has no excuse to not try them.\n\nRemember, if he is not happy by your presence, and you being a human next to him is causing these reactions in him, it\u2019s not at all about the noise itself and is a much deeper issue.\n\nGood luck!",

            "The fact that he says ear plugs don't work and he can't listen to white noise aside from the fan and that you haven't indicated he has apologized to you for his behavior when he is fully awake during the day are all red flags to me. \n\nLike, yes, he is a very light sleeper. I am sure he has anxiety about sleep and feels frustrated when he is disturbed. He has real, valid feelings. But what about you?? \n\nYou are the one with insomnia! You ALSO have sleep problems which he is not respecting. Where is his sympathy? Neither of you are having an easy time sleeping. Where is his willingness to compromise? He is your partner and he should be concerned for your well being as well as his own. He should also feel embarrassed at how snippy he is when he is falling asleep and apologize! \n\nIt bothers me that he is not willing to try things that inconvenience him to work with you. \n\nI think that you should show him this post - or write a letter to him based on it - and read it aloud to him during the day when he can listen to you. If he is apologetic and reassuring and willing to try to compromise and work with you, great! If he is defensive, minimizing of your problems, mean, or rude - take that as your sign that he is not likely to be a great long-term partner and find somewhere new to live at the end of your lease.\n\nA long-term partner should have empathy, concern, gentleness, patience, and a heart open to compromise. They should want to solve problems with you. If he doesn't do those things, do you really want to be with him?",

It was nothing to this extreme though, he just insisted on listening to ASMR or stories while sleeping, and I can't sleep with noise. We found some headphones that he can sleep with and we no longer have a TV by our bed, so it's all good now. \n\nBut it kind of sounds like your guy isn't willing to compromise at all. I mean, I would suggest getting some good and comfortable ear plugs for him, and I really don't see why he's not willing to do that. Also, if you haven't, you should definitely have a conversation with him when none of you are tired or busy. Because I know just how frustrating it is to not be able to sleep well because of someone else. He needs to know that his sleeping habits are a serious problem and obviously you can't control the noises that your body naturally makes, so he's the one that has to do something about it.",

If he can't find a compromise for this, I cannot imagine what he would be like with the constant interruptions of kids.\n\nSometimes its hard to take that step to leave, but if, after clear communication and attempts to find a way to make this work, he isn't meeting you in the middle, you should consider leaving. You are so young still, don't waste time with someone who doesn't see you as an equal partner in the relationship. Especially if you want children, they are exhausting and are wedges in relationships, you need to be a strong team. Good luck.",

I wear earplugs, occasionally take sleeping pills, nap while he's out whenever I can, and suck it up. Trust me, it frustrates me some days and some days I want to be an ass about it but I control myself. We've lived together for over a year, I've lost a lot of sleep to it, but I don't think I've ever seriously gotten on his case about it. I know he can't help it and I know constantly ragging on him for it would just stress him out and ruin his sleep more too. Why would I do that to someone I love? Why would I decide his sleep is less important than mine? He's clearly not sleeping that well either (just like you) and I worry about that more than anything.\n\nYour boyfriend doesn't.

He needs to medicate and wear ear plugs. He can get a vibrating watch alarm that he can wear to bed to wake him or the gentle light slowly turning on thing. Next time he starts yelling, just say \"sounds like a you problem\" and roll back over. You deserve comfortable sleep too. Prioritize yourself. Either he'll realize he has to stop being an unrealistic ass or he'll move out. Either way is a win for you. He can be the one sleeping on the couch.\n\nI started an anti depressant recently and it makes me have a harder time with sleep. I used to sleep like the dead, you could literally have a conversation with me and I would have no recollection. Now I wake up frequently but I would never dream of yelling at my husband for breathing. Or make him sleep on the couch when he was sick. You know why? Because it's a me problem.

            "Girl he's being selfish, look I get it, I'm not as light of a sleeper but small sounds tend to really bother me so I can relate, but I come up with other solutions, like earplugs, ear buds to put music over other sounds. Move rooms if it's getting too much. Example: the girl who sits behind me in my math class chews really loudly. Not with her mouth open or anything, just really crunchy things right behind me. I don't ask her to stop eating, I put in earbuds. Not everyone is going to cater to his needs, so he needs to come up with his own solutions. He could take some sleep medication, wear earplugs, probably other things but I haven't researched it. You don't need to stop existing while he's sleeping cause he can't come up with solutions himself.",

It was torture. I would get so angry with him but it wasn\u2019t his fault. There was nothing he could do to make them stop, and no reason for me to be mad but I would get so tired and be woken up seven to ten times every night. It wasn\u2019t the only reason we broke up, but a major one. \nEventually I started dating my partner now of six years. We sleep like BABIES together. There is the occasional frustration or someone is sick or what not, but we love going to sleep together and it\u2019s a joy to share a bed with him. If you want to spend your whole life with someone, find this. After the other things fade from the shiny newness of a relationship, sleeping is of paramount importance to having a good life.

            "From personal experience as long as you go to bed with the intention of getting a min of 8hrs of sleep, melatonin works wonders. It will keep you asleep. Its also natural and completely healthy. \n\nThe downside for me however was I felt fatigued if I didn't reach the 8hr mark which is why I stopped taking it since I now average 4 1/2-5hrs of sleep at night due to work.",
            "Separate beds, don't know why people have such an issue with this. I suffer with insomnia and am a light sleeper so only way that has worked for me. Mainly on work nights.",

            "Ear plugs work just fine. I know because I use them. The foamy are best for me. My ex could fall asleep in minutes but it takes me an hour or longer. Just when I was ready to go under she would begin light snoring. It would get louder as time went on. I could hear her fall off the deep end in her sleep, soooo relaxed, because then it would sound like me when I was drunk! I would just move to the other bedroom, no big deal. It\u2019s not her fault. She can hear herself while sleeping and make herself stop. It was my problem to deal with. So off I would go. Next morning she would ask why I left the bed. At first I would tell her because of her snoring. She would get mad and I would tell her not too. It got to a point that I said stop asking me why when I wake up in another room. But she couldn\u2019t. So I would just say I couldn\u2019t sleep. She tried everything to try to stop, all the products on the shelf. She would feel so bad. But I didn\u2019t care. I told her I don\u2019t care and it\u2019s MY problem not hers. Just like it\u2019s his problem. He is being unreasonable and it may be showing his upcoming personality. It your not being totally noisy, like jumping into bed when he\u2019s almost asleep, turning in lights, being loud with doors and such when he\u2019s trying to sleep. There is a level of due respect of quietness when someone is trying to go to sleep, but to stop breathing, not yawn, or roll over is ridiculous.  Bad move in his part having you sleep on couch when you were sick also! He\u2019s not treating you with respect and my guess is he will learn or become single. I tell you though, his actions sound like there might be a problem down the road. You\u2019ve only been together a year..... where\u2019s the love?",
            "> I don\u2019t want to keep taking melatonin every night \n\nWait, you must not take it everynight. You must have nights without it. Or your body will get lazy and stops to produce it on its own. It's my pharmacist which warned me. For those melatonin less night, I took phytotherapy instead. \n\n> When I was extremely sick with the cold, he made ME sleep on the couch because I was having a tough time sleeping without being able to actually blow my nose to breathe.\n\nHuge red flag. It's the one who doesnt want to sleep with the other one which leave the bed. Otherwise it becomes a punishment.",
            "I'm a deep sleeper who snores really loudly and my girlfriend is the exact opposite. At first I was anxious to sleep near her because she'd always have to wake me up to tell me I'm snore and I'd never want her to have a lack of sleep. I care about my partner's sleep and health and she cares about mine because sometimes she wouldn't want to wake me up and would instead just suffer through it. I think the fact that he doesn't care about your sleep and your comfort is a HUGE red flag.\n\nThe way we solved this was by compromising, and we both being a bit more inconvienced but we solved this issue. I think that it's bad that he doesn't care about you, but I think it's even worst that he doesn't want to give any leeway to helping your situation out as well. Significant others are suppose to care about each other and compromise, not prioritize solely their own comfort. This is such a bad sign for the future, and you'll see it start to show in other aspects of your relationships. Especially, once things start inconviencing him, our true colors will be shown. Is that really a future you want? \n\nJust know that there are so many other people who are more compatiable and will understand and try to work on things as opposed to brushing them off when they don't suit their needs and not your own.",

            "Try seeking couple therapy or counseling because you\u2019re in need of it. It\u2019s good to meet with counselor to talk about your feelings and workout a plan if you want this relationship to work. He\u2019s being selfish and I know this isn\u2019t fair -life isn\u2019t meant to become fair so we try to work things out for the best. I hope all goes well with you. At least he\u2019s not an abuser but does sound like a bully. He should take melatonin and dim off the lights. You can adjust your body to sleep in early to get needed rest. Really I\u2019d say fuck that and let him groan and mumble as you yawn or cough. It\u2019s natural, and farting too.",
            "Im a light sleeper, my bf is, my dad is, but we never done any of what you have mentioned. An earplugs should be what he opts for, rather than controlling the noise. I feel like this guy is so selfish",

            "I can be very easily disturbed by various noises or physical sensations when I'm trying to fall asleep. Usually it's my own anxiety/frustration that gets my adrenaline going and snowballs to a point where I'm too keyed up to sleep. It can be something out of my control like my partner snoring because he has a cold, or something totally self contained like not being able to find that one position where my shoulder doesn't feel weird.\n\nI use various different general anxiety management techniques to deal with it. Counting, forcing myself to focus on trying to remember or create a story in my head (basically things that take my mind off my physical surroundings, kind of like reverse grounding techniques), reminding myself that losing an hour of sleep isn't really the end of the world because I can always sleep later, going to bed before my partner so that I'm already firmly asleep by the time he's in bed... If part of my trouble is being sick, I have a nighttime cold medicine that I swear by...\n\nMaybe when you talk to him about it again, you can see if he's considered any of those sorts of techniques.",

            "\u201dHe says that earplugs don\u2019t work\u201d. Yes they actually do in fact work great but he\u2019s being unrealistic and unnecessary pissy about it all.",

            "Have you had this discussion in the light of day, rather than in the moment at night when he\u2019s being kept up? Maybe there\u2019s a chance he wouldn\u2019t be so unreasonable when he\u2019s not desperately trying to get to sleep that second.\n\nAnyway, this is ultimately a \u2018him\u2019 problem that he needs to solve, because you are already doing more than is reasonable with taking up a tiny part of the bed and keeping it down. He just expects even more rather than making any effort on his part - so enough of that. He\u2019s afraid of oversleeping if he takes sleeping pills? Time to learn to take them early enough that he won\u2019t oversleep. He\u2019s convinced earplugs don\u2019t work? Well, yelling at you to be quieter than regular breathing isn\u2019t working so maybe time to give earplugs another go. Etc.",
            "This sounds exactly like my partner. We've been dating about 2 yrs and living together 5 mos.\n\nExcept any sudden movement like me turning to one side or other he gets all upset. No cuddling. Sometimes when he feels more relaxed we'll just barely touch legs. I was going through a bad spell amd now its better but it is really hurtful that he gets so upset. I think personally though our bed is really shitty/warped/too small so I think when we can afford it we will try to get a bigger bed that is more resistant to movement.\n\nAs for sound being the problem mostly for you, I would recommend the Earaser earplug brand",
            "Just an additional thought - can\u2019t he wear noise blocking earbuds playing white noise from his phone? Won\u2019t solve problems of him being woken by your movements, but could be good for times when you have to sleep together, like travelling.\n\nObviously he\u2019ll need to sort his attitude out first though.",
            "I\u2019m a light sleeper and I get cranky when I\u2019m falling asleep. I don\u2019t yell but I\u2019ve definitely grumbled when my husband makes noise. I decided to get ear plugs and that helps a lot. We have a fan that sorta acts like a white noise machine. Also, I go to bed much earlier than him. So it\u2019s quiet when I fall asleep and he doesn\u2019t make enough noise to wake me up when he comes to bed. Still there are some nights where some noise will wake me up (him, our dog, etc.) or I\u2019ll wake up from being too hot and then I can\u2019t get back to sleep. In that instance, I move to the couch.",

            "Ok I\u2019m going to play devil\u2019s advocate here: I\u2019m a light sleeper so I empathise with your boyfriend. Sleep is precious and being woken up by any sound is really awful. And it\u2019s true: earplugs do not work. We need absolute silence to sleep peacefully. Cut him some slack. He\u2019s not being selfish, he literally just can\u2019t sleep. And when you can\u2019t sleep, you get easily irritated, so it\u2019s a vicious cycle. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with someone who doesn\u2019t let me sleep.

Listen to the others telling you to have a sincere talk with him about fairness and what is reasonable.  I agree with you that he's being unreasonable, but at the same time most people can be unreasonable about something.

Since my first post, things took a bit of a turn from her progress, but today she is back to 30 days sober!We have not proceeded with rehab, but here\u2019s what has happened since then. \n\n2 weeks after my first post, my daughter came home from her work and asked me if she could borrow the health savings card and pick up her medication the next day. I said no, I would get it for her myself as I usually do. She protested for a minute or so but I was firm. She left it at that. \n\nFor the rest of the night she was unusually quiet. She\u2019s usually quite talkative with her grandparents who live with us, or myself and her sister. Not that night. This was slightly concerning, but I didn\u2019t raise any questions. \n\nFast forward to around midnight, my daughter came to me and spilled A LOT of details about her drug past. It was a lot of information to take in at one time, and finally she got to the point that she relapsed and needed the health savings card to get detoxed. After my momentary shock passed, I told her that I loved her and that I would go with her to the detox center, and that she didn\u2019t need to hide things from me. I didn\u2019t tell her about how I found out she\u2019s already in meetings, I figured that could be my little secret or it can emerge when the time is right. \n\nAfter that, she got detoxed and all was well for a while before she relapsed again. She was much more straight-forward about it that time, and since that detox, everything has been going smooth. She is back into counseling and takes a 4-day a week class for getting her high school diploma. Today she is 30 days sober and is celebrating her sobriety / birthday with some friends. \n\nI appreciate every single comment! Thank you everyone for their kind words and advice. I feel good about the approach I took, although I would go back and change some things, she is getting the help she needs and we have a more open line of communication. She is more lively, is getting back into her passions, and is much, much happier. I\u2019m still feeling guilty that I didn\u2019t pick up the signs of addiction soon enough, but she assured me she has forgiven me and that I don\u2019t need to worry about it at all. \n\nHappy ending! Thank you everyone!\n\nTL;DR: 30 days sober today, and all is well after a few hiccups!",

            "Good for you, and especially good for her. You're both absolutely on the right track, and she will never forget how you supported her during this battle. \n\nIt may be a long journey, and you're not out of the woods yet, but no matter what, she knows you're in her corner. That is invaluable. ",
            "Hey, good for you and daughter, it's a struggle brotha, help her stay on top of it, good luck!",
            "Hey! Congratulations to her for 30 days sober. I remember reading your original post and wondering what had happen. She is very lucky to have support instead of other options. Thank you for being a wonderful father to her.",
            "It took me until my 27th birthday to get to where your daughter is at sixteen. You should be very proud. \n\n\nI will be 28 in eight days, and on Feb 2nd I will be sober for a year. I couldn't have done it without my dad's support. Your daughter is lucky to have you, and i thank you for being who she needs. ",
            "I'm happy that your daughter is sober, but honestly - after reading your last post I think you really need to pull the reigns in a little bit as a parent.  There's a big difference between being a helicopter parent and not knowing where your 16 yo kid is because they hopped on an airplane and traveled across the country without telling you - even worse that you are pretty much OK with that.   Jesus, I'd get grounded for weeks if I so much as broke my curfew (11pm) by 10 minutes when I was 16.  Kids that age need some structure and discipline.",
            "Good luck, my man. It's never over, but make sure you surround your daughter with good models for behavior a little closer to her own age and try to keep her away from friends that still use. She has to give them up of her own free will, but she really needs to. That's the easiest way to relapse.",
            "As someone who officially has 106 days clean, I can relate. There are a couple things that bug me a little. In NA, we use the word clean, sober usually refers to alcoholics. I also just read the first post and the friend should have never said anything about seeing the daughter in a meeting. \"What is said here, stays here. Here here\" there is a reason why the meeting is called  narcotics anonymous.\n\nI also agree with other posters who said addiction is for life. This is not something she is going to grow out of. She is always going to be an addict. Yes, she is going to relapse, but she will always be welcomed back with open arms. We won't ever judge her, because we are just like her. I have seen addicts with 10-20 years relapse and die from the disease, then I have seen addicts get it the first time and never go near drugs again. \n\nI, myself have relapsed 5 times in as many years. I was going to meetings in 2015-2016 with fentanyl patches in my mouth, pretending to be clean, while I was nodding out in meetings, blaming my Prozac as the cause. My husband would catch me in the act of using and stealing and either send me to detox, or make me detox at home by myself. Every time, I would go back to using within three days and be that much sneakier the next time. Right before I got clean this time, I was no longer just using my mom's used patches, I was taking them off her back. I finally put MYSELF in detox. It took me one failed suicide attempt, two inpatient stays, diagnosis of bipolar and ADHD, therapist and psychiatrist, medication and of course NA. I was also put on Naltrexone. (Opioid blocker basically. If I take opioids I would get sick.) I also have the support of my husband and family. Every doctor, including my endocrinologist knows of my addiction to pain medicine and knows not to give it to me. I had it written on my chart. If your daughter is serious about addiction, she needs to do her due diligence.\n\nI hope you understand that addiction doesn't ever just go away, which is why we call it a disease. Good luck with your daughter's future addiction trials. She is lucky that she has you helping you, I can see the love you feel for here. Just remember she is 16, not 25. Maybe try keeping a closer eye on her? A 16 year old should not be traveling across the world, especially if you don't know where she is, or when she is coming back. Kids, especially teenagers need discipline. ",
            "Congratulations to your daughter, and to you for being so supportive when she needed it.\n\nJust make sure you're looking after yourself, too, yeh? No one expects you to be SuperDad all the time, and don't be afraid to ask for help if it all gets too much :) You've handled this remarkably well though.",
            "Something I think hasn't been posted here, but be careful if she's gonna take any controlled substance prescriptions that were similar to what she was taking.  She could rebound.  She needs to be aware of this.  I've seen too many people fuck up their lives over prescription drugs.  ",
            "Do you mind me asking what it was that she was using? ",
            "Congrats to your daughter! \n\nDon't be so hard on yourself for not picking up on the signs sooner.. if my teen years were any indication, most kids are good at hiding that stuff and/or most parents don't pick up on it. My mom was pretty open minded and someone I could talk to about that sort of thing, but she still didn't know half of the things I did.\n\nOh, and one more thing from my teen years when I knew addicts in your daughter's position (trying to get clean, going to meetings, etc.): be wary of old friends. Especially at that age when it's not so obvious that they were/are addict friends, and even if they're in recovery together. I've seen old friends take out one too many addicts in my day, young and old.",
            "Man, i just want to celebrate with you. That is so awesome, i am just busting. As a dad of a daughter, i can kind of imagine. I would be overjoyed that my daughter told me that. Not that it had happened and that she had to experience and go through all that, (nonetheless, \"experientia docet\"), but SHE TOLD YOU, MAN! You all must have done something right along the way. Congratulations. Happy things are going in better direction. Btw 3/24/86 myself. ",
            "Just wanted to wish you my best.\n\nI know you came here for advice but honestly I think your daughter's story really puts a light on how the public sees issues of addiction because the narrative is wrong, this isn't some kind of moral or behavioral failing on her part, this is a medical problem with elements of will power and choice mixed into it.\n\nI really do wish you the best, and thank you for sharing.",
            "If she hasn't been, try to nudge her returning to NA. Don't need to indicate you know she was going before to do so. After a relapse it can feel almost wrong to back to NA, which I know is absurd. Maybe nudge her going and see if she's actually working the steps. Can't just go and not work the steps. If she determines NA isn't for her, encourage she try out other recovery programs like Smart Recovery. Be prepared for things to get much, much worse. It's amazing she's taking these steps at such a young age, but the unfortunate reality is it usually takes a much longer time and much greater consequences for someone to really and totally give themselves over to sobriety. Good luck to both of you.",
            "The pattern of being clean for a while and then relapsing is actually quite common for addicts of most types. If you see the time clean between relapses getting longer and the depth of the relapse getting less severe each time, then things are going as expected. Don't tell her that a relapse is no big deal, but don't treat it like the end of the world either. Her feeling it's safe to talk to you about relapsing is a HUGE positive in her recovery. It's ok, and probably even good to express disappointment, but try not to get angry about relapses. ",
            "The fact that your 16 year old daughter went into NA on her own accord is pretty astounding and a testament to either her own intelligence or the stellar way in which you raised her.  Keep on down this path my fellow reddit brother.",

            "This is great news. There is obviously a great deal of mutual respect between you two, and that's not accidental. You're paying attention and you're doing an A-plus job of communicating and helping her without enabling or guilt-tripping her. It's very difficult to see the signs of drug use if you're not looking for them, and it's wayyyy easier to just deny that your own family could be in trouble that way. The fact that she took those initial steps to get clean at her age without your interference is a really really good thing; it means she wants this, and that is what will keep her sober.",

            "Proud of her and you both!",
            "Sounds like you are doing an awesome job so far. As an addict myself, the first time I was in rehab I was 16, then again at 17 (for 6+ months) and then again at 24, the best thing my parents did for me was support me 1000% while sober but didn't put up with a DROP of BS when I wasn't or I was slipping back into those old behaviors. I'm talking no money, no house... Nothing. Best thing they ever did. I now have over a year sober and like some other commenters have said... Its not all sunshine and roses. She may wake up one day and have a \"F*** It\" attitude and however much time is gone. Its a constant daily battle some days. Just beware of the signs of slipping back into old behaviors so you can watch for them and do something about it then. A relapse does not start when you use again... It starts much, much sooner than that. ",

People *do* change, and not always for the worse! \n\nThe only reason I would not want to leave some opening for reconciling the situation in the future would be if I genuinely feared this person (your FIL) and saw no future in which he may begin to regret his actions, or if I believed him to be completely incapable of and/or uninterested in understanding why it is *beyond* wrong to behave threateningly towards a laboring mother. In that case, life is just too freaking short, and mucking it up with people who are such incredible douching assholes is just asking for misery and disaster.  \n\nI just read your first post, your FIL is a misogynist shitlord and there is no way in hell I would *ever* allow that sack of testosterone flavored shit anywhere near either me or my girl children.

(I will preference by saying it was a big urban hospital, OP could be in a rural area with not a lot of security. If possible, would like a rural nurse/doctor to comment on this/my comments)\n\n1. No one can get to the L&D (Labor & Delivery) floor without checking in with the hospital receptionist. They won't even tell you want floor it is on. The receptionist will check the list given by the mother then call the floor and get confirmation that the guests can come up. Even the *father* can't go up without the mother's consent. Once confirmation is given, the guests are given a badge/wrist badge that allows them to enter the floor. The doors are locked, you need the badge to buzz you in. Once on the floor, the nurses will check the name against the list and ask the mother **again** if she wants the guest.\n\n2. NO ONE IS ALLOWED IN THE LABOR ROOM without the mother's consent. Regardless of who it is, mother's mom, the father, whatever.\n\n3. There is security on the maternity floor. (You'd be surprised how much drama occurs).\n\nFor the MIL and FIL to barge into a birthing room, not possible. \n\nIf there is an assault (the FIL swinging on a birthing mother), filing a police report is out of her hands. Security would have stepped in, detained him and called the police. If nothing else, the nurses wouldn't have just stood there waiting. **This is why my spidey senses is tingling**\n\nBecause of the rash of baby thefts, security protocols are in place in every hospital. This situation wouldn't occur but I am not a L&D nurse, so I'm not 100% sure but I find this story hard to believe.\n\nA birthing mother isn't left alone by nursing/doctor staff. A nurse/doctor isn't going to stand there letting someone yell or attack someone in active labor. Police or security would have been called. A physical altercation (son chokeholding father) would trigger police and a police report.\n\nI don't know OP's location, she may be in a rural area that doesn't have as much security or stringent L&D protocols so I can't say troll or bullshit with certainty but this story raises a lot of doubt to me..\n\n\nEDIT:I withdraw my bullshit/troll statement. Apparently there are a lot of hospitals that don't have strong maternal security protocols. I'm genuinely surprised.",

Collect and bring papers whenever possible, so she doesn't have to be confronted with things she cannot overcome just yet like stairs or even elevators, when she is in a lying down wheelchair, as my dad had to be a few weeks after surgeries.\n\nWhen she gets fit enough to sit again make sure she gets a good wheelchair. Those are her legs. Don't save on that. If you need help on what to look out for regarding wheelchair fit dm me, I worked for a company that handbuild tailored wheelchairs, as does my dad.\n\nI can imagine getting back into tennis or golf could be either very good or very bad. You know your girlfriend better to know what type of person she is.\nBut as she obviously likes sports, try and find a sport she enjoys. Almost all sports are with a few rule adjustments possible to do from a wheelchair.\n\nAnd most importantly: Don't help her go through her day. Help her figuring out how to do so herself.\n\nI grew up with a wheelchair as a hobby. My dad taught me how to balance it on two wheels, how to get up curbs, how to ride escalators, how to go down stairs. As long as something is not out of reach, or to small for her wheelchair to fit, she can learn how to do everything her daily life might throw at her.\n\nFor most wheelchair users I know this is the most vital part. Getting your independence back, being able to live without someone's help, and seeing just how much they are still capable of doing.\n\nEdit: thank you guys for all the nice comments, dms and awards. I just woke up to see all the responses and it already made my day start out great!",
            "You're the guy that couldn't locate his girlfriend for two days. I remember your story. I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through, and, of course, your girlfriend. You're a wonderful man for staying by her side. I don't know what else to say to you, I don't have any advice, but all I can say is that I appreciate your unconditional love for your girlfriend.",
            "Let me start by saying I'm not paralyzed nor do I have a paralyzed family member.  But I did have a stroke 4 months ago and lost control of my right side. Much like your girlfriend, I had to lay there in the hospital wondering what my life going forward would be.  Many questions running through my mind like \"Can I ever do X activity again?\" \"What do I do about my business if I can't regain control of my body?\" \"What will I be able to do?\"\n\nFor the immediate term, having family & friends visit meant a lot to me when in the hospital. Being able to converse in a normal manner brought a sense of normalcy that I needed. Just being there and talking to her will mean a lot.  More than you will realize.  \n\nShe is going to need counseling. That is a given. There will be good days and bad days. If you are in this for the long haul, then you need to cheer the good days and handle the bad days. If possible, be there with the counselor so you can learn to be there and help her mentally.\n\nNow, when I was learning to walk again and use my arm again, nothing bugged the shit out of me more than people trying to do things for me. My mind set was to get better as much as a can and in order to do that I had to do as much as I could myself.  Yeah, at first it royally sucked not being able to even wipe my own ass.  I needed help. But I worked at it and worked at it until I could some of it.  Then, I got so I could wipe my own ass. Doesn't sound like much and people laugh, but as a personal milestone, it was HUGE.  Your girlfriend hopefully will have a similar mindset.  Keep that in mind always if she does. Don't do it for her. Let her do as much as she can and only then step in once she's done as much as she can.\n\nHer life isn't over. It's just different now.  I don't know if she had facial injuries or not. But if she modeled before, why not again the future?  More companies are being inclusive in their ads. Why can't she strive to be one?  Liked to hike before? Maybe now you bike. It's great exercise and there are great long distance bikes for paraplegics. Tennis and basketball are still in the table. Just different.  Skiing? Still on the table, just different.  Swimming, etc. There is practically no limit to what she can do. She just needs to set her mind to doing it.\n\nFinally, when I got out of the hospital, people treated me like I was fragile.  I had a fucking stroke, I'm not made of glass. If I stumbled, they would freak and act like they are going to do a diving catch.  It got so bad I yelled a few times.  I'm learning to walk again. Yeah, I'm going to stumble and if I don't learn to catch myself I won't improve. Your girlfriend is in a similar boat. She had a bad accident. She's paralyzed. She's not dead. She's not made of glass. Don't treat her like she is. She has to learn to 'walk' again in her new normal. She's going to fall. She needs to be able to pick herself back up again. Not you picking her up and putting her in her chair, but asking her if she needs any help first. Let her be independent and prove to herself that she can be independent.",
            "Obviously be there to support her and she should go through the grieving process. But this isn\u2019t the end of her active years. Far from it. If you live in/near a larger city she can get in touch with the local adaptive centers. Skiing, biking, swimming, basketball, tennis, working out at the gym, etc are all still activities she can enjoy. Once she gets in the groove with a physical/occupational therapist, maybe you could learn a new sport together? \n\nAlso, I recently got to try out a couple of the adaptive mountain bikes and oooooohhhh buddy, it was a good time!!! One of my friends can get some massive air in his! Another of my friends goes on hikes on adaptive friendly trails.",

I\u2019m so sorry it\u2019s been such a difficult time. Hoping for the best for you both. I think this is a good first step; seeking advice instead of leaving.",
            "My friend is paralyzed from the neck down. There is a lot of stuff she can do. It's surprising how inventive people can get. Your girlfriend still has a world of opportunities open to her, but it is gonna take a while to find those.\n\nIt's OK if she's depressed, it's OK if you're depressed. Being paralyzed still sucks.\n\nAlso, constipation and bladder infections are a major issue. My friend was once so constipated that it started giving her heart problems. Do not let it get to that point.",
            "Research it and know that there is a grieving process on both ends. You and her will be grieving your lives as you once knew them. That doesn't mean life is over. But mourning is entirely normal and valid. \n\nAlso think about ways to help her not feel left out, emotionally, mentally, physically. Make the effort to make sure things are accessible to her.",
            "im not paralyzed, so my experience is not as severe, but i did suddenly become physically disabled when i was 20. im 22 now, im still figuring stuff out. becoming chronically ill has seriously thrown my life off the path i was working really hard for. so im not paralyzed, but i can definitely empathize with your entire life changing and the things you loved becoming inaccessible.\n\nI really hate asking for help. When you ask for help for simple tasks because you\u2019re disabled, especially if you were known as someone quite physically capable before, people always want to fucking pity you. It *sucks.* This is the rest of my life. I am only going to get worse as I age. I do not need to be reminded that my existence makes you feel bad or guilty. I\u2019m human, I am me, I just need help. I\u2019m sure many disabled people would agree that pity is at the very least frustrating. My advice to someone in your position is to just learn how to act around someone who\u2019s physically disabled. Be available to readily help, but don\u2019t turn it into like a symbolic act for adjusting to the new normal. Be thoughtful about the space around you. Try to notice simple things that are easy for you, but might be hard for her. When you do help, keep the mood casual. Don\u2019t turn it into a chance to emotionally bond, or an overt display of love. In my case, someone helping is enough. It does not need to become a mini soap opera. \n\nYou know her best. When she needs that emotional support, when she needs to wallow, that\u2019s different. I think that\u2019s something only you can know how to do. Like others said, there is going to be a grieving process for both of you. But this is the rest of her life, and she\u2019s still as much of a full human being as she was before the accident. She\u2019s not a stray pet or a tragic story, she needs to be supported and loved but not pitied (unless, of course, she does want that!) \n\nAlso, you\u2019re allowed to get frustrated. This is a big event for the both of you. Life is going to be very different than it was. Be transparent with how you feel, have open discussions with her, encourage her to speak with you about things that are difficult for her that aren\u2019t so obvious. Open your doors to your friends, family, support groups etc. One good thing I have taken away from becoming disabled is how many people showed up for me. When people love you or empathize, they *want* to help. Not only will it make your life easier, but I think it can be a general bright spot in this journey. \n\nI wish you both the best.",
            "Don't try to support her through this if you aren't planning to be in it for the long haul.  If you need a gal with model looks, who can play golf and tennis and go running with you, hiking, and so on, then be honest with yourself about that.\n\nShe can still hope to travel, though, and you might find new enjoyments that you can share which you never did before.\n\nMy father dated a paraplegic woman for a few years, but then unexpectedly met the woman he later married (my stepmother).

            "I found it really helpful to connect with other young, disabled women, who were living their lives really well. Something about seeing it embodied in a person was a huge help for me to imagine my life, and also to feel like someone understood. I had a few friends who were disabled already, so that was a boon. I also got a lot out of watching YouTube videos from younger, disabled content creators like Jessica Kellgren-Fozard, Molly Burke, Hannah Witton, Jen from WheelsNoHeels etc. It was helpful to know I wasn't the only one who was constant the subject of other people's ableist microagressions.\n\nMost of all, let her know that you love her, support her, and see how the adjustment is hard.

            "Hey man,\n\nI'm not sure how much help this is, but I've some experience in the powered wheelchair industry that might help your girlfriend and you. Not sure where you're located but some insurance worldwide can help subsidize these wheelchairs which are really expensive.\n\nBut it seems like she \"used\" to enjoy a lot of outdoorsy activities. So one thing that you can maybe help with is to find a product that helps with that. (I got some sort of wakeup call when I heard it from my boss, \"when was the last time a person with paralyzed legs was in the woods?\" or similar). Some brands that I remember gave me a good impression are Zoomability, Invacare, Permobil and Sunrise Medical.\n\nSo to help her get back to the \"normal\" after grieving, maybe you can start with going to some Powered Wheelchair/medical fairs and find something that can help her in the future. Maybe right now she won't have the energy for it, but then you can start and make some research on your on and help her in the future :)\n\nAll the best!",
            "I just wanted to suggest some new hobbies for now while she's healing. There is a massive serotonin boost to creating something while sitting in one place, and seeing that item come to life right before your eyes makes you feel like youre accomplishing something. \n\nWhen I was about 30 I discovered the art of needle felting via this video: https://youtu.be/3u7X1AsSSZU[Making a Schnauzer plushie](https://youtu.be/3u7X1AsSSZU)\nI was immediately fascinated. I went out to Joanne's fabrics for wool roving and Walmart for a Clover 3-needle felting tool. This is an incredibly CHEAP hobby, you can buy an entire set of needles, huge selection of colorful wool, and some finger protectors for under $15 on etsy or Amazon. There is something SO meditative about the repetitive stabbing of the wool to form little shapes, and there's pretty much no mess to clean up after. No glue, no sewing. Just stabbing. \n\nThen, when my mom was in hospital for a bone marrow transplant, I was going  absolutely nuts with the waiting. So again, I got on youtube and found [a crochet tutorial to make a stuffed bunny](https://youtu.be/3WZw15ihw9U). Went to a nearby Walmart, bought two pretty yarns and a set of crochet hooks ($12) and learned to follow along with the video. It took much longer than needle felting but it was so much fun! I had no experience with crochet at all, youtube videos were good enough to learn with.\n\nHope this helps, you seem like such a good man.",

Remind her that everyone has challenges throughout life, and while hers are significant (don\u2019t downplay it) you will tackle it together. You\u2019re in it for the long haul, as her condition isn\u2019t a reflection of value differences in the relationship or anything that affects how well you two work together. That reassurance was and is huge for me with my partner. I have an unpredictable and tricky chronic illness that\u2019s forced us to make some pretty big changes to our lives and his confident reassurance and love makes a big difference\u2026as I often used to feel like a burden, inconvenience, or just like I was baggage for someone to deal with. I would also worry that he would eventually some day stay with me out of guilt if he was ever unhappy. Like \u201cyou can\u2019t break up with the sick person\u201d. But we\u2019ve worked through that. Like others have said, therapy is vital. Your girlfriend may never struggle with these feelings, but it isn\u2019t uncommon and is something I haven\u2019t seen brought up yet.",
            "Love   her.  Realize  that  this is a big  life  changing  event  for  her and she is  gonna  need some   time  to  adjust.  I  suggest   getting  her some  form  of counseling  because  this  is  bound  to  be  traumatic.   Try  not  to  be  overly  helpful  or  over  sympathetic because she  won't want  to    feel  like  she's an  invalid.  Encourage  her   to  try and  do  things   for  herself, but  don't  push .  She's still  the  same  person she  was  before  and  she  should  be  treated  as  such.",
            "Not sure if anyone else has mentioned this but before you take her anywhere in a wheelchair (even just down a hospital hallway) please get someone to push you around in one for a few hours. It will really help you gain some perspectives. Being in a chair can initially be terrifying, not to mention having to negotiate different routes and plan things much differently. Watch out for curbs, corners, walls and doors in a new way. Also helps to understand how the wider community behaves around a wheelchair user.",

            "Seeing all these wholesome comments make me feel like an ass because I think either a lot of you are lying or really nice people. Me personally\u2026 I would break up to be honest. Too much to deal with and so young (I\u2019m 24 also). I always tell my gf even If I ever get to a disabled or vegetable state I don\u2019t expect her to be with me. \nYou\u2019re a good person though for wanting to be there \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb hope she remains strong",
            "Omg this thread is so wholesome... nothing changes when som3thing happens except a mental lapse of pressure... you love your love and she needs your love. Be there, be fair, and just stroke the poor girls hair and tell her you love her, got damn it couldve been so much different, I have no awards but please enjoy what time you spend together, it's unusual compared to ur \"normal\" time spent together but really, all it is is she has a cool chair now and she needs a bit more attention, nothing new ay aha.. \n\nBut seriously, you have to be her rock, you don't need to punch someone who looks at her, you don't need to learn anything new, just nourish what you already know is in her that she feels she has lost, when in all truth, she has only gained. \n\nYes a terrible accident \n\nBut also the greatest gift \n\nA second chance. \n\nNow, go watch squid game, stroke her hair for half an hour, run her a bath, Help her in and out, passionately, get her a drink, kindly. Talk to her humanly. \n\nI'm crying because I miss my girlfriend man\n\nJust love her dude.",
            "Just be there hour by hour and let her feel all the rollercoaster of stuff. The first few weeks aren\u2019t the time to look long term. After that, be involved in her physical healing and don\u2019t sugarcoat things. Be her soundboard when she needs and stay communicative",
