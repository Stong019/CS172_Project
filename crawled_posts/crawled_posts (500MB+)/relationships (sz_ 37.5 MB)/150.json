        "selftext": "Original here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zh4m2/me_34m_with_my_wife_32f_of_five_years_i_know_shes/\n\nSo, lots to tell. First off, however, a few things. Before I wrote this, I didn't know what a \"red pill\" was. Now I do. I kind of wish I didn't, but a few dozen messages kind of made that happen. You know those \"debt solution\" letters you get when you're known to the county to owe money? That's how those things came in, fast and furious. Some others assumed that my throwaway having the word \"red\" in it meant that I was a sockpuppet for them. I am not. I don't think they've got a solution that isn't worse than the problem it pretends to fix.\n\nWell, what happened? I left the house that evening for a walk (she wasn't home) and called around for lawyers. It was pretty late already and I got a lot of voice mail, but one picked up. She asked me to get mt financial statements and a lot of other things together and see her the next morning. I then decided to confront my wife that evening. \n\nThat didn't happen. She came home very late and disappeared to take a bath almost right away. I snuck into her office and took her phone out from her purse. It had a fingerprint scanner, but her PIN was the same as she uses for the garage and our safe which she set up, so that was easy. There was nothing on the phone that I could find, pictures in Apple Photos and Google Photos were all from things we'd done together and some for her job. No messages or so, either. Just as I wanted to put the phone back, her bag buzzed. She has another phone! That one is an Android and had a pattern, so I couldn't log in. But on the screen was a message, phone number only, no name, with a \"<3\" on it.\n\nPut that back. Decided to postpone confrontation until after lawyer, but took a photo of the message.\n\nNext morning I talked to the lawyer and she spent about half an hour to just go over possible outcomes and what I can expect next, then another 45 minutes talking about finances and so. We don't have kids and she's the big earner, so I stand to either be just out of the relationship or be out and owed some money. It'll be months, maybe even more than a year, until all this is dealt with. Takes five minutes to marry, a year to unmarry, it seems.\n\nI'd walked by my work and told boss and I was sick. I look like shit, from not sleeping and some crying, so that was pretty convincing. We work in food, being sick is a bad idea at that job. Went home and unplugged the Apple TV and took it to a friend who runs a small computer store. He confirmed what you'd told me, the pictures on the screen saver are from her Apple Photos. He's also the first I told and he immediately offered me to stay at his place with his wife and kids if I had to leave for a while. Then he called the number the text on my wife's other phone came from and told me a guy named \"Rob\" had answered it.\n\nWalked home and texted her if she'd be home for dinner. She texted back, that she'd have to do some \"extra work\" and it could be late, so I told her to please make an exception and come home, I had important news. We'd been looking for a house for a while, I figured she'd think I finally found one. \n\nWell, dinner came and went, and she didn't show. She came home around 10, smelling of cigarettes. She was all happy and asked me what I wanted to talk about, so I asked her to sit down. I'm 99% to making something up about a house and avoid the confrontation, but then, I guess for the first time, I felt a little anger. So I told her.\n\nI said \"I know you've been cheating for a while, now. I've been working with an attorney and we'll have to talk about these things at some point, so now is as bad a time for that as ever.\"\n\nShe didn't blow up and deny it. She just... deflated and started to shake. A lot of your PMs, my attorney, and my friend, all told me not to press for details, and not put that on me as well. But I really wanted to know, so I said \"tell me about Rob.\" She told me they'd met through Ann (the friend on the couch with her) and Ann wanted to have sex with him while he had a crush on my wife, so they hatched this threesome plan. That was ... 14 months ago. Apparently they've since included Rob's wife (that's the mysterious fourth person who took the pictures) who is \"polyamorous\" with that Rob guy. \n\nThe picture thing was solved, too. She'd handed the wife her phone to take a few pictures and didn't remember the whole screen blanker thing. When she was at work, she'd uploaded them and deleted them from the phone. By then, by chance, I'd seen them. She had the second phone for precisely the reasons I thought, as one that isn't on our shared contract where I couldn't see the incoming and outgoing calls in my statement.\n\nShe also had short affairs with other women and a few men, and a most of her \"weekend work things\" were actually her and Rob going on short trips together. Through all this, it felt like she was giving me as much detail as she could in an effort to hurt me, and it worked but I think I kept a pretty good poker face.\n\nI told her that I would leave the house, that I had photographed and cataloged everything and was hoping for an amicable separation. She simply declined, told me she'd leave and take a hotel for the time being, and put her keys on the table. She packed a few things and left. That was it. As this one guy /u/jluster says, it was like the dentist, it hurt less than I thought it would but still hurt damn much.\n\nToday I have about 15 missed calls from her and 150+ messages, all asking me for forgiveness and if we could make it work again. I agreed to meet her next week, but only to divide our possessions. As far as I am concerned, this is over. Except for my one friend no one knows, yet, and I want to wait with making it public knowledge while I sort my stuff here and decide how I go from here. Might actually be hitting the gym, no intentions for a rebound relationship, and the rest we'll see.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR**: Confronted wife, she admits to cheating, rest is in the hands of my attorney. I'm broken but I'll get better.",

She's been exploring her sexuality outside the confines of her marriage and she knows that in all likelihood, that when this gets out, her reputation will be beyond repair...or at the very least, she will have to deal with a lot of embarrassment and shame that she is not prepared to deal with.  Fucking around with so many different people while being married...well not many people look favorably on that, no matter if you are a man or a woman\n\nSo...I say make her a deal in the divorce.  You'll keep your mouth shut if she agrees to give you everything you want and makes the divorce as quick and painless as possible.  Then move on with your life and don't look back",

That's 14 months of lies, deceit, sneaking around to fuck a married man and his wife behind your back and potentially exposing you to STD's. \n\nShe's not remorseful that she cheated, just that she got caught. She's afraid of losing her comfort, and will do/say anything to get you to stay. Divorce this horrible person and don't look back.",

I deserve better than that.\"\n\nGranted saying something along those lines may add fuel to the fire, but in my experience it was really helpful to make the woman who cheated on me actually think about me and how I felt because of her actions. She's still not thinking about you, or how you feel. \n\nBest of luck to you. I was in your position almost 2 years ago now.

We are good, real life friends who will tell you how it is are invaluable during a time like this. \n\nIn the future, it's best to handle things directly. Always remember that your time is limited, and you should not waste it. Not on jobs you hate, not on friends who are never there for you, and not on SOs who do not treat you as you treat them.\n\nI might be the odd one out here, but I do think that if your partner doesn't try their best to sexually fulfill you and vice versa, it's not a worthwhile relationship. It's 2016, if your SO says she doesn't do blowjobs or a guy is unwilling to dive, and it's something the other partner wants, and there's no hygiene issues... that's a red flag. Sex is important and if a woman has a bunch of reasons for why she \"doesn't do\" X or Y when she can tell it really turns you on.. it's a bad sign. No different than if I was unwilling to try going down on my GF because \"real men don't do that\" or whatever. \n\n",

            "I absolutely understand your reasoning behind wanting to call her \"mom.\". There are three major reasons I support your decision ..\n\n* Your mom didn't want you to hold people that love you unconditionally at arm's length.  She's probably so happy there is a woman there that loves you as she would; as a treasured son.  \n\n* The fact you are even second-guessing calling her mom shows that the word holds a GREAT deal of value to you and I'm sure you know in your heart Kendra is worth that honor.  \n\n* My 6-year old daughter calls my boyfriend \"dad,\" even though he's only been in our lives for a little over a year.  He treats her as if she was his very own and it was HER decision to call him dad, not coached by me at all.  That shows me this little girl knows what a dad should be and that my bf loves her as his daughter.  \n\nFollow your heart in this sense.  Kendra will love you, regardless.  \u2764\ufe0f",

I\u2019m sure your mom feels the same, wherever she is right now. \n\nAs for how to start, you can just do it casually, but since it looks like its a very emotional thing for both of you, why don\u2019t you ask Kendra? Tell her you love her very much and that you would like to call her \u201cmom\u201d. Ask what she thinks about it. \n\nI would be bursting with joy and happiness if I were her. You seem like a great kid.",
            "OP, I\u2019m a mom and I can tell you that nothing would make me happier than to have someone like Kendra take over my role of \u201cmom\u201d if anything we\u2019re to happen to me. Your mom\u2019s memory will not be betrayed if you called Kendra mom. Btw Kendra is lucky to have you as a kid, too.",
            "Family is not just about blood. If this woman has treated you like a son and she fills that role, she absolutely can be called \"mom\". Your bio-mother's memory is not insulted in the slightest. I can tell you have a wonderful heart and precious relationship with Kendra and I see absolutely no reason why you cannot call her mom. I am so happy you have such a loving relationship!",
            "Just call her Mom, bro. \n\nAsk her permission if you want the reassurance but from what you\u2019ve written here, sounds like she\u2019d be perfectly happy with it. \n\nThe thing is\u2026.you\u2019re not betraying your mom or her memory. You\u2019re simply making room for another mom. And I bet your mom would be delighted to no end to know that Kendra\u2019s stepped up and taken care of you so well\n\nIf that\u2019s what Kendra\u2019s been to you, then that\u2019s what she is. \n\n\nMy mother is still alive but when my dad and stepmom got married, my mom insisted that my siblings and I call my stepmom \u201cmom\u201d because she had fulfilled that role as a mom should\u2019ve.",
            "This is sweet and wholesome!! Talk to Kendra about it and see what she thinks. Maybe you two and your dad can come up with a name that is different from your biological mother, but still is endearing to Kendra.\n\nI'm sure she'd really appreciate that.",
            "\nTo answer your question, I would ask your dad how he feels about that and how he thinks Kendra would think of it, and then ask Kendra if she would mind if you called her \"mom.\" I'm sure it won't be an issue, but you never know if you don't ask!",
            "Maaaaaate if she is already calling you her son then call her mum. Go to her right now, give her a big lip smack on her cheek and say love you mum. She is gonna cry. Heck you are gonna cry too but that will make her week, month and year. Dont stress it at all :)",
            "You can have more than one mom. It\u2019s not a disrespect to your mother. I called my mother in law mom after a few years of dating her son. Even after we separated, when she calls, I call her mom.",

She might want to respect your mom, and maybe the two of you can come up with a different name for her. Either way, this is so healthy for you!\n\nI have two friends whose mom's died when they were young. Both are adults, and their dads remarried a few years after the passing of their wives. \n\nBoth of these friends claim they grew up without a mom, even though they had a stepmom who loved and nurtured them. They are extremely unhealthy, mentally, because they refuse to \"disrespect\" their birth mom by acknowledging that their stepmom nurtured them. They constantly disrespect their father's choice of a new wife, and they disrespect the woman who stepped in and took care of them, when they had a choice not to. \n\nThey would both be much better off mentally if they were like you, and see the good, instead of wanting everyone to pity them because their mom died. They both have this image of their mom being the only perfect person in the world, when in fact, they have no idea what their mom might be like today, if she hadn't died when they were 8 & 9 years old. \n\nYou're doing great. Call her mom. Live a happy life. That's what your real mom would want for you.",

Kendra is someone else, she can also be your mom but she does things in her own way. It sounds like your dad made a good choice, finding someone who isn't scared of the space your mom will continue to occupy in your life. \n\nMaybe you could make it special: get a nice card and write your request. You can probably make a lunch for you all. Perhaps see if you involve dad, add flowers. She'll appreciate you seeing her efforts.",

            "Oh dear. It's not a betrayal at all. She's a good step mom and it's okay to call her mom in my opinion. She takes care of you and love you with all she's got. She by all means is your mom. She may not have given birth to you but she still loves you like you are her flesh and blood.

Your mother would be very excited to know you have someone that not only isn\u2019t trying to replace her but is stepping up to fulfill her role as a mother. My dad passed when I was very young, my mother remarried when I was 11 and at 15 I felt my bond with my stepfather had reached a point to which we were real family. I talked to my mom about it first, to more so make sure that it wouldn\u2019t make her feel as if I had forgotten my father and was trying to replace him. It\u2019s not so much of an offense to the step parent most of the time, as it is to the biological parent. I hope this helps you.",

And I feel proud to say it and almost silly for waiting so long. \n\nEven if it feels weird at first, just do it and watch the way her face lights up at your words.

So if you feel a little uneasy using \"mom\" right now, you can try to ease in with another motherly name like mama, ma, mum, etc, until \"mom\" feels right, unless it already does and then just go for it.",

He refers to me as his daughter as well and everyone knows he\u2019s as much my father as my bio dad, and my bio dad is more than happy that I have someone like my stepdad as a father figure along with him. \n\nMy advice, talk to your stepmom about it, tell her how you feel about seeing her as a mother figure and if she\u2019d feel okay with you calling her mom or maybe something that she\u2019d like, maybe a nickname if she doesn\u2019t want to be called mom out of respect for your mother, I call my stepdad Billy.",

It's his father, and his father's wife (so technically my husband's stepmom).\n\nAt mother's day, my husband and I sent the stepmom flowers and a card that was addressed to her as \"mom\". She cried. She never had children herself, so it was the first time she got called \"mom\". She was so proud that she paraded the flowers and the cards at her office!\n\nI kindly asked at a meal if I could call his dad  \"dad\", and it was a very tender moment. He told me how proud he was to have me as his daughter. It was at his birthday.\n\nIn this way, I gained a dad and a mom, when I thought I'd never have one. And Stepmom got called \"mom\" for the first time in her life.\n\nWe were in our 20s and 30s when all of this happened. So don't feel like you are too old to call her mom. we all need moms, and it's very meaningful to a parent-figure to receive the honor.\n\nSo if you really don't know how to do it, why not at mother's day? or if this is too far into the future, then maybe for Christmas or at her birthday, you address the card to her as \"mom\" and see how she reacts?

The most I can do is stumble to the bathroom. I feel so useless. My kids are helping me with bare necessities, like water or crackers. But that's about as much as they can do, as they're little. \n\nYesterday I had to pick up my kids, drive to the doctor, and pick up my prescriptions. By the time I got back I was shaking and almost didn't make it up the stairs. I had asked my fiance to at least pick up my kids. He responded \"I'm not picking up your fucking kids!\"\n\nI asked him to pick me something up from the store again, and I was met with the same response.\n\nMaybe I'm being emotional. I don't know. I've never been this sick in my life. It's actually quite terrifying not being able to breathe. I just wish he would be a little more understanding, instead he just sighs, scoffs, and cusses at me. And on top of everything, I'm getting kind of scared that I'm going to waste away into nothing because I don't have the energy to get out of bed for more than a minute.\n\nTLDR - Fiance is refusing to help me with even basic care when I'm sick with pneumonia. I don't know what to do. Or even if I have a right to be upset.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your comments. I just want to let you know that I am not going to marry this man!

The best treatment might require hospitalization, and can cut short the misery of pneumonia, or prevent it from becoming worse. Energy is going to be nonexistent, and do not push yourself, that will weaken the immune system, prolong being sick and make it easier to pick up other viruses (I had the flu while balancing 19 credit hours). Sleep will be a friend, as well as warm liquids (tea/coffee, a friend and her girlfriend always had warm cider while we studied), warm showers, and easy comforting meals to keep up strength. As for help around the house, either a relative or a good friend shouldn't have an issue pitching in. \n\n2) kick his ass curbside, he's clearly demonstrated his lack of worth as a man, along with his selfish nature that will only prove either physically, emotionally, and/or verbally abusive. I wouldn't be surprised if he's a closet narcissist also. He clearly doesn't care for your kids, picking them up is hardly a trying task, and he clearly doesn't seem to care about you. Even though I wasn't in a relationship, my friends still did what they could to help, because they're good people, and because a serious illness does require help. He is NOT deserving of the title of \"fiance\". ",

That means that if you become ill, he will not care for you.   It means that if you become infirm in old age, you will be put in a nursing home instead of cared for by your husband.  It means that you will be left to face and carry the weight of the biggest challenges you will face in your life.  Your child is 16 and on the verge of being expelled for fighting?   Your problem, not shared.   You have a worrying test result and it might be cancer?  Your problem, not shared.

I woke up several times because I couldn't breath, and several more times because my dad was checking that I was breathing. Typically when one of us kids got sick, he was uninvolved in nursing us back to health. He'd let my mom handle us when we were sick and he'd do yard work or something outside, away from the germs. But my pneumonia was so terrifying to him that he stayed by my side almost constantly. I've never seen him so nervous before or after.\n\nYour fiance ignoring such a serious illness is a massive red flag. You need to dump him.

He was really angry I didn't tell him right away but I get it, I would be too. Mostly though he was very concerned for all of us and wanted to kill my mom's bf. He called her for her side of the story, but when he began asking about her boyfriend's behavior she cursed him out and hung up on him.\n\nThat made her find out I told him and she barged into my room screaming that I was a liar and a little cunt (yeah she called me the c-word). She accused me of wearing slutty clothes to try to steal him (the fuck?) and of loving my dad and stepmom more than her. When I denied this she slapped my face, hard, and told me she was kicking me out. She hovered over me as I threw some clothes and important stuff into a bag and then followed me still verbally abusing me into I got into my car, saying that she'd never wanted me in the first place and that she should have aborted me. I'm hurt, but whatever, she's delusional.  I'm at my dad's now and probably will be living here for the time being, my dad and stepmom have told me I'm totally welcome. \n\nMy dad went to the house yesterday to talk to her in person about her boyfriend. He was there too and apparently the three of them got into a screaming match. He asked my siblings if they wanted to go with him and they said yes, so now they're here too. My mom tried to stop them but couldn't, and she sent my sister a long rambling text about how the three of us are dead to her and ungrateful pieces of shit. \n\nSince she won't talk with him to come to a solution my dad sees he has no other choice but to go to the courts to get full custody of my siblings (especially with how verbally abusive she's being). So that's good.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Told my dad, and he rescued my siblings and is seeking full custody due to my mom's refusal to cooperate/instability. However I got kicked out of my house and my relationship with my mom is in the shitter. ",

Make sure that you save all the mean text messages/voicemails/emails that your mother sends you so that your dad can use them in court if necessary. Also, consider filing a police report about the physical abuse, even if it doesn't go anywhere this time it's something your dad can bring up in court and it establishes a record in case your mother ever does something like this again.\n\nYou brother and sister are still young, it would probably be a good idea for the 3 of you to do counseling together.\n\nGood luck to your family!",
            "I know it doesn't seem like it right now, but this is the best possible outcome for the original situation. \n\nYou *absolutely* did the right thing by calling your dad and getting yourself out of there - and even better, your siblings all wanted to go with your dad, too. You're letting your dad do his job as a parent, which is great. I'm not sure if you were able to get important documents out of your mom's house as you left (Social Security Card, birth certificate, passport, etc.), but if not, maybe your dad can go, with police escort if need be. These are documents you'll need as you go to apply for jobs and school, and it's going to be better for you to keep your distance from your mom until she gets help.\n\nTake this time to talk this over with your siblings about how you feel about the situation. Maybe talk to your dad about getting in to see a therapist (or talk to your school counselor about everything - that's why they're there). This is not at all an easy thing to go through, but there are people who can help you process the emotions you're feeling. You don't deserve to be treated like your mother and her boyfriend treated you, and those people don't deserve to know you. You will get through this and come out the other side even stronger and better than before.\n\nBest wishes, and keep us posted on how the custody situation goes.",

            "First off, if you have a driver's license with your address on it or can prove that you live at your home (mail with your name on it), your mother cannot just kick you out. As an adult living in her house you are her tenant and she has to give you a formal notice of eviction (if you're in the states, all states have at least a minimum of 30 days notice, some have more). So you can at least fight to live in your house for a bit while you figure out your next move, if you want. It's up to you to know if this is a fight that is worth it. To me, it seems that you're already in a safe place, so the fight isn't worth it. I'm just informing you so you know that you have tenant rights in the future. \n\nAlso, your mother seems like a narcissistic bitch and not worth the effort. Surround yourself with people who actually care about you OP. Just because she is your mom doesn't mean that you're obligated to have a relationship with her if she is a shitty person. ",

She failed in her parental duties towards you and your siblings, which is not your fault **whatsoever**. Yeah divorcing sucks but at some point you become responsible for your own mental health (especially as a parent) and she refused to address her problems.\n\nKeep any texts/emails your mum sends to you or your siblings and pass them onto your dad so he can give them to his lawyer for the custody fight.

What's good to know is your father is there for you and you have a safe and welcoming place to be, and your siblings are also there and safe from your mother's terrible behavior. Sometimes adults flip out like this and upend everyone and everything in their lives to get something new, like this boyfriend from the sounds of it. That's her path to walk, her mistake to make. You just focus on you and be there for the younger siblings as this may be even tougher on them because they're too young to really understand and can easily feel guilt or shame when that mantle belongs squarely on your mother's shoulders. Take a little strength and a hug from an internet stranger who wants more than anything for you all to heal and do well from here on out.

Trust me, there's nothing worse than having a lazy, mean, abusive mother who constantly insists all she cares about is you, and puts on a pretty face in public, but is an absolute nightmare when no one else is looking. It's just that much more frustrating knowing this person is single handedly ruining your life/childhood, yet insists they are wonderful and that you are ungrateful. \n\nI WISH my mother would straight up do something over the top like that.

So please, feel free to not read or think much about this; get your own affairs in order first. But, with that in mind:\n\nOne thing that hasn't really been brought up in this thread, is the relationship of your mother with her boyfriend. I'm not a psychologist, but your description in your first post (depressed until she met him, on anti-depressants now, madly in love with him, didn't get crazy till recently) sounds very much like some kind of dependancy. Which is unhealthy, especially given that he's verbally abusive.\n\nDoes she have someone close to her (siblings, friends etc) that can talk to her about this? If you want to repair your relationship with your mother at some point in the future, it sounds like this needs to happen first.",

She is under the mistaken impression that I don't know where this love nest is and there are both a no-contact order from his release conditions and a condition of his probation that he have no-contact with her and refrain from alcohol use and fraternizing with females. The last one seems weird but it's there in black and white. All I have to do is dump a folder of pictures, credit card receipts, and witness statements in his P.O.'s lap and he goes to prison for 18 months.

I'm not excusing her behaviour, but I get where she's coming from. She was severely depressed, terrible self-esteem, etc. It's a very bad place to be and very difficult to work yourself out of. You said she was better with medication and treatment, that's good - but now that she's found a new \"man\", she probably feels that she has to do everything she can to hold on to him because she feels that's all she'll ever get and if she loses him, that's it. So now, in her mind, it's *everything* to keep him \"happy\", to the point of irrationality. Even to the point of treating you and your siblings like this - it's terrible. She needs to get help with her self-esteem and to get out of that relationship, because it (the relationship) is not going to get any better.   \n\nAgain, this is not at all to excuse her, and you're 100% in the right to get yourself and your siblings out of that situation - it's just to make you aware because if she's able to get past this and is sincerely remorseful then there's a chance to mend some of the relationship.   \n\nYou and your siblings would also do well to sit down and talk to someone about all this, you sound like you've got a good perspective on this, but who knows where your brother and sister are. And even if you're \"alright\", it's still good to talk to someone anonymously.  \n",

I didn't talk to her for years until she got herself into AA and now we have a relationship. I wouldn't call it mother-daughter connection but more of a friendship. It sucks and growing up without a mom was horrible but hopefully she'll get her head on her shoulders one day.

The sooner she can do that, the sooner she'll be able to get a proper perspective of reality. Until then, everything she does is designed to protect her fragile sense of self. Maybe the best thing to do is just tell her that despite what has happened you still love her. But for the sake of everyone's health it's better to change these living arrangements. It looks like she sees the fact of her kids staying with her as a sort of emotional leverage over her humiliation of the past. With her kids leaving, it is almost like a revival of that humiliation. She's living in the past. By maintaining a narrative that reinforces the past the neurological imprints created by those traumatic experiences are maintained. By changing the narrative, those neurological imprints will go away and be replaced by other experiences, ideally positive ones.",

I guess I just need to put it out there...\n\nWe didn't broke up right after I made my post. We had a long conversation, made effort to listen to each other and decided to stay together. We right then planned to move in back together around New Years if everything's ok between us. And everything was good for a month, really good. At the end of November I finally relaxed, we started getting really close to each other again. One night he was extremely affectionate, we fooled around a bit for the first time after three months and later I mentioned moving in. After I told him how I think it's natural next step for us, I asked what are his thoughts. In a really cold manner he held 10 min long monologue how he's good where he is and there's no real reason to move back. I was sad but calm and just accepted what he was saying despite knowing that wasn't what we agreed on. He didn't really understand why am I sad but he let it go after I pleaded him. In short, he promised he will think about it.\n\n\nThen there was a week long string of his shitty behavior where all of a sudden I was guilty for every little thing. In short, the biggest thing was: I asked him, though nervously, if I can give him my house keys in the town center so I can spend morning with family that arrived for a day instead of waiting him at home til he arrives with his stuff in the early afternoon (he lost his keys to my place); he agreed moths ago that he will there with me, on that date, when my cousins arrive. He could have come over day earlier but first he said he had to work, then when he didn't he said he would rather spend the day at his place and town. It really pissed him off when I asked that... He was irritable whole week after that, acting cold and distant and refused to come to my place as agreed on multiple occasions.\n\n\nFinally we agreed he will come on Friday (a week after our last talk about moving in). He called me Friday morning, I couldn't really talk so we just exchanged few words (have a nice day etc.). Few minutes later I got text how I am cold and he feels unwelcome every time he needs to come over, how I ruin everything. I responded that if he doesn't want to come or be with me, it's okay, but I am not the problem and I don't want to fight. He is welcome to come if he solves his anger. He called me again and said he had enough and said he will just come over to gather his things. I was really pissed off because this was happening all over again and after 10 of his break up threats during our conversation - I told him I am fine with it. It ended up with him calling me a 100 times that day, I guess he was in disbelief that I (!) decided to break up after a whole month together where everything was good between us. I answered every call hoping he would say the right things but he was angry because his apologies weren't enough, mocking me and saying how he has no problem finding other women, how he was willing to forgive me all my wrongs and how I should do the same for his. At this point apologies meant nothing to me and I was annoyed how easily he would like to let all (his) drama go. Every few days he continued contacting me proclaiming his love etc., claiming he would do everything for me and us and how he changed, how he will always wait for me. He calmed down after a month, I was drawn to it so began calling once a week to see how he is. In February, after 2 or 3 conversations of that type, when I asked why is he willing to wait for me but not willing to actually do something to prove his change, he coldly said if what he already did isn't enough, it can't be helped. He was playing with me all over again and it was a final confirmation for me. He still tried to contact me after, confused how I stopped reaching out but I am not calling, not texting, not answering him for two months now. I truly loved him once but was miserable with him. I am now much happier and much much calmer, filled my life with hobbies, friends and happy thoughts! I am really proud that he didn't manage to convince me to lower my standards even more and destroyed my self esteem. I am tired of drama but I have never been in better state, both emotionally and physically!\n\ntldr He was playing with me again, hot'n cold, I broke up with him, disappointed how he really turned up to be, feeling pretty good.\n\nEdit: \nDear Redditors,\n\nthank you all for your support, it means the world to me in these moments! It feels good not to be alone.\n\n\nLots of you are guessing what was it with him: for months I was trying to figure why was he doing some things and, as some of you suggested, I noticed certain things were present form the beginning of our relationship \u2013 I was communicating back then I wasn't comfortable with it but he created a mental fog (great term!) about it,  I was more naive or understanding or just in love and accepted that change is a process that will take time. \nThose examples I provided you with are just the end of our relationship: yes, I was dismissive because I was sick of the pattern. Maybe I am not the best communicator, I see that now but I was really trying to listen. He did start dating me because I was empathic, he claimed it's my biggest quality. Later he claimed I disappointed him and that he expected more. His psychologist said he has just one problem: accepting things as they are when he excepted way more. He never had any problems he would talk to me about \u2013 except those where I was the problem. When I would approach him with my problems or how my day went, he would be smothered by it saying I must get used to people being unprofessional and not to be bothered by it (though not always); later he would point out how he always listens to me and expected me to be grateful he put up with it. \n\n\nAlso, when I broke up with him \u2013 he moved to the city where I live in a matter of 10 days claiming that it was his wish to move there all along and how life in his hometown is hopeless \u2013 and how it could have been with me if I haven't broke up with him (that was just 15 days after our moving in talk). He also mentioned it was part of the plan he made with his parents long time ago \u2013 when I asked how I wasn't aware of it he responded, confused, that I have nothing to do with it and his and their living arrangement. While we were living together he would attack my choice of words for his birth home \u2013 if I asked how was it at \u201ehouse\u201c (in my language used the same as home), he would say how dare I use house instead of home \u2013 when I would defend saying I didn't mean to hurt him and that I am not that conscious about my wording, he would be convinced I am doing it on purpose just to provoke him, emphasizing that his birth house will always be his home \u2013 and he wouldn't let go easily. Usually it would last for 3 hours - 3 hours of reasoning and convincing. Some months I was just numb sitting waiting for him to stop, not even trying anymore, my mind couldn't process it.\n\n\nI think he was very insecure, out of his comfort zone and trying to find a way to move away from me, he became suspicious about everything I did or said, looking for a reason to argue. I figured he didn't want to be with me. We were incompatible in many ways and in the end I just didn't want to be closed in his box together with him anymore. I want to live. Freely.\n\n\n\nWhat did help me? I learned that not everyone will react to my statements / words like I am hurting them. Now I still sometimes expect the worst and I can be really anxious about what I said (even though objectively it's not a big deal) but then the other person reacts positively, acknowledging me and my thoughts \u2013 and it's magnificent!\n\n\nThank you one more time - I can't describe what it means to me.",

They are nuts enough to have fights with themselves and their crazy circular self absorbed manipulative arguments, they don't need a partner, they need someone to just fight with.\n\nSeriously, glad to read that you finally broke it off with him. Let the trash take itself out. I don't talk to my sister anymore, and my life is a million times better without her in it.\n\nGood grief.",
            "Possibly. But people who aren\u2019t gaslighters don\u2019t typically know the behavior to lie about it.  But I guess it could be possible.",
            "So glad you did what you did! You are so much more important and rational than this guy who sounds like he was emotionally manipulative. I feel bad for the next girl he dates. But, well done to you \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",
            "Basically he's not irrational and you're as empathetic as you need to be,  hes just nowhere near as strong as you and no where near as interesting and doesn't want the things you do because they're just too much hard work for him. You deserve better. You know it and now he knows it. \ud83d\ude00",
            "What does (m31) and (f27) mean",
            "I'm glad you dumped this dumb person. literally sounds like a nightmare and I'm telling you it's so refreshing to be in a relationship with someone who does not make drama out of things that there is no drama about",
            "My ex was like that too. He would ignore me for days at a time when he got mad at me. Finally, after four days of refusing to speak to me he asked me \u201cso what are we?\u201d And i said \u201cdone\u201d. He harassed me for the next four months.",
            "Please read some books on codependence and/or boundaries so that you can recognize these traits in the future.",
            "Hes manipulative and when you dont give him what he want he projects his problems as being yours. I had a guy like that. Kicked him to the curb real quick. It sucks though. Take time and just spend your time doing things you enjoy and with good friends who value your opinion. You dont have to walk on eggshells nor do you deserve to.",
            "Idk, when you start taking your unhappiness out on your spouse, when they aren\u2019t the source, but treat them like they are, is textbook manipulative behavior. \n\nIf your GF is doing this, you might want to have a talk with her.  I can see being waspish at times, but if this is a constant thing, it could be a problem.\n\nIf you feel like you have to walk on eggshells, or any mistake is going to be a blow up... it\u2019s a problem.",
            "So I read this and the original post. It sounds like you weren't a good match, and I'm not surprised the relationship didn't work out.\n\nThat said, I'm surprised nobody's pointed out that he did have a point - you are not empathetic. Every time he tells you he's hurt about something, you shove it away and tell him it's not a big deal. That's actually a really shitty thing to do to people, especially someone you're in a relationship with. It says that you don't value their feelings, you don't trust them to be honest about their feelings, and you think you're the only decider of what's important in a relationship. You need to practice your empathy and validation skills. I bet a lot of situations earlier in the relationship could have been avoided if you had just said \"yes, I see that you are hurting\" and given him a hug.\n\nHe is passive aggressive, and neither of you are good communicators, but this is something you need to work on or it will come up again in future relationships.",
            "After all I've read, I'm still asking myself who's the bad guy here. If you look at it logically, it's not easy to tell, because this post is only one side. Maybe there was no bad guy. Maybe it just shouldn't have been, maybe you two are too different in how you communicate. Maybe you're too cold and he's too emotional. All possibilities, nothing's certain.\n\nI'm glad for you though, that you're happy the way it is now. Might be better for both of you.\n\nEdit: I find it frustrating and not especially fair, how many of you not even try to look at things from not her, but his perspective. The dislikes on my comment show, how few of you want to even only consider that her ex is a human being with reasons, flaws and so on while glorifying OP. Y'all might have had some similar problems with someone else, but please don't let your judgement get clouded because of that."
