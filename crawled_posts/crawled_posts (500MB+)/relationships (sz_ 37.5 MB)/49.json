        "selftext": "Here's the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5j2max/my_husband_drained_our_accounts_and_wants_to_kick/\n\nFirst, I want to say that I logged out of this account that evening, and didn't come back until now, and I was BLOWN AWAY by all of the people offering food, gift certificates, or just good will, and I started crying.. again. I will respond to each of you individually.\n\nSo, to recap: My STBX is a cheating ass, and he panicked and tried to erase his family.\n\nThe update: This all happened on a Sunday, so there wasn't a lot I could do right then. I put the kids to bed, and called my mom and cried. Then, I called my mother in law, who was horrified.\n\nMy inlaws came over that night with $200 in cash and a check for much more. My father in law is didn't say much, but he did fix my bathroom door (which is how he shows affection), and muttered that he would \"fix this\".\n\nI opened a new checking account at a new bank (THANKS FOR THIS ADVICE) with the check my in laws gave me.\n\nI opened a new credit card in my name.\n\nMy mother deployed a niece to help with childcare for the next week, I called in a lot of childminding favors, and with the cash my inlaws gave me, I was able to pay the babysitter while I worked this out.\n\nI met with two divorce attorneys- both of them told me about what you had said, that he was legally screwed. I chose one, and we set the process in motion to get an emergency hearing, but by Tuesday, my old checking account had most of the money back, and my husband was asking to \"talk\".\n\nOn the advice of my lawyer, I took half of the checking account money and put it in my new bank, and kept records of everything.\n\nI pulled our credit reports- He has over $40,000 in credit card debt. I also found out, that he received a raise last year, and funneled this money out of our shared accounts. I would have figured this out when I did our taxes, and this led to him panicking and trying to \"erase\" us.\n\nKeep in mind, this asshole gave me gonorrhea. I am an accountant by trade, and I'm afraid of CC debt the way some girls are afraid of spiders, so I was horrified about this, but my lawyer thinks it's likely that he'll have to have this debt on his own, as my name isn't on it, and it seems that most of it was spent on his side piece.\n\nWe have started mediation, which he agreed to when he realized that he would need to pay for BOTH of our divorce attnys.\n\nMy goal- which my lawyer thinks is reasonable, is to ask for alimony until I either re-marry (not likely) or my 2 year old is in school full time, and to have a reasonable amount of child support until she's 18, and then we'll split college costs for all of them. When all the kids are in school, I can concentrate on getting back to work.\n\nI also plan to sell the house and buy a smaller house in a less elite section of town. The kids can share rooms, and I can live mortgage free.\n\nSo, I'm heartbroken, and diseased, but there's also an incredible weight that his lifted from me. Our marriage has been bad for so long, and I didn't even realize how unhappy I was, and how.. absent by husband was. It took my 5 year old almost a week to realize that Daddy was gone.",

It'll be like it never even happened.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is, while it is a shit cherry on top of a shit sundae, society's misinformed notions and a scary name have given you something else to stress about, when the reality is it's not your fault and it really isn't a big deal.",

And they can be to help you be happy and your kids to be happy. They will judge him on their relationship to him when they are older, and his behavior is his to be responsible and accountable for in life. Dont feel bad because hes their dad and somehow because hes a shitstain thats your fault. Its not. Just be the best you that you can be. So many options and choices are yours in the future.

            "This guy is a real piece of work. He gives you an STI and was content to hide his cheating until you called him on it, and instead of taking any responsibility whatsoever, he freaks out (because someone called him out on his bullshit), steals money from his wife and children and tries to evict them. He's getting exactly what he deserves, and it is delicious.\n\nYou are amazing, OP. Never forget that. You learned the hard way that your STBX sucks as a human being but don't let it affect your self-esteem because he is crap. I hope your MIL chews his ass off. ",

Hang in there, one year from now, everything will be SO much better.\n\nThere is a book that every person who is about to get divorced should read:\n\nDivorce & Money: how to make the best financial decisions during divorce by Violet Woodhouse, published by Nolo Press. \n\nThis is a very easy to read book that will take you through the important decisions that you need to make when separating assets. I read the entire book on the plane. Because you are an accountant by nature, it will only take you a couple hours to read the book and you will feel so much better to tackle the negotiation process. \n\nThis was the most important book I read about divorce, and it made the difference between facing the future in excellent financial shape instead of a dismal outlook.  This book allowed me to secure my child's future.\n\nIf you want to buy the newest edition (12th), it just came out. However, your public library has older editions that you can read for free.  Depending on what my library had available, I rotated between the 9th-11th editions, and I honestly couldn't tell them apart because they were so similar to each other. \n\nBest wishes for your future, but I know that you've got this.

Gonorrhea is a readily treated STI.  As soon as you are able,  please get yourself to a counselor to start talk therapy.  Then find a yoga studio that has child care and start a regular practice.  With all this emotional turmoil it's very easy to forget to or not feel like eating. People lose a ton of weight and get sick in situations like yours,  and with your recent infection,  your immune system needs all the help it can get.

I absolutely understand his need to game, it's his downtime and I would never ask him to stop altogether. However we haven't gone to bed together in over 2 years, he stays up till 3/4am every night gaming. I can't get any sleep, it's a small house so all I can hear is the clicking of the mechanical keyboard and him talking to the others online. He'll sleep till 12/1pm on the weekends, he games for most of the day and night, thinks spending an hour or 2 with me after I make dinner is 'quality time' (it really isn't). I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to limit his gaming time.\u00a0 I'm stuck doing all of the household chores while working full time and running my own business (a bakery). I love alone time as much as the next person but I feel so lonely as we can't do anything together because his world revolves around it. I have tried every approach and he won't budge. He turns it around on me saying that I'm being controlling, needy and that I'm changing him which I'm absolutely not, I have never asked him to stop and would never. He does work so I understand the need to escape and have time alone. Any advice is much appreciated.\n\nTL;DR Husbad games all night, refuses to see it may be a problem in our marriage",

            "I read a similar story on here a few years ago and the girlfriend/wife had good success with asking her husband to just track his hours, everything he did. Then rank his priorities in life and compare how he spent his time to his priorities. He would *tell her* she was his priority but she was able to demonstrate that is not where he was prioritizing his time.\n\nIDK. My husband went through a phase where gaming was a problem, but it was that, and directly related to his mental health. \n\nAside from making it extremely clear that he is prioritizing a digital life over his irl wife and that you are being negatively affected by his gaming and are not going to stick around for that forever or subject kids/dogs whatever to it. And that playing an hour or two at night and a couple hours on the weekend are fine but what he's doing is unhealthy for everyone including himself, there's not much you can do. It really is similar to dealing with an addict. You have to decide what **your** boundaries are and stick to them.\n\nETA: also. You are not obligated to try to fix him or try to solve this problem. This is a problem of his creation. If he does nothing and you leave you should not feel guilty. **You deserve to be treated well in a relationship, and not expected to sit on a shelf until your partner is ready to play with you. You are a whole person with needs and wants and it is a good thing to know that and fight for it**",
            "Having a hobby is fine. Having an addiction is not. A hobby becomes an addiction when it takes over his life and he refuses to see the damage it\u2019s doing to his relationship and the pain it\u2019s causing you. \n\nLike any addict he\u2019s unlikely to stop until he recognises the problem and wants to stop - and he\u2019s unlikely to recognise the problem until he hits rock bottom or is shocked out of it.",

            "\\>  I've tried talking to him about this but it always escalates into a  fight and he says that he'll be living a miserable life if he has to  limit his gaming time.\u00a0 \n\nAs someone who has been addicted to gaming in the past (now recovered), this sounds familiar to me.\n\nVideo games are a form of escape. Same as drinking or doing drugs. They let your mind be obsessed with something other than your real problems. They offer the feeling of success, victory, winning, the same way that a gambling addict gets a psychological reward from the slot machine hitting a winner. Except gaming has no hangover, no physical effects, and costs very little (compared to gambling).\n\nIt sounds to me like he's dealing with some inner demons that he can't handle, and he's found his escape mechanism. I recommend finding resources for partners of gaming addicts- there are some out there.\n\nIf he's unwilling to fight his addiction, unwilling to deal with his problems, you need to look out for yourself. I don't think that divorce should be the first option- you care about your partner and you want to help.\n\n\\>  I'm stuck doing all of the household chores ...  I have never asked him to stop and would never \n\nPlaying some devil's advocate- this is enabling behaviour. He has a serious problem that you can clearly see. You make it possible for him to continue to have this problem, and don't ask him to stop having it. Replace gaming with drugs, alcohol, or gambling and ask yourself if you'd still look at it the same way?\n\nGood luck to the both of you. It's not an easy road.",

Stop doing his chores, cooking and laundry and then you two need to get to counseling. He is ignoring your needs (sleep, comfort of a marriage, etc.) AND is not open to collaborating to find a solution. If he was open to communicating and sympathetic to your feelings about it I wouldn't jump to counseling, but these are major red flags that you can't even talk to him about it because he is blinded by the need to game.",

It's not unreasonable for you to want to spend more quality time with him, and it's absolutely unfair for him to leave the burden of household chores solely on you. If you've tried everything, and he's still acting like a miserable teenager, I'd seriously consider divorce and find yourself a true partner.

            "I\u2019ve lost countless days, weeks and months to video games. I\u2019ve shown up to work extra tired, sacrificed the quality of my output in school etc. I myself just got a new ps5 and have been putting down hours upon hours with COD. \n\nWhat I realized is that this addiction is even worse now with covid (I work from home) - it doesn\u2019t take much to hop in and out of zoom calls when needed and then work on my cod K/D ratio for the balance of the day.\n\nI had to immediately break this habit as there would be some serious reprecautions that would reverberate from this. More importantly, I have my headphones enjoying myself in game while my toddlers are upstairs with their mom. Wtf am I doing?\n\nI\u2019m sorry to tell you this but dude is prioritizing his gaming friends and relationship over yours. You need to understand it\u2019s a community of gamers. No matter what game you play you and your gaming friends \u201ctogether\u201d are overcoming challenges. These challenges can be completed in 30 minutes or in weeks. Regardless, during this duration of time you are effectively building a bond, trust and ultimately a relationship with your group of \u201cgaming buddies\u201d. You wonder why this ends up in an argument when you talk about it? Well that\u2019s because he\u2019s defending what means the most to him, he\u2019s protecting his loved ones and making sure no one gets between him and them. You unfortunately are not in the same level as them, that\u2019s why the argument is with you and not with them. \n\nThis is a very serious problem that will only get worse IMO. Dude needs to check his priorities and see what\u2019s happening outside of the 120fps he\u2019s starting at. (I agree with others, professional help is required)\n\nYou on the other hand need to to understand that this is not ok. 3 years has gone on way to long and it\u2019s going to be that much harder to break. How would you feel if he was out of the house all the time and only giving you 2hrs a day every day and Coming home at 3-4am Just to sleep? That\u2019s what this is, just because he\u2019s physically home doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok. \n\nI think this whole release thing is fine, and when we get new games and systems there\u2019s a period where you can really put serious hours down but 3 years everyday. This just slaps differently",
            "Does he work? Does he pay the bills? If not, turn off the internet",
            "He clearly is addicted. If you want a better life, he will have to make changes ON HIS OWN. Otherwise, he will forever resent you. \nI suggest a trial separation and you'll see how much better your life will be with a proper partner.",
            "If my SO told me their life would be miserable if they stopped playing games I'd start encouraging them to seek professional help. I'm also miserable doing laundry but I fucking do it because I'm an adult. I do have depression and anxiety and it IS a struggle! My SO also games far too much (we don't watch TV really and we both play, it's our main activity which I'm fine with) so we have rules like do chores before starting a game, so he'll do a load of dishes or take out the trash or something (I do not have this rule because it isn't a problem for me,I have my own issues)\n\nETA: if my so told me that chores made them miserable my initial statement would probably be something like \"chores make everyone miserable, that's why they aren't called funs, and I'm a person here too and you not pulling your weight is adding extra misery to me. I wash your clothes, I cook your food, I don't have to do these things, these aren't requirements for me. I do them because we are supposed to be a partnership, but you're not being a good partner right now, so I'm going to just do my own stuff for a while as you do\"",

            "Few years back I was engaged. My fianc\u00e9 ended up with depression then sunk his life into online gaming. We lived together and didn\u2019t speak for two weeks. We would hardly even see each other unless I made the effort to go into his office to see him.\n\nWhen I got home from work he would already be up there, headset on. I\u2019d go to bed alone every day. I asked him to cut back but he\u2019d get mad and call me controlling, say it was toxic I didn\u2019t want him having hobbies. He needed professional help, it was an addiction. \n\nI couldn\u2019t do it anymore so I left. And he was awful about it. Told everyone I cheated on him and I lost all my friends, but the good ones came back when they saw who he was.\n\nIt\u2019s an addiction and you are suffering because of it. You have all the physical and emotional labor of running a household on your shoulders. It\u2019s unfair and he needs to change or leave.",
            "For 1 or 2 weeks carefully note just how much time he's spending on the games. Suggest different activities like watching a movie, playing something together, going for a walk, or whatever. Note the number of times he chooses gaming over anything with you. Make notes of chores and other tasks you complete and his contributions as well. Be honest about all this because you are upset and your brain is bias because of it so estimating is not a good idea.\n\nAfter the set time look over the information and present it to him. Just say very directly you are unhappy with the current relationship, you are concerned he is either addicted or suffering from depression or other mental health issues, and it needs to change or the relationship is over. Gather some information about therapy if you have access to that service. Make it clear you cannot continue in the relationship if he does not change. Then leave him to do what he chooses. Support him in finding help and changing habits and if he refuses don't yell or lecture. This isn't worth fighting about because he either chooses the relationship or gaming and it has to be his choice not you screaming him into what you want. Biggest thing stay calm, present facts, act accordingly.",
            "Oh man, I could have written this myself 10 years ago. At that time, it sucked, but I put up with it. I gamed too, just not as much. It was at a point where he was missing work because he over slept after gaming all night. He even lost a job because of it. Really, his not seeing it as a problem was the beginning of the end. I realized I wasn\u2019t his priority. But, I stayed, because I was so sure he\u2019d change or start to care about me over the games again.\n\nNow, I don\u2019t know if you have kids or plan on having them. \nFor me, having children was the straw that broke the camels back.\nBecause now I was a mom and he was still playing just as much. If I said I was tired because I\u2019d been up all night with a baby, He was also \u201ctired\u201d ...because he\u2019d been playing video games all night. \n\nEventually, I left. It wasn\u2019t only the gaming but it certainly factored in.\n\nYou need to make is abundantly clear how this is affecting you and your relationship with him. \nSet boundaries and stick to them. You deserve a partner that\u2019s putting just as much into the relationship as you are.",

We have played together (WoW being one) or he plays on his console and I snuggle up and watch for the stories. If I am being more cuddly than usual he will stop gaming to do so. \n\nOh man, just thinking if kids where a wanted thing how downhill that would go x.x we have kids (4/7) and we rarely let them play video games, maybe twice a week.\n\nCounseling if you want to try, couples and just him sessions, and if that doesn't work it would be divorce.",

He chose games over your relationship a long time ago, there\u2019s effectively no more relationship to be saved.\n\nStart quietly documenting everything, separate your bank accounts, then walk into an attorney\u2019s office. Don\u2019t say a word to him, if he cared at all then he\u2019d at least put the controller down. Do not announce your departure, just get a truck and start loading it. \n\nMAYBE he has an untreated mental illness, in which case I could have SOME amount of sympathy, but it still doesn\u2019t excuse his lashing out and disrespect.

            "\"he'll be living a miserable life\"\n\nHonestly, it sounds like he already is and trying to mask it with video games. Of course this warrants a conversation, but I'm the type of person who will give my facts in order by timing the amount of time he's been playing and propose a compromise (if you truly want to stay with him)\n\n\"Honey, I've noticed you've played video games for x hours this week. I'd love to get some more time with you. Can we shoot for x-5 hours next week? 5 hours is only 3% of your week, and I'd love to have that 3% with you.\" It's a small compromise which if he loves you, he should be willing to make.",

My fianc\u00e9e and I game together a lot and separately but we always make time for each other, do household chores together, cook dinner together, and we also prioritize the nights we need to cuddle on the couch. He doesn\u2019t usually go to bed with me but does spend about 10-15 minutes on \u201ctucks\u201d where he holds me and kisses me before I fall asleep. His boys know tucks are important. My kids get tucks where he says goodnight and does silly things with them and he games with them, too.

It\u2019s so much easier to avoid everything in your life and to play video games. A world where you have control over wins and losses. \n\nI honestly would suggest serious ultimatums. Not necessarily to have him quit playing video games but more around seeking counselling. \n\nDon\u2019t shame him. Tell him you\u2019re worried. Tell him you care. Tell him how much you love him, how much you miss him but only do so if it\u2019s sincere. Explain how this is hurting you emotionally, even to see him live this way. \n\nTell him if he doesn\u2019t at least try therapy or counselling you will have to reconsider whether or not you can continue being in this relationship. \n\nIf he ends up choosing video games over you, it\u2019s probably for the best.",

Stop making his life so convenient for him, he seems to have completely checked out of your relationship, his responsibilities and your needs. You did not marry a child, you married an equal. Stop making his life so easy for him. He needs to pull his weight too, and since he has not been doing that you really need to think about if this is something you want to put up with.",

You don't have a problem with your husband gaming you have a problem with your husband being addicted.\n\nIt's not about hobbies, me-time or \"trying to change him\" it's about an addiction. Addicts don't realise they are addicted. They don't see their behaviour as a problem. You won't be able to help him until he realizes that there indeed is a problem. Your only choice is to either continue enabling and bearing with it or taking some drastic measures. He probably won't even notice it if you try to change smal things. I would go big. Make waves.

Maybe seeing it laid out on paper will make him realise the imbalance. I hope you are able to make him see sense. Video games can be addictive like anything else, maybe he doesn't quite realise the extent of the problem. Good luck.",
            "I\u2019ve been there, OP, and relate to your story significantly. Many years ago I was married to a man who literally did exactly what your husband is doing - stayed up super late gaming, was super loud and kept me up at night, slept in, was no help around the house, seemingly no real motivation in life which ultimately developed into a lonely and loveless marriage. I made it very clear over time that things had to change or I was leaving. I remember seeking the advice of my father as I felt I would die in that marriage, and he said go where there\u2019s happiness. Long story short I left and I\u2019ve never looked back. Sure he suffered the repercussions of his ways down the road and begged for me to give him another chance, but it was too late. I don\u2019t recommend something as drastic as divorce - at least not now - but if he\u2019s unwilling to change, this current way of life goes from one year into two and then three and you\u2019ll be asking yourself why did I not leave sooner while enduring your own personal hell. Love is tricky, the heart wants what the heart wants, but being alone in a relationship is worse than merely being alone. And I did end up going where there\u2019s happiness. In hindsight I do believe, as others have stated in these comments, that he was likely dealing with mental health issues and for that I am empathetic, but it was coming at the cost of having any semblance of a healthy life. Wish you the best!",
            "I've dealt with this in 2 relationships. Thank goodness never married.  I feel really bad for you. Its simply an addiction. Breaking that habit will be hard. Trying to get him to understand you are more important will be hard. It's an addiction . You will upset him by saying that. You will upset him by looking for help. Be you. Be honest. Thsts all you can do. No one deserves to be alone in a relationship.  I hope it works out",

It's been awesome. \n\nWhat i did and try to do as much as i can:\n- go to bed early to sleep together (maybe 3 or 4 times a week, it's not eazy tho.

Don't nag nor try to get him out of playing while he is at (it just make u both nervous and uncorfortable, but resolves little or nothing)\n2. While your situation don't improve, stop doing his house work and calling him to lunch or dinner if he is gaming. He must learn that he need to do stuff in the house so he can have a nice place to live with u.\n3. Sit down and talk.

Maybe he needs some outside help/support (therapy, etc). I also would say don't make the gaming thing all or nothing. As you said, he still needs some time to decompress and that is his way of doing so. However, point out his priorities are not in the right order.",

            "There is such a thing a video game addiction, as someone who\u2019s been there i might be able to offer some advice. \n\nGames these days are highly addictive, the reward systems are tuned to keep your brain engaged. Throw in a social element and the game can start to replace an IRL social life - to the point where it\u2019s becomes a negative feedback loop: lose connection with friends, replace with video game friends, play more video games, lose connection with friends etc. So the trick is to organize activities outside of the home (hard with COVID I know) with people you know. It\u2019s a slow process but if the need for social connection can be found outside of the games that\u2019s a good path to recovery. \n\nSecond is depression. Games are a good escape  in moderation, but if he\u2019s constantly escaping, maybe there\u2019s some issues in his life he\u2019s not communicating. I\u2019m not an expert with lifting people out of depression, but replacing the source of those feel good hormones with something you both enjoy might be a good start. \n\nWhat got me was moving to a new town for work (super small, < 10k pop) in the dead of winter.

            "Gaming is a very sensitive subject I think.\n\nA lot of people get addicted to it because it removes you from the real world. When the real world is shit, depressing and you feel like you can't handle it, gaming will bring you to a different world and give you relief. It will give you the kind of satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment that is endlessly hard to achieve in the real world.\n\nSo I think when approaching this, we have to look at what we could do to make this person more satisfied in the real world. Which can be immensely difficult! Especially right now: the world isn't looking too great. It's only understandable there are so many people addicted to games.\n\nStill this is very unacceptable behaviour toward someone you supposedly love.

I know that my fianc\u00e9 would drop everything if i needed him and vice versa.

It also means nobody is in the wrong here. You're both just living different lifestyles.\n\nHere's what you do.\n\nSet clear expectations and boundaries. You want a relationship where you prioritize each other. Where a majority of free time is spent with each other. Gaming has nothing to do with this. You could replace gaming with charity and the same issues would apply.\n\nYou also need to be brave and ask him to define his expectations.

You could possibly play with him. \n\nI also suggest sitting him down and saying that you want to do more activities together like going for a walk, watching a movie together or even cooking together. \n\nAs for your sleep....I would ask him to get a quieter keyboard and yourself some earplugs to help",

At his age he should be waking up no later than 9:00 a.m. depending on his job of course. That said **as someone with a family he should try and make time for them, meaning you.**\n\nI recommend throwing out some ground rules like when I go to sleep I want you in bed with me until I fall asleep then you can go back to your games, or you need to wake up with me and have coffee/breakfast in the mornings,and especially you should try and make some time during the week to spend with just each other some weeks won't have it other weeks will have more but there should be some time to bond with each other.",

You need to be very concrete about what you want. For example, instead of asking for \"more quality time\", tell him how happy it would make you if you could have one game free night per week together. This is specific and measurable. If he won't, it might be time to admit that there's some really fundamental incompatibility in what you both want from the relationship.\n\nI'll also ask this.

            "Hi.  I was you.  Married for just over 3 years and had been together for a total of 5.  He was a gamer right from the beginning but he still made time for me, his schooling and friends.  Every once in awhile he would lose balance and game a bit too much but would bounce back.  After the first year of marriage that didn't happen anymore.  I graduated, worked fulltime, did the chores, 95% of bills (mine, his and household), gave him spending money and bought his games.  The reasoning I had for letting that happen was to unburden him from the strain of having to contribute when he was still trying to finish school.  He struggled with school.  He was taking one course and told me he could not work because he needed to give this one course his everything.  So as rediculous as that seemed, I shouldered everything so he can get that last credit.  Well he failed.  Three times.  He never studied. He stayed up all night playing games.  I'd hear the clicking in the next room and I'd get mad because I needed to work.  He'd throw a tantrum and tell me too bad.  He'd game with his friends nonstop while I cooked and cleaned.  He smelled.  He wouldn't shower, brush his teeth or change his clothes.  We had sex once every six months because I would have to practically beg for it.  He would lie there and I would get pissed off because he was staring off.  I would stop and just leave it because it was horrible.  He would go right back to his game.  I tried getting him to go for walks or hikes and he would tell me how stupid and pointless it was.  He was so unprepared, he was obese, wore jeans and a sweater on a really hot day and nearly passed out.  My friend's friend was a nurse and seemed all judgemental that I would let him dress like that.  I bought him shorts and a light t-shirt but he gave me heck for that. \n\nI bought us a trip to Japan because he loves anime and everything Japanese.  I planned lots of activities for him but also for my brother who came with us.  He threw fits because he didn't like some of the excursions planned.  He brought bad shoes when I bought him new hiking shoes.  Then got blisters, yelled at me saying I made him walk too much, had me change his bandages and tend to him in the hotel room all day.  My brother was livid and went on his own.  I paid for my husbands entire trip, plus gave him his own spending money and never said thank you. \n\nIn the last year I was getting fed up so I asked him to leave multiple times.  He would say I owed him half of everything, I would have to pay for half of his school debt and owe alimony.  When I actually really made him leave he threatened his own life, tried begging, cried but him saying he would change was something he's done a few times already.  I gave him a couple thousand and he left.  He still wants more money years later but I now have a new boyfriend and we just had a baby.  I can't support him any longer.\n\nI wasted a lot of time on someone who was an addict.  I felt like as his wife I was responsible for his well-being and I was a failure for not being able to cope with his addiction.  Try putting it into perspective for him but don't waste your life on someone who doesn't appreciate you.  I was affraid to leave but I'm happier now.  Being alone was so much better.  I was able to have friends and enjoy my life.",

You may have to have a conversation if he doesn\u2019t. \n\nYou could also schedule family time. Maybe dinner and a movie.

He is turning on you when you try to bring up your concerns. That is not ok.  I would sit down and have a serious talk. Think about what you want to say and what you are willing to do and tell him. Will it therapy or couples counselling? If he blows up and blames you or says no, then you have to follow through with your plan. Will you stay or go? Only you can decide if this is the life you want to live. Gaming is fine. He does not have to give it up.

I know he\u2019s had a lot of opportunities to change and may not necessarily deserve it, but try to be patient and gentle because he may just not fully understand how much of an issue it is in your relationship.

I no longer had a husband who wanted to be in a marriage. The best advice I can offer is to get in front of him, turn off his console, all media devices and let him know how strongly this is affecting your marriage and your resolve to continue in it.

Usually 10PM to 1AM.\n\nIf your SO doesn\u2019t play, then you both have to compromise. Gaming is his thing, so find your thing. And he can compromise by playing only a few days a week and less hours. \n\nAny relationship requires compromise from both sides. Works wonderfully for all my married friends who game. One is a woman with a brand new baby, and she always finds time because with the pandemic gaming is what makes her have time to talk to other adults.\n\nEdit to add:\nIf he can\u2019t compromise and help you, then you have to weight everything and see if this relationship makes you happy. Maybe it\u2019s best to end now when there\u2019s no kid involved. \n\nGaming at night to release the stress and connect with friends is one thing. Having an addiction and letting down people who love you, it\u2019s something else.",
            "Spending 40+ hours a week on a hobby is excessive. He should keep it to 10-20 hours a week. Like others have said, ask him to clock his hours. Just do this for a few weeks to a month, not a permanent thing. Him getting angry about this conversation is a big red flag, and you don't deserve to be talked down to like that.\n\n\nI've seen both ends of the scale on this one. The other end of the scale is when a spouse only spends 5-10 hours a week on gaming, 10+ hours with their spouse, and the other half *still* gets peeved by it. This is because video games are *very* unique hobbies. Unlike golf or bowling, gaming happens in the home. Unlike car tuning or wood working, there is no physical 'product'.\n\n\nTo mitigate this, I always suggest having a specific room for gaming, and if possible, find a game that both spouses are into and play it together a few times a month.\n\n\nIf he can't even have the conversation, then seek couples counseling. If I can get my 13 year old son to put down COD Zombies without protest, then a 34 year old man can for his wife.",
            "I'll say this, as a lifelong gamer and lifelong depressed human: the amount of time I actively spend/spent gaming has a pretty direct connection to how I'm doing, and the more stressed/depressed, often the more I game.\n\nThankfully, this hasn't been a huge issue in relationships for me, because I'm not one to end up ignoring a partner over it. When my ex-wife and I were still together, I can say for sure that I played a *lot* more when shit was tough, and like you two, we didn't go to sleep at the same time.\n\nWhile I never played as much as him as regularly, I can understand what he might be feeling, likely without knowing he's feeling it. Gaming is a comfortable place to be, and provides a world with rules that feel a lot more understandable, and lots of games clearly provide those occasional dopamine rewards which is pretty nice when your brain is failing *hard* at giving you that.\n\nOthers have suggested having him really track the time, and I think that's a noble idea, but I worry that he'd lie. Not questioning his character so much as if he truly is this deep in it, and already feels like your interest in addressing this is \"controlling\", he already feels like you're in a position of authority over him, and that's when little lies to protect yourself start to feel okay.\n\nMy angle would be: have him look into therapy. Like you've said, it's not just that he's gaming a lot, he's also clearly not giving you time and attention you need, and it sounds like, not really investing anything into the rest of your (or his) life.\n\nTo me, that's signs of things to talk to a professional about.",
            "I'm a gamer and this is not normal behaviour whatsoever. This is addictive behaviour. He's being a lazy ass and you need to give him an ultimatum. He wants all the bonuses of having a wife but doesn't want to put any work in himself. You're gonna have to sit him down and tell him he can't have both worlds. Absolutely no way I would treat my partner like this, even when I'm heavily into a game I love, I take breaks to give my partner attention and show him love and we cook together or clean together. I also take hour breaks here and there so we can have intimate time together. Your hubby either has an addiction he needs help for, or he's a lazy arse and needs a good kick up it.",
            "Try to talk to friends of him maybe. \nAddiction is real and you could talk with a trusted therapist on how to handle the situation. \nMaybe you play your part of co-dependency and having some separated time is good for both of you.",
            "You're not his wife. You're his mother. He doesn't have to do anything except game, and only spends the bare minimum of time keeping you around.\n\nStop enabling this behaviour.",
            "Literally my boyfriend maybe games once a week if that. And he always asks me if it\u2019s okay if he does",
            "Ok so the comment he said\" he would be living a miserable life if he had to cut down time on gaming\" just left a bad taste in my mouth. Essentially is he saying that without his games and spending time with YOU will make him miserable? \n\nI think you DO need to intervene here. This is just nuts on how much he plays. Does he work? Does he bring in any income? If not maybe you need to put your foot down and explain he needs to get his priorities straight. He's not a 16 yr old boy. He is a grown man. \n\nIts fine to play, im not bashing on that. I like to from time to time. The fact here, he's playing from sun up to sun down. He makes it sound like spending any time with you is just too much effort. That he'd rather game then be with you. Im not trying to be mean or harsh, but this is my take on it from over here. \n\nYou do not deserve with. He's not in a relationship with you. He has more of a relationship and bond with his games than you. I would definitely put your foot down. Not to mention this is not healthy. For him or you.",
            "I used to play any and every hour I could. If I could, I'd play 30+ hour sessions. Granted we've only been together for 2 months, but I have barely touched my computer in ages.Still play something every now and then, but I don't NEED it anymore. Gaming, just like anything else that's done in big quantities of time on a daily basis, is an escape, not a hobby.",
            "omg, enough of this! enough! there are a thousand of these posts a day across multiple subreddits and websites. at this point, just start dating another guy. he will literally be too immersed in his vidya to even notice or care. if he finds out and cares, tell him that the new guy is bringing him a ps5, and bring him some chicken tendies for dinner. he will be ecstatic then.",
            "Look let him know that this is ridiculous.  If you started going out at night or dating someone else, w=oud he even notice? Him playing games all day is not being with you or being a present partner. \n\nI mean I'd let him know your are leaving him if he doesn't get treatment for what is essentially an addiction. \n\nBTW he can fuck right off keeping you up at night. That's cruel and selfish.\n\nThis is not normal and I say this as a guy who games every day. I always chose real life over games. But I will say that this pandemic has made me game more since a lot of my other interests and outlets have been cut off.",
            "He'll understand if he loses you and all he has left is his gaming buddies",
            "As someone who struggled with the same problem from the other side (I was pretty much addicted to online gaming) I can tell its a way of filling a void in your life, just as probably any addiction. Maybe try and engage in some serious talk about what he wants to achive in life and if he feels something is missing.\n\nIn my case I felt wrong at the university but struggled to accept it. Once I gave up on it and got a nice job it got better right away. Sad part for the girl at that time is that I also realized that she was also part of me feeling miserable. She kept accepting my behaviour so I dug into this whole. You have to be strong to pull him out of his situation, I know that sounds unfair and awful and that what it is. But he just like me at the time lacks the strenght to pull him out of it.\n\nMy new partner and now wife for 4 years with two kids was very dedicated on not letting me waste so much time and energy on games and I didnt really miss it, not the long gaming nights at least.\n\nI hope my story can offer you advice and not just bad feelings but please stay strong and consider that your husband may need you more than you realize.",
            "All is not lost - don\u2019t give up because of this. I dealt with the same issue at the beginning of covid. It took a few months of arguing, and then looking at my own priorities and expectations, and acting on them. I told him he could game as long as he wanted, as long as these chores were done every day and we had dinner together and spent time together for an hour or so. \nWe both have our separate social groups (as well as groups we share), but this separation has really helped me focus on spending time taking with my close friends and working on myself too. He decompresses by gaming and comes to me happy and excited to spend time, and I do the same. It was hard to get through but we are both so happy now."

I wish I could go and thank each of you for your thoughtful comments, but time isn't really something I have a ton of right now ;) And for those of you who said you relate, might I encourage reading \"Boundaries\" by Cloud & Townsend. Obviously this is still a huge struggle for me, but I'm thankful for the example others who have figured it out can set for us \"people pleasers\".\n\nOne of my best friends of over 12 years is getting married in October and chose a college friend to be her maid of honor. There was just one weekend thrown out to have both a bridal shower and bachelorette party, in a city 600 miles away from me. Unfortunately, it is the weekend that my finals and group projects are due for graduate school and it's the first week of school for me, as I work as a behavior therapist in a school. Once I discovered this, I immediately drafted an email explaining the situation, including several other weekends that my husband and I could come up to celebrate, and apologizing profusely. I get an email back about how everyone's \"busy\", but she thought I would be the one to understand since I just got married (about a year ago) and how she went to all my festivities. Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life, I agreed to make it work, and have made arrangements to take finals early and have working with my group to try to finish our work before we leave.\n\nThe party is this coming up weekend, 4 days away. I have not been told a schedule, don't know where we're staying, how much anything will cost, etc. The MOH has been flaky with email, didn't tell me which airport to fly into (since the initial thought was bridal shower in one city and bach party in another, but who knows what the plan is now) so now I'm driving 8 hours on Friday to get there. Since the MOH hasn't been answering me, I had to text the bride asking for a plan and she said she knows nothing either, but asked if I could potentially drive people back from Bach location to bridal shower location, which would add 2 hours to my already 8 hour drive. I have no idea when I'll have wifi to look over my group project and already have to change my work schedule during the first week to accommodate this party, of which, there is literally no plan.\n\nOriginally, my plan was to just suck it up and not add drama to the situation by chalking the rude email up to wedding stress and just not saying anything; however, now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend. Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say?\n\nTL;DR Friend guilted me into attending bridal shower/bach party in a city 600 miles away from me even though I told her I had finals and it was my first week of school, as I work in a school. The party is 4 days away and there is no plan and now I'm starting to feel bitter and don't know whether to say anything or if I should, what to say.",

And that *real* celebration is the wedding. If you are invited and attending, you can make sure you made a HUGE fuss of the bride on the day (if she even notices)\n\nIf she shows lack of understanding still then I'm afraid that shows the level of friendship you have with the bride. A true friend, close or not, would understand or at least tell you so and grin and bear it no matter how upset she may be.",
            "my god, what is WITH bachlor/ette parties?? I have several friends who've recently had miserable experiences at out of town parties- spending way too much money, poor scheduling, etc who felt like they couldn't say anything because that would trigger the wrath of the bridal couple/family. I'd say cancel your attendance, and if you want to be very nice, you could offer going somewhere together to celebrate her marriage at a later date. You can also frame it as \"I am so incredibly stressed and I don't want to bring down your celebration by not being in the right mindset.. I'd rather plan a special evening/weekend for you when I can be fully present\" or some other excuse to get off the hook.",

You have no idea about the when, where and what - how do you plan to even attend in these circumstances? Not to mention that the whole situation reeks of \"cancelled or postponed last minute\". Your education is more important than some party that doesn't seem to be happening anyway. \n\nAs for picking up people, which would add extra 2 hours of drive - just no. Driving for 8 hours is insane already, and she is out of her mind if She thinks that this is acceptable. Those people can use the bus or the train. Don't let her guilttrip you into even more unreasonable favors.\n\nIn any case, it is really weird that a friend of 12 years would act like that. Normally, if someone has exams, paper due or projects, it is more than enough reason to bow out of attending some party. She is incredibly selfish and doesn't care about you one bit.

Politely explain (in an email if you don't want the confrontation) that while you were willing to rearrange your schedule to accommodate the celebrations, at this late point and with no definitive plans, you are unable to attend due to prior obligations with your Graduate studies.  That's it, end of story.  Your studies and mental health are your priority - not a childhood friend who is still acting like a child.  But fully expect to be uninvited to the wedding and to possibly lose the friendship.  No big loss from what I see, though.\n\nYears ago I had to skip some of the festivities for a good friend's wedding.  I was newly pregnant, in my first trimester.  Getting there would entail an early-morning flight to one city, sitting for several hours, then another flight on a puddle jumper to a small airport and THEN a one and a half hour drive to her hometown.  She was fully understanding.  And guess what, I was a bridesmaid!",
            "Just say no. No is a complete sentence.\n\n> agreed to work with them\n\nNo... just no. One syllable. \n\n> transport some people to the next venue 2 hours away\n\nNo. \n\n> can't get in communication with MoH or bride for what the plan is\n\nSounds like they're just going to play it by ear. Doable if everyone is local. Not so much when you cant even get airport information. \n\n> in 4 days\n\nHahahahaha. No. \n\nFor your sanity. For your own mental health. For you education. For your career. Just. Say. No.",
            "Don\u2019t go. I experienced the same thing two years ago. I was asked to be MOH to my friend for her destination wedding. Problem was I was still in grad school full time, broke, and working overnights at the hospital. Her wedding fell right smack in the middle of my clinical rotations. After months of begging professors and my dean and getting coverage from other students, I was able to rearrange my schedule to make sure I could go to the wedding (it cost almost $4,000 to go, by the way).\n\nThen for the bridal shower and bachelorette party, she and her friends chose to do something that was local for them (in Georgia), but I lived in NY. After how hard it was for me to rearrange my schedule just to go to the wedding, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be able to rearrange again and told her I couldn\u2019t go to neither the bridal shower nor the bachelorette party. She and the other girls were far from understanding. They said \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just call out sick?\u201d and \u201cjust have another resident cover you.\u201d\n\n**Mind you, just like your situation, there were no solid, definitive plans, lots of things were up in the air, and half the activities the bride wanted got cancelled.** I found out which restaurant they were going to dine at literally 20min before their reservation. I still contributed by calling the restaurant ahead of time and having a bottle of champagne and a dessert platter sent to the table. Instead of being thankful, they complained that there weren\u2019t gluten-free or dairy-free options for everyone. Uhmm, what?? I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not my problem, I\u2019m not even in attendance, and I did it for the bride, not those other ungrateful b$&@!s\n\nIn the end, I got so much shit from the bride and groom AND their families for not going to the bridal shower or the bachelorette party, to the point where I was so turned off and didn\u2019t give her a gift. Haven\u2019t spoken to the bride since. It was the most expensive lesson I ever learned. Don\u2019t make the same mistake.",
            "Whole lotta people badmouthing the bride when it seems like the maid of honor is the one letting everyone down. The poor bride will be heartbroken when nobody shows up or when everyone shows up super pissed at the bad planning.",

First.\n\n\nThis is your career here and your future that can be affected by this. Hands down I would put that first over this. Especially with the flakiness. Fuck. That.",
            "Don't ask for your friend's permission to not attend the bachelorette party - TELL HER you are not coming (with the apology, reason if necessary etc). This could not only cost you your group project etc but also probably a lot of money too !",

            "> Do I talk to her about it? What do I even say?\n\nJust say no.  Tell her the truth or make up an excuse, that's up to you.  But it's complete BS to do all of this, have no idea of plans, timing or cost, and plan on doing 16 to 20 hours of driving over the party.",

I don't know where you are or what the tradition is in your area/culture/friend circle, but that seems like an awfully long way from the wedding.  And it makes me wonder what other festivities could potentially pop up in the next two months which could possibly require your attention./attendance.\n\nSecond, any type of true friend would absolutely want you to put your education ahead of frivolous parties.  She honestly feels that her bachelorette is more important than your education and future?  \n\nThird, in addition to ditching your studies, she expects you to drive 8 hours each direction to a non-event, picking up 8 other people along the way.  \n\nIf you tell her that you are sorry but due to the importance of your own future, and the lack of any plan or communication, you will have to miss this weekend.  Her answer will tell you all you need to know concerning the status of your friendship.",
            "Save yourself all the stress and don't go. My gut tells me they are deliberately being awkward and withholding important information. Some people are so easily offended and are not understanding of other people's life plans! Life gets in the way- it happens. I think cut yourself the stress and stay at home. It seems like they are only interested in you attending now providing you can serve as a cheap taxi driver! Respect yourself :-) finals are way more important than a party.

            "Don\u2019t go. You\u2019re not gonna be doing much together after her wedding anyway.  People tend to drift apart during this time and it\u2019s completely normal. So why are you moving all your life around for this? Because she cane to yours is not a good excuse.",

If you go ahead, you will suffer and probably be absolutely miserable also.\n\nIf you bail now, she will be mad and probably not talk to you for a long while.\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't go and just think of myself for once and accept whatever consequences with regards to the friendship.",
            "I ended up in a similar situation where I went above and beyond out of my way to attend a bachelorette party during one of the hardest times in my life. MOH was super flaky making the plans, would leave important details out, and when I tried to hold her accountable for her actions- she played victim and acted like I was the one in the wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s a situation where you can\u2019t win. If I could go back in time, I would not have gone.  I get your friend went to your events, but I doubt she went this out of her way for yours. It\u2019s not fair to compare the two situations.\n\nIf I was in your position, I\u2019d just makeup an excuse to not go. Say you\u2019re having car problems, say there\u2019s a family emergency, whatever you want to get out of the situation.

            "> Against the wishes of my husband and therapist, who I'm working with to say no during this busy time in my life,\n\nSo what is stopping you from saying no now? You already got chewed out for this, might as well do what makes you happier/less stressed at this point. \n\n\n> now I'm at the point where I'm feeling such bitterness toward my friend and basically want her to know how much I'm sacrificing to be there for her and this terribly planned weekend.\n\nHere's the thing: This would be wasted effort. She doesn't care. She made that clear when she bullied you into attending. You're wasting your breath explaining it to her and you're only going to be left unsatisfied if you go to her expecting her to hear you out. She doesn't care what you're sacrificing. It's all about her. I honestly think you'll feel worse if you talk to her about it.\n\nIt sounds like she just wants attention, and a lot of it. If this event were truly important to her, some effort would have gone into planning it. She's being ridiculous and she doesn't value your time. \n\nSo why are you putting her needs before your own, still, when she's shown you zero care? You should listen to your therapist. You're NOT working with the therapist to say no because you still aren't doing it. You're saying yes and rearranging your schedule for this woman. What's the point of going to therapy if you're going to ignore his/her feedback?\n\nI got married when I was around your age. Old enough to know that it was about my marriage and celebrating with those who love me. I was grateful for everyone who was able to be there. My friends threw me 2 bachelorette parties (their idea, but I was fine with it). Even so, some people couldn't make the trek twice so they only attended the wedding. I was just thrilled that they were there for our special day. Some people couldn't make it and you know what I didn't do? Throw a tantrum and guilt trip them because I don't know their situations. The day was about me and my husband, and while it's nice that so many came, it would have been supremely bratty of me to guilt trip anyone for not attending. Your friend is being terrible and her priorities are way the fuck out of whack.\n\nYou need to learn to tell her no. There's no better time than the present to start practicing. Also, if you go, you're just going to get shit from her for not being fun enough because you will clearly be resentful. Don't waste the effort.",

These people *are in charge of your academic reputation.*\n\nNone of these people are impressed, OP, and you've only must started.\n\nYou really need to double down on learning to say, \"no,\" OP, or grad school is going to be even harder than it normally is (and it is normally super hard, like Tour de France levels of exhaustion.)",

            "My bachelorette party is this weekend. One of my bridesmaids can\u2019t make it due to work and the cost to fly the distance. I told her I understand and that it\u2019s ok, I miss her but can\u2019t wait to finally see her again at the wedding. \n\nAnother of my friends is in the middle of house renovations with a three month old baby and a farm to run. She can\u2019t make it either.

Telling her \"no\" in the first place (because you had a legitimate excuse- finals) would have been better, but now a white lie is the polite way to back out.  After the weekend is over, offer to visit her to make up for it.   This way if she's still a friend you can make up with her after this crazy time is over.   If she's unreasonable and snotty about you not showing up, you can drop her as a friend.",

I still paid for my share of the air b&b, but i was on the rocks with the bride and her close friends and was about to start my medical residency.

Because I skipped the party, I was able to be present at his last meal, be there within an hour when my mother found him, and help my parents, aunts, and uncles plan the funeral.

            "Your friend is in the wrong for a few reasons. Not the least of which is using her participation in your wedding festivities a year ago as leverage for getting you to do something you're uncomfortable with. Even without the additional layers of drama that are going on here (the unresponsiveness of the maid of honor, the uncertainty of the plans, etc.), the fact is that these non-mandatory events are happening on a weekend that happens to coincide with a tremendously busy/hectic time in your life. Your friend going to your bachelorette party last year doesn't give her leverage to force you to do something. \n\nFrankly, I've never quite understood why brides/grooms get so hung up on attending the bachelor(ette) party. It's a party to celebrate an upcoming wedding; if someone can't make it or doesn't want to be part of it, why would you want them there in the first place? People need to relax about what they think they are entitled to when it comes to things like this. But that's a rant for a different day. \n\nOP - your friend is acting poorly. If you had more time, I would suggest backing out. I think backing out now would not be a great choice, but attending is also not a great choice. Waiting until 4 days before the party to ask this question was cutting it far too close, in my opinion. At this point, all you can do is weigh the impact of not going against the stress and burden of going while juggling everything else. It's quite an unfortunate situation, but one which it's important to recognize your own role in helping to create.",

WHATTT??? I'm intentionally planning my wedding during the summer (yuck, humidity!) to avoid any conflicts between the wedding and college since 1/2 our guests are still in school. I applaud your dedication to your friend, but I really don't think this is beneficial to you. This isn't even her wedding, this is a bachelorette party--a poorly planned and organized one at that. If the MOH cannot supply you with information about what's going on in a timely fashion, you should not have to rearrange your entire life or serve as a shuttle service. You have given up so much to attend; they are treating you with utter disregard. \n\nYou can reach out to the bride and say something like, \"I appreciate the invitation to the bachelorette party. Unfortunately, since there are no clear plans and MOH did not supply me with the details in advance, I cannot get the time off from work/school to attend. When my finals are over, I would love to see you and spend some time together one-on-one. I'm sorry to miss your party. I hope you have a lovely time.\" If the bride is shitty to you over this, she is not a true friend. If one of my close friends couldn't attend a wedding-related event, I would be disappointed; however, I would understand, especially if they have a busy life and obligations like you have, OP! That's what happens when you try to coordinate multiple events with adults: not everyone can attend because of life obligations.",

            "I agree with what everyone else has said, however I think you might create more drama for yourself by just sending them an email saying you aren't going and why. I would definitely call - it's much more proactive and in my opinion makes it seem like you're making more of an effort. Then set the expectation that if you don't know what the plan is (where you're staying, and approximate cost) by XX date, then you don't have enough time to prepare and won't be going. It's direct and simple. \n\nI also do think you should talk to the bride about how you're feeling.

Making to a party or not will effect her marriage one way or another, but how you perform on your project and exams will effect your future. As a long time friend, she should be able to understand this and she's asking too much from you. It's her wedding, it shouldn't be your burden. The wedding day is the important day to support your friend, not all of these ridiculous \"all about me\" parties made up along the way. Life is short, you have already wasted valuable time stressing over an event that has nothing to do with you, but rather your friends own ego. Just explain to her that although you would like to be able to be there to celebrate with her, unfortunately it just isn't feasible and you look forward to seeing her walk down the aisle on one of the most important days of her life. Send her a bottle of champagne or a giftcard for a message and turn the page. Don't give it another guilty thought. If she's willing to hold something so insignificant as a party against your friendship, then perhaps she has a different definition of friendship than the rest of us. Good luck on your exams and your group project. I'm sure you'll do great with a clear head.",

Are you supposed to put your life on hold until someone deigns to send you the information 24 hrs before you have to leave? Some people need a couple days to pack to make sure they have everything they need, make arrangements for someone to watch pets, etc. This is really negligent on their part. If her reasoning is that you should sacrifice your life because she came to your events, that isn't a good enough reason. She might not have been busy or had much going on when you got married, so she's comparing apples to antelopes. \n\nI would be very honest with this person, and if they are not understanding, then she will show you how much your friendship means to her. I'd take the money you would have spent on this inevitable disaster, and engage in some post-finals de-stressing.

            "Dear MoH,  \nDue to your lack of communication I will not be able to attend.  \nBye.  \n  \nMake sure to cc the bride",
            "Have you called the bride or the MoH, not emailed?",
            "If you wish to bail and avoid as much drama as possible, I would just email the bride and let her know you're no longer able to attend, and rather than going into detail about planning to come and then having to cancel due to lack of organization by MOH, I would just tell her something like, \"I told you I could make this date work despite school/job, but now that the date is approaching, it's become apparent that it will be absolutely impossible for me to meet my deadlines with school/work *and* attend this party.\"  Then you can add whatever \"I'm so sorry about this\" and \"you mean the world to me\" bit you feel necessary.  It's just important to commit to the decision without wavering if she comes back and tries to grill you on whether you meant \"can't\" or \"won't\" (and you will need to stick with \"can't\").  You'll nee to make clear that your reasons for not going are on your end, not hers, that way it doesn't leave the door open for \"let's rush and throw something together\", thus turning it into a bigger cluster than it already is.  I'd personally probably also offer to pay for any of the sunk costs that came as a result of me committing and backing out (easier to do when you have good reason to believe no plans have been made anyway), but I just like to make sure money is never something that gets between me and friends.",
            "I'd come down with the flu.  Bad case.  Can't drive.",
            "Seems like your friends is pretty selfish",
            "People in Hollywood make movies about clusterfucks like this. I'm anxious to hear whose advice you followed, and how things turned out.",
            "Seriously, dont mess up your group project for this girl who clearly doesnt care enough about you! \nOne of my oldest friends now lives on the other side of the country and couldn't make it to my wedding because shes a school teacher and couldn't get down on time, so we facetimed on the big day. I loved and respected her enough that I wouldnt put pressure on her to put her future in jeopardy just to attend my wedding. \nIf she was a good friend she'd let you finish your work and see you at the wedding. \nP.s. that mother seems like a lot of work. Who doesnt have a schedule for a big event party, which people are travelling hundreds of miles to attend?!",
            "Can you update and let us know what happened?",
            "Your exams should always come first and she should understand that. Also you are a student so she should understand that you might not have the money to go. She sounds like she is being a bit unfair to you, I think you should explain that to her because if this gets in the way of your studying and you getting the grade that you need then you should definitely not go. Maybe you could suggest you and her having your own get together after you finish you finals? Honestly I wouldn't feel bad if I were you, if she was a true friend she would understand.",
            "I wouldn't necessarily hold the poor organizational skills of the MOH against the bride, though I can't stand it when people get passive-aggressive when others have busy schedules. I can tell you from experience that these parties are less a big deal than you think, and that the wedding is far more important to attend. Just politely and kindly tell the bride that the lack of clarity on these issues has sadly meant you cannot attend but that you're very much looking forward  to the wedding.",
            "Question: how far out did your friend have to travel to go to all your festivities?  If she is expecting you to attend/participate the same level as she did, then I cut her a lot more slack.",
            "Since you've already worked out school and job issues in order to be able to go, I would still go. \nYou have every right to be pissed, but everyone knows all common sense flies out the window when a wedding is in the works. Is it worth it to possibly lose what appears up til now to be a great friendship? \nMy biggest concern, though, is what if MOH has dropped the ball and there really isn't this big celebration that the bride is counting on? You will be the good friend that put a lot of effort in to attending the party that wasn't, and will be the good friend that makes sure the bride laughs it up through her tears if things do go awry.  \nWhichever the case, just be the good friend you are and be there for her. If her selfish behavior continues you've shown yourself to be a good friend and you can peace out with a clear heart if you desire. If this is just wedding nerves related, you still show you are a ride or die friend and she will always appreciate you for it. \nGood luck and have fun."

        "selftext": "Hi guys - it's been about a month since I posted and even though my issue wasn't too popular, I've gotten some requests for updates.\n\n[Here's the link to the original.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4k5icd/me_30_f_with_my_boyfriend_25_m_of_15_years_i/)\n\nSo, I brought up a lot of the points that you guys brought up in the last thread, including: \"How would you feel if I stopped working?\" and I actually threw out an ultimatum of \"If you had to choose between getting a job and being with me, which would it be?\"\n\nI wish I could tell you I took the calm, rational, mature route and just walked out to a new life.  I decided to have a tiny bit of fun instead.\n\nI've got a decent amount of money saved up since his dad didn't charge me rent and that was the entire purpose of me staying here (please note: I prefer to carry my own weight and still contributed as far as preparing meals, buying food and buying drinks!).  I put my notice in at my previous job without informing my boyfriend. Once the notice period was up, I started staying home. Every. Day.\n\nWake up in the morning and he says \"...don't you have work today?\" and I'd be like \"Eh, I don't feel like it\".  The first few days he was like \"Awesome!\" and we sat around playing games. After the first week he starts getting a little anxious and he's like \"So...what's up with work?\" and I tell him \"Oh, y'know, just not feeling like it\".  After the second week he says \"What's going on?!\" and I tell him that I thought a lot about what he's said, and I really agree with him. I don't feel like working and contributing to \"the machine\" either, so I'll just stay here with him.  \n\nHe FLIPPED OUT. He started telling me how irresponsible that is, how I have to work, basically the entire diatribe that I should have been screaming at this kid the entire time we were together. Except at me. Because I didn't go to work for 2 weeks.\n\nI kinda figured that would happen and I wanted something drastic to point out to him that, as I said before, he is a hypocrite. Because, he is! I have to admit a small part of me was kind of hoping this would be a revelation to him, and help him change. No, he just couldn't fathom how I could possibly do something so ridiculous and blah blah blah.\n\nAnyway. What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program. I also found a roommate in the area who's cool with my animals, and that way I can split my bills up and not be strapped for cash. Plus I sometimes drive for Uber and this is an okay market with a decent bar scene on weekends, so if I need a little extra, there's that. So I've moved out and moved on, and y'know, I'm not even that sad because I got closure out of that whole event.\n\nI'm also pursuing the cliche of hitting the gym more/at all, and hoping to lose a little weight.  Though, I did just lose 180 useless pounds, so maybe that's enough for now. :p\n\nAnyway, I know I didn't go about it in the right way, but I thought if any of you were curious to know, here's how it went. Thanks Reddit!\n\n\n**tl;dr**: The kid ain't alright and I GTFO'd. I am free to prey on the geeky men of Cleveland again.\n\nEdit: Sweet Jesus, this exploded, and you are all very kind and amazing! Lots of people PMing and commenting about his actual \"reaction\", but to be honest...I feel like I'd have to be a trained therapist to even figure it out. After he flipped out at me and I pointed out that it was really was just a \"what's good for the goose...\" scenario, he got kind of quiet and said I was being mean. I told him that it had become pretty obvious that tying to talk to him about everything wasn't doing me much good, so I had decided to actively show him.  He told me that it doesn't change anything about the way he feels about not working. I told him that he's got to find some way to contribute, or I walk.  He told me it would be my decision.  So, it was.\n\nBasically...to this day he still believes he's \"right\", or at the very least he hasn't done anything wrong. There's some sort of disconnect in his brain where he can't connect the part of him that loves me and wants to take care of me, with the part of him that doesn't want to work and wants to live off his parents forever. It's pretty sad, really. \n",

            "Best update ever!  I was worried when I read you quit your job, but you had the college plan all along.  I'm so freaking impressed.  I think you're amazing!",
            "I did something similar with my ex. Every issue I had tried to discuss with him, it would boil down to that he's doing nothing wrong and I'm the one who needs to change if I don't like it. One of my issues was that his stupid dog was untrained and he did nothing for it. It constantly ate my clothes. Upwards of $800 worth. This dog would go to great lengths to eat my clothes and he didn't care. So I started wearing his clothes and she started eating holes into all of his underwear, pants and shirts and then suddenly he cared. \n\nI also had days where I would do \"opposite days\" and I would act like him. Doing nothing all day, saying I'll do something but never doing it. Pushing him away when he came around. He got so upset with my behavior and asked why I was acting so weird. And I told him that I was only doing what he does to me. ",

            "Duuuuuude I took welding in highschool and I'm a girl as well! I love it! I was reading this for the first time out loud to my boyfriend and when I saw the welding program part I freaked out and screamed \"OMG THAT'S CRAZY AWESOME!!\"  And he started laughing. Way to go. I am so glad you got rid of your ex and decided to try welding. It is a really great career path, and if you don't do it full time it's still nice to know you can do it while most people don't have a clue how. There is a group on facebook called \"women welders\" you should join. They post a lot of neat stuff. You can put pictures of your work and others will try to help you out based on what the welds look like and tell you how to fix it. ",

            "I usually tell people here that closure is overrated but damn, girl. You found it. ",
            "I missed your first post, but the whole thing reminds me a bit of my first husband. When we got together I was 19 and he was 22 and he had recently quit working and was living with and supported by his parents, but it was because his dad had said, \"look, we really want you to go to college. Just go to college and we'll pay for everything so you don't have to worry about supporting yourself through it.\" And he was passionate about his planned major and dream job after, so I wasn't concerned. Then we moved in together and he had had some trouble passing one particular class that he needed (a math one that just wasn't clicking for him that he'd taken a few times without being able to really get it) so he stopped going to school. But he didn't get a job either. And he didn't do housework. So I was working full time, going to school, and coming home and cleaning up after him and caring for the pets and doing meal prep. Then I gave him an ultimatum about getting a job and he finally did. He'd been working for all of three months in our three year relationship at the point when we were having some major relationship issues (shocker, right?) and on top of that, he was nervous about one of my coworkers being a little too close to me and he demanded that I quit my job to be away from that person. So I talked to my boss about it and while policy didn't allow a leave of absence at my level, he said I'd officially have to quit, but that he'd consider it a leave of absence and hold my spot for the few months I asked for. I was home and not working (but doing all the housework and all that better than ever since I had all day to do it) for all of a week before he started yelling at me about how I really needed to get a job. This was the man who'd spent the last two years living in my apartment, leaving empty soda cans and dirty dishes around the place for me to clean, wracking up credit card debt on *my* credit cards because he just didn't get it when I explained that since he'd already maxed them out, that $5 lunch he was getting was actually costing $54 when the over limit fee was added in and he still got fast food every day. \n \nGood job getting out before it got that bad! I'm glad you had a little fun with it :)",
            "Lady justice boner on a Saturday morning are awesome. OP you're great! Best of luck on your new career ;)",
            "In the most non-stalkery way, I've been checking your account for an update once a week or so since you last posted and this is the best outcome I could've hope for. I am so glad that you are out of that situation because honestly, I got a touch worried.\n\nGood luck with your welding course!",
            "OMG I don't know how you put up with him for as long as you did. You're a saint and I'm glad you didn't go down with the boat.\n\nStory time. When I was in my 20s I was engaged to a guy who had no real career prospects so I encouraged him to go to graduate school to expand his insane music composition talent.\n\nThe first year went great, we lived on my income and some student loans, and when summer rolled around he refused to get even a part time job. He threw a fit that summers were for sitting around, and I really couldn't fucking believe it. I've never sat around for a summer in my entire adult life.\n\nI promptly told him that if he wasn't going to work then I wasn't going to work either, and he came around a lot quicker than your dude.\n\nThat relationship ultimately didn't work because I couldn't handle pushing him into life decisions like work and school. Some people need to grow the fuck up.",
            "You are kind of my hero right now, OP.  I have seen a fair few situations where men refused to work and let their girlfriends work.  My birth dad, God rest his soul, wasn't really great with working while my mom was pregnant with me and after she had birth.  (They pretty much split pretty close to when I was born.  Funny thing was that he was at a strip club the day of or so the story goes.)\n\nThere have been other acquaintances that the guy wasn't working, and the girl wouldn't be happy.  The guys in those situations actually made an attempt to change.  Maybe not going all the way, but at least helping around the house, and keeping clean over all.\n\nEDIT:  What do you qualify as geeky out of curiosity?",
            "I like you. Your story made my day, though it is too bad about your relationship. Sorry he was such a useless lump.",
            ">What I actually did after leaving my job was find a part time job and go down to the local community college to pull the trigger on something I've wanted to do for a couple years now: enroll in a welding program.\n\nGood for you! There's a serious shortage of trained welders and it's getting worse all the time, so if you enjoy it, that will be a career that pays well and advances easily. Companies are also fond of promoting welders to quality control, where they start paying you to go to school instead of the other way around. ;)\n\nThere are a few welding related subs, and the ones like /r/welding are usually a helpful bunch if you have any questions or just want to show progress pictures to brag.",

He obviously gets that \"no money = no decent living\" and \"work = money\" but he can't seem to get ... well, a lot of things. I think it's not his brain that disconnected or something.. It must be that he thinks he can leech of people forever. His dad must've spoiled him rotten. Unfortunately if his dad keep this up, it will be a long time before his actual reckoning.",

            "Good on you OP. My comment has nothing to do with your relationship, you seem to have that sorted. I just wanted to pass on some welding wisdom I was given as a female who learned to weld in college. You will get burned so have something handy to treat it. \n\nWear loose clothing and consider not wearing a bra - you do not want the stray sparks to be trapped next to your skin by your  clothing. (I suspected the guy who taught me welding said this because he's a dirty old man, but it really was good advice, even though it came from a self admitted dirty old man.) If you have long hair keep it tied up. \n\nAlso, please learn from my mistake and do not blow on the slag to clear it from your weld. You do not want a tiny piece of metal embedded in your eye, it's really painful to get out and dangerous to your eyesight. Don't be the idiot I was. ",

He fucked off for five months, played games and did volunteer work, and as the sixth month approached I told him that he needed to get another job. I knew that money was fine but I could not mentally handle him being unemployed. We did not live together. We did not share incomes. I simply refused to be in a relationship that did not have finical responsibility from both sides.\n\nHe sighed at me and got a job a week later. The next time he was laid off (a regular event in his industry) we discussed how long his 'free' time would be. I felt that a month of vacation was reasonable. We were living together at that time. I said nothing for a month. He did whatever he wanted to do. We did tighten our purses just to be preemptively responsible. At four weeks he went job hunting and he was employed two weeks later for more money then what he left.\n\nYour request was not abnormal or unreasonable.

I don't know the exact amount but I would guess just based on their buying and selling of property its somewhere in the 8-15 million range. My husband seemingly has always resented that he came from a rich background, he is a VERY do-it-yourself kind of guy and dislikes handouts. Even before the pandemic, his parents always offered to help us out with stuff and he always refused. We would argue about it but it was never that big of a deal because we were both financially stable. To him, this is a super sensitive topic, one which he wont even entertain. He always tells me to just act as if his parents have nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, my son developed some medical issues. I'm not gonna go over them, its not deadly, but he does need expensive treatment and eventually likely surgery. I took off from work to watch him, which put a major dent in our finances. Fast forward to 4 months ago, and my husband lost his job. The past 4 months have seen us arguing non stop about finances. His parents have PLEADED with him non-stop to help us out, and he refuses. He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% deadset on fixing this situation himself. He is COMPLETELY confident that he will fix all of these issues on his own, that he will find a job or start a business that will save us. Meanwhile, medical bills have piled on, our mortgage payments are late, and we have effectively burnt through our savings. We quite simply cannot keep going like this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mostly manage our finances. I think that, oddly enough, him growing up in a rich home and also getting a good job right out of college means that he doesn't entirely comprehend the kind of situation we are barreling towards, so even while he likes to sort of reject the benefits of having rich parents, in a way it also means he is blind to what it means to not be rich. Even while we are headed into debt, we haven't changed our lifestyles that much (we were frugal before this). The only difference has been debt piling up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not looking for financial advice. I am looking for a way to get my husband to accept his parents money. We have been looking everywhere for a job for him, and as of right now with unemployment through the roof and his industry especially having been destroyed, we have no prospects in the near future. There isn't much of a solution except his parents helping us out. How in gods name do I get him to accept the money? For me? For his KID who has medical issues which cost a fortune? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - - How do I get my husband to accept the money his parents are offering us? We are in debt and both unemployed and our kid has health issues, and he is refusing to take their offer.",

            "If he doesn't want to accept a gift, he could accept a loan; it's better to be indebted to relatives than to some bank, so maybe you could convince him to accept the money as a loan, write up paperwork between him and his parents to indicate this is a loan, and he'll pay it back when he gets a job etc.",
            "Hard facts, if he was to get a job next week on X salary how long would it take to clear the debt? Especially if your child\u2019s medical condition will keep costing you. \n\nWould he agree to a loan from his parents?",
            "You mange the finances. Sit him down and show him the bills. Ask him what his solution is. Since you manage the finances, I feel you get the final say.\n\nSome solutions I can think off:\n\n1. The money is strictly for your kid. Maybe that way he can put down his pride\n2. Consider a loan instead of a gift.\n3. Get a job from his parents. I assume his parents have some work that need his help.\n\nHe doesn't sound like a bad person, just too prideful and refusing to accept reality.",
            "Has your husband ever said (beyond pride) another reason he doesn\u2019t want to accept money? Are his parents overbearing or controlling or stepping on boundaries constantly? If so, your husband might be more persuaded if you talk through ways to address those concerns",
            "I would sit down w/your husband, have all the bills piled up, show him what you have left after you pay the bills this month, all the unpaid medical bills, what it's going to cost to pay all the medical bills, and tell him if he doesn't have a job in 30 days you are going to take a loan from his parents that can be paid back. That YOU are tired of being stressed, you are tired of arguing, it's more unnecessary stress because of his huge ego. You have enough to worry about w/both of you being unemployed, and your kid being sick. I personally wouldn't lie about it tho, or go behind his back. That's only going to cause more issues and he will feel betrayed. If it's possible have him go work for his parents on their rental houses or houses they are flipping, he obviously has the time being layed off. He needs to have an open mind so that you can have less stress! I pray that you find some peace, and that your child gets better.",
            "Pride doesn't pay the bills.\n\nShow him the past due bills. Do the math for him.\n\nHe's selfish for placing his pride before the health and welfare of his family.",
            "My parents were wealthy, and I can tell you that he absolutely has no idea what it's like to run out of money, I mean *actually* run out of money. \n\nIn a well-off kids mind, there is always more money somewhere because...well...there usually *is*. It's easier to have savings or investments when you're wealthy. A lot of well-off parents start investment account for their kids so they start ahead of the curve. I'm not saying its a bad thing to prepare, but I'd argue this leads to the kind of mindset that there's always a backup account, always a $100 bill in the sock drawer, always backup money somewhere. \n\nIf you're an arrested development fan...he thinks there is money in the banana stand that's catching on fire. \n\nAsk him this; does he want to accept the assistance now, or does we want to have to move in with them after y'all have lost the house?",
            "So I am in a similar situation to your husband, in that I come from a well off family. And I have the same feelings as him on accepting money from family (although mine have only ever offered once when I was made redundant). \n\nThe (very first world) problem is that, when you come from a family with money, people are very quick to take every achievement away from you on the basis of \u201cyou only got it because of your parent\u2019s money\u201d. It makes it very hard to feel like you\u2019ve actually achieved anything yourself and therefore the reaction can be to pretty aggressively pull away and ensure that once you\u2019re an adult, you don\u2019t get that help anymore so you can feel better in yourself that your achievements are your own. If you want him to take money, it may be better framing it as a loan which has to be paid back as this may sit better with him.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that his issue is more in that he doesn\u2019t truly realise the position you\u2019re in. \n\nWhen I was made redundant, I didn\u2019t accept the help but this was because we had stripped back our budget, I put all money aside between getting notice of redundancy and actually losing my job and we worked out that we could last. We never went into debt for it. However, coming to the end, we were getting incredibly tight and it was getting to the point that I was thinking about asking my parents. Fortunately I got a job before it came to that.\n\nIt sounds like his head has been buried in the sand. Your lifestyle has stayed the same so there has been no impact on him which means he is able to ignore the issue. You need to sit down and do an actual budget. Show him the truth of your situation. How long can you keep going as you are? How long until the roof over your head is at risk? \n\nHe needs a shock now to bring him back to reality. Tell him that if he\u2019s not accepting the money then he has to give you a plan of how you are going to get out of this situation without it. And when he can\u2019t do that (if it\u2019s as bad as you say) then he will have to concede and then you can discuss if you take it as a gift or a loan and form a proper long term plan.",
            "My daughter had $18,000 in DENTAL work needed. Seriously- Unbelievable. But it's now done and I told her that if she ever played sports I would kill her. Anyway- My mother offered to help and I told her that if she could give me some money toward my daughter's dental bills instead of giving me birthday or Christmas presents it would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps your in-laws could forego future Xmas/Birthday gifts as a way to assist in an acceptable way.",

            "Tell him that you all are drowning and that you are not going to let the sink keep shipping to save his pride and ego and that if he doesn\u2019t accept his families help then you will accept in lue of him with or without his permission.

If he is so upset with his parents being rich or something, then take more of their money than you need and give it to charity maybe? Do anything except for this stubborn martyrdom to prove he's such a strong man who can provide without anyone's help. Seriously, what is going to happen when they pass away? He's going to get it anyway, right? And like, them having money has definitely given him a better quality of life than the average person. To do this whole thing and pretend like he hasn't is just absolutely ridiculous of you ask me. There is nothing wrong with asking for help, no matter who you are.",

            "Sit him down, show the bills, add it up. Maybe he could agree to a loan? If he is still refusing, I would accept the money from his parents anyway.

            "Lots of bad advice here in the comments, so I'll try to provide you with a different perspective.\nFirst problem, you don't have a budget. A real written budget that you review together each month. You act like your husband is incapable of undsranding your financial situation because you handle most of the finances. The core problem is that you two don't effectively communicate about your finances. If you did, you'd have a written monthly budget.\nSecond problem is that you are 100% focused on getting money from his parents, not working out the problems yourselves, which is probably the reason for your husbands stance. Go over the budget with him, and get his input. Maybe he's OK spending less on some other items to make it through. If the problems are just medical, and you've been in a poor financial situation for a while, there should be some income based financial assistance options available to you.  If your financial problems are long term, maybe it's time to scale things down a bit. Think car, house, etc. \nLastly, stop freaking out. Financial problems are something every couple deals with. Rich parents aren't the solution.",

You should look into other solutions that do not include the parents.  \n\nYour husband might be prepared to downsize as necessary.",
            "His parents might have a history of offering money but using it as a way to control or guilt him in the future. \n\nI think you're focusing on them too much as an easy solution. I would suggest:\n\nThat you go back to work (if you haven't already) while he stays home to take care of your son. \n\nMoving forward, handle finances together, even if it means that you have to take time out to sit down together and go over everything once a month. (You say he isn't good with money....but you've dealt with the fiances. When would he have learned?)\n\nHe should apply for unemployment benefits, since he was laid off. \n\nBoth look to take jobs outside of your industry or far below what you're usually making, to tide you over. \n\nThe longer you hyper focus on him getting the money, the less time either of you will be focusing on real solutions that you are in control of.",
            "As a person who has a great amount of deal accepting money from anyone, let me give you some perspective. \n\nMy father used to pay me my private school, my horse riding sport (which can get really expensive as I was doing it professionally) and bought me a set of nice clothes once a year. \n\nAnd for every penny he spent on me, he always told me how ungrateful I am for not completely succumbing to every single one of his expectations for me. I wasn't allowed to derive in any way from what he imagined me to be. Want to go to a good school? Well then you must only have the best marks. Want to to horse riding? I better see you in Olympics in a few years, girl. Have an opinion? Well you better not.\n\nMind me that I never begged him for anything. He decided to do these things himself, I never asked him to become a horse rider or to go to private school, horses were just something I was excited about since I was very small.\n\nBy the way, I only was \"rich\" in this sense, but never in any other - sometimes my clothes were worn out, and I almost never had pocket money to spend even on a lollipop.\n\nOne and only one thing I've ever asked for was a laptop back when my old one broke. And I patiently waited one year till I finally got one for Christmas. I only asked for it once and then just let it be. So I got it,  just an average, not that expensive laptop. I was happy but oh boy I got so much shit for it later,  manipulation like \"you have your laptop now you must think you're better than your siblings\", \"I can see that you're not happy, just malevolent\". Every positive emotion of mine was always turned into something negative by him and his wife.\n\nSo I learned to associate money with control. He who gives you money has leverage. And I can't allow that to happen to me.\n\nI've worked on my acceptance since and because I am a student, I sometimes get into a situation when I need money urgently.  I've learned to very rarely lend it from my friends for max 1 month, that's what I can tolerate. But I'm still widely uncomfortable when someone just gives me money for free or lends it without a specific deadline in mind.\n\nIt might be seen as pride by some from the outside but in reality it's a fear of falling for someone's manipulation plan. Because there are people that do that, nothing they ever do is truly for free.\n\nMaybe your husband has had a similar experience with his parents or with someone else and that's why he is trying to avoid taking the money at all cost. As always, it's probably the best to just talk about it. Maybe you can figure out a solution that fits you both.",
            "Since this appears to be such a core thing for him, do you have any other avenues available - if nothing else then to buy more time?

Don't just assume this is just his \"gotta do it for myself\" attitude. You need to investigate and find out why that is important to him. Have his parents held favors over him in the past?

Understanding WHY will help you change his mind.\n4. **Write a loan contract.** Because of your financial situation, it's unlikely that you could get a loan from a bank with good terms right now.

You could have a loan where you owe nothing until a specific date, but includes 5% interest for every month that it goes unpaid after that date. \n5. **Finally, plan how your family can \"pay it forward\" to someone else in the future.** Accepting help now (even if you pay it back) is not the end of it.

Ask him if he\u2019d be willing to accept a loan from his family over a gift.

I wouldn\u2019t usually recommend it, but you just might have to tell his parents that it no longer matters what your husband says, and have them pay some debts directly or accept the money yourself, while telling your husband you had no other choice because while he\u2019s been trying, nothing has changed. You can\u2019t sit idly by while your family loses everything while also possessing the knowledge that there\u2019s an immediate way out.

That isn\u2019t the case, though.

You say he doesn\u2019t have a real understanding of these things, and that is definitely part of the issue. Perhaps if he sees it all in black and white, all of the past due letters and final notices, he\u2019ll come around. If not, I have to fall back on what I said above. You cannot in good conscience let your son suffer in order to cater to your husband\u2019s pride. \n\nEdit: I wanted to add that I understand this situation, personally. My boyfriend of three years has a strained relationship with his very rich father.

It wasn\u2019t an insane amount; his dad offered to send enough to pay rent and utilities for one month, which was a huge deal. My boyfriend vehemently refused.

We argued, he broke down, and I effectively told him that it was either accept the money or be on the streets in a matter of days. I told him I wasn\u2019t willing to let that happen because I\u2019m chronically ill, and we both have sons (living with their other parents at the moment) that count on us to be stable. I told him I sympathized with his pride being hurt and it wasn\u2019t his fault we were in the position we were, and offered hours of comfort before finally telling him I was calling his dad to accept the offer. He gave in, but not without much upset. It was extremely difficult, but we\u2019ve moved past it. He doesn\u2019t even give it thought, now.",

            "Him not accepting the gift and living with the consequences is one thing. Him not accepting it and putting you and your son through the consequences is not fair. Sure, there are reasons to want to stand on your own and not accept help from your parents. But when it becomes problematic for your life (or those around you) that's when you go to therapy and sort your shit out.",

            "He is willingly refusing to help the health and welfare of your child, probably because he feels emasculated having to accept help from his parents. What he's doing is tantamount to child abuse. At the very least he should be willing to accept help for his son. Honestly, if he won't even budge on a suggestion of a loan I would go behind his back and talk to his parents if I were in your shoes. I'd get enough money to help your son (and their grandson) and tell the husband he needs to sort his shit out because allowing your child to be in poor health is irresponsible parenting.",
            "I\u2019m gonna take a different approach, what if it\u2019s not about pride? \n\nI think a lot of us, especially for those of us who come from poor backgrounds, we don\u2019t think about how being \u201crich\u201d can effect intrapersonal dynamics. Have you explored why he doesn\u2019t like taking money from his parents? Why do you automatically assume it\u2019s pride? Maybe he\u2019s a do-it-yourself type person and hates handouts because his parents lauded their money over his head their entire life and made him feel like shit whenever they gave him money? \n\nI have a friend who came from a very well off family who\u2019s parents told her that she *had* to go to college. That if she didn\u2019t, they would disown her. They then proceeds to pay for her entire college education and keep track of EVERY SINGLE PENNY they gave her, and they require that she pays them back. They have an excel spreadsheet they share that they literally document every single bit of money they have given her, and how much she has paid them back. She does not loan money, she does not borrow money. When we go out to eat she always pays for herself, no matter who is in the group, no matter if someone is offering to pay. She has a very sensitive relationship with money because her parents have traumatized her by turning money into a punishment. \n\nI\u2019m sure if it was that extreme you would know about it, but it\u2019s entirely possible it\u2019s less about \u201cpride\u201d and more about his way of addressing the trauma his parents instills in him relating to money growing up. \n\nI\u2019m purely guessing, but I think by calling it pride you\u2019re immediately making it seem like he\u2019s not taking the money purely because he doesn\u2019t want to, when it\u2019s entirely possible there are some underlying reasons that he hasn\u2019t shared with you.\n\nYour best bet is going to be to go into the conversation with this in mind. Find out why it\u2019s an issue, how it can be resolved, what he thinks is the best solution? Don\u2019t hold punches, make sure he understands the direness of the situation, but also make sure you take time to understand that this might be a lot more complex a situation than prides",

I would say that in this case, it isn't that the man is wanting to deprive his family, more like the whole situation is causing him emotional and mental pain for what he sees as his failure to provide. It's not just about pride but about the feelings of uselessness this man is probably feeling because his family is not in a situation that he could fix himself. It could also be combined with some passive-aggressive reaction happened in the past with his parents regarding financial help.  I suggest a friend, brother, some close person, maybe even the son etc  goes and talks to this guy. Help this man realize that accepting the help from others is not necessarily \"charity\" as through his acceptance, HE IS providing for his family. It's not the way he would ideally CHOOSE but it is the way he can ALLOW. Refusing the help would put the blame of not providing for his family square on his shoulders.

I have this problem. With my mom.  We grew up poor and she never wants money.  I tried explaining it is of no consequence to me to take it and it is creating absolutely no hardship for anyone.  In fact nit taking it is upsetting because she  would be struggling in a sense out of spite\n\n.  I end up just helping mom negotiate  purchases ext.

            "\"I mostly manage our finances.\"\n\nMaybe your husband would have a better appreciation of the situation if you put him in charge of the finances.  I agree with the loan option as a means of saving face if he refuses a gift.  Also, ask him to look at things from his parents' perspective.  I have a son from my first marriage your husband's age, and I'm pretty well off financially myself.  I'd be hurt and insulted if he insisted on forcing himself, his wife, and my grandchildren to suffer rather than accept my help.  He's going to get the money when I die anyway, and I'd rather have the enjoyment of knowing that I helped my family out while I'm still around rather than after I'm gone.

He most likely feels like taking money off them would mean that without them he can't live on his own or get by.\n\nDepeneds also on how he was treated as well. My parents, especially my dad used to flash his wallet at me all the time, give me money just to show everyone he earns alot to somehow think I was impressed by it.\n\nBut it did the opposite effect. Because he kept handing me money I grew to despise my parents because they made it seem like I was a child and that I couldn't live without their help financially.\n\nI stopped talking to my family and started living on my own and eventually got my own place with a nice view and a very private area. I've honestly never been happier.\n\nIn the end, I refused to take 1 cent from my family any longer as it felt like a insult every time they offered me money and I didn't want to give them the satisfaction of bragging to me that it was because of them that I got anywhere in life.\n\nHis probably in the same boat, he probably doesn't want to take their money because he will be looked down on or he will feel useless or not feel like he can succeed without his parents help.\n\nHe probably can but he needs your encouragement. If he despises his family's money like he has then he might be angry or very upset on the inside and needs help but doesn't want to come off sad or anything.\n\nMy advice is to be supportive of him, look at it through different perspectives, don't think because his family is rich that you think you should take it and force him to do it.\n\nHe wants to prove he doesn't need their money so as a wife/gf be his support. Tell him that you believe in him and help him manage and pick himself up, relationships go through very hard times together and how you get out of it can put a impression on someone.\n\nEncourage him and yourself to be more careful with money and start saving so he can prove to his parents he can do fine without them. If he gets the encouragement from his parenter, has your support and does well. He won't feel so bad for asking money from his parents anymore, his just not very confident at the moment and needs you to support him and be his rock.\n\nBelieve in him,help him and he will gain the confidence eventually to stand up proud. Men and women are treated differently when they are raised.\n\nMen are raised to have providing be thier number 1 priority and that is the foundation of being what they call a \"man\".\n\nBecause he isn't fulfilling that role he feels less of a man and it does damage us from the inside badly feeling that way. \n\nTry seeing it from his perspective if you can",

If he was single, he could make that choice but hes not. He has a child who depends on him and he is unable to provide for them. Even if they just paid the medical, it isnt really money for him but for his kid. He probably feels like he should be the one providing and is being stubborn but he needs to face reality and the fact is that he cant provide right now. \n\nHe should care more about his child than his issues with his parents. Have you said that? Because it doesnt speak highly of him. I'd tell him to take the money and he can return it ASAP when he gets employment, but you cant wait for that to happen. And if he doesnt want their money, maybe it will serve as additional motivation in the job hunt.\n\nAt this point if he still refuses, I'd tell him I was just going to get a loan from them then. It's not like you need him to accept money. He can either hurt his pride accepting money or hurt his pride forcing his wife to accept money that you need for your kid.

Your own words stated \" He would rather everybody suffer, and he is like, 110% dead set on fixing this situation himself\"  There is no other option but a ultimatum for you period. Your child in need is the priority over ANY pride. And that is what you need to tell him. His child comes first over his pride over getting help.  And I must be honest; you might have no choice to to make a HUGE stance on your relationship with him as a ultimatum. As I have seen other say, have it come as a loan for him to pay back. Then his parents can decide to cash the checks or destroy them instead as he pays back the loan instead. But the loan option would help him with the personal guilt he would feel over it. But the rest, is the problem where you may have to make a stand in where you pick your child and yourself over your husband and his pride. Make no mistake, as I see there is no other option for you as much as you do for yourself on making ends meet to fix the now situation. And having him look at it as a loan to he can feel better on taking the money will help, but will still leave his parents to decide to cash pay back checks or not. But doing a stance like this; where I also see no other way to make him do it; will have a effect on your marriage for time to come.
