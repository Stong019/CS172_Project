        "selftext": "\nTL;DR my dad died and I'm scared my family won't get along \n\n\nI'm sorry if I begin ramble typing this is like one of my first posts on any sub reddit and I am just overwhelmed. So yesterday after my dad comes home he eats what my mom made for him. Eggs and spam. \n\nTo be clear, he has a pre existing medical history of high blood pressure and gout. First found out when he was admitted to the hospital in 2015 when he fell ill and we basically had to force him to go to the hospital bc he didn't wanna go. He was put on medication since, with changes to them maybe a year or so ago.\n\nSo back to when after he ate. My half sister heard a thud around 740 ish and told me to check bc she thought maybe my parents are arguing. I go down and see my dad on the kitchen floor w my mom behind him a few feet away and I hear him snoring. I ask my mom a question get worried run back upstairs and knock on my sisters door. She calls my other sister and also tells me to stop wasting time call 911. I was scared and frantic I wish I called 911 or saw him when he came in so I could maybe have called sooner...\n\nThey get frantic too and we all start yelling at each other and I try to maintain order also as I'm talking to 911 person. At some point in all of this my brother in law yells for help and I help him turn my dad onto his side bc he said he could choke on his saliva. My dad stops snoring and we start panicking. The ems tells us how to perform cpr but my sisters keep yelling and so I try to get them working together. They finally start working on it one is doing compression and the other giving him air and sometimes rotating. Fire dept and ambulance gets here and they start doing the same thing but also have defibrillators and honestly I'm just in shock still. It was maybe 8:03pm when they came or so i dont remember it's all a blur I checked my phone for time stamp but I called twice so I forgot when original call was placed. \n\nThey called it at 8:50pm and I just begin to lose it. My aunt comes and my sister is trying to call my dads work to let his bosses know...\n\nWe talk about how we want my dads arrangements and agree on cremation bc we dont have the money for anything else but also my sister wants the remains. \n\nHonestly. I wrote this post bc I'm scared for the future. My mom is bipolar schizophrenic and my sisters and bro in law dont get along w her because of a whole history that would keep you here forever if I tried to type it. My dad was a big shit talker but he still chose us and tried his best to provide regardless of his fallacies. He had my mom's back too saying he wouldn't kick her out or place her in a mental home.\n\nMy sisters kinda want that (I think) but I'm scared to talk about it. My mom is ok sometimes but also acts up bc of her mental illness sometimes and my dad and I were her constants regardless of what happened. My mom is old and still wants to benefit from some social security services that my dad had but my sisters (and i) think we should get a majority control of his account bc theres a lot of renovations to be done bc he ignored upkeep of the house for a number of years (example, the roof) my mom is not very sad about the ordeal bc she had a long history of mental abuse from my dad and I understand but we for some reason stayed together. Idk how to move forward except for one moment at a time and I'm still waiting for funeral home to come pick up his body (its 8:13 am now, been waiting since night before) and I have been crying but also I can't sleep and I'm sorry if this doesn't meet guidelines I just need to vent even tho I told a few friends I'm still in disbelief. I'm sorry to write so much I just can't help it. Idk how this will work moving forward. I believe it can though. But it's hard to stay positive",

            "People react to grief and loss very differently. You are going to see a lot of emotions being worked through and buried problems being brought up, and you will absolutely see a lot of anger. \n\nThe \u2018snoring\u2019 was agonal breathing, it often happens after heart failure. **He was not taking a breath**, his lungs were only reacting to his brain firing all shots before giving up. He was likely dead before he was moved to his side, long before the CPR. \n\nDo not blame yourself. You couldn\u2019t have called 911 before it happened, and that would have been the only way to save him from cardiac arrest. You did not waste time. You did not cause it to happen. You reacted, and you gave good directions on CPR to your siblings. You did everything right. \n\nYour family will either splinter apart, or come together. Some members might use his death as a way to cut the final tie to your mother. You can still have a relationship with all of these people separately, you do not have to choose sides. Do not take on the responsibility of keeping everyone together. Take on the responsibility of healing yourself. You need to look into therapy because you were there when it happened and trust me, it effects you. Even if you feel numb now, you will need to talk this out. You cannot control how others react, you can\u2019t control who supports who, you need to make sure you are okay before you try to help anyone else.",
            "If your parents were married, your mom will get control of the Social Security money. That's not something to argue over, it's just a fact. \n\nIf your mom has untreated mental illness, you can try to get her help. If she refuses you might be able to get her put on a psychiatric hold, but I'm not sure there is any way to force her to comply with taking her meds in the long run.\n\nConcentrate on the things that you can control: your behavior and your reactions to other people. You will cry eventually. Grief takes its own time and is different for everyone. There is no right or wrong way to grieve as long as you are not hurting anyone in the process. \n\nGoing second by second is probably the best thing and you're doing it. I'm so sorry for what you're going through. It must be so traumatic. Be kind to yourself.",
            "Get some counseling. Even remote counseling if you are in quarantine. \n\nYour family sounds toxic and disfunctional.\n\nIf your mom is has untreated or unmanaged mental illness a home is probably the best place.  It seems like your family likes to ignore problems rather than address them.\n\nNobody will be able to place her there against her will unless you do a long drawn out process. These homes are not nightmares. Lots of them are nice and most people in them would die if left to their own devices.",
            "You don\u2019t *have* to keep it all together and stay positive. If you need a minute to break and cry, do it. Feel your feelings, what you described is traumatic.",
            "So sorry for your loss. First thing you need is grief counselling.",
            "I\u2019m sorry for your loss OP. There\u2019s so much going on with your family aside of your father\u2019s passing that it\u2019s going to be a hard one to get through. I seriously recommend you get some therapy to aid you in this trying time and to help you decide what do you want for your family. Schizophrenia can be quite difficult to manage, so professional help is 100% needed on that front but I also understand not wanting to send your mom to a mental health facility as some of them are sterile and abusive places. \n\nTake a breath and don\u2019t let your sisters steamroll you with their plans, decide what YOU think is best and put that on the table. That might align with them or not. Lastly, cry as much as you need. When going through grief the only thing that helped me was not holding back my tears. It\u2019s not the same if you repress your sadness until later.",
            "I'm a nurse in a cardiac cath lab (the area that opens up the blocked arteries that cause heart attacks). I wanted to respond to your statement saying that you wish you had done things in a different order. I think it's important for you to know that with the way you described the events, it's unlikely that doing things differently on your end would have made a difference. Sure, in an ideal world everyone that collapses like that would have an immediate call to 911, CPR, etc, but when this type of thing happens outside of the hospital, survival rates are very low even if all of that is done. He likely had a severe blockage in an artery or some other serious pathology, and without being already in a hospital at that moment ... Let's just say it's a bad situation. The snoring was probably not snoring, but agonal breathing, meaning he was already very close to death at that point. Please don't carry guilt over the way things unfolded.\n\nBefore I was a nurse, I worked as an EMT, and I know what it feels like to watch someone die outside the hospital and overanalyze everything you did, wondering if you could have saved them somehow. I'm so sorry you went through this with your father. I just hope you can move forward knowing that it was not your fault in any way.",
            "I'm very sorry about your loss.  As an older man in my 60's, I've been through this with parents and other close relatives and friends.  So I can appreciate the pain and state of mind you're in right now.\n\nYou're worry about too many things too fast.  You need to realize that your thoughts and grief are going to be overwhelming to start as you're in shock right now.  It may remain that way for a while getting better every day, but not overnight.  \n\nDon't worry about any decisions right now, other than your father's final arrangements.  Everything else can wait a bit until things calm down a little.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss op xx grief is a strange time, be kind to yourself and your family and yourself x it\u2019s painful but it gets better x lots of love and nest wishes from me in England \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Wow, I just had such a flashback to 3 years ago when my dad died. Different familial weirdness but my head being literally everywhere and the recent trauma (I watched my dad die too, I also told my brother it was time to let go since my brother had the life termination rights, I did it as a way to share/take responsibility with him but we still haven't actually talked to each other about it). \n\nSo the best advice I can give is small lists and timelines of when to deal with different shit if you cannot shut off your brain. Try not to work ahead because the quiet moments are just as important as feeling useful. \n\nWeek 1: sort out arrangements, is there an obit? Who can write it/handle it? Who needs to be told. Who do you want to tell or make sure you get to talk/grieve with? How can you celebrate your relationship with him in a way that gives just you or you and your family members the different types of closure they need? \n\nWeek 2: spend deliberate time together being kind to each other. Tell stories, watch movies, play games. Laugh and cry authentically. \n\nWeek 3: start to have the hard conversations. Some of it will have come up organically last week. Why does your mom think she needs dad's benefits, what kinds of homes or living situations are on the table. Can the benefits be split so mom would be more comfy but you have resources for the house. Are you ok being moms sole grounding piece? Understanding the \"why\" allows for creative problem solving and making sure peoples needs are being met not what they want. And if you haven't found separate counseling for your mother and yourself before now this is the week. Make SURE you have someone to talk to who is supportive and in your corner period, not family, a stranger to give you good advice and be kind to you. \n\nWeek 4: move forward trusting that even if you hate the decisions you made later, you did the best you could with what you had. Be kind to yourself and be honest about what you can reasonably do.",
            "First thing...BREATHE! You have been through a huge ordeal.  Second,  this is a lot of stuff to process before his body has even been picked up. So slow down.  All of what you are describing takes time.  It takes time to get financials after a death figured out, and it takes time for courts to go through things also.  \nDeath sucks.  This will be a process that you will learn from, but right now, you are in shock and need to slow it down.  Take a walk, do a meditation, things will start to feel ok eventually but it will be messy for awhile.  You're welcome to message me if you need to talk.",

Do some Internet research. Watch YouTube. Listen to some music. It\u2019s eventually going to be better. Give yourself some breathing room.",
            "i am so sorry about your father\n\nplease do not blame yourself for the CPR. CPR is a last ditch resort when someone is presumed to be close to death. it rarely works in the real world. you did your best for your father- please dont blame yourself or your family for how you performed CPR. you loved him, and he knew that. I hope this provides you with some comfort on such a truly awful occasion. again, im so sorry for your loss, but im glad you were with him for his last day- sharing conversation, time, a meal, and love.",
            "Everyone will act differently in moments of grief, but I recommend you to familiarise yourself with the five stages of grief.

            "I'm really sorry for what you're going through. My partner lost his dad last year (similar ages to you, 25 and 73). I'm not going to lie, the next twelve months are going to be so incredibly tough, but please make sure you take time for yourself to grieve and process what has happened away from difficult family members. Make sure you reach out to your friends and ask for their support too.",
            "My family used to be very family orientated when I was very young. Then things fell apart. Lots of lunacy went on. My only advice is be ok for you. Only for you. Figure out what you need and try to do what\u2019s in your interests. If you had asked me 30 years ago I would have had a different answer but here we are. Just be ok, be well.",
            "First of all, I am SO sorry for your loss! I cannot imagine how traumatic it must feel to witness a close family member pass away right before your eyes. Not to mention, have other family members screaming in your face and causing a ruckus. Just know that you did EVERYTHING you could to help the situation and there was nothing more you could have done! Your dad was seriously ill and his fate was sealed as soon as his heart stopped. \n\nAs others have said, his \"snoring\" sounds were not him snoring as in being asleep. It is known as agonal breathing or \"the death rattle\", which means the person is pretty much gone already. I just feel so bad that you have to be stuck in a house with all of this chaos right now! I would suggest seeking online counseling or maybe consider spending time with a close friend during quarantine? You should try to distance yourself from them right now so you can start the healing process. If you need to chat, I am here for you!",

No matter how good or bad of a person he was, he was a consistent person in your life and losing him, especially in a time of uncertainty like this has to be difficult. \n\nI don't know if you're religious, but here's something practical you can use from the mouth of Jesus. \"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\"\n\nEach of the days you have that follow are going to be difficult. If you can't fathom getting through the week, you shouldn't worry about it. You can't tell the future. Focus on the day ahead, and if that's too much, take it moment by moment. If you can't make it through the moment, close your eyes, breathe, and count to ten. At the end, you're still there, hanging on. \n\nYou will make it. Don't worry about the future. What happens, happens.

To be completely honest, it took several days to finally register he was actually gone and not coming back. As for your reaction I can say with 100% confidence you reacted appropriately and admirably. He had pre existing conditions, and at that age your body is fighting just to keep the lights on let alone everything else that comes with well... Life.\n\nAll I can say man is hold your family close and please try and understand that people truly do say things out of pure emotions, especially when it comes to loss. Try not to hold onto what is said and forgive as much as you possibly can. I know from first hand experience that by holding onto all that anger and sorrow you'll only be holding yourself back, not anyone else.\n\nSorry for the short post, I just feel like in times like these the simpler the better.

Its hard, its tough, but im sure youll get over it eventually. All the best to you OP",
            "We all go eventually. My Mum passed from cancer a couple of years ago. Then I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer... Did all the chemo and luckily squeaked through with only nerve damage. Now my dad's suddenly got cancer too, but they keep moving the surgery because hospitals are totally fecked right now. Sister is a hospital worker (surgeon) and I'm just waiting for her to get this bloody virus.\nOne thing keeping me sane is what my mum always said: live in the moment. I got the notes from Charlie Parker's \"now's the time\" tattooed on my arm where they used to hook in the chemo. When I get overwhelmed I look at it and just breath deeply and slowly and remind myself that all I need to do is be in this moment and do my best in this moment."

        "selftext": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/JYg2PTNn9L\n\nHello everyone, just wanted to give a quick update. Recently I had my lasik operation done on my eyes. So I wasn\u2019t available to answer all the PMs and comments. I wasn't allowed screentime for 48-72hrs. But thanks to all of you who opened my eyes. I was having some doubts. In my mind I was doing the right thing. But people were telling me I should reconsider. So it created a doubt whether I'm doing the right thing or not. But the comments from people has cleared it. So where are we? That's the discussion I had with my stbx. \n\nMy stbx came to see me during my operation. I never asked him but he still came. He took me home after my operation. Since I wasn\u2019t allowed to do put pressure or dust in eyes it made majority of the chores very difficult to do. But he did all my chores, starting from dusting, cooking and laundry. He was with me reminding me to take my eye drops. It felt good. For once I thought I got my husband back. But I thought about this a lot. He never did anything like this unless I ask him to. He never did my portion of the chores even when I was sick with a flu. He is only doing this to be on my good side. I don\u2019t want someone who only acts nice only to gain something. Plus the messages he shared with his AP stil haunts me. It's been imprinted in my brain. I don't thinl doing 2 days worth of chores will make me forget the humiliation me and my kids went through because of him.\n\nSo I sat him down, it easier to talk to him wearing glasses. I told him I'm still going through with the divorce. I am not going to take his kids away from him. He is still their dad. I can never live under the same roof. Even if I take his advice and go to counselling together I would still never be able to let go of the fact that he cheated. Our kids don't deserve parents who resent the other. It's better we part our ways and continue as a coparent. I did suggest counselling as a family so that we can be the best coparent. But as far as being married that's out of the question. He can resent me all he wants but he still has to be there for the kids. He agreed. Although I can see the sadness in his eyes. He said sorry for everything that he has done. He opened up about his affair. That he just thought it would be great. Because we got so stuck in our mundane lives that the affair was an escape. But he didn\u2019t realize what he was losing. He blocked his affair partner and ended his relationship with her. He acknowledges that not only he destroyed his marriage, but also ruined her career. He also stooped so low in his kid's eyes. He also said he will never date again. I told him to not make promises he knows he cannot keep. \n\nAnother problem we are facing now is our kids. My oldest son knows what's happening. Apparently the ruomors has reached his school. The teacher taught my middle child. So she also knows. My son is not talking to his dad. He even refused to eat the meal he cooked and has been living on peanut butter and jelly sandwich. My other kids followed his lead. He refuses to talk to my stbx and it hurts him. I even caught him crying 1-2 times. I can understand what my kids are going through. I don't want them to hate their dad. He is a crappy husband but a great dad. I don't know what to do with them. If you have suggestions please let me know. Also I cannot reply to all the comments because I'm only allowed 30 mins of screentime every 2 hours. But I will read the comments once I'm fully recovered. \n\nTldr: had lasik surgery. Had \"the talk\" with my stbx. We are still getting divorce. Kids still hate him.",

            "I'd get them to see a psychologist asap. The anger and resentment are normal, and it's up to him to do the work to get their forgiveness. But they need a safe space in the meantime where to process it all and cope with the changes that are coming; they have been exposed to grown up issues beyond their emotional understanding and a psychologist can help them through it.\n\nCongratulations for making the right choice for you and your kids in the long term, it's not easy but future you will be so grateful of your strength now.",
            "Let the kids have their feelings. They\u2019re old enough to understand that level of betrayal. He didn\u2019t just do it to you. He did it to the kids too. I just can\u2019t get over the teacher part and I\u2019m a stranger! I can only imagine how your kiddos feel. Definitely do family therapy and let the therapist help them work through their feelings, and find their way back to their dad if that\u2019s what they choose. Good on you for looking after yourself and kids. You\u2019re a strong woman and good mom!",
            "He made a decision that destroyed his family. That doesn't make him a great dad. Your kids are not stupid. They know he put sex with their teacher before their welfare. You should not pressure them to forgive him. That is their choice and they only thing they have control over. He humiliated them too. Imagine having to go to school every day and hear the whispers that their dad screwed the teacher.",
            "He might have been a good dad at one point but a great parent doesn't prioritize their libido over the well-being of their children. When you are a parent and choose to have an affair, not only are you saying you don't care about the harm to your spouse, you are also saying you don't care about how it will affect your children. Destroying the stability of your child's home over an affair is not something that a parent prioritizing their children would do, doing so with a teacher that taught your children is even worse. Your children will probably have some resentment, that's natural. I would second others here and suggest counseling to help the children work through their complicated feelings about this.",
            "Unfortunately he isn't the great father you hope he is. Part of cheating, part of choosing to destroy his life in the way he did, would very inevitably result in the kids being hurt. That's part of what cheating does, ripples outwards. Your kids are feeling the full impact of his direct choice to hurt them. That's the reality. \n\nAnd that will take time. Emotionally they have a lot to deal with and individual therapy/counselling may be worthwhile. Especially for your son who is clearly taking this very hard and is being forced to face the reality loving people doesn't stop them hurting you. \n\nYour ex husband chose to hurt everyone in his life for 'excitement' or whatever. These are the ramifications of his choices. They may choose to hate him in the end for that.",
            "He is not the great father figure you thought he is. He did not think how would his children be affected after using one of their teacher to live an exciting opportunity! A good parent always would put their children first in their every selfish desire.",
            "Good on you for sticking to it!\n\nDon\u2019t forget, a great dad would not cheat on their children\u2019s mother! He is reaping what he sowed.\n\nGet your kids into therapy if you think that will help. Let a professional help them work through the trauma.\n\nIf your kids hate him then so be it, *he* caused this.",
            "It's only been 4 days. Your kids will recover later on. Right now, they've heard and are embarrassed of the reality that their father cheated on their mother...and with one of their teachers too. \n\nIt's going to take time (again, the whole thing imploded the last month so it'll still take time to recover) for things to start being okay.\n\nAfter you feel better, start getting into therapy for the whole family. \n\nI have a good friend, she was a single mother of 3 at 37. If she's around your circle of friends, they'd probably think she can't get a good man. But nope, she's met her husband at 39 and married him at 40. \n\nThe point being, it's always possible to meet the right partner for you later on in life, even if you still have children. So the people trying to get you to stay are false.",
            "Good on you not buying his 2 days of chores. You don't have to stand by someone who hurt you in the worst way because they managed to scrape together some crumbs of kindness afterward.\n\nI'd be worried about the impact on your kids. The fact that he chose a teacher of all people. This could not *just* impact your kids relationship with their dad. I'd worry It could impact the kids in other ways. Like socially or educationally. His actions have permeated the kids world at home AND at school. It's bad enough that the kids have to deal with this at home in private, but if word gets around at school they have to deal with it in public too. Which sucks. What if this impacts how they feel about school or teachers? What if some mean kid teases them about it at school?  \n\nI'm so mad on yours and your kids' behalf ! What a mess he's made !\n\nI really feel sad about the advice you received from others too btw, about how all men cheat so you may as well stay, or that it will be so hard to find another man as a single mother at 37, or that it's your responsibility to suck up all the pain and mess he has caused for your kid's sake. Heck No to all of that. Youre not an old maid, it's 2024, and your worth as a person is infinitely more than that advice implies. It's true dating as a single mother is no picnic but that doesn't mean that staying with someone who's treated you like this is preferable. These people seem to think that being single is the worst thing that can happen to a woman. I guarantee that it's not. If you were to stay and internalize and absorb the impact of his actions and pretend like everything's fine - that would be worse.",
            "I'm sorry, but \"great dads\" don't cheat on their kids' mother with their kids' *teacher*. That is so fucked up. He may have been a great dad in the past, but he isn't anymore and he's likely destroyed his relationship with his kids.",
            ">I even caught him crying 1-2 times. I can understand what my kids are going through. I don't want them to hate their dad. He is a crappy husband but a great dad. I don't know what to do with them. If you have suggestions please let me know. \n\nDon't tell your kids how to feel about their dad, or to not hate him, or that he's a good dad. They are entitled to be upset, to be mad, to cry, to want distance from them. They have had less time to adjust to the news, and they are not only sad, but also scared about how their life is going to change. \n\nYou need to be the parent here and give space for their feelings, and reassure them that you're there for them. \n\nTell them whatever they are feeling is ok. Don't try to keep them from \"punishing\" their dad, this is one of the few ways they have agency in the situation. \n\nAsk them how they are feeling, ask them what they are worried about. Let them talk. Don't argue with what they say or how they feel. Reassure them that while changes are going to happen, you will let them know what's going on.",

He cheated on their mother and humiliated all of them. The other children and parents will keep talking about it for a long time.\n\nBut they need therapy. Not only because of their father, but also because of the humiliating they will face because of him.\n\nHim saying he didn\u2019t know what he was losing is a lie. He wanted an escape. He got that. But he knew that cheating would destroy you and his marriage. He knew what he was doing.",
            "How is he a great father? By fkn one of his kid\u2019s teacher and destroying his family? Y\u2019all be really needing to know and understand definitions",
            "He isn't a great father. He not only cheated on you but your kids as well. He deserves every ounce of hate he's getting from them.",
            "Oh no, if it isn't the consequences of my own actions. \n\nLol, hope your POS stbx enjoys no longer having a family for the rest of his life. He deserves all the pain and misery that comes with it. \n\nGood for you OP for standing up for yourself!",
            "#Good For YOU \ud83d\udc4f \n\nNot to sound condescending; but I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting the example to your kids that this kind of behavior between a couple is not to be done or tolerated. \n\nThat's Huge! **WELL DONE** \ud83e\udd70\n\nSo, now the kids...\n\nThe kids have the right to their feelings; but they are going to have to navigate them with the help of a 3rd party (counselor) because there's some complexity in this situation which extends beyond \"typical\" divorce because everyone outside the home knows about the affair so this will be something they feel they are dealing with full time from all directions. \n\nThey have the right to be angry with their father. Not only did he cheat on their mom; but his cheating is widely known which makes the matter even worse because there is no hiding it or keeping it in the family, and as such the kids could be hearing things at school.\n\nYour eldest son may benefit from some kind of sport or other physical activity to help him channel his anger.\n\nMine got into weightlifting and body building when he was dealing with our messy divorce and it did help to give him a physical outlet for all that rage. My younger child got into running and used her rage to propell her to the finish line which was helpful.\n\nIf the kids have interests try and help them to feel grounded in those outlets to help them with their emotions. Art, music, gaming, sports, writing, whatever they like to do- indulge them in that because its all a form of self care and that's important. \n\nCounseling will be paramount for the elder and middle child right now; but especially the elder because he will set the tone for the youngers as the oldest. He's also more aware of what's happening by way of gossip and in being old enough to understand mature relationships and what cheating actually is.\n\n**DON'T** push the kids to be good or nice to their father- that just invalidates their feelings and can cause friction between you and them, and make them feel bad or wrong for feeling the way they do. They have the right to those emotions. They can decide what they want their relationship with their father to look like in time. Give them that time.\n\n**DON'T** force the kids to spend time with their father if they don't want to. This is a continuation of what I just said above. The kids will decide what they want and don't want. If dad invites them, agree that the activity sounds fun and let them decide. If the elder child is influencing (even indirectly/not purposely) the younger children to not ingage with their dad through his example then make plans to do something with the eldest yourself and your husband do something with the younger 2 or one (whoever wants to go) while the eldest decides what he wants and needs in terms of a relationship with his father.\n\n**DON'T** try to be the kids counselor. You can listen to how they feel, validate their feelings, let them know that you have the adult of things and they don't need to protect you or punish him for hurting you; but they have a right to feel how they do about him because of what he's done and how what he's done has affected their lives.\n\n**DON'T** talk badly about their father or try to exonerated his name. You are a blank canvas. They will paint you with their perceptions and you will say that you understand why they feel that way and that it's ok to have those feelings. If you're lucky the kids will tell you the complexity of their feelings because he's not all good or all bad- there are good times/bad times and good things and bad things throughout your familial history and its ok to laugh and remember good times, to  cry through the hurt and frustration, and to be angry about the situation. All of those things are valid. The painting is not black and white even if it may seem that way for a little while as they work through processing all of this stuff.\n\n**Get the Kids in to Counseling ASAP** (eldest especially; middle child too) you can't \"fix this\" for them. You're too close to the situation and you have to work on your own feelings surrounding what's happened.\n\n**Get YOURSELF into Counseling ASAP** you're going to have to navigate the cheating, the divorce, the impact of public knowledge of the cheating on you and the kids, your kids relationships with their father and the eldest may develop some anger issues that might need managing too so you're gonna need a lot of tools in your belt to help yourself and them to deal with this.\n\n**Counseling for You and the X** this is an excellent idea; but make sure you have an individual counselor for you too.\n\n**Family Counseling** yes; but not unless that oldest child has someone of his own to speak to and has put some time into doing that first. Trying to work as a group when one person is unwilling or incapable of doing so won't work well for anyone involved, and could actually cause more harm then good in the long run. \n\n#Thank You\n\nFor heading our advice and updating us with how things are going.\n\nMy heart goes out to your eldest child! Please focus on him (not your Xhusband) because its obvious that he is hurting very deeply right now.",

            "I don't normally comment on these types of subreddits but this hit home. I come from a family where the parents stayed together \"for the sake of the kids\" (i'm an only child but that's besides the point). My mom caught my dad cheating multiple times and stayed with him because she thought it would be better for me growing up with both parents. It wasn't. I grew up resenting my dad for demanding cleanliness and cooked meals and a presentable home and watching my mom do everything while she excused his behavior. I also remember my mom telling me when i was around 15 about my dad's cheating (casually, during a conversation where i was complaining about him in general). I was so angry and i started encouraging my mom to divorce him from that point on. Good on you for divorcing, it's going to set an excellent example for your kids (they'll definitely keep this in mind, kids are crazy observant).\n\nAbout your kids hating him, it'll get better. My parents ended up divorcing when i was in my early 20s and it was a nightmare and i resented my dad and downright hated him for a while because of a lot of things he did and said. We were no contact for around a year and he was desperate for a while after to get back in my good graces. I went to therapy, worked on my resentment towards him and now we're fine. He's not an award winning father by any stretch, he's actually quite lousy and always has been. We're not close but our relationship is somewhat functional and i know i can count on his help whenever i need it.\n\nAll this to say that your kids will grow and learn how to process all of this. It's a shock and it's upsetting. It's also a very public conflict with rumors running around their schools and they're probably getting all kinds of comments. Go to therapy, family and individual, and help create a dynamic where your kids can speak openly about their feelings and resentment while also getting your side of things. This kind of communication should be a two way street. That's how me and my mom fixed our relationship post-divorce and now we're best friends (she wasn't without faults of her own, lots of resentment there too). Be patient and open and have faith that your kids will eventually process their father's transgressions and learn how to cope in a healthy way. Stay strong, it'll get better for everyone.",

Your job is to help your kids through the pain of what he has done, for their sake. \n\nGet them into counseling and get you into counseling. You can go to a few joint sessions with your ex.if you want to in order to learn to coparent bur you need your own safe space to work through what's happened and likely the neglect and treat.ent he ha sout you through that you might not even be aware of fully yet...people like this don't become that way over night. I doubt he will get his own help, and likely, his offer of therapy was only marriage counseling to try and manipulate you into not ending the relationship and the lifestyle he's accustomed to. So don't expect him to get anything hut worse over time...this is where the mask comes off, and he becomes a stranger. \n\nYou and your kids will be fine. You are entering an exciting new time in your life full of possibility. You didn't compromise yourself to get there, either. You are going to find that that works in your favor. Work through the pain in a healthy way, with help, and your next relationship will be better and stronger for it. \n\nMy ex cheated, lied constantly, and was physical at times. I stayed because I didn't trust him with custody until our kids were older. Once I left him I was scared, but life really started. I am now remarried to a loving husband and also have a wonderful long-term boyfriend, and both men treat me like gold, and I have true passion in my life. I have amazing friends and a new hobby that helps pay the bills. I have found myself in ways I never could under the weight of the misery of that relationship and everything I had to take on that my ex wouldn't. My kids are happier and freer. My ex is still a part of their life, but with boundaries that I am able to control under the law (he gave me full custody without a fight). \n\nLife starts after divorce for many people when their partners cheat.",

The kids can still have a meaningful relationship with their Dad if that's what you guys decide.  Don't hide this from the kids.  They need to know that downfalls happen in relationships.  What they'll remember the most is how you reacted and grew from the experience.  Then if it happens to them, they'll know what to do.  And you WILL find someone who will treat you better.  You just need to remind yourself that your feelings matter.  There's no excuse for him doing that and there's no way he DIDN'T know how important that issue is to you.

            "I experienced very similar circumstances as a child. My parents had been married for 17 years when one of them cheated. My brother & I were about 9 & 13 at the time. It was tough as hell in the beginning when they were still trying to keep the marriage together. There was a coldness in the house bc of their lack of speaking to one another and the resentment and anger. When they did speak it was typically to fight one another. It\u2019s was sad, lonely time. Within a couple months they told us they were getting divorced. We were both very upset and scared about all the changes. My brother stayed with my Dad & my mom & I moved out. As hard and as sad as all of that and the adjustments that came with was I realized that it was better than going back to them staying married just for us. A lot of people told my mom it was a mistake to leave and in just 9 years or so I\u2019d be 18 & she could leave then My mom responded with I love my kids immensely and I owe them a happy childhood but I do not owe them my life. Both parents remained in each child\u2019s lives and they coparented as best as anyone good. They attended our school & extracurriculars together and for the first couple years they still did thanksgiving & Xmas together. As time moved on so did they and I\u2019m so glad they did.  It meant we were raised parents who were happy and trying hard to live their best lives. They both went on to have successful careers and successful second marriages.  Divorce is certainly hard on kids but a loveless, anger filled household would\u2019ve been so much worse.  Give yourself & your kids some time to adjust and I\u2019m certain they & you will be happier. Good luck on your new beginning.",

As adults we know parents are people and flawed but kids learn that slowly and your kids learned it fast,  make sure they know you love them and get them into therapy so they can learn to cope with these emotions.  I am so sorry for what you\u2019re going through but also proud of you for going through with the divorce.

I knew him 20 years, he's a couch potato and did each if those things once)\nAnd I was too busy trying not to die to deal with him. I spent exactly one year hating his guts. Then i let it go.

But that isn't true. Your dad chose to do that. After the divorce he could have stuck around, put extra effort for decades and your mum could have learnt to forgive him etc. The fact that his chose to simply abandon his kids is evidence she did the right thing because he was a shitty person.\n\nYou divorcing him is asserting those boundaries as he's done a shitty thing. It seems your kids would be behind it.\n\nThe balls now in his court to win his kids affection back and yours, it's not up to you to worry about that stuff. Even with extreme conservative Christianity that is against divorce there is a verse that says its acceptably with infidelity. It's so so normal to want a divorce after cheating and it's so hard to repair that trust.\n\nAll the negatives listed in your OP only are bad if he decides to continue his shittiness and leave.

I read every single one of them and (although some were... interesting) I never expected to receive such amazing support and encouragement from strangers all over the world. I also received dozens of PMs, with some even offering me a place to stay or simply someone to rant to. I can't thank you all enough, you made me see that I will be okay after all of this is said and done, and for that, /r/relationships, you have my eternal gratitude. (Also thanks to the guy that asked if I was interested in a threesome, appreciate it). \n\nA fair bit has happened since I put up my post a couple of days ago, but I'll try to keep it as brief as I can. After 3-4 hours of reading your replies, I decided that I'd drive home and grab some essential items before my BF got home from work, and stay a few nights at our local motel. A few of you suggested that the texts I saw may have not been from my mother, but I'm 99% sure that the pictures I saw in the texts were of her (plus I was far too scared to face my BF or mum to double check). \n\nBy the time I got home it was getting fairly late so I tried to grab what I could before my BF arrived. Unfortunately, as I was looking for my laptop I heard his car pull into our driveway. At this point I practically just grabbed what I could and tried to get the hell out of there - I really did not want to see him ever again. I got down the stairs and he opened the door. I'm not really sure what happened, I just started bawling my eyes and screaming, harder than I had been all day, and booked it for the door. He stopped me as I was trying to get past, but I told him to leave me alone and that I'd be back later that night. He did, surprisingly, and I got in my car and drove off.\n\nI mentioned in some comments in my last post that I was sort of friends with the lady who owned our local motel. I was good friends with her sister when we went to high school, and I was sure that after I explained myself she could get me a room to spend a few nights in. I pulled over and rung her up, and whilst trying to convey to her what happened I just started crying hysterically. She went above and beyond what I ever expected anyone would. She offered me a room in her own house for free, and told me I could take as long as I needed. Since then I've basically gone between sleeping and crying, and only left my room to eat and go to the toilet. I am in extreme gratitude to her though, the support I've received in general over the past 2 days has been staggering. \n\nI turned off my phone last night but I know my BF was blowing it up. I didn't look at any messages or missed calls, but I saw that the notifications were there when I went to turn it off. He'll have no idea that I'm here though, so I guess it's nice to know that I can take a little while to recover without him finding me. \n\nI didn't mention this earlier, but my BF was the only one on our lease. I'm currently unemployed whilst he has a fairly well-paying job, so hopefully that'll make everything a little easier. As for my mum, I'm pretty much done with her. I plan to move across the country to find a job interstate once I've gotten all of my stuff, and basically never talk to either of them again.\n\nAs I said, I still need to get all of my belongings from my BF's place, which is going to be tricky without seeing him. I'm not sure how to go about that and I guess I'm looking for suggestions.\n\nAs for me, I'm doing okay. Right now I still can't believe any of this is happening. Sleep is my only source of comfort right now as it allows me to forget all of this is going on, but when I'm awake I can't shake the feeling of dread and constant sickness. But, again, all of you gave me the strength to know that this will get better, it just can't come soon enough.\n\nAgain, thank you all so much for your words of encouragement. Hopefully I can get my stuff with no troubles or dramas, and update you all when I begin my new life (without my mum and my ex).\n\nLove you all <3\n\n**tl;dr -** Staying at friends house, need help on how I should get my shit back from my ex.\n\n",

I think the most you can do is call her and apologize for your friend's behavior, that you told them to ask Cindy because in the moment you thought she'd know exactly what to do. It won't solve the overall problem, but might make her feel a little better about that specific situation.",

            "I am a parent in a same-sex family, although my daughter is only 3.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong by asking for Cindy, you asked for the parent you thought would be best in that situation. \n\nSame-sex parents can have their own insecurities around their role as a parent.  Depending on where you live, same-sex marriage likely wasn\u2019t legal when you were born and even now it is very uncommon for both parents to have rights as parents immediately on birth.  Medical care is one of the situations where that becomes very relevant and may have reminded your mums of the different ways they experience parenthood.  However, for your mum to move out suggests this isn\u2019t just about that insecurity surfacing.  We can\u2019t say why this became such a big deal but it isn\u2019t because of you.  \n\nTell your mums you love them both but beyond that, this is something they need to work through themselves.",
            "\nAny reasonable person would get Cindy. \n\nSomething happened that you don\u2019t know about. You shouldn\u2019t - parents shouldn\u2019t rely on their teenagers to meet their emotional needs or solve their problems.  But you\u2019re getting older.  It\u2019s time to recognize that your Mums *have* needs and wants and desires and hopes that aren\u2019t about you.  They have every right to have them met - by other adults of course, not you. \n\nYour parents need to work their own stuff out.  Don\u2019t get involved.  But also don\u2019t paint one in your mind as being in the wrong because you just don\u2019t know.",
            "This isn't about you, Dear One. \n\nIt's about parental insecurity. It may be further about how they each handle things in a crisis and how the other person in their marriage feels about it. \n\n\nYou didn't do *anything* wrong. \n\nIf you feel the need to take action and clear the air, call Jasmine and tell her your truths, whatever they are: (you love her, are missing her being at home and are concerned that she is mad at you.) \n\nRemember that it's normal to have disagreements even in healthy relationships, but one of your parents moving out temporarily certainly doesn't feel good.\n\n\nThis is between two partners; it truly has nothing to do with you.\nIt's appropriate to share your feelings respectfully with your parents. You're entitled to have them, just like they are.\n\n\nMay you experience abundant healing for your arm. Here's hoping this will be a small bump in the road for your parents. Wishing you three every happiness.",

You should not be made to feel as if you did anything wrong, and frankly it\u2019s a bad look that Jasmine left right after this happened and allowed you to feel like you precipitated things.\n\nPlease confide in each of your parents that you\u2019re feeling like you did something wrong and give them the opportunity to make things right (which might not look like Jasmine coming home and everything going back to the way it was, but should look like them reassuring you that it\u2019s them, not you).\n\nYou and your friends are kids. You asking for your surgeon parent should not be misconstrued as a slight against your parent who isn\u2019t a surgeon no matter how tactlessly your friends could have carried that out.\n\nYOU should be the victim here and your parents should be the ones asking how to make things okay because you are the child who broke his arm! You should be receiving special attention. Not either of them!",

            "This sounds like an insecurity, self doubt, inferiority issue that Jaz has and this request you made was the final thing that made her react this way. I learnt that many times when people over react like this, it\u2019s not about us . They\u2019ve got stuff going on.\n\nIf you feel like speaking to her to explain you asked for cindy because she\u2019s a surgeon and they as parents to you to use logic- and this was a logical move instead of a preference of a parent, maybe try that.",
            "Sorry but your moms are being bad moms for fighting within earshot of you. It's only logical to go for the health professional when an accident happens. Nothing about this should be your issue.",
            "Is one of them your birth mother?  Could that play into their response?\n\nParents fighting is always tough on kids, regardless of age.",
            "You don't do anything. It's not about you. It may seem like your mom is upset you hurt yourself and asked for surgeon my mom but she's not. That started an argument between them that doesn't have anything to do with what started the argument. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong and they should have made that clear. You didn't cause this fight and you can't fix it.",

Because my same sex couple cousins have had this same argument about their son and that was the root one one\u2019s jealousy.\n\nThey\u2019re now in process of divorce. All of their arguments stemmed from the child\u2019s needs and someone feeling like their toes were getting stopped on. In most opposite sex relationships, the man defers to the mom when kids are sick and dad steps in when needed. (Traditionally)\n\nThis is no fault of yours, it\u2019s just a dynamic of many TOXIC same sex relationships. Most same sex relationships that are healthy, parents do not fight over such trivial things. \n\nYou going for the doctor mom makes logical sense. But someone in this situation is only thinking with their emotions and there is a root cause that\u2019s likely about you but not about anything you did or your fault.\n\nEdit: Again, this didn\u2019t same sex specific, because a straight couple may have the same issue, especially when a parent has adopted their partner\u2019s biological child. It\u2019s just a potential root cause. \n\nIf this continues to affect you, suggest family therapy. It\u2019s so nasty for kids to have to go through this and really selfish.",

            "This truly had nothing to do with it and it's mega selfish of your mom to leave without making it clear to you that the issue was not you. She has to know that this had made you feel ashamed or guilty, which you shouldn't feel.\n\nYou made the right chose. You picked the right person for the job. ANYONE would have done the same thing. This is an issue between your parents that they need to work out. Talk to your other mom about how you're feeling. I'm sure they will reassure you that this isn't your fault or your responsibility. I'm sorry your mom is being so immature :(",

I don't know if this should be a good or a bad thing.\n\nI would also think they have other relationship problems and what happened just ignited the whole wood pile.\n\nYou did the smart thing, the logical thing. So don't beat yourself over it. This is 100% not you. They need to solve their issues like adult parents should do and not make their son feel like he did something wrong and caused this.",

            "There is something else going on between them, this is not your fault at all. Maybe Jaz is feeling insecure about something and it all came up when this happened, but that\u2019s not your fault. You asked your friend to get the mom who made the most sense in your mind, that\u2019s not a bad thing. I\u2019m sorry that they are using you as the focus of the argument, but please know that you did not cause this. It could have, and likely would have, come up another way if you hadn\u2019t broken your arm.\n\nParents have this really fun thing where they stuck their kids into their arguments and it leaves the kids feeling like it was their fault. It was not your fault. This is a chance for you to state your needs to your parents, at least if you feel comfortable speaking to them about this.\n\nI\u2019m going to suggest talking to them separately if you choose to, they won\u2019t have the chance to bring up the argument in the moment or blame each other rather than owning up to their part and focus on how it\u2019s affecting you. It\u2019s clearly hurting you and that\u2019s what matters here, they need to push aside their shit for a moment and focus.\n\nTell them, separately, that this situation is bothering you. That it feels like it\u2019s your fault, or like they are placing you in the middle, and it\u2019s just not fair to you. If they have an issue that needs to be worked out they need to do that, they need to face whatever it is together and not act like it was caused by you. Remind them that you all love each other and it\u2019s important to be able to communicate in healthy ways. It might be nice to also tell Cindy that you asked for Jaz because it\u2019s part of her job, not because you see Cindy as less capable of helping you or taking care of you. That\u2019s a separate thing though and if she\u2019s feeling insecure about that then she needs to communicate, not argue with her wife while putting you in the middle.\n\nI really hope this works out and that you have a relationship where you can speak to your moms openly. It\u2019s hard, I remember so many arguments between my parents where I was put in the middle and it took me a long time to realize it was never really about me, it was them taking their issues out on each other and using me as an excuse to fight. I remember one night in my early 20s where my mom was trying to shit talk about my dad to me and I just kinda was beyond done. We didn\u2019t have a relationship where these things could be talked about, so it was basically years of pent of emotions coming out at once. It helped me gain more clarity, but it also wasn\u2019t productive since it came out when my mom was already in a mood towards my dad and she just took it as me wanting to vent about him. It was about both of them and how much that shit hurt growing up, but all she heard was what she wanted.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry this is happening, I hope you take it to heart that this isn\u2019t your fault. They have work to do and as the adults, they shouldn\u2019t be letting their own issues affect you like this.",
            "This has nothing to do with you. It\u2019s about their relationship. You sent scared kids for the most logical parent. Scared kids got the most logical parent. \n\nThe other parent can feel their feelings, but it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix them. \n\nI\u2019m going to say this again because I can\u2019t stress it enough: it\u2019s not your responsibility to fix how your mother feels about this. She needs to work it out with her partner and a therapist and _YOU_ stay out of it. If she tries guilting you about it, just grey rock until you can leave, or tell her she\u2019s responsible for her own feelings and it sounds like she needs to talk to a therapist about them, not you.",
            "Wow, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this especially when this is absolutely not your fault. \nIf anything, Jaz should be incredibly grateful to be married to a doctor that knows exactly what to do in this kind of situation and have immediate access to other surgeons that can fix you. Sure, situations arise where one parent gets their feelings hurt if their child chooses one over the other, but this is not that situation. You did the right thing and if I were in your position I would\u2019ve done the same.",

            "Talk to your moms and left them know what's on your mind. Something is going on between them and you can ask about it.

It makes total sense that when you\u2019re injured your mind would jump to the parent who is a doctor, and it obviously has nothing to do with preferring her in general or loving her more or anything.\n\nThere are clearly deeper issues going on in their relationship, and it\u2019s not on you to sort that out. Just keep communicating with them about your feelings and needs, and don\u2019t try to take sides or fix anything. It\u2019s upsetting to see your parents fighting like this, but only they can fix whatever is going on between them. If either of them DOES try to blame you, turn you against the other one, put you in the middle of the fight somehow, etc, tell them straight up that it\u2019s inappropriate and they should not be pulling you into this. Hopefully they won\u2019t pull anything like that.",
            "You definitely did absolutely nothing wrong. As many have said, they'd go to the parents who can fix the problem first, *but* this isn't about that, and I'd like to add to the choir. My dad says a lot if you're ferociously arguing about dinner, it's probably not about dinner.

I don't really know how it happened but I ended up just spilling everything like word vomit and telling her the truth. At first she was taken off guard and really didn't have much to say, but we talked it out and she admitted that she still had feelings for me, too.\n\nSo, long story short, we are now dating, and I'm still trying to come to terms with my sexuality.

One of the characters who was straight fell in love with a gay character. He came out to his family as being in love with the guy, but insisting he's straight. He doesn't like men, just him. Just the one man. He's still straight. Just the one soul that calls to you stronger than all preconceived notion of sexuality. Then I finally understood how my ex could claim to be lesbian yet have been with me for years. Sometimes it's not about gender or sexuality, it's about love. I don't expect it to ever happen, and I'd still be straight, but if I fell in love with a man, then that wouldn't have to change who I am.",
            "Taken by surprise, caught off guard ;)",
            "Congratulations on confronting your feelings and opening up to Margot. She sounds very understanding and supportive. That's great! I wish you the best!",
            "I'm so glad that you have so much love for Margot. \nBut I very strongly disagree with the porn comments and suggestions towards sex in any manner. Had you been asking about a man, nobody would have suggested that you do a quick search on a porn site, so that you can please your new lover. \nYou do not have to do anything with each other sexually at all if you are uncomfortable. Focus on the love side of things, and feeling comfortable around each other won't ever be a problem. Best of luck :)",
            "Good luck on your journey - my daughter took some twists and turns figuring out her sexuality - but she's been with her partner for over 3 years and is happy and so much more comfortable with herself and it's awesome.",
            "Congratulations! That happened with me, too. I ended up dating a woman and it was the best relationship of my life. It ended, unfortunately, but love is love.",
            "Also if people who were your friends resent you for your decision it wouldn't be a bad idea to cut them out of your life like I had to years ago. All my so-called \"friends\" thought it was weird and vanished a year or so later after I came out as bisexual and started dating a guy. Don't let them get to you.",
            "Yay! I'm happy to see this update. Sexuality isn't cut and dry, just take it slow and go with the flow! ",
            "Congratulations!!! I'm so happy for you!",
            "This makes me so happy. :) Like everyone else said, don't stress it, just explore yourself & be happy (& proud!).",
            "Yay, a happy ending! Happy for you Reddit stranger. ",
            "If your both happy that's what matters most. I wish you two the best!",
            "This sounds lovely and I hope you guys have tons of fun dating!",
