He still eats mostly meat, but has moved on to things like bacon-wrapped meatballs and burgers. The fried chicken was more occasional, and he improved his cooking style over the year.\n\nShortly after I made the original post, we talked to Louis about the jokes he'd been making concerning the incident. He genuinely didn't know he had offended people and apologized to everyone he thought necessary. Things were mended on that front pretty quickly.\n\nWe have since left that job and that housing, and so has he. But Louis proved to be one of the best roommates we ever had. He was reliable, fun to be around, and hard working. We consider him one of our close friends now, and are very grateful to have had the experience of living together. Thank you to everyone who commented on my original post, your advice was sound and you all helped me feel much better about the situation, which ended up turning out great.\n\nTL;DR: Fried chicken-obsessed roommate expanded his palate. Ended up being one of the best roommates we've ever had.",

        "selftext": "[PREVIOUS POST](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gzblnk/my_30m_fianc%C3%A9e_29f_has_discovered_a_new_love_of/)\n\nMy original post blew up in a way I totally wasn\u2019t expecting. It seems a lot of people could personally relate to my post in some way so I hope it\u2019s been helpful to others apart from myself. Thanks very much to everyone who commented; I wasn\u2019t able to reply to everyone obviously but I did read as much as I could.\n\nThere are a few things I\u2019d like to clear up since they kept coming up:\n\nShe is not doing this because she wants to spend more time together. Previously, we would spend most of our evenings together watching shows or playing video games. Now that she is spending 8+ hours cooking by herself I don\u2019t see her as much, and she is too tired from cooking sometimes to spend time with me. So that's something that\u2019s been bugging me about this that I hadn\u2019t even realized.\n\nIt is especially bothersome to me because I work 50+ hours a week and she still works full-time as well (though her schedule is much more flexible). So now I feel like my already meager free time AND quality time with her is being cut into, which might be one of the most important aspects of this whole issue.\n\nHer motivation is not to save money or be more healthy. We live in a big city where we are able to order lots of homemade-style ethnic food from mom-n-pop type places that isn\u2019t overly salted or oily to appeal to the masses. It\u2019s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person. Furthermore, we make a very comfortable income and don\u2019t want kids. So money is not an issue.\n\nSo I sat her down and talked to her, again, because we were both in a good mood. But when I brought up the topic, she started to become annoyed, simply because this is a point of contention and I guess she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nI told her that I\u2019m invested in solving this problem and that if we\u2019re unable to do so we can bring it up during couples\u2019 counseling. We had already intended to go before the wedding purely for premarital counseling, but now I feel as if there is an actual problem we have to discuss during the session and if we can get an appointment sooner rather than later I would be open to doing so.\n\nThis seemed to make it real for her. She seemed to be truly taken aback that I wanted to go to counseling over this (well, not over this specifically but that I wanted to involve a counselor at all in the cooking issue). She even became teary-eyed! I felt bad so I asked her if there was anything else bothering her, that was really at the root of this, and she said that she\u2019s overall felt pretty depressed by the pandemic and quarantine and everything. I told her I could relate and let her cry it out a bit.\n\nWhen she\u2019d gotten past that I didn\u2019t want the conversation to lose its steam so I brought up the following things:\n\n* I love that her new hobby is making her happy and I appreciate that she\u2019s making lots of delicious food for us to enjoy. \n* These are the problems I have identified which I would like to find solutions for:\n    * We used to spend a lot more time together. I would like to have more easy meals so we can go back to spending quality time together on TV/video games/etc. like we used to.\n    * I do not mind helping a little or hanging out while she\u2019s cooking, but the disrespect in the kitchen absolutely has to stop. In future I will be getting up and leaving if she is rude to me in the kitchen. \n    * The unfeminist comment was a low blow and I would like an apology.\n\nShe said she understood these things and apologized for the unfeminist comment. We worked out a meal schedule where I would be responsible for providing meals 2 times a week and she would cook elaborate meals on weekends. One designated night would be for both of us to cook a simpler meal together as a couples\u2019 activity. \n\nI asked her if there was anything about this she wanted to bring up\u2014about how I was behaving or how she feels\u2014and she said no, that she really was just depressed by quarantine and had dived into her new hobby. Hopefully if there is something else she will bring it up later.\n\nThat was a night where she was to cook a simpler meal for us. As a show of good faith I decided to help her out and see if she could be more chill and suggested we do all the prep first as some had suggested. It started off fine but she started to become snappish as she juggled frying in two different pans and wanted me to keep handing her prepped ingredients, so I went back to my room. \n\nI felt VERY bad because I was leaving her in a bit of a tough spot but I also felt like I needed to stand by what I said because I did not want to put up with her poor treatment of me. On top of that I had had a really difficult day at work (my job involves working with people who have very tough lives and I end up heartbroken and emotionally drained quite frequently; this has become exacerbated due to the pandemic) so I really just did not want to deal with my own partner being mean to me.\n\nUltimately the dinner turned out fine but she was pretty icy to me. I praised the meal a bit more than I usually do but she was sour all night. \n\nI have started looking to get a couples\u2019 counseling appointment soon. I wish I had a happier update for you but hopefully things will get better with our new meal schedule as we continue to implement it and as I continue to set boundaries. I will also be keeping an eye on her depression and suggest individual therapy if it seems appropriate.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: We're going to couples' counseling and have implemented a new meal schedule.",

            "I learned something when I was building a paint-rack for one of the first apartments me and my now-wife shared - I get very high-strung, very stressed, and very on-edge when I am building things. Just like your Fiancee wants your help in the kitchen, I wanted help with building this paint-rack, because sometimes two hands just felt like not enough!\n\nBut as she wasn't able to read my mind, I got frustrated, and when anything went wrong the irritation and disappointment that was usually reserved for myself began to spill out (unfairly!) to her. She was hurt by me being snippy and snappish, and that was totally fair. She didn't put up with it, and she was right not to.\n\nSo now? I don't ever ask for her help with building stuff. That's unfortunate, because it could be something cool to do together, and certainly two pairs of hands can be helpful. But ultimately I am a bad co-builder, and that's on me, not on her.\n\nI think the same thing may be inevitable with you two. She's a bad co-chef. Even if she acknowledged that during your talk, she wasn't able to control that spilling out when cooking again, and she didn't even apologize for it afterwards - instead blaming you for following through on what you two agreed to! So I think she loses co-cooking privileges. **She's just not wired for cooking together** (the same way some friends can be awesome friends but terrible roommates!).",
            "I read and commented on your previous post, but now it's showing deleted. \n\nI'm glad you left the room. If you hadn't, you'd be telling her that you don't mean what you say. It's concerning that she immediately went back to snapping after your conversation though. \n\nYou will have to keep working at this and holding her accountable if you want to help solve it, but ultimately only she can fix it. Hopefully you get a good counselor, and she puts in the work.",
            "It was only the first try, so hopefully you can both settle into this new schedule, or find ways it needs to be tweaked for both your benefit. \n\nYou mentioned you guys used to watch TV together/play video games a lot. How into this was she? Have you also considered these are passive activities where you are consuming, whereas cooking is an active activity in which you create? Have you asked her if there is a different creating activity, in addition to cooking, that you both enjoy which you can add to your together time? Just an idea to have more together time but doing something more engaging. Maybe if it's outside the space of cooking, she'll be more relaxed.",
            ">\tIt\u2019s at least as healthy as the normal diet of a Mexican, Indian, Thai, Ethiopian, etc. person\n\nJust want to throw this out there - home cooking is _much_ different from food eaten out, in other countries and cultures as well. Usually with much more vegetables and starches and less meat, fats, sugar. Restaurants are tiny snapshots of \u201crich\u201d foods from a cuisine. Plus, restaurant portions tends to be larger.",
            "Her compromising and recognizing the problem is a great sign! It\u2019ll just take some getting used to,  so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into her snappiness. But the sooner you can get an appointment with a counselor the better.",
            "Since she is still new to her cooking hobby I think maybe she thinks she was doing something less complicated and by the measure of your previous post was probably less complicated than before, but still complicated. Like someone who gets really into juggling and is struggling to juggle 5 balls and gets told to go simpler and instead of just doing 2 they do 3 lol",
            "As a chef I'll say this, it's never about cooking. Everyone loves tasty food.\nHave you considered she doesn't actually like just sitting around playing games and watching movies? Maybe she feels like she's wasting her life away etc. Especially if you aren't planning on children, what is she going to do for the next 50 or 70 years of her life. Sit on a couch? I think OP needs to back off a bit and thinking about their future rather than video games movie nights and couple cooking.\nLastly don't think of this as her new hobby. She probably just feels stifled and frustrated, your job might be emotionally straining but if you can't muster the capacity to cherish your partner after work you got a very big red flag.",
            "Keep in mind that irritability is a major part of depression and one that is not mentioned nearly as much as sadness, loss of enjoyment or apathy. \n\nI find that my most functional depression is irritable rather than the latter. When I become overwhelmed with sadness or grief and feel defeated by life, I don\u2019t self care about much and I don\u2019t do much of anything, much less do anything well. \n\nWhen I\u2019m still mostly functional, it\u2019s like the energy I need to be okay with things is gone and I just get irritable about every little thing. I see myself doing it, I don\u2019t feel I can stop it, and it makes me more frustrated and irritable. \n\nYour girlfriend says she is feeling depressed. I think she started something new because she needs something to refill the part of her that now feels missing or needy. \n\nI would suggest outdoor exercise and friend time. I have certainly needed it so I\u2019m doing physical distance hikes with friends every weekend (I\u2019m an essential worker and have been working at my work place this entire time) and it has done WONDERS for my mental and emotional health to get those outlets back into my life. \n\nIf you live together and have been nonstop home together then she probably started the cooking as a way to get some space from you and try to self care while also stimulating herself. Being so invested in the cooking and feeling a need to have it replenish a hole can add to her irritability and depression. Obviously this is speculation on my part, but could be why she stopped your regular routine and you two are spending less time together.\n\nI think your talk was a great first step and I\u2019m glad you held your boundary, it\u2019s very important. I hope you can find a way to remain patient and compassionate, and I hope that she can find a way to refill her cup because until she is able to rebalance her needs so that she is no longer experiencing depression, you\u2019re going to have a rough time of it. \n\nGood luck! \n\n(This is based on my own experience and life living with anxiety and depression. Obviously I could be projecting to the point of being totally wrong, I just feel this is correct due to the experiences I\u2019ve had. Her own personal therapist, if you can afford it or have coverage for it, will likely be a great support to her. It took me a few tries to find a therapist I like but I finally have one and it\u2019s changed so much for me.!)",
            "If your jobs are sedentary and your hobbies are as well, I would actually recommend some kind of exercise - especially if she is depressed and irritable! She seems to enjoy a mental challenge (even if she obviously overdoes it a bit), so maybe dancing together or something? Or if she is too irritable, something more individual and tough...",
            "I don\u2019t know if this was suggested in the previous thread, but consider a meal delivery service.  You still get to cook, but the prep is mostly done for you.  The recipes give us different ideas than what we usually cook and my wife saves the ones we like if we want to replicate them.  We do this like three nights a week and do our own more elaborate cooking on the weekends.",
            "Sorry to hear things didn't turn out as well as hoped. Your sit down with her sounds reasonable. Your compromise with her and continued willingness to help shows you're not dismissing her feelings or interests. It's unfortunate as soon as the discomfort passed she went back to her usual habit and got upset when you called her out by following through and leaving the kitchen. I commend you for seeking out counseling sooner rather than later. There's clearly more to this and the root cause needs to be deeper confronted. Hopefully professional guidance will be insightful.",
            "Yah, there's most definitely something going on here when **immediately** after your discussion she went right back to snapping at you. You did very well with this discussion, you laid it out and told her what you were going to do. You stuck to it. The fact that she saw it as a non-issue regardless of the fact that you brought it up multiple times before only to be shut down (and acted surprised when you drove that point home) is strange to me. \n\nOverall I'm glad you're going to couples counseling, honestly she needs to develop a lot of introspection and emotional intelligence (at least that's what I can gather purely from this post.)",
            "Your wife needs cooking lessons. While cooking can be elaborate it sounds like she makes process waaaay too complicated. Head chefs don't demand their sous chefs bring them prepped ingredients to put in the pan. \n\nYou're exercising some great patience, counselling will do wonders, it doesn't appear that you're being unreasonable.",
            "Depression can make you really irritable, and I've been on both the receiving and giving end of its consequences. Little things can set you off really easily. I like to compare it to being really exhausted and you just wanna go home and sleep. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the problem. I'm sure cooking could be a good outlet for her. Honestly, I would suggest that you only cook dishes together that at least one of you already knows how to do very well. That way one person can lead and assign tasks and the other can follow suit with the instructions. Even if you find a new recipe that's also simple, have only one of you try cooking it a couple times to get the hang of it.\n\nI think it would be a good idea for you to start cooking some simple meals yourself so you can get more experience and do more of a give and take with cooking. Even if she really likes to cook, there might be days where she just doesn't have the energy or motivation. Eating out can be really expensive as it adds up, and it honestly raises my self esteem when I cook my partner something they really like. And I know that I could still have food I really like even if I didn't have someone else around. You could start doing a dinner by yourself once a week or make lunches and breakfasts for the two of you. I get that life can be stressful and exhausting, and I'm definitely cooking less when school or work gets busy, but I never really had a problem cooking at least a meal or two a week when it got bad. I can't exactly tell but just from the wording of the post it doesn't seem like you really cook, which is a really nice tool to have under your belt\n\n I think couples counseling would be good but also individual counseling, that way you have a space to talk without any worry about what the other might feel about what you said and you can be completely honest with yourselves.\n\nI'm sure you guys will be able to work something out; I think quarantine and the current civil unrest is getting to us all. Much love!",

            "Am I the only one that thinks OP is in the wrong here? 8 hours a week spent on cooking is nothing, and if this is a new found hobby to help with Covid depression then let her have it. Some people don\u2019t want to mindlessly watch TV every night, especially when feeling depressed. \n\nI also couldn\u2019t help but notice that it seemed like OP used marriage counseling over this as a threat as opposed to a solution. I think OP needs to check himself",
            "Hey op, my husband has gotten real into cooking even before covid, I didn\u2019t really get it and he\u2019s had to explain to me that it helps him decompress  after a long day. Your following instructions, for him using different parts of his brain, there\u2019s some sort of \u201cmaker\u201d satisfaction you get out of it. \n\nThat said we always cook enough for multiple leftovers so we can have less ambitious days - is she not doing that?\n\nAlso, part of the fun to me is conquering a new recipe. But not all recipes need to take hours to make. Has she tried looking for new recipes that can be done in under an hour? You can make some really nice and fancy meals within for under that timeframe.",
            "One thing that stood out to me when reading your post is that the two things you listed as things you normally do together (tv and video games) can increase depression if done in excess. If she\u2019s anything like me, it might be making her more depressed to be spending so much time not really doing anything (I get that looking at screens is technically doing something, but both watching tv and playing video games are very dissociative activities). She\u2019s found a more grounding hobby which is good, the problem is you can\u2019t join her doing it because of her irritability in the kitchen. You might considering finding activities you both like that bring you closer together since she may be feeling unfulfilled by sitting around staring at a screen, and cooking clearly causes contention between you. Try to find a new hobby that you can share! Start doing yoga, buy a puzzle, play board games together, anything that actively involves both of you and is away from screens.",
            "I\u2019ve worked in too many commercial kitchens.\n\n\nTo me, being polite means being considerate, and being considerate means prioritizing efficiency above all else. No professional cook, chef, or baker wants to listen to niceties if it means risking their b\u00e9chamel curdling or their whites falling. \n\n\nI also genuinely don\u2019t think I could handle someone not being able to do something as simple as hand me preprepped bowls in a timely way while I juggled multiple pans. I don\u2019t think I can say more without it being mean, but I would be absolutely livid if this happened routinely. If I\u2019m doing everything else and you have the simplest, lightest task, and you don\u2019t do it...the division of labour would be enraging.\n\n\nLike, I if did all the laundry and folded almost all the clothes and I asked my boyfriend to put the pillow cases on the pillows, but instead he folded them into the sock drawer. \n\nIt\u2019s been hard, because my boyfriend is much more laid back and loves to cook with me. We\u2019ve figure out that the best way is to plan and divide the tasks beforehand, which works well. I also tend to act more \u2018friendly\u2019 when I let him take the reigns and lead the way, because it\u2019s so much easier for me to follow instructions than to patiently and politely give them. Even then, I\u2019ll still catch myself just yelling \u2018OLIVE OIL\u2019 with my back turned sometimes. \n\n\nJust another perspective.\n\n\nEdit: I also wanted to mention, most kitchens have a very ridged working hierarchy. In the most traditional and strictest ones, it literally resembles military rankings. There is a reason for this - co-cheffing really doesn\u2019t work well. Things run smoothest under a chain of command.",
            "This whole post feels skewed to one-side so I\u2019ll go against the grain here. \n\n1) Is she snapping at you because of your lack of skill or your lack of effort? Like is she doing the majority of the research and work while you just stand there and wait to be told something to do while the onions are very obviously burning right beside you? \n\n2) I have doubts that she feels \u201ctv and video games\u201d are sufficient bonding activities for a 30 year old couple. I like those things too, but if that\u2019s all I ever did with my partner I\u2019d certainly be bored. \n\n3) Making a meal that requires one hour a day and two pans is not \u201celaborate\u201d ffs. That\u2019s a decent pasta bolognese. \n\n4) Healthy, home cooked foods benefit you and your health too, and I encourage you to start investing in it for yourself. Sorry - it seems like she wants to grow up and you\u2019re partially stuck in the \u201cpizza rolls and CoD\u201d phase. \n\nThough I will echo suggestions from everyone else - try a meal prep service like Blue Apron and get thee to a couples counselor.",
            "So she immediately cooked a challenging meal on the first simple night and snapped at you in the process? Yeah. Counseling. The feelings about the pandemic are her reasons for cooking. Her reasons for treating you poorly and doing whatever she wants are grounded in entitlement.",
            "I would actually like an expansion of the \"unfeminist\" comment and apology. Did she apologize and truly acknowledge this, or not?\n\nThe thing is, she has assigned a very high value to her cooking, on her own. And, she is insisting that you also follow along (in the traditional family, gender role way) to also value \"wife cooking\" as a highly sought-after thing.\n\nI am really curious, when are you getting married? You say you both make good income...but is she happy in her career? Is she ambitious? Do you want kids? Has she EVER expressed a desire to stay at home as a wife/mom, or to quit her job? Is her job stressful, or does she derive pleasure from work?\n\nThis may be a bit of a reach, but ...it could be worth to explore...whether or not she is unhappy with her career and trying to figure out different ways to \"be valuable\" to you. And, maybe, she's not fully sharing her intent with you, and this is why there's a disproportionate blow-up on this topic.\n\nEven though the fight seems silly, you're getting married, and food is a BIG DEAL. Meals happen every day - literally. Imagine fighting every day on this, for years, until the resentment and bitterness finally carry over into other topics, and your love for each other falls apart. Strongly recommend you get to the REAL root cause of this issue before marriage.  \n\n\nEDIT: Another out-there theory, but maybe it resonates.....is she being devalued at her work, or has she been trying to take on ambitious projects at work but failing to deliver them?\n\nYour example of the 2-fry pan \"simple\" dinner is really telling. Either she did that on purpose - to set you up to fail right after you discussed compromise - OR she really IS unable to correctly assess her own abilities. The overestimation of her own abilities to such a dramatic degree seems almost to be like a defense mechanism to make up for failures where maybe she didn't deliver when she should have. And, as part of the defense mechanism, she's trying to deflect blame on you - so it's not about the cooking failure, as much as what it represents about her other failures. They're not her fault. It's because she didn't have help. Just like in the kitchen. Etc. \n\nEither way, this really isn't about cooking, there's no way.",

            "I like cooking and it's my own time for peace and quiet. If my boyfriend offers to help I shoo him away. It's my peaceful time and someone interrupting that ruins it. \n\nI don't agree with the way you've been treated. But to me it sounds like she's recognised she needs some more mental TLC and has developed a strategy to fix that problem, and you're asking for things to remain the way they were in an ideal situation. She probably sees that as you asking her to put aside her self care to hang out together. \n\nI like the ideal of the cooking schedule, but maybe leave her alone on the days she cooks. And maybe one of the days you cook tell her to run a bath, grab a glass of wine and go relax why you do dinner. My boyfriend has done that a couple times for me when I'm feeling really broken and I always feel so much better afterwards. \n\nIt just seems like her mental state might be making her seem more self centred at the moment",

            "Sounds like you handled this well. Is it possible she really wants to do some new things? Watching TV and gaming every night- does she legitimately actually like doing this? Maybe she needed a new hobby and this was all she could think of and she went kind of overboard. maybe she could learn something she can do while watching TV with you, that is a less involved hobby.  Since income is a not a challenge for you, what about one of those meal ingredient services where they mail you everything and give you a recipe or demo video? That might let her enjoy learning to cook while also making it a bit more streamlined. Good luck OP.",
            "As an older guy, I can say that cooking does not need to involve both people, but you should stay there and talk to her if she wants.  Supposedly, you love this person.  You should want to spend time around them.\n\nI don't think you should have to help, but you should be willing to help if asked.  She shouldn't be asking you to basically be a sous chef - she is the one that wants to cook - but you would do well to talk to her and flirt or whatever while she cooks.  She wants attention.",

Best of luck, keep on your toes.",
            "While I personally enjoy the walking out tactic, I\u2019m going to warn you that a therapist might not suggest you keep it. \n\nEven though you explicitly and maturely explained your plans to walk out if she got snippy, leaving her out to dry in the middle of a stressful situation can really only make things worse. You benefit by getting immediately more comfortable, but I hope you can see where that would increase her stress levels x10 and make it seem like you\u2019re abandoning her. And when people are already in compromised states of mind (ie: her depression triggered by the pandemic), we spiral out of control sometimes. I\u2019ve felt this depression she\u2019s feeling, and if I were in her shoes, my brain would tell me: \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 is leaving me when I get difficult. Can he manage marrying me? What if I become too much? What if he only loves the parts of me that are attractive to him, like when I\u2019m calm and collected? What if he\u2019s looking for a woman who is gentler than me, or who behaves better under stress?\u201d I bring up those last two sentences specifically to tie into her anti-feminist critique of you. I\u2019m wondering if that statement went further and she didn\u2019t have the words to explain it (and this is a very common feeling among those socialized as women: we must behave as so or we are unlovable.)\n\nI only say this to give you perspective, not because I feel you\u2019ve done anything wrong. In fact, I admire your grace in this situation. However, when we get into depressions like this, our minds make up narratives that often times are either completely or partially divorced from reality. These narratives can be very scary and cause us to act irrationally or in ways that make us seem not like ourselves.\n\nMy advice has nothing to do with your collective time in the kitchen: make a concerted effort to remind her as often as you can that you love her unconditionally and that you support her. Sounds like she needs it now more than ever. & hopefully if you tell her often while she is not under stressful situations, when she becomes stressed and frustrated she will remember your words and be able to pull herself back on track.",

She expressed a desire to change, so I would give it a little more time before you should get worried.  That being said, you shouldn\u2019t allow this indefinitely.  You seem very reasonable, so you should trust your judgement as to how long to give her.\n\nAlso, very good observation about something bothering her.  Again, I have same problem as her in terms of frustration, and when I get like that it\u2019s normally because I don\u2019t even realize something is bothering me.  Just because she didn\u2019t say something in particular is bothering her doesn\u2019t mean nothing is bothering her.",

            "When my SO and I moved in together we would get into fights all the time, solely because of cooking.  We talked it out and basically realized that when one of us is cooking, the other needs to not be there trying to help.  The attempt to help ALWAYS just created strife.  We will occasionally wash something or chop something (with VERY clear instructions) for the other but that is it.  Any more and we end up getting upset at each other.  It's a bit hard to just let the other person do all the work but it results in a happier attitude around the house.\n\nThis also went both ways.  We both would regularly (once or twice a month) attempt pretty elaborate meals and the other person helping would leave us both angry and upset.\n\nNot really sure how much help that is, but it's what we had to do and it helped us.  It also cut down the elaborate meals to the weekend because, when it is only one of us, the prep time can take hours and nobody has time for that during the week.",
            "As someone who hated cooking before the pandemic and has now gotten really into, let me offer my thinking on it because it may be similar for your partner.\n\nI have depression as well as PTSD. When things are out of my control, that\u2019s when my symptoms get worse. Cooking is one of those activities that offers an abundance of control. You pick the ingredients when you shop. You choose what to put in. The whole process is one of control and choice. It\u2019s a reasonable response to a time where we are entirely not in control of this pandemic. I suspect that\u2019s why a lot of people are cleaning too. Cleaning is control. You form your environment to your will.\n\nWatching tv or any other sedentary activities right now do not balance out that lack of control because they\u2019re passive activities. For me, they\u2019ve been causing a lot of anxiety because I\u2019m not actively in control of a tv plot. The best I can do is change the channel or shut it off. \n\nI think what she needs right now is a sense of control. Her need for it to come out perfectly is in response to needing that control. When you are in the kitchen (not condoning this part btw) you are in her realm of control. When you don\u2019t perform to her expectations, she\u2019s again reminded that she is not in control and it causes anxiety which comes out as irritability and anger.\n\nWhat helped me stop being so snappy with people is to recognize my actions were an attempt at control (I\u2019ve had to learn there are good and bad ways to achieve this). Once you become aware of where an action is coming from, you can begin to understand how its affecting you and respond to you actions knowledgeably. You can question yourself. Is my desire for control getting out of hand? Why am I snapping at him/her? Am I scared? How can I deal with that more effectively? \n\nIt takes a lot of time to do that. I was hospitalized in fall of 2018 and its taken me until a few months ago to start recognizing my patterns of action/thinking and be able to question them. So be patient, but keep sticking your boundaries because it actually helps her see when she\u2019s acting disagreeably. Make sure to talk with her after to tell her what she exactly did/said to cause  you to leave because she might not remember in the \u201cheat\u201d of the moment. \n\nIf cooking turns out to be an activity she can\u2019t exert that need for control in healthy way, she might have to change activities. Maybe cleaning/redecorating or exercising.",
            "I just wanted to pipe in regarding her getting snappy in the kitchen.  I\u2019ve been married for 15 years and my husband get snappy when cooking elaborate meals as well. Most of it is because he gets stressed when there is a lot of time sensitive things to take care of a LOT of multi tasking, especially since he does zero prep beforehand which puts him in a tough spot and high levels of stress.  One thing I did that helped was record the conversation without her knowledge.  We have a camera in our kitchen so it was pretty easy for me to just turn it on to record the convo, which I later showed him once everything had calmed down.  I did this to show him how the things he says and the way he says them is rude, and snappy.   He was able think a lot more rationally once he was no longer in that super stressful situation.  \n\nWhether you should do something similar with your fianc\u00e9e and whether she will take it well and be receptive is up to you and your knowledge of her. \n\nI sincerely hope you guys can work things out.",

You are complaining about not having time with her, and also her being upset about you not helping with cooking. \n\nWhy don't you just sit at the table, and chop up some vegetables or just even hang out while she is cooking? Why is that so hard?\n\nI hate cooking, my husband cooks every night, when I come home from work (60+ hours a week) I catch up with him and spend time with him by just being in the kitchen with him. It doesn't matter what I'm doing - sometimes I'll chop, sometimes I'll have my son on my lap, sometimes I'll even set up my laptop and work while he is cooking. The point is, we're doing it together. \n\nDoes she participate in your hobbies? Like you mentioned video games - was that a hobby of hers before, or did she start doing it to spend time with you?\n\nYour complaints seem incredibly petty considering it would only take a small change in your life in order to solve those problems and accommodate her.",

            "She's suffering from issues related to the uncertainty of the future and reminder of the fragility of the normal life she had. Taking it out on her partner is unacceptable. She has to make the decision to resolve her issues because it sounds a lot like depression.",

Give her more time. \n\nHer snapping at you while trying to fry two things at once sounds like she got frustrated and took it out at you. Her frustrated could be rooted in not being good at her hobby yet, or with the current state of the world, or anything else.

I\u2019m glad you are seeking a counselor though because this is absolutely something you two can work through.\n\nGive her some space in the kitchen while she figures this out (your proposed plan sounds good) and don\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t want to do.",
            "It's promising that she responded well to the talk and you guys had a bigger picture conversation and her depression about the pandemic etc has been raised. I suggest getting her a gift card for a few sessions at Better Help or Talkspace so she can work with someone on those stresses specifically, you cannot be her therapist, and even just having a few sessions to safely and freely vent about a stress like that can really help. It sounds like that could be more a pressure for her than you may realize.\n\nGOOD on you for holding to your boundary. Did you try and remind her about your agreement before you walked out? \"Honey, we agreed, no snapping in the kitchen, lets take a couple of deep breaths and remember we love each other\" - remember that this is a new habit she needs to train into, it's ok to gently coach her. If she responds badly, or continues snapping, then by all means hold to your boundary and walk out. But a slightly gentler approach to putting it down may help.\n\nWith my SO and I, when we were retraining some bad habits about taking stress out on each other, reminding each other \"HEY, I love you, you love me, lets be loving in how we talk\" really helped. And doing in lovingly and playfully, not in a chiding kind of way. Or interrupting snapping with \"Hey, I need a hug right now please\", the physical contact helps to ground and reduce stress, so use hugs as medicine. It's scientifically proven to work.\n\nComing back to the LOVE between you again and again is what will really help with getting through this period of retraining and dealing with stress. It's hard to be reminded you're being a jerk, even if it's true, so that's probably why she got salty. It's not easy as an adult to feel like you're being punished, and that may be why she got icy... no matter how right your boundary holding is. Maybe bring some love and gentleness back into that re-training, it might be good for you both.\n\nGood on you for looking into couples counselling, that will help as well I'm sure. Keep up the good work of communicating and loving each other. Because really that is what counts.",
            "Dang, I was hoping it went better than it did. Ultimately, you did the right thing. You found a neutral time to talk about your issues, you communicated as a team, and you stuck to your word when she got snappy. I don't think the cooking is the problem, I think her respect for you and coping skills are. It's fine and dandy that she's passionate about cooking, it is not okay for her to take her stress out on you, especially when she's the one who chose to make something complicated.\n\nAs hard as it might be, continue walking away and disengaging if she gets rude. And good for you for looking up counselors. I think counseling helps everyone, if for no other reason than you have a neutral third party to facilitate healthy dialogue. Good luck, I wish you both all the best.",
            "I think you sound like a really good person and you have touched on something really important the pandemic. It has changed us so much, its is frightening and many of us are struggling with anxiety. I think the cooking is a control thing, in a world of chaos she is feeling more controlled by having control over the food. She is providing for you both and seeking distraction. She may need medication for the depression. If you look at the internet/social media people have become fixated on banana bread and sourdough bread. Many people are cooking who dont normally cook. Others are obessively decluttering/sorting larders I think we are seeking some distraction far more deeply than the usual tv binge. Most people your age are not familiar with widespread illness that we older people grew up with. We are cut of from family and learning to live very limited lives. I am considered very vulnerable and l became overwhelmed with fear l might get sick and terrified by the strangeness of it all. Be patient and tell her you love her. I wish you all the best",
            "I'm not super surprised by the update regarding depression. I also love cooking and actively pursue it as a hobby. That said, the times in my life where I have spent the most hours on it also directly correspond to times when I was depressed or stressed and was using it as unhealthy escapism. There's a reason 'procrastibaking' has become a term. \n\nYour wife should check out blogs like Lady and Pups - it's a food blog where she actively talks about this and how food relates to her life situation, in a fun way. \n\nIt's good your wife is aware of it, because it can really affect your relationship with eating in a negative way. It got to the point for me where I realised I wasn't even enjoying eating my own food - in fact I barely registered I was eating at all. So much focus was put on other people's appreciation of it and how tired I was afterwards. Washing the dishes is not nearly as good for escapism - it leaves you too alone with your thoughts when you're already tired from cooking.\n\nIn my case, I put on a lot of weight because time consuming recipes are usually not healthy eating options - they're usually meals eaten once a year or on special days like large family gatherings.\n\nIt might also be good for her to talk to a therapist about it/her depression, on her own, if she's feeling trapped and down. My therapist helped me realise I wasn't really enjoying cooking as much as I thought. I put way too much pressure on the people eating my food to appreciate it, because I wasn't taking care of my own mental wellbeing. It was way easier to push that maintenance onto other people, but ultimately it meant I took any lack of appreciation extremely personally.\n\nI'm not saying any of this applies to your wife, but if she herself says she feels depressed and it's affecting your relationship, I think you made a good call with the counselling. The counselor may recommend single sessions as well, for things like this.",

Honestly, you should stop trying to appease her.  There is something really wrong here and it's not you.\n\nCounseling sounds like a good idea.\n\nThis has gone beyond a difference in priorities, honest misunderstandings or a minor bump.  For some reason she feels like she's entitled to treat you with disrespect.  She also feels entitled to make agreements in bad faith to fob you off.  This will kill the relationship if she can't put the work in to change.\n\nOP, proceed carefully.",

            "I didn't read your first post but I LOVE to cook. I enjoy cooking everything from 4 course themed meals to simple/easy week night meals. Cooking for me is a huge stress relief and I get to add some artistic flair. I live for seeing people enjoying my meals. \n\nThat all being said, I prefer to do the actual cooking myself. Most home kitchens aren't set up for 2 chefs or even two people in them. On top of that, cooking isnt always following a recipe to a tee. Sometimes I realize I need to add something not listed or it's going faster than I expected and I need whatever you're cutting up now. And being a leftie doesn't help anything since my kitchen is set up for a leftie and most everyone else is right handed. \n\nIt took me at least 2 years of cooking with roommates to realize that I needed to fly solo in the kitchen. It also made me realize what I want in the kitchen is company but not help. Now when I'm cooking and there's someone else there, I ask them to make themselves a drink and to sit at the table/counter and talk to me. They feel useful because I can ask them to do something if I need it (get me a drink, or grab something from the pantry, etc.) And I get the company and socialization that I want. \n\nIf someone is really insistent on helping, I ask them to set the table or help with the dishes afterwards. \n\nIf cooking is a new hobby, your fiancee is probably still learning how SHE wants to cook and what works for her. Cooking with a sous chef (forced or otherwise) is a whole different ball game. A lot of shows/movies portray cooking together as this wonderful romantic thing. And I wonder if she wants that feeling. But in my experience, reality falls short of the movies. \n\nI think you have a good start with simpler meals on week nights and more elaborate ones on the weekend. And it's probably worth trying having you hang out near the kitchen but out of her way.",

That\u2019s the first thing they teach on \u201cWorst Cooks in America\u201d, as an example. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this comment is helpful at all, but if you prep everything first and have the ingredients ready to go, you don\u2019t have to juggle chopping and cooking at the same time, and it just goes so much smoother. It\u2019s a time management issue, more than anything, and has done wonders for me in making my cooking time organized and easy to clean.",

I've been cooking as a hobby for almost 15 years, and it's just this last year that I can have 3 things going at once and not be stressed about it all.\n\nAgain, +1 for Blue Apron or similar. They're complex seeming meals, but with lots of the tedium done so you can focus on technique.",
            "So less than 2 or 3 hours after she told you she'll change , she didn't change.  Good for you about leaving her in the kitchen, based on her actions and your reaction.  I think the bad part is it seems she knows why you left, and she hasn't even apologized for regressing after she said she would not snap at you.\n\nIt means that she doesn't really think her snapping at you is an issue she should be guilty about.",

Eating out can get expensive, and cooking these elaborate meals may be an attempt to show you both can get a similar experience at home and saving money."

And I always honor those - I still would today, because they have been really good to us.  But for friends, if it takes more than a few minutes of explaining, I pass.  I used to help, but after spending a few hours doing legal work for a buddy of mine who was going to pay with \"a couple pizzas\" he showed up with an individual lunch pizza and a salad from his work.  I knew people who work there and it was clearly his free employee meal for the day.  I get that he was hard-up, but paying for what would have cost any actual client about $600 with a free mini pizza isn't going to cut it for me.\n\nSo I tried a system with limited results - the whole payment in kind/barter angle.  I had one client that worked out for, and that guy ran a small remodeling business and so had no problem providing some free labor at my house that had a value equal to the legal work.  But otherwise I'd ask people to come by and maybe they could do some yardwork or housework while I worked on their stuff, and it actually offended a couple of people.  Even after I explained that what I asked them to do was just stuff I would have to do anyway, like vacuum and do some dishes, and that by donating my time to them I wouldn't have time to do that stuff.  And it's not like I asked them to do really dirty jobs like cleaning out the gutters.  But it did kind of stop things for a while.\n\nEDIT:  if anyone is still paying attention to this, I did want to point out that I regularly do pro bono work, but I save that for nonprofits and sometimes individuals who are truly destitute.

For one thing, it's the principle.  For another, if you give in once, they'll expect you to keep on doing it forever.  \n\n> do I just have to accept that some of my family sucks and move on?   \n\n\nSadly, yes.  But look on the bright side -- sometimes these entitled, selfish people are doing you a favor by taking themselves out of your life. ",
            "So, two ways forward.\n\nIf this is a hill you're willing to die on (and I have to admit its one I might be), hold your ground. I would probably obliquely point out the dozens of hours of free professional labour you are probably *not* receiving from them. I would probably also make a point of being a bit hurt and confused to those on the fence at their reaction after having donated so much of your time in the past.\n\nThat would probably be my choice, especially if it's mainly the Aunt taking it personally. It's possible some of the other reactions are a response to her shovelling some shit on the family gossip line, and that's something you can probably kill with a little targeted kindness.\n\nAlternatively, if your extended family has a strong tradition of banding together (Uncle helps fix the car, cousin helped move, fix your plumbing, ~~Aunt paid you in exposure~~, etc), then it might be better to bite the bullet a little, but on your terms. Donate one Saturday morning a month or what have you to fix their stuff while you enjoy your coffee. Politely refuse the rest of the time, being apologetic but what with your schedule you just can't help right now. Oh, and did they know that Local Company/Younger Cousin offers a pretty great service if it's really critical?",
            "1.  Tell them you have to take a lot of work home now.   Sure, you can work on their stuff but it has to come after the work you are paid for now.  Might be a month until they get their phone/computere/console back?  Hard to tell.  If they want it faster, you can recommend some services that do this thing for a reasonable fee.  That's their job.\n2. See what these people do for a living.  Link the two.  \"Oh hey, cousin-who-is-an-accountant, sure I'd be happy to help with your busted motherboard.  You going to be good to help me with my taxes this weekend?  We can do both at the same time.  Fair's fair, right?\"  If not, see #1.\n3. If neither of those work and you get the snotty response of un-invitations and nasty texts, let them know that you get the message.  \"Oh thank god you only value me for free tech-support.  Here I was worried that we loved each other because we were family or something.  Now I know that you only value me for my IT expertise it is so much easier for me to understand our relationship with each other!\"",

I hated the whole thing. It\u2019s just not for me. I am terrified I\u2019m going to mess something up, I don\u2019t have the vision for beauty, etc. I kept doing their hair after I graduated because I love them and it didn\u2019t occur to me to tell them I wanted to stop. \n\nEventually one day I went through an entire haircut feeling sick to my stomach the entire time and realized... wait, I don\u2019t have to keep doing this. So I sat my family down, explained that doing people\u2019s hair made me physically sick with worry, and told them the only person\u2019s hair I was going to cut anymore was my dad\u2019s. His cut is simple and he doesn\u2019t care if it gets messed up. \n\nEveryone was bummed. My aunt and grandma were kinda pissed, but my sisters understood. My mom still gives me passive aggressive crap about it sometimes but I don\u2019t let it bother me. \n\nThat was kind of a similar situation. So my advice would be to make your decision and stick to it. Eventually people will get over it, and if they don\u2019t then don\u2019t let it bother you. It\u2019s not your problem. If you\u2019re going to stop though, just be kind and firm about it. ",

When you do encounter a problem that won't be a quick fix, let them know the required work in terms of estimated hours. Let them know that with your current workload, you don't want to get involved and add X hours on top of your already heavy workload. No one will get mad at you if they realize they're asking you to perform 8+ hours of work. What's likely happening is they're asking for guidance because they like you and know you'll help, but don't realize the amount of work it involves.

And at first I always wanted to help, because I'm a nice guy and I wanted the experience. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me things changed drastically when I opened my own shop. All the people I gave wicked discounts to I couldn't afford to anymore and I have to give them a bill. Overhead on a shop is a serious deal. I still would make it a deal for them, but not what it was before. I got a lot of backlash and some grumbling on facebook. My uncle and a few other relatives stopped bugging me for work on their car. BUT I do admit when I had to put my foot down the matter I also gained some respect from other relatives that understood. I actually lost friends over it as well, and there's a lot of people that will never understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm still in a position that I work my day job and still stay after hours to get side jobs done. Most shops the rules were you could work on immediate family vehicles for cost after hours but extended family had to pay ( possibly discounted rate). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as navigating with your family your just going to have to draw a line where you stand. You are your own person and can do as you please and are under no obligation to be their repair guy.

And not even just build the things, but front the cost of supplies and hauling, too.   \n\n\nThat is NOT ok.   \n\n\nIf your family wants your expertise in all things IT, they need to understand that it is 100% still a business transaction.

If it were for an elderly family member on a fixed income, that's where I'd make an exception for doing anyone such a favour without expecting anything in return (have to take care of our elders. I mean, unless they're just the worst people who somehow have lived that long, and people are just waiting for them to shuffle off).

They should go to bat for you and explain that you work hard, you work long hours, and she and others are just plain *using* you without regard for how tired you are mentally and/or physically from doing that same type of work throughout the day. They can explain that there is no reason why you'd think you were too good for the family, that you just need work/life balance, such as spending time *enjoying* family instead of having your time and efforts taken advantage of to fix their crap. They can tell this aunt that if she doesn't smarten up and correct her negative influence over the other family members (apologize for her behaviour towards you, admit to others that she misjudged you), then the family members who are understanding of your situation will correct things with said supporters, and she'll have lost her chance to resolve this quietly and with less embarrassment for herself.",

        "selftext": "Okay, the title does seem a little one sided. \n\nContext: My boyfriend (29m) and I (30f) have been dating since last summer. I live alone in an apartment in downtown DC and he lives alone in a house in Annapolis about 40 mins away. Pre-quarantine, we did well will splitting weekends between the two places. Once states closed for COVID, we decided it made most sense for me to temporarily move in/stay with him in the bigger space with a yard for the dogs. \n\nAs you might imagine, it\u2019s had its ups and downs. We were getting a crash course in living together in a space that wasn\u2019t really mine at all, having lots of important conversations, enjoying evenings cooking together and having wine while watching shows together. \n\nWe\u2019ve also been irritable due to drastic changes in our daily routines. I have continued to work full time from home (+ overtime due to an even busier schedule) while he is only working a half day once a week. He is bored. I am stressed with work and finding it difficult to decompress. I am used to/need quiet time to myself to recharge and he likes a noisy household (TVs always on, music on top of that, chattering constantly about sports or draft statistics or things only of interest to him). I\u2019ve tried saying \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to read\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d just like some quiet time to myself\u201d and it bugs him that I don\u2019t want to do things that he wants. I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn\u2019t fair to him. \n\nLast night he wanted to watch the NFL draft so I made plans to FaceTime my girlfriends upstairs while he did that. I am used to weekly girls nights and miss them as they\u2019re also my primary support network. I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. After FaceTiming I went down and sat on the sofa with him and said \u201chey I heard you talking to the dog, I came to hang out, how are *your team\u2019s* picks doing?\u201d. He was irritable and replied \u201cugh it was quiet until you came down\u201d. I\u2019m feeling like I can\u2019t win. \n\nAlright; getting to the point now. I hadn\u2019t been to my apartment in over 3 weeks and needed to go check on it (it\u2019s not in a building, it\u2019s in a row house) and pick up prescriptions I couldn\u2019t have transferred. We were originally going to go together but seeing this irritation with each other I suggested I\u2019d just go alone and take a night or so to myself to recharge and come back. \n\nCOVID NOTE: I do not have to interact with anyone to access my apartment. My car already had ample gas. I literally drive from his house to my street, am alone in my apartment. Any exposure to no-contact takeout I would have gotten is the same as if I were there with him. \n\nThis morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn\u2019t want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me. \n\nReddit, I just wanted to read in silence, get my medications (anxiety pills), water my plants, sleep in my own bed alone for a night, watch my own trashy TV shows without interruption. And now I think my relationship is over? I\u2019m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up. \n\nTLDR; boyfriend said if I wanted a night alone I should just take all my stuff from his house and continue to stay alone through the rest of quarantine (no added exposure risk). I\u2019m confused with his all-or-nothing approach. \n\nSo, what do I do from here?\n\nEDIT: wow, this post blew up. THANK YOU for such thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary. I\u2019ve felt really supported and \u201cseen\u201d by a lot of these replies. \nI\u2019m still reading through and responding to comments but wanted to provide a quick update re: some things I keep seeing pop up. \n\nI am home in my own apartment, alone. He has not contacted me. I spent yesterday drinking wine, cooking, listening to music softly, FaceTiming girlfriends, caring for my plants, and reading a good book. (And checking reddit of course). I am not crying or sad. I feel comfortable and at ease in my space again. \n\nWhile bf is not working, he is still being paid his full salary. \n\nWhile I am currently working a lot, I normally have a much healthier work-life balance. Some big deadlines happened to coincide with and be exacerbated by the pandemic. it\u2019s only temporary (a few weeks of hellish hustle). I was very clear with my boyfriend before this upswing started, and let him know I was going to be a lot busier and would appreciate his support extra for a couple of weeks until things settled down again. \n\nMany of you have brought up quality time. I have attempted to express my desire for quality time to him. Things as blunt as \u201clet\u2019s hang out together tonight, what should we do?\u201d Or \u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of coexisting, let\u2019s plan to do something together more like quality time.\u201d Perhaps I wasn\u2019t resonating with his communication style. Sometimes it would work and we\u2019d have a nice dinner and watch a show together etc. and other times it would end in frustration and not go anywhere. \n\nIn regards to the mattress thing, I am hearing all your replies about how it just wasn\u2019t important to him so he didn\u2019t want to compromise. It took my having a very dramatic hysterical emotional breakdown after nights of no sleep for him to realize how important it was we find a solution. That breakdown was loud and ugly on my part and not a moment I am proud of. It came after numerous \u201cI\u2019m really not sleeping well, I need more sleep than you do, can we work something out so I\u2019m more comfortable\u201d conversations. \n\nI am in therapy and understand I am a highly flawed human with dramatic emotional tendencies as well. I do not always communicate well. I consider myself very self-aware and make concerted efforts to require my default actions to create a better life for myself and my loved ones. \n\nAnd, finally, you are all not wrong that I have a low bar for thoughtfulness. It\u2019s not really something I\u2019ve ever experienced in a relationship.",

            "Sounds like spending time apart is not the worst idea, go home and decompress and let him reach out.",
            "I'm very sorry you're dealing with this relationship stress at an already stressful time. To me it sounds like once you moved in together, you found that you had very different needs around space. This kind of thing isn't irreconcilable, but your boyfriend seems to be experiencing your need for alone time as a personal rejection, and his response has been somewhat reactive. Perhaps he is acting up because of covid anxieties, something you mentioned at the start of your post; but it's mildly concerning that he doesn't seem to handle your setting boundaries well. So it's up to you to decide if this is unusual behavior for him, or whether there have been other warning signs that you've overlooked. From there, I think that if you are interested in continuing the relationship, you'll need to have a talk with him about this behavior, because left unchecked it becomes not okay.",
            "I'm sorry you're dealing with this mid-pandemic. You've gotten some amazing responses, and lagomorpheme's stood out to me.\n\nI'm chiming in to highlight that **the primary issues stem less from his personal preferences and more from his responses to the fact that you have different preferences.** You're both allowed to like louder/quieter environments, more/less solo time, etc. There's nothing wrong with what he likes. There's everything wrong with how he reacts to you being a real person with individual needs and wants.\n\nYou're mature enough and compassionate enough to make compromises and meet him halfway. For example, rather than just disappearing, you actually tell him explicitly when you need to recharge. You don't expect him to read your mind. After you heard him complaining about you (knowing that you would overhear), you went to keep him company rather than getting upset with his passive-aggression. Even though it's a difficult time, you're still trying really hard to be a good partner.\n\nHis reactions to your reasonable boundary setting and your discomfort is to complain about you, snap at and insult you, and threaten to dissolve the relationship. Notice that even though he said you shouldn't bother coming back, *he was actually too immature and too cowardly to say clearly and decisively that you are, in fact, broken up.* So, not only are you upset, but you're also confused about whether you're still even in the relationship. I know you said below you're going to take some time and just wait for him to reach out. You may want to reconsider. It says a lot about his character and the depth of your relationship that he would ambiguously and impulsively \"break up\" with you.\n\nThe reason why you're feeling like you can't win is because he's setting it up that way. Yes, it's possible or even likely that there's some deep, complex narrative around why he does the things he does. But if he doesn't already:\n\n**1)** acknowledge that he has issues he'd like to work through (like we all do) and \n\n**2)** commit to changing (not for you, but for himself) by seeking outside help\n\nthen I wouldn't personally stick around to dig into it. **A partner is not a parent. A partner is not a therapist.** A partner is also not a wastebasket for you to throw in every single thought you've ever had. He's annoyed that you don't want to be talked at while reading, which is a strange form of entitlement. You talk with your friends; it would help if he talked with his. \n\nI respect whatever choice you make, because you're the only one who has to live with it. That said, your responses, especially to off\\_brand\\_gobshite, indicate that having him in your life doesn't significantly improve it, that you're afraid you'll end up alone and thus make decisions based on that fear, and that your bar for romantic partners is low.\n\nLife is always hard, and things are harder for everyone right now. You deserve someone who not only loves you, but who respects, admires, and LIKES you, and whose words and actions reflect that every day. It doesn't mean you won't ever argue. It just means that it'll be you two against the problem rather than you against him or him against you. Good luck with everything.",
            "You're lucky to witness this now what it's fairly soon rather years into a relationship, or marriage. I get that we live in a very uncertain society, full of anxiety. But clearly doesn't even try to sympathise or even try to respect your wishes. \n\nDo you really want to continue a relationship with a person that doesn't even try to understand your position, and instead of.. communicating, bags all your things over to your car, especially in the middle of a pandemic?\n\nYou're lucky to see this kind of behaviour now. I'm sorry!",
            "I\u2019m sorry, just reading this sounded incredibly draining. I really resonate with all you wrote and feel pretty similar in terms of how much time I need with close friends, my boyfriend, and alone. And I personally couldn\u2019t date someone that wouldn\u2019t let me balance all of that. Maybe you could take a break and then try again when \u2018Rona passes?",
            "You go home, work from home, and in a day or so contact him and have a calm conversation.\n\nYou figure out if you guys can work it out or not. You've also discovered that living together, at least for the foreseeable future, is not going to be...conducive to your relationship. \n\nHe seems....clingy, to be honest.  I couldn't live with someone like that - where you can't even have an hour to yourself without them demanding your attention.",
            ">I\u2019m feeling frustrated that I attempted to handle this in a productive and proactive way and somehow screwed up.\n\nYou didn't screw up. Your boyfriend threw a tantrum. Honestly, take him at his word and don't beg him to reconsider. You've been dating less than a year and now you've met the \"real\" him. Yes, it's an unusual situation. But people face a lot of stressful, shitty situations - and now you know how he reacts to them.",
            "My ex gf was/is a lot like you (we ended due to long distance). I\u2019m an ambivert I can be around people and there\u2019s times I want to be left alone. But I had to adjust to her wanting alone time. Not saying I crowded her, but I did have to adjust. \n\nMy first relationship my ex cheated on me. I\u2019m also in school to be a therapist so I pick up on everything and was prone to over think everything. I really started listening to her and realized her alone time wasn\u2019t a personal attack. She still loved me, liked being around me etc, but she needed time to herself. I also found that useful because I would do extra school work or do an extra workout with her focusing on her own time. \n\nWhen I was using that time to be productive we both came back recharged and happy. It\u2019s not your responsibility to help him grow emotionally. But if you\u2019re feeling up to it, it would be worth saying \u201cit\u2019s not a personal attack you. I still care for you, love you etc. but I need this time to recharge and do some of things I need to do. Not only for work so that I can be there to have a healthy relationship with you.\u201d If he can\u2019t understand that, that\u2019s on him you\u2019ve gone above and beyond",

            "Honestly, I would cut your losses. It sounds to me like hes bored of you or tired of putting in real work for a relationship. Let him be alone if he has such a problem making any adjustments for someone he cares about.",
            "I'm sorry you're going through that especially during this pandemic. I see how it seems like no matter what you do, you're in the wrong. It sounds like he has some serious insecurity issue and needs your attention constantly for his own reassurance. It sounds selfish on his part. Speaking from experience, it only gets worse. Stay away for now and do whatever you need for your well being. I also have anxiety and know how important it is to have those comforts, like a quiet place, to recharge. Best of luck to you.",
            "This would drive me bonkers too.  It's the inability to talk about it that's a bit concerning.",
            "Girl you didn't screw it up. It seems as though maybe you are a bit more introverted and whereas he wants to hangout all the time. The issue is not that, but that for whatever reason he takes offence to you needing alone time. He seems immature and very irratable which don't really see a reason for him to be since he isn't working.\n\n\nI am verrrry introverted, and while I love spending time with my bf who is currently staying with me, I need my alone time now more then ever. So i've been doing workouts, walking my dog etc by myself and he likes it so he can do his own thing. If he was not ok with that it would be over for me.\n\nHe's expressed that your alone time doesn't matter to him by kicking you out and wanting to \"take a break\" until after Covoid. Immature and has kinda a hot temper. No thanks!",
            "Think about how you felt when you got home. It will tell you everything. \n\nA BF was staying with me temporarily once & when he left, it felt like a weight had lifted. While in the middle of I didn\u2019t even notice how his presence was affecting me, weighting me down (although apparently others did). I felt AMAZING the day I came home to my empty quite apartment. I knew in that moment we had no future because I couldn\u2019t go back to that feeling when I was with him.",
            "I am actually in a similar boat than you. Only, my bf shares the house with 2 other people and due to lock down, one of the others gf is also here. So we are 5 and then our dog. Our lockdown was going to be 3 weeks, then turned into 5. It 'ends' Friday and all I want to do is go back to my place and just have some personal space and alone and quiet time. When i mentioned earlier that I was planning on going home on Friday, he was kinda upset. But, he knows how frustrated and irritable I have been with having to share space all the time. So I get you and I understand your need. This lockdown sucks! But I hope for you two that when the stress is gone after covid you guys will be able to figure this out. I can't imagine being together and work stress making it easy. Good luck!",
            "Honestly, I know this hurts, but I feel like you dodged a bullet. Take time for yourself that you need.",
            "So your boyfriend expected that you'd take care of all his emotional needs when you moved in.  That means constantly being there for his socialising and entertaining needs.  It's a personality flaw and an indication of immaturity that he's reaction to you being an autonomous adult who can't manage his wants all the time was an ultimatum.  Plus of course the passive aggressive behavior is deeply unattractive. \n\nStay in your own apartment OP,  de-stress and reevaluate what you now know your boyfriend is truly like. In your shoes I'd be glad that it's over and when he inevitably calls to try to make up I'd hang up.",
            "Oh man, this sounds horrible. \n\nI will say as someone who went through something similar in my early twenties - this all or nothing, multiple break ups...it isn't worth it. Someone who can't seem to separate your needs, is passive aggressive, and controlling to the point where the escort you out to your car after bagging your things for you and tells you that you'll date AFTER covid....is not a person you want to date. Your BF or whatever he is seriously needs to work on himself. \n\nHe is also testing the waters here. If he can kick you out - among the various other issues you barely touched on - and you'll come back he will then know he can really break you down. I say, take him at his word. \n\nPeople who really want to be with their SO would NEVER do what your BF did. They would be terrified of losing you forever and also, it's SO hurtful. Incredibly selfish, destructive and immature. For me, it's a huge red flag and I would just go home and not come back. Take the out he's given you and move on. \n\nIf you aren't sure, then go radio silent for a few weeks and re-evaluate how you feel after being away 100% from his influence.",
            "He's constantly prodding at your boundaries, creating conflict and when you're trying to do something for yourself, he overreacts...sounds like all the red flags you'd ever need to get out of it. Think about this; regardless of the pandemic, he's always going to be like this. He'll constantly seed conflict, poke and prod at you, until you either acquiesce or until he drives you away. It's almost like a 'test' to him from the sounds of it, and having any personal autonomy at all is 'failure' in his eyes.",

            "Speaking as someone who tends to react like your boyfriend, he needs to respect your need for personal space. You are a) very stressed from work and b) in a completely new environment. He may be latching on to you because he's bored and needs extra social contact. However, he needs to find that social contact with other people in addition to you, so you are not his only social support during this time. Nta\n\nP.s. he needs to work on having such a severe reaction to a reasonable request",

(Now, on the playoff games, I would make all sorts of snacks, make sure he had the booze he liked, etc. I went all out, even if it was just us two).\n\nNeedless to say, he also didn't like when I went out with my best friend, and she wasn't allowed to come to the apartment - MY APARTMENT where he had moved into - the entire time I was with him.\n\nSo my question is, before quarantine, were there any red flags that were concerning?",
            "He's a narcissist. Get out and stay out and be glad he let you. Speaking from experience.",
            "Honestly he sounds like a nightmare to live with, to me. I'd have gone back to my place after the first week. Not just for his choices of entertainment, but the petulant passive aggressiveness would have seen me out the door.\n\nYou live together all the time and you can't take a minute to talk to your friends while he's busy doing stuff that doesn't interest you? What about what YOU want and like?",
            ">And now I think my relationship is over?\n\nI hope so.  It sounds like he did you a favor - at 29 if he still acts like a child that needs constant attention, then you need to assess if that is the life you want to live.\n\nIf he wants to spend time with you then he can join you in girl talk, not watching the draft.  If you ask him to quite down the house, then he should.\n\nYou going by your house for the night is a bit much, I'll admit.  But if you can't get peace and happiness in the house with him now, then you won't later.  \n\nSo move on, don't look back unless major changes happen.",
            "The times we are going through are definitely affecting your relationship, and trust me it's not new. I'm sorry you feel so frustrated, and I know the feeling. He's probably feeling hurt and rejected, which hampers his ability to communicate or work things out.\n\nIf you believe in it still, the challenge is getting him to understand, without him thinking you don't like him or want him around. Tough challenge but definitely doable if you still have stakes in it. Hang in there, there are brighter days ahead.",
            "As you said, you got a crash in living with him and it's not working, if it's already difficult it won't get better after 5 or 10 years together,  sorry.\n\nI'm in a similar situation, got a new gf in November, we  are spending the quarantine in her apartment. We both lost our jobs due to Covid19 so were litterally hanging out 24/7 since mid march now but things are going great, no fighting at all. If we were irritating each other and fighting semi regularly already we'd just break up. A new relationship not even past 1 year should be EASY.",
            "Fellow introvert here who very much understands the recharge thing... you can absolutely find a man who is considerate and understanding of your need for space. I was worried about living with my not-very-longtime boyfriend during this, but he's been a gem. He leaves me alone when I ask and without complaint, and he's even snuck in some alone time for me without me even asking (leaving me alone in the kitchen to cook/clean, or making dinner for us so I can hang out elsewhere in the apartment, for example) and it's been such a relief.

I don\u2019t know how much clearer the signs can be: he\u2019s not mature enough to be in a relationship and wants your focus to always be on him.\n\nDo not contact him. Let him reach out to you.

I wish I had helpful words but it\u2019s been hard for our relationship in a very similar way, I feel much like your boyfriend does. Possibly he doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re expressing love like you did before this started, he is frustrated about not working as well I\u2019m sure. He might be lashing out to see that you care, he might feel that these new boundaries mean you don\u2019t care. Dating before moving in together, you guys planned to hangout so you\u2019re both the center of attention, but dating after, you have to deal with the fact that you have different needs for recharging your energy. This pandemic is isolating, disruptive, stressful, scary, and very abnormal. I would say that if you want a future with him, you should reaffirm your feelings for him and be very clear about boundaries. A boundary like, during work hours, I don\u2019t want to hangout but we can have lunch together.

Getting prescriptions and checking on your house are absolutely totally reasonable things to do. If he wanted to be right you, he could have asked to come along. The only way soul can make him happy is to do exactly what he wanders and when he wants it. And also trust me here, if you do they get will change the rules so they you are still wrong.

            "Right before the pandemic, I moved in with my boyfriend - it was literally three days before our government started advising social distancing and a week before his work shut down. I completely understand couples navigating togetherness during this quarantine.\n\nLike you, I need time to recharge my batteries or I get short-tempered. My boyfriend is an affectionate chatterbox. I let him know when I need quiet time, and he goes into the other room to play games. I also have mental health issues, so when I'm not feeling like myself, I tell him and he is very attentive.\n\nIt's confusing to me that your boyfriend is offended by your habits. It sounds like you've been clear by telling him exactly when you need alone time and why, and yet it doesn't seem to matter to him.\n\nIn my opinion, he feels cooped up in a new living situation but isn't as in tune with his feelings as you are. What I mean is that you know when you're starting to feel uneasy/stressed, you know why, and you know how to handle it. Maybe he feels cooped up in a new living situation but doesn't know how to handle feelings of loneliness/frustration when you spend time away from him. And it ended up blowing out of proportion when it didn't have to.\n\nSome time apart for self-reflection sounds like a good thing for both of you. I wouldn't immediately think that the relationship is over, because he could apologize, so feel free to keep that door open. But **in the end, he does need to respect your needs.** If he wants you to constantly hang around with him and listen to him talk about things you aren't interested in, then he might as well have a mannequin sit next to him.\n\nEnjoy your wine tonight, and I hope things work out for you :)",

His comment about it being quieter before you came to sit by him and that you should stay home is him lashing out, and while it\u2019s not ok I can somewhat understand why he might take it personally. It\u2019s also absolutely fine for you to need time to yourself to relax and de-stress, as long as you are still finding time to nourish your relationship too. If that\u2019s not a priority to you (and it seems like it is to him) then perhaps you\u2019re not suited as a couple, and that\u2019s nobodies fault per se. \nSee if you can have a proper chat and see if you can align your perspectives.

            "Hey OP! So my initial thoughts here are that it sounds like your SO could possibly be feeling like whatever free time you have you just want to spend alone. Disclaimer: I obviously do not know you, or your relationship personally, I am simply trying to understand a root cause behind his reaction to your very reasonable need for alone time. \n\nI obviously do not know the specifics of your situation, however my initial thoughts are that there could be a healthy amount of compromise here. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel, when living with an SO, that you\u2019re spending time with them just by being there. However that is not the case. Just by living in the same house does not show that you are (necessarily) valuing their time or showing them that you want to be spending time with them. \n\nAlone time is extremely important. But quality time can be equally important for your partner. It could possibly help balance out the fact that you\u2019re in need of personal time when your partner feels like you do already set aside time for just them. \n\nSet aside an evening just to have a night where you cook something together and just do a movie, and then when you take time for yourself it might not seem as bad because you\u2019ve already shown your partner that you value their time and WANT to spend time with them. \n\nYour partner should respect your need for personal time always! Even if they don\u2019t necessarily understand it. My initial thoughts without knowing you or your relationship personally, are just that it\u2019s possible your SO might be feeling this way if there hasn\u2019t been much time for you two to just spend quality time together, if you separate yourself when you do have some free time.",

            "Honestly, while it sounds like a good idea at the time to quarantine together (you figure, we are together so much anyways), actually what you are doing is two things at once:\n\nOne, you are taking a big step in the relationship that you might not otherwise have been ready to take. Because you are still learning to compromise on things like eating habits and sleep times and how often you do separate things. Forcing it to happen for non organic reasons means it can be too much togetherness too soon. Which is ok. Having separate apartments even if you stayed together most nights gives you a space apart which doesn\u2019t hold true if you are quarantined together. So perhaps you are fundamentally incompatible and perhaps you are just not there yet.\n\nSecond, you are doing it at a time that causes immense stress to everyone. You end up overworking. He ends up underworking. None of your usual coping strategies - going out, weekend activities, seeing friends, whatever it is you do - are available to you. I mean everyone is apparently learning to bake bread and trying to do home workouts or just cope, but it\u2019s not so easy or straightforward for everyone to find an equilibrium. You are stressed and need to decompress, he\u2019s bored and looking forward to you to hang out with him when you\u2019re done working. Neither of you are wrong for wanting what you are wanting. The internet is full of stories of people doing crazy stuff or becoming alcoholics or playing video games for 20 hours at a time. So you both should cut yourselves some slack and not expect a perfect response to the stressors of life under COVID plus being around the same person (and only that person) for months.\n\nGo home, spend some time apart, have a conversation when you have both calmed down and focus on the feelings you were both trying to express and not the miscommunication that led to the fight. If you care about each other, you\u2019ll want to work it out. Maybe it involves some time apart here or there. Maybe he also needs more entertainment that\u2019s not you. Maybe you need better ways of switching off after work so you can spend quality time with him when you aren\u2019t working. \n\nGood luck, and be kind to yourselves.",

When one of us needs that, we respect it and make it happen. No one gets their feelings hurt because it has nothing to do with the other person. Personally, I need my own time and so does he. \n\nSecond, you can\u2019t win. You don\u2019t hang out and he gets mad. You do hang out and you\u2019re annoying him. You need to talk and discuss what he wants. \n\nI think it can work out if you just communicate.

We\u2019re both used to our respective alone time and adjusting to being home 24/7 has been really difficult for both of us. We\u2019re both pretty solitary creatures though so at least it\u2019s easy to say \u201cI\u2019m going to go read in the bedroom\u201d and the other knows that means \u201cI just need to be alone\u201d.\n\nIf your SO can\u2019t understand that your needing your \u2018me\u2019 time isn\u2019t about not wanting to spend time with him, if that\u2019s something you explained to him, maybe he just doesn\u2019t get you.

The constant need to spend time together could be because you are his only social outlet and he's craving that right now. \n\nIs he doing Skype or FaceTime calls with friends and family, or planning activities with his friends remotely? If not you may want to encourage him to do so, or do it more frequently. Being out of work+pandemic is a lot. \n\nI definitely wouldn't blame you for walking away, but I also think that people should be cautious about making big decisions during this time.

Sometimes I go up and snuggle next to him, and sometimes he comes down and cuddles with me. This arrangement had helped us so much.

That was my normal daily routine for the last 10 years before being laid off 2 months ago. (But I did work in a public office setting) BY NO MEANS do I believe that you are in the wrong and I believe you were being mature and knowing your limits & standing up for your own sanity. You were trying to avoid a foreseeable argument with 2 upset, confined, world's turned on their heads fight! It's hitting us all! You are not alone! Already a self diagnosed germaphobe (no appt necessary, I work for the public and manners have disappeared,) this shit I'm scared to leave my home for anything! It takes me forever to do anything between mask, gloves, cleaning everything touched and then talking myself down from the panic attacks I'm having before getting out of my car. It's exhausting! Just as mentally exhausting as a work day!  So home, for the most part, I 'm putsing around doing what I want, when I want, drinking like I'm on vacation (or treating anxiety, to be determined) and it's sooo quiet. I'm loving it! I don't have to answer the phone, answer questions, thinking for my coworkers at times, solving the hundreds of issues a week and cleaning up after tornadic caty women. Then my \"essential working\"(definitely not in my opinion or his) partner comes home from work and he's silent! Doesn't want to talk or leave the couch! I understand him and why he's exhausted it's terrifying and stressful to be working and he's worried about bringing back home the virus. I guess I am being a bit selfish when I subconsciously want to throw a fit because I want to talk and have an adult conversation with a real person. Basically just vent about the idiots running us back into the line of fire in May! I want & need to talk about it, I'm imploding with all bullshit and senseless lives lost! But believe me 3 months ago all I wanted at 7pm was a glass of wine and silenc cc zzz 0ce not 1 conversation. Getting a dose of my own medicine. Possibly, his mindset(like mine right now) is nonchalant throughout the day because you are busy. And when your day comes to an end he just wants to spend time with you! He sees you all day now but he can't interact with you. It's very exciting in new relationships especially if there's some distance between homes. Men are wired much differently than you & I and so are there sex drives. Look but you can't touch. Then your craziness ends, wine needs to be drank, you need to be in a zone & that today doesn't include him. He might just feel dejected and attacked like a baby! But you can't ignore each other when you want the space like you could on your own turf before the virus. We are human and all dealing with these new times differently. Some of us are having first time fear and our own assumed reactions are much different in reality. If an open line of communication can be reached and the kinks worked out with an honest apology I would give him the benefit of the doubt. I can only assume his reactions may be different because of the added crisis. Not an excuse but maybe a forgivable situation.",

Especially the way he quickly packed up your things, like he wanted it done before you changed your mind.  \n  \nI'm not going to attack him the way most people here have (I'm not saying they're wrong).  This situation is stressful on everyone, even without one of the most stressful tests of a relationship i.e. living together.  You might have made it work in a more stable situation.  But its clearly not going to work now.  I don't think you need to reach out to him, at least until after quarantine.

He was in graduate school and I was looking for a job when we first moved so I spent a large part of the day hyping up the moment that my husband got home. It's lonely business having to entertain yourself all day and easy to hype up spending time with your partner. I would still go out to the store or for a run, I'd apply to jobs or try to call loved ones to keep myself from going crazy but at the end of the day what id look forward to the most is hanging out with my partner. On the other hand, he would be out all day at school and at work so when he got home sometimes all he wanted was alone time. It was a disconnect in needs and expectations that we did not discuss at the time and led to feelings being hurt. What I'm trying to say is - your bf may just be an ass, and his behavior might not be excusable or mature for that matter but it could be rooted in him feeling dissapointed after a day of anticipating quality time with you. Id suggest having an honest conversation about your feelings. You should explain that sometimes you need to decompress and it has nothing to do with not wanting to spend time with him. I'd even talk to him about setting a day in the week or specific  time every day where it's \"you\" time.",

He's aware he does it and is working on it, but usually when it happens he's best left to cool down a while before we talk again. That, or, depending on the situation, he'd say something like \"why don't you just leave for good then\" and I'd go \"cos that'd be silly, you'd miss me, see you tomorrow\" kiss him and go. Haha.

            "What I make of it is sometimes if you not use to being in the person's presence 24/7 it becomes overwhelming and you become irratated with each other which is a perfect example here but what I dont understand is he doesn't try to understand its like his taking his anger on you because he like yourself is use to his space, but his reaction is still not even of understanding sometimes its hard for us to for example get use to being in someones company 24/7 and that's why sometimes there's nothing wrong with giving each other space I always say there's nothing wrong with missing each other it makes the relationship stronger give yourself time away from each give yourself time to miss him and he miss you but sometimes we just need to talk it out because clearly there's alot going on and if he wants to break up he should just say but his behavior is unacceptable Noone should feel like that in a relationship at all, do what's best for you because you deserve nothing but happiness",

He is behaving like a petulant child who wants to be entertained adored and pandered to constantly, he has no concept of autonomy,  he gets passive aggressive ( talking to the dog loud enough for you to hear it) uses Emotional Blackmail to try to get his way, ( if you are going to leave me all alone to have some time to yourself then I am going to be spiteful & punish you by ending our relationship, abandoning you for no logical reason). \n\nThis is the beginning of the FOG, using Fear of abandonment , Obligation & Guilt to control you.

Unless you're both willing to reach a compromise, it won't work.\n\n>I\u2019ve tried saying \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs to read\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d just like some quiet time to myself\u201d and it bugs him that I don\u2019t want to do things that he wants.\n\nHe's acting childish. He refuses to see your perspective or try to understand how it feels to you. It's all about him and what he wants.\n\n>I find myself becoming more snappy and short-tempered from feeling constantly drained, which isn\u2019t fair to him.\n\nIt's completely fair to him. He hasn't been considerate to you, and actions have consequences.\n\n>I heard him downstairs complaining to his dog that I never want to hang out with him. [...] He was irritable and replied \u201cugh it was quiet until you came down\u201d. I\u2019m feeling like I can\u2019t win.\n\nOf course you feel that way. It's true. He won't be pleased no matter what you do. He's displaying extremely toxic behavior.\n\n>This morning, when I grabbed some necessities for a night to myself (my laptop because I have to work over the weekend, some underwear, face moisturizer) he got upset and said I might as well take all my stuff and not bother coming back. I tried to talk through why it was so all-or-nothing for him. He said I clearly didn\u2019t want to spend time with him or be around him so I can just go home for good and we can resume dating when the states open back up. He actually bagged up the remainder of my stuff and took it out to my car for me.\n\nHe's bringing it to an extreme and making it difficult for no reason. He has no interest in hearing your side or understanding how you feel. In his eyes, *it's all about him*.\n\nI would seriously reconsider this relationship. If it's this bad already, consider how it would be if you got married. It would be a thousand times worse than this. It could even develop into an abusive relationship.\n\nGet therapy, both as a couple and individually. If it still doesn't work... It'd be best to reconsider the relationship.",

            "\"It's beginning to look a lot like leave him...\"\n\nYour further comments suggest you're not upset about this potential ending. Just keep the convo civil, mature, and intelligent when it comes and remember that your feelings are valid and they matter.",
            "Sounds like he doesn't like that he can't control your time and that you are self sufficient .  Would say it's an compadibility if I'm being honest and if you can't make him happy if you stay or go because you aren't worshipping him then that's a him problem that you found out sooner",
            "This seems to be a serious case of one sided relationship, where one tries to resolve situations by communication, and the other feels justified to pout and throws tantrums. Having personal time is a need for you. Having a quiet environment is a need. Being able to resolve conflicts is a need (I presume, from the way you acted). He isn't willing to hear you out and take your needs into consideration. If he wants to be with you, he has to. You can't run after him and try to fix things, if he isn't willing to participate. Otherwise you will end up parenting him, not being in a relationship.\n\nIf it worked before, are you willing to be in a relationship where you don't ever move together? If yes, maybe it will keep on working. Not everyone has to live together, even though having a family, provided you want one, is easier that way. If that's not what you want in the long run, ask yourself some questions about boundaries.\n\nI'm not telling you to run for the hills, but to try to see the situation without fear of loss. Is what you are getting good enough for you? If not, is it likely to change?\n\nGood luck."

Hello everyone! I appreciate all the advice on my last post :) special thanks to /u/anodynic for her long piece of important advice.\n\nAnyways so it's been 10 days since my last post and about a month since my daughter has been with her boyfriend. After reading all the advice I decided I needed to support my daughter rather than be judgemental towards who she's in a relationship with. We had a talk the following day and I told her that I loved her and if she wants to date him then I am going to be a supportive father and that I shouldn't have been playing a police officer role. I told her if she needed help or had any questions or anything that I'd be there for her and she can tell me anything. She was really happy and said that she's ecstatic that I'm accepting of who she wants to date and I apologized again for jumping to conclusions earlier.\nI told her that as with every boyfriend, I'd like to meet him and get to know her new man. This time she didn't use the \"he has work\" excuse and we met the next day for dinner at a restaurant. He didn't give off an amazing vibe but he wasn't a total douche either. I guess he was a decent guy but I felt uncomfortable with how much he would touch and grab her publicly but maybe that's just me being a dad.\n\nSo anyway fast forward a few more days and this is where it goes downhill. My daughter comes home and tells me he asked her when she wants to move in with him. I was in absolute shock. She told me that she doesn't want to move in with him right now and she said \"Everything's moving too fast and I'm afraid he'll get really angry with me if I say no, but I want to live here dad\". I told her she could just say no and if he wants to be angry then so be it & that she is completely right with being concerned that it's happening quickly. She said that she was afraid he was going to hurt her if she refused to move and I just instantly bawled. It's embarrassing to look back at now because she was making me feel better instead of me being mucho dad but it was the worst thing to ever hear that my daughter was so afraid of this shit guy. I gave her a hug and told her she would be safe with me, and we just needed to figure out what we were gonna do.\n\nA few days later she decided she wanted to break up, and have me listen on speaker and talk to him if \"things got bad\". They talked at first and when she broke up with him he went all physco and told her \"you won't break up with me or I'll pinch you again babe.. And this time it'll hurt!\" I looked at her and she looked terrified so I took over and basically yelled at him really loudly (probably louder than I should have) and said \"if you haven't heard she's breaking up with you. And if you ever go near my daughter again I'm going to pinch the hell out of you!\" He just hung up :P My daughter looked at me and said \"I have never seen you so angry!\"\n\nI never thought I would be updating this but since it's been a crazy week I'll update everyone. im just happy that she's safe and well see what happens from here. Hopefully he won't continue to bother her but if he does, a restraining order is always possible. Thanks again everyone :)\n\nTldr; they broke up!\n\nEdit: HOLY SHIT this blew up!! I'm at work so I can't read or answer much of the replies but I'll get to everyone tonight hopefully! & for all those who are wondering- yes it was pinch not punch. No typo there! Thanks everyone for the support its amazing to hear! :)",

You should know that this single act will make her trust you beyond any doubt for so many years to come, although she might not say it out loud. You just showed her she's safe and loved and protected. Which at that age, is the most priceless relationship to have for a girl growing up to become a women, be it a relationship with your father or other male role model. This single act will show her what kind of qualities she'll want in the men she's dating. ",

If that dude hurt her before but she still wasn't willing to leave she has some fucked up notions of relationships.\n\nThis time she freaked out because he wanted to move in.\n\nBut at that point he was already hurting her.

It helped me get out of a bad spot, when I told my mom that I was afraid I'd be trapped in an apartment with my exSO and was starting to get scared.  Having her suddenly stop fussing and being overprotective, suddenly sounding so calm and collected but also sad, and saying \"I will never let you get trapped like that, ok...? You should never feel that way, and I will do whatever I need to to get you out of a situation where you feel like that.\"   It made me realize how serious it was, and gave me courage to end things.\n\nStop chopping onions OP.

            "Wow, this could honestly have not gone better, all things considered. Good on you for showing your daughter that you are there for her no matter what. You gave her someone she could come to when she was frightened. That's awesome parenting. \n\nMy only recommendation is that you perhaps suggest that she go to therapy. Oftentimes, people engage in abusive relationships because of underlying issues within themselves (often issues w/r/t severe insecurity/lack of self-worth). Therapy could be a great way for her to talk through this relationship with someone who is a little more impartial than dad. There are probably things she doesn't want to discuss with you because you're her father, no matter how much she loves and trusts you.",

It's also for anything, e.g., the 'pinching'. I am sure she told him not to do it, and he continued to either do it, ignore her requests, or belittled her for feeling hurt by a pinch.  \n-she needs to understand that feelings should not be invalidated in a relationship. She needs solid examples of this.  \n-teenage and early twenties is a high time for women to get exploited, because we have low self esteems and are surrounded by movie/culture where guy's possessiveness or persistence = romantic. it is not.  \n-she needs to understand this before she starts dating",

Being a 21 year old guy, through high school and early college I've seen many of my friends (that are girls) date dudes that have nearly a decade (sometimes more, sometimes less) on them. Likewise, I've never seen a single one of those relationships go well. \n\nIf you're a nearly 30 year old man, you really shouldn't have that much in common  with an 18 year old girl. I'm painting with a broad brush, I know, and I'm sure some of these relationships have worked. More often than not, though, these guys are emotionally stunted predators looking for someone to manipulate and scare into staying with them. I've seen it way too often, and more often than not these relationships are a girl's first serious attempt, they turn toxic, last much longer than they should, and leave some bad long term effects.",

Of course my ex thought himself the face of the college and showed up. My dad wanted to bring a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire (actual thing he has). I had to talk him out of it because you know...film festival, there would presumably be other people there. Didn't stop him from telling my ex to \"shut the fuck up\" while he was flapping his mouth during my thank you speech. \n\nIf you care to know, I filled the lecture hall where my film festival was held.

To her at first an older guy was interested in her. An 18 year old sometimes thinks that so cool. They are blind to the creep factor. ",
            "You're such a good dad. You realized that what you were doing before wouldn't help your daughter so you changed it and you TOLD her. If you hadn't, she might have been too scared to come to you now. I'm really proud of you. Keep a log of when he calls and what he says just in case it gets out of control, but hopefully it should be fine. You probably scared him off pretty well. Good luck to both of you!!! And good job, dad. You're ideal. ",
            "Bless you sir. You are q good dad. ",
            "I'd file a report with the police about this guy in case if he feels like \"pinching\" other daughers in the future.",
            "If more dads were like you instead of being forced to accept unacceptable shit then this world we be a better place. women would be less lost and used and abused. ultimately your father should protect you. \n\nImagine if she never told you, and moved in with him...who knows where her life would have gone...but nowhere good thats forsure.",
            "Omg you did awesome! Way to gain your daughter's trust! ",
            "You're an amazing father!!",
            "I always make sure people know this. Some areas offer protective orders, and restraining orders. If a protective order is violated, the person is immediately arrested no questions asked. Typically in areas with both law enforcement can only tell the person to leave. ",
            "I'd get a restraining order on him to be safe and to make it a point to him that this kind of shit is never ok. I hope he gets what he deserves and doesn't move on to the next victim. Actually, I strongly recommend a restraining order so police has a paper trail to help future victims because this guy will try and find more victims.",
            "Just came here to say you're an awesome dad",
            "You're a great dad.  I hope she knows how lucky she is to have you.",
            "Best dad ever!!!! Your lines on the phone made me laugh. Keep it up, your daughter is very lucky to have you. ",
            "Wow you handled that super correctly, good job super dad. Not being sarcastic. ",
            "This is terrifying. Good on you for flipping your shit on that loser. ",
            "Hey I don't really post on this subreddit all that much. But I feel the need to say something here. \n\nAs a 18yo female (almost 19) I think you \"overreacting\" at first was understandable. I couldn't read your text of the first post as its been deleted. But you being worried is not over reacting at all. People in the comments (from what I read) were doing a very good job of helping you out and letting you know that you should at least give the guy a chance. \n\nThat's exactly what you did. You gave him a chance. You met him and you let your daughter know that she could always come to you for support or if she needs help. \n\nThat was one of the most mature things you did. You gave him a chance. Once he proved who he was to you and your daughter you took no time to turn into big papa bear protecting the cubs. You stood your ground and most importantly your daughter knew she could come to you for help without fear of judgment. You helped her and overall. I think you handled the situation wonderfully. Doing it over the phone was the best call for everyone involved. It could have easily gotten physical between all 3 of you had it been in person. \n\nIf he does anything don't hesitate on insisting she get a restraining order. And continue to support her. Let her know that you're there if she needs to talk things out. \n\nThank you for being a wonderful parent. The world needs way more of you. ",
            "You're a bloody legend. Never change, you handled this beyond well. You taught her how to read the situation for herself and make propper choices. Top bloke",
            "Alot of young girls fancy the idea of being with older men. Iasked my sister why and she said at a young age, like young adult or teen, for girls they want an older guy because they like the idea of someone teaching them. They simply want knowledge, and in our society we teach girls they need to rely on a man, while for guys we learn opposite, so we look for sex usually. Unfortunately, most of these older guys who date young girls are douches. It makes sense right. Why would a fully grown man date a girl in her late teens. There must be something wrong with him if he would prefer not to date girls closer to his age. These guys like young girls because they are easy to take advantage of. It's very low I know, but it's true. \n\nMy advice would be to teach you're daughter to mend her garden. To work on her self. Teach her she does not need a man in her life. Get her to finding her self. To connect with her deeper self through reading, mastering her hobbies and picking up new ones, setting goals, and getting physically strong so she can defend herself. They should be taught this early on the same way us guys are, but lost of  times they are not.\n\nI'm sorry to hear she was with such an abusive ass hole. I wish the best for her. But for her this is an experience that she can learn to take from rather than let it bring her down. You can talk to her, but alot of times daughters don't take that self improvement type of advice from their dads well. Maybe get one of your female friends to spend more time with her.",
            "I am standing up at my desk and applauding. Seriously. What you did is exactly what older teens/young adults need- give them the room to spread their wings and a soft place to land when they fall (and a not so soft place for douchey abusive ex-boyfriends to land if they don't leave quietly). You are amazing!",
            "See,  this is what happens when you're supportive instead of controlling. If you had continued down the path of telling her she couldn't be with this guy,  she likely wouldn't have told you she was scared and would have moved in with him as she wouldn't have had any support to say no to him. I really hope you have learnt from this experience to trust your daughter to know when things are not alright and going forward trust that she will be just fine with whoever she chooses,  and if she's not,  she will come to you again for help because you won't have been pushing her into his arms. Well done! ",
            "\"I'm going to pinch the hell out of you\". You're way nicer than most of us.",
            "Literally the best update I've ever read on this sub. Hoping I can be as awesome of a dad as you one day.",
            "Fuck yea dude! I'm so proud of you.\n\nDefend your daughter! I love this.",
            "You are an inspiration ",
            "I'm so impressed! I was your daughter. An 18 year old with a 29 year old. If my parents had been half as awesome, it would have saved me 4 years of heartache and abuse. Your daughter knows she has a respectful champion in you and will be a stronger woman for it.",
            "Reading these threads always terrifies me, because I'm a dad.\n\nBut then I remember I'm also 33 and my paramour is 21, and I'm like... hmm. ",
            "Now that you have supported her, it's time to teach her not to make these mistakes again.  Some people have to learn the hard way,  but imo,  would rather learn to avoid those situations altogether.  ",
            "Your original post wouldn't show for me, so I'm not 100% sure what was contained in it.  When I first started reading this post, though, my heart sank.  \n\nI have close family friends, whose 17 year old daughter started dating a 32 year old man.... with a 7 year old daughter.  She was always the rebel type, so no one felt comfortable telling her like it is (that this relationship isn't a good idea).  When she introduced him to her mom, they lied about his age, and told her he was 23.  He'd be a hard 23 though.  It came out shortly after that he was actually 32.  Mom was upset, but afraid of pushing her away, so didn't really do anything to stop this.  \n\nAnyway, now at 19, she's still with this guy. Living with him and his daughter and their 5-month old son.  Yep, she got knocked up not so long after she turned 18.  Such a damn shame.  \n\nAnd yeah, he's not a good guy.  He recently accused her mom of stealing from him. She wasn't. But he went as far as calling the police on her.  This girl is forever tied to this creep. \n\nSo, I don't know why exactly I'm telling this story.  I guess I'm just really glad your daughter could come to you and get out of this situation.  Even though it sucked, and he scared her.  Your daughter had the chance to get out and learn from this.  Hopefully she will.  It sounds like she has a pretty loving, supportive, and caring father though, so she'll probably be fine. :)",
            "Yeah you handled this right. Age gaps aren't automatically a problem but they leave the younger party vulnerable so it's important to look for signs of abuse. It's good you didn't make it just about age because she wouldn't have understood, but because you didn't she was more able to trust you with the real problems.",
            "What does it mean to pinch someone in this context?",
            "What would you have done if she did want to move in with him? ",
            "Dad of the week award!! Also it might smart to get in touch with the police over this guy, he might actually be super crazy.",
            "Sounds like it went ok. I've seen worse.",
            "Can I just say, you're a really good Dad. It always makes me happy when I see families sticking together. It happens a lot less often than you'd think. And now you're daughter knows from experience that she can always rely on you. Bravo!",
            "You're awesome. Because you kept your cool in the beginning she felt comfortable coming to you when she was scared. Go dad!",
            "Does pinch mean something im not getting?",
            "Technically she's 18 and can make her own decisions, but I don't see anything wrong with you being a father and passing judgement on this guy. He's 11 yrs older than her, and in the end you were right about him. Yes it's great to support your child, but you also need to remain a father at the same time and give real advice from your experience too, like you did. ",
            "punching would be better though, OP.\n\nI don't think people are that scared of pinching tbh until that douchebag hung up after you said you would pinch him to death lol",
            "You really handled this well. It could have gone so far in the opposite direction with her being with him just to prove you wrong and rebel. You showed her respect and in turn she felt like you were there for her to support and keep her safe which is what dads are for!\n\nI agree with below posts, please be sure to talk to her about domestic/abuse violence. She's at an incredibly impressionable age and it will help your family avoid any future instances like this.",
            "That guy sounds like a real winner.\n\nAnyway, good job Dad. No man should treat anyone like that. I think you saved her to be honest!",
            "Nicely done you handled that excellently well. When raising kids if you put your foot down they may follow your letter but they won't be happy with it. By showing support it made it into a team effort and gave her the strength to do it. Otherwise she may not have been happy to talk to you about her fears or as comfortable doing it. Keep being a awesome dad. ",
            "This gave me so many feelings",
            "You're the kind of dad I hope to be one day.",
            "Yay! I'm so glad to see people like you taking a stand when someone causes harm to their family and friends. I'm sorry he treated her the way he did. Remind her that his behavior was wrong, and she didn't ever deserve it under any circumstances. She's a good person who was caught up in a bad situation, no matter what he's either told her or left her feeling like. You caught onto his act, even though you couldn't quite figure out what it was at first, and you were looking out for her. It wasn't a level playing field, especially at her age, and you saw that. I'm with the others who said therapy may be a good idea for her. He may have done more to her than what she's let on. Another book that might help her is the expanded edition of Psychopath Free. Moving forward from this creepy guy won't be easy, but with your support, it'll hopefully be easier in the long run. ",
            "You're an amazing dad. ",
            "You should pinch the shit out of that douche bag",
            "Thanks so much for doing what you did. you honestly remind me of my dad, when I was 18 I was in a relationship with a 25YO man... At the time I didn't think it was that weird, since the guy was about on the same maturity level as me. I trust my father to the ends of the earth so I told him about my boyfriend, and he was honest with me and said he'd support me but if I ever needed his help to go to him. He was clear that if he ever tried to step out of my comfort zone, for me to be stern with my bf- and he'd be there to back me up.\nSure enough, the guy tried to force me into acts I wasn't comfortable with and eventually cheated on me. After cheating he told me I needed to stay with him because I was his \"backup plan.\" I dumped him on the spot because I had a pretty tough skin, but immediately went home and had a breakdown. My dad was the #1 person to be there for me, and he gave me all the support in the world- Seriously, if it wasn't for my father constantly supporting my choices, I might have thought breaking up with him would be the wrong choice.\n\nSo, thanks for being a great dad. Your daughter is so lucky to have you as a father.",
            "A+ parenting: your daughter trusts you to provide help and advice. You'd be sadly surprised how rare that is, so you've clearly both done a good job building a healthy relationship! :)",

            "You did the right thing. This guy only wanted a young pliable woman he could control and mold into what *he* wanted, he didn't care about her as a person. This is the case about 90% of the time when someone significantly older dates a teenager. \n\nYou've clearly been a good parent to her, and it shows in how reluctant she was too move out. Good job dad! ",

            "I think you did a fantastic job of supporting/ backing up your daughter. I didn't see the original post, but I was originally going to comment on an experience with a family member about the age difference. My cousin (about 33 now), started dating a man with 2 kids in his 30s when she was only 18. Obviously we were skeptical, but they did what they wanted to do and eloped when she was 19. As young as that is, she was an adult, and had to make her own decisions, good or bad. For her, it has worked out. He's a really great guy, who loves his family and does what he can to support them well.  They now have 6 wonderful children, a nice home, and they seem pretty happy. She's a stay at home mom, and he sometimes has to travel for work, but they like their lifestyle and it works for them. It is not the life I would choose for myself, but it's perfect for her.",
            "One of the hardest lessons I've had to learn is that I can't really change my friends minds when they date (or even marry) someone that I think sucks or is otherwise shady. I imagine it's an even harder situation when you're a parent because they might even be less likely to listen to you. That being said, you did the right thing. She can trust you in a way she couldn't if you hadn't been supportive.",

            "You showed your daughter how a real man stands up for and defends his woman; by appropriately using the male propensity for rage and violence, with the sole intent of defending the dignity/respect/safety of their loved ones from those who would seek to erode those principles and inflict harm upon them, you managed to scare away a weak and lesser man from your daughter.\n\nFuck yeah.",
