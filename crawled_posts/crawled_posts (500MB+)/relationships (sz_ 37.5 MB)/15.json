        "selftext": "A lot of you requested an update to my [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2nsy91/i_22m_suspect_something_between_my_girlfriend_22f/).\n\nThe majority of you suggested that I speak to Brooke and/or attempt to walk in on the act.  I decided on doing both.\n\nSunday night everyone was back in the apartment.  I had every intention of speaking to Brooke about the neighbor's comment alone, but before I could she said something that completely threw my theory off. She told Derek to get to bed so he wouldn't be tired for work in the morning. What. I knew Derek has a job on campus, but he had always worked the same night shifts. Being as casual as possible, I inquired how long he'd been working mornings and when he started. He said he picked up the extra shifts a month ago and worked at 9. (I leave at 7:45 so it's possible for me not to have noticed that). I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out whether he was lying about that, whether still he had some mornings here at home, whether Alexis could be seeing someone other than Derek in the mornings (like some of you suggested) or (again) if I was just a paranoid loser. I went to bed feeling emotionally drained and confused.\n\nThe next morning I left for classes as usual and operated on autopilot. I alternated between thinking I'd run home to check on Alexis and thinking I had way too much work to run around based on a theory that I wasn't even sure about anymore.  In the end, I walked out of my first class and straight to my car to go home. In a weird way, I sort of wish I hadn't. \n\nWhen I got to the apartment Derek's car wasn't there, just Alexis'. I walked to the apartment with my heart pounding all sorts of crazy. I don't know what I was expecting. Outside the apartment door I could immediately here a guy's voice inside. I heard him talking and laughing and a soft feminine mumble replying and giggling back.  I've been on this subreddit long enough to see all the different reactions people have to this situation. I never once contemplated what I'd do. I pressed my ear to the door and see if I could make out what they were saying, but I could only make out a word here and there. There was a lot of giggling. Then, I heard the sound of Alexis being tickled and shrieking.  Maybe I should've waited more. In retrospect I wish I did, but I couldn't take it. As soon as I started fiddling with my keys, it was dead silence in there.\n\nShe was fucking Mark.  I never mentioned Mark in the previous post but he's one the guys in the apartment next to us (**not** the one that tipped me off). He's the only one I never liked. Fucking know-it-all douchebag attitude. Always made inappropriate comments towards both girls. Never thought anything of it. As soon as I opened the door, they both gave me a deer-in-headlights look that removed any naiive doubt I may have retained that the situation was innocent. I was planning on yelling at them or demanded answers, but (and this is fucking embarrassing) my eyes began to well with tears. I didn't want them to see that shit. So I said \"Nice. Real fucking nice.\" and bolted back to my car.\n\nI heard Alexis yelling my name in the hallway and picked up the pace. I sort of expected her to be chasing me but by the time I got to the car there was no one following me. I drove to a park that's near the apartment and sat there in disbelief. My first thought, weirdly enough was *How is my family going to take this? What the hell am I going to tell them?* My family fucking loved Alexis. They joked about our wedding and regularly called her part of the family. Then I started thinking about living arrangements. Our finals end in about two weeks, there's no way I can handle moving now. I'm applying to an extremely competitive graduate program and I can't let anything get in the way of that. Definitely not this cheating bitch. \n\nI'm writing this from a friend's house. I explained the situation, he explained it to his parents and they welcomed me to stay in their home. I'm going to have to go back home to get some clothes sometime. I'm planning on going during this lab period I know Alexis can't skip tomorrow. It took her an hour or so to start blowing up my phone, but once she did it didn't stop.  She started off asking me to come home so she could explain.  Before I even had the chance to respond she sent another one begging me to come back because she was having an anxiety attack, something I always help her through. Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was *good, you earned it*. There was a pause and then she sent \"I don't know why you get so jealous, we were just hanging out.\" I waited. She sent \"Look, I know it looks super sketchy, believe me if I were you I'd think the same thing, but we didn't do anything. He needed advice on his girl problems. You have to believe me.\" No, no I don't. Normally I would have gotten a weird sense of satisfaction watching a cheater scramble to cover their ass, but my stupid brain just kept replaying all these great times we had together and wondering if she was cheating then too. I want to know when this started, but at the same time I'm worried it's been going on for longer than the month I've suspected something.\n\nI received a text later that night from a number I didn't recognize. It was the nice dude from next door. He said (paraphrasing because it was a long text) that he got my number from Derek. He was extremely sorry for what I was going through and that he would have told me sooner but he wasn't completely sure.  He said he knew his friend was seeing a girl with a boyfriend, but didn't put it together until he learned the girl's name. As many of you suspected, the comment was him trying to tip me off. So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year. \n\nI don't think Derek and Brooke know yet. I haven't texted them. I haven't found the words. I know it's going to turn our living arrangement and friendships upside down. I guess I should message them before Alexis paints a different picture.  I wonder what the cool neighbor said when he asked for my number. I don't think he told them, the would have said something... Right? Unless they took her side. Then I've lost my girlfriend *and* friends.\n\nAny advice on coping with something like this, especially from those who have been there before, please let me know. I don't have many friends to reach out to besides the guy I'm staying with. Alexis, Brooke and Derek were basically my family. Alexis and I had talked about spending our lives together. I have never been serious about a girl the way I was with her. \n\n**EDIT:** I am seriously moved by the amount of support you guys are giving me here. Please keep them coming, I may not reply to all the comments but I've read each one on both posts. I'm going to tell Derek and Brooke soon. I'll try to do a follow up when I have some sort of plan. \n\n---   \n**TL;DR** She was cheating, but it wasn't with Derek. I'm shattered. ",

            "Man that is... That sucks.\n\nTalk to Derek right away. He is close to the situation and might provide some insight and might be able to help. Brooke is a tougher sell though, because of how close she is to Alexis.\n\nBuy the guy across the hall a pack of beer.\n\nAnd don't drop the ball on finals or graduate school. You will be in a better place next semester once you continue kicking ass at school.",
            "Like the others said, concentrate on your school work and finals.  Pour your whole soul into it.  Then get into grad school and just move on with your life.  If Mark is the douchebag you say he is, let her wallow in his glory for a while.  Don't respond to her texts or calls.  Cut ALL communication with her.  This really, really sucks.  I am a guy and not very emotional but this brought tears to my eyes.  I hate a fucking cheater more than anything.  \n\nI bet she waits outside one of your classes and tries to corner you.  If she does, mention the neighbor hearing them fucking and the condom in the trash.  She won't be able to deny it.  When she does corner you, be ready.  No crying, no swearing, just \"Get the hell out of my life!\"",
            "Been through something similar. Feels absolutely terrible. I'm so sorry for you.\n\nThe reality is, you've now learned that you've got good instincts that you can now learn to trust even more. These instincts will you get you far. Also, the fact that your neighbor tried to help you - it means you're a good guy who people want to help.\n\nTake a moment to get this stuff out of your head, practical stuff and so on. You also might have to get an STD test? You have been using condoms, but still... you might want to consider that.\n\nAnd then focus on your exams like the others said. Don't hold on to the anger for too long, \"it's like holding on to a burning coal to throw it, you'll just end up hurting yourself\". They'll be carrying a burden because of this for a long time - that's their punishment.\n\nYou'll get through it. It's these challenges in life that make us better people.",
            "Hold out with the silent treatment. It's clearly killing her, and she needs a little killing (figuratively speaking.) Just keep doing what you're doing: dealing with the arrangements (where to sleep, what to get, getting through exams, staying on course) and keep that Cold Silence.\n\nYou're doing fine.",
            "The guy who tried to tip you off and the people who are letting you stay with them are golden. Just remember they exist when you feel alone in this. Keep your eye on the prize of your education and how it's going to pay off down the road. As for your girlfriend, as much as this hurts (one of my brothers used to say that \"chick pain\" hurts the most), it's better that you found out about her *now*, instead of down the road, when you're married and have a kid or two. She may spin her story for your roommates, but reality is reality. Good luck, OP. Like any difficult thing, take it a day at a time. You will fall out of love with her and find someone who deserves a good guy. It sounds like the universe has a different plan for you. May the force be with you.",
            "OP,\n\nI made an account for the first time just to write to you.\n\nFirst, I'm very sorry that you are going through this. I went through something very similar, and it is a terrible feeling. I won't get into my story, but, suffice to say, the cheating broke me. It didn't break my heart, it broke me as a whole. I chose to mask the pain with alcohol, which caused a problem I am just starting to get in control almost 2 years later\n\n\nPlease, don't let this happen to you. You MUST put these new feelings into something healthy. People always joke \"lawyer up and hit the gym\", and it is actually true. The real feelings will come soon, and they will come hard. Anger overtook sadness for me, and it made me become someone I didn't recognize. I learned to put those feelings into the weights, and it really helped. \n\nI wish I could tell you that it will all go away, but this will stick with you for a long time. The anger and sadness will fade, but the knowledge that someone you loved and trusted could do that to you will always be with you. Don't sabotage future relationships, but remember this feeling if you ever feel the need to stray from your future SO.\n\nTurn this experience into a positive one. Use the new feelings to boost your studying. Use the feelings positively. Stay away from alcohol for a bit and let your body go through the grieving process. Tell your roommates what happened, and most importantly, NEVER TAKE THIS GIRL BACK. She will come up with some convincing arguments that will play with your emotions and feelings. Just push through and don't give in to them.\n\nIn a few months, when yoy get the email at 2 a.m. saying \"I miss you\", you can laugh and enjoy knowing that she knows she fucked up.\n\nGood luck brother.",
            "I was waiting on pins and needles to hear the update to this one...not the ending any of us wanted. Keep close to your friends and family and cut Alexis out of your life. \n\nBest luck on grad school and finals!!",
            "She didn't chase you and took an hour before texting you?  Either she wanted to get in one last good fuck with Mark, or she knew she was fucked over and was trying to come up with a story. Or both. \n\nGo no contact. Focus on your studies and tests. You've got big things ahead in your life and don't need this two-timing ho to drag you down with her lies and gas lighting. A few months from now this will be a distant memory. Good luck!  Please post another update after shit settles to let us know how much better things are without her. ",

            "That neighbrour really has tact. He said it in a way that implicates nobody, came off as a passing remark so he didn't rat anyone out and enough to help you connect the dots. ",
            "I'm 7 years out of my cheating relationship. He cheated on me with everyone (even one friend's mom). In hindsight, I can see what I did wrong and what I handled well. My advice: try not to make any decisions or say anything in anger. That gives them emotional power in the situation. Stay calm, find your zen, and realize you are just going to have to cut this cancer out of your life, no matter how much the cancer (your ex) wails about it. \n\nThis is a complicated emotional surgery. Remember that the thing that made you sick with anxiety, fear, and mistrust is not the thing that will heal that damage. You will find no comfort in her explanations, because now there is nothing she can say that you can trust. Tell you friends what you saw, what you heard, but just the facts. Let them decide for themselves where they stand. Don't emotionally manipulate them because you're scared of losing your friends - that's what she did to you and it isn't fair to anybody. \n\nFocus on your work and the things in life you enjoy. I know you're going through an emotional tsunami right now and it's hard to not get stuck in misery, but you can channel your energy towards your goals. Creating new positive memories is the only way to take the stage from your heartache. If something makes you smile, let it. Enjoy it. It's going to be rare for a bit, but the hurt will fade if you are willing to let it (although slowly and in tiny pieces). \n\nYou can do this. You can handle this situation with class, patience, and compassion. You can be a better person than the person who hurt you. Don't be petty. Don't be childish. It just didn't work out. She wasn't a keeper. The experiment is over and that's ok. Now it's time to start dreaming new dreams to chase and to let go of the ones you built together (often the hardest part, imo). \n\n<3, \nMamaFrankie",
            "Buddy... I'm sorry. \n\nI've been waiting for this update because I *knew* she was cheating on you. I've felt that same panic when all the pieces of a very heartbreaking puzzle come together, and all you want are the pieces to blow away. Good on you for following your gut, and confronting the issue. Don't let this get you down, don't let her win. When you feel that pain in your stomach from the memories of her, use that strength to push forward. In a year you will be glad it is over with and she will never forgive herself for what she did, and you shouldn't forgive her either. DO NOT GIVE HER THAT SATISFACTION, she will ask for it but don't give in. Block her from your life and move forward.\n\nDo you have any idea why she would have cheated on you? And what a fucking asshole that neighbor is! \n\nGood luck in the future, buddy. An internet stranger is rooting for you!!",
            "Sorry bro, we all knew she was cheating. Well only silver-lining is at-least it wasn't Derek. Just take it easy for few days. Remember keep NC. Inform Derek and Brooke asap, do it when Alexis is not around.",
            "Hey, at least your best friend isn't a fucking asshole. ",
            "Just wanted to say I'm sorry, man.  \n\nYou're too nice a guy though.  She DID deserve that anxiety attack and I hope that after the initial sting wears off you don't allow her to worm her way back in because she sounds like she can manipulate you a little.  ",
            "*Ugh*. I am so sorry. You've gotten excellent advice here, but I will say that *at least it wasn't Derek*.\n\nGet Derek out of the apartment and away from Brooke for a beer, and tell him what's up (if they haven't already figured it out). Lay it all out there, show him her texts and the neighbor's, everything. Ask him how he thinks you should approach Brooke. \n\nAnd definitely buy your cool bro neighbor a beer. ",
            ">Maybe I'm heartless, but all I could think was good, you earned it. \n\nShe fucking did.\n\n> So yeah, I guess he's bro of the year.\n\nOnce exams are done and your living arrangements are sorted, you need to shout him a drink or ten.",
            "The fact that she cheated on you with someone who sounds just awful and gross is really just the icing on this shit-cake. I'm a girl, and I can't stand guys that are always making inappropriate comments to girls. Just ugh, no, gross.  \n\nAlexis really fucked up. Sounds like she ruined a great relationship with a great guy for some disgusting, arrogant prick. Way to go, Alexis, real fucking nice, indeed!\n\nI'm so sorry this happened. Best of luck to you, you have a bright future ahead. The pain subsides over time.  (Probably way too soon for you to hear this...but maybe down the road, you could sell your story; write a short story or a screenplay or something.  It was a compelling story, you had us all behind you and on the edge of our seats.  Make a million bucks, they say success is the best revenge.)",

This shit even teared me up and I have a heart made of pyrite. \n\nWow. Sigh.\n\nJust keep on going forward, man. Don't think about what you've lost. Think about what you've gained. You had an invisible weight around your neck that was dragging you down and now it is fucking. gone. \n\nIt's *so* much better that you learned about this shit now. Christ, imagine, if this shit hadn't come out until you were much further along in the relationship. \n\nThis Mark guy may be an asshole but he's an asshole who did you a favor, he revealed your girlfriend for the unbelievable sleazebag that she truly is. She was going to do this eventually and it's better you find out who she is now than later. And now that it's done you can let that cancerous part of your life blow away like dust in the wind.\n\nEnjoy freedom.",
            "Holy shit dude, that's tough.  This is going to hurt like a bitch for a while.  There's no reason to speak to her ever again.  Just get your stuff out while she's at lab.  Text your friends and tell them what happened.  If they are true friends, they will remain your friends.  No more contact with her at all.  Tell your parents what happened.  The whole story from the beginning.  They will no longer think so highly of her.  Tell the next door neighbor you appreciate his trying to help you out.  He really sounds like a cool guy.

            "I was in a very similar boat a few years ago. My boyfriend and I weren't living together, but we'd talked about the future, marriage, kids, the whole nine yards. \n\nIt turned out that he was dating two girls. Me and another girl he had met about a month before me. We both lived in the same city, had mutual friends, and were in similar situations in life. I think she knew about me because after I added up all the weird bits about my relationship it turned out I was just being used for anal sex. Guess she wouldn't put out the back door and allowed him a thing on the side to meet his needs? \n\nIt was awful and embarrassing and this is the first time I've ever admitted to full reason of why he had kept me around... I guess the mushy relationship stuff was just to keep me from leaving sooner? I don't know. I just wish there was a public forum where I could caution women against him by name without getting sued.\n\nWhy am I over-sharing? Because it can always be worse and because I got over it (mostly) and moved on. I just want you to know I know where you're coming from, and that I'm not just a dumb internet-voice that assumes to be all-knowing.\n\n1. (and I'm sure people said this already) but get tested for any STDs.\n2. find a therapist (if you can afford it/have insurance) and have someone help you through it. I didn't and I regret it - pulling yourself up by the bootstraps isn't always enough.\n3. give yourself a moment to grieve but do move on and start dating again. Not all women are cheating scumbag Stacys. \n4. Your family is YOUR family and if they're anything like mine, they'll be coming after her with pitchforks (which she brought upon herself and you should try not to feel guilty about).\n\nOne day this is the woman you're going to see walking across the street from you and if you recognize her, you'll be grateful that things ended and be able to see how much better off you are.\n\nScum happens. Feel better and good luck with Grad School.",
            "I am so sorry OP.... I can't really say anything that will make you feel better except that you the man bro.... Immediately go no contact. I don't care how, or what you have to do, but she's a terrible person and needs to be removed from your life. Tried to put it on you? Not happening. Make sure to inform your friends about why a douchenozzle she is and let them decide if she's worth there time. God damn what a bitch. Just know that /r/relationships is on your side right now.",
            "I am sorry you are going through this dude. And you are handling this very good. There is no embarrassment to have because of the tears. You are hurting, cause the love of your life turned out to be a selfish cheating whore. It's not clear if you sent any reply to her texts. If you didn't, you are a hero. And you should continue to not do it. Cause it's the fucking best thing to do for a revenge on a short team. Just imagine how much she is fucking boiling because you are not answering. She does not know, are you sad, angry, relieved, indiferent? What is it? The not knowing is killing her. She's just waiting for a sign from you and nothing, dead silence. Even a \"fuck you whore\" from you would help her, because she gets an answer. Just do not answer anything. And if her messages and calls are fucking with your mind and soul, just block her number dude. You don't need to know what else she writes, or when she calls. Just have some peace. Tell the bitch to fuck the fuck off when she waits for you in person at school or whatever. Three words and you're gone. Resist the urge to do anything stupid. As a long term revenge plan, you go on about your life and be the best person you can be. Focus on school, work, friends and family. One day, maybe 10 years from now, she will run into you somewhere, you will be this happy dude with a pretty girl around your arm, and she will realize how bad she missed out. She will be the sades person and you will have the sweetest revenge, cause you won't even care.\n\nI'm sorry people are assholes buddy. It hurts now, I know first hand how you are feeling. And there are no words to describe how you feel. But it will get so much better as time passes. Keep us updated, and feel free to PM us if you want to talk. I went through all this twice in my life. It wrecked me, it shattered my world, it changed me like nothing else, and I'm a better and happier person for it. You will too.",
            "On one hand, I'm glad it wasn't your friend Derek.  That would have made an already bad situation substantially worse.  I've been through something like this, and honestly it's probably going to be way up there for one of your most painful experiences.  I recommend that you do the worst thing you can to her:  succeed and be happy.  It's easy to be hurt or angry, and by all means embrace those feelings, let yourself feel them, and get it out of your system.  \n\nDon't bury yourself in a bottle.  That makes things much worse.  Go out, have fun, hang around new people, and do things that make you feel good about you.  Crave new experiences.  Hit the gym, swim, run, learn something, or do some physical activity that helps naturally balance your brain and keep you out of depression.  Pour all of that anger and sadness into bettering yourself.  Take the mentality of Atlas to Zeus, \"I ask not for a lighter burden, but for broader shoulders.\"  Make yourself better, because recognizing the good in you and the good you've done for yourself and others will help.  Volunteering somewhere is a good option, too.  Kindness has a way of spreading from those who receive it back to you.  It helps us remember what is important in life.  \n\nSpend time with friends and family who love you.  It's a good time to be close to your family.  If Brooke and Derek are really your friends, they won't abandon you in this situation.  Instead, they'll be pissed that she put you through this.  If I were them, I'd be pissed at her for messing with the living situation.  If they bail on you, then it was probably for the best.  They weren't really your friends.  Remember the people in your life that care about you and do what you can to not let this damage your sense of self worth.\n\nTake a little down time from dating.  This sounds like it was a long term relationship, and you guys were very close.  Don't rebound.  That's about the worst thing you can do, because you wind up bringing baggage from your previous relationship.  Take the time to heal, get to know yourself, and learn how to be alone for a little while.  Simply put, get busy being you.\n\nI know this probably feels like just about the worst thing to ever happen to you, but you have a place to stay while you sort this out.  One day you'll look back at this and realize that she just wasn't mature enough for a serious relationship and didn't appreciate you enough to be faithful.  Own any mistakes you made in the relationship and learn from them.  Learn from the things you now see that you missed in the relationship.  It's never a waste of time it it helps you grow as an individual.  \n\nKnow that you will get through this.  Approach it with the mentality that the grief will pass.  I like Sun Tzu's iconic passage in the Art of War:  \"warriors who are victorious go into battle first with victory in their hearts, while warriors who are defeated go into battle first and seek to achieve victory.\"  In the end you will come out the better person.  Don't stoop to her level.  Don't be mean or petty.  It weakens you and dampens your heart.  \n\nKeep your chin up.  If you find yourself lacking in bros, you should probably make an effort to hang out with the neighbor.  You guys weren't even close, and he tipped you off.  That shows a lot of integrity, and we could always do with more people like that in our lives.  \n\nThe time I went through something like this, I was married.  The advice I offered was from mistakes I made.  I had a few relationships end after that, and I used this approach.  I bounced back faster, felt better faster, and I was able to reaffirm my sense of self.  What's more, I actually remained friends with the exes I've had since then.  I hope that it helps.\n\nTL;DR  Pretty much just listen to Be Good To Yourself by Journey and you'll get the gist.\n\n",

            "What a horrible horrible situation. I was waiting for an update, and I'm even more horrified.  \n\nThe hurt and betrayal will eventually pass, but the lasting affect sucks the most. As for your family they dont need to know the details. A simple \"We wanted different things, It just didn't work out, etc,\" is enough. \n\nDon't give this girl an ounce of leniency.  She doesn't deserve you and I hope things work out with your other roommates.  If they opt to take a neutral stance or forgive her, don't take it personally. She didn't cheat on them so it's easier to forgive and forget.",
            "I've been in your shoes. I ran away and let my Alexis keep my Brooke and my Derek. I regret that everyday. Well, not quite everyday, but I still regret that. ",
            "Op,  this is for you and I hope you get a chance to read this. First off,  if you're near Birmingham, AL you already have a friend here- I've been in a similar situation and can empathize.  Second, and this is my main point,  you are still the same person today as you were some years ago.  Experiences like this can give us a feeling of definition- *this is who I am now,  a victim of infidelity* but that's not true.  You may have realized this already but I'm going to elaborate- you had something bad happen,  stand up and rejoice in the fact that 1- you didn't hurt anyone (including yourself,  because that wouldn't solve anything)  2- by your post,  you've won the hearts of thousands of people around the world and I bet that any number of those would just like to give you a big hug and say *good job* on being a decent human being.  3- This is going to sound like a dickish comment,  but,  as they say, in a few years you'll look back at this and think you're a better person for this having happened.  No- no one wants to be cheated on, nor lied to by the ones you trust.  Jesus Christmas, people can really suck sometimes- but that's the status quo. Not changing anytime soon and this happens to LOTS of people.  In the grand scheme of things,  you are better today than you were yesterday and don't forget that.  Tomorrow will sting less than today and in a few weeks/months you'll be right as rain.  Talk to your parents if you think it'll help.  You know your situation better than anyone else.  Lastly- keep your head held high.  You just survived a cancer being removed from your life.  You are not a victim,  you are a survivor.  Now get back in there,  study hard and when you're done with classes- have a beer for me. You got this.",
            "Alright man. I'm gonna tell you how it is. I've been cheated on 3 times (out of 3!) and it sucks. You're gonna keep thinking in your mind: When did it start? What did I do wrong? Why would she do this? \n\nJust remember this. It took me 3 times to figure it out. It isn't your fault. NO MATTER WHAT. She cheated because she is a scumbag. PERIOD. Even if you did go back to her, would you want to date someone that shitty? NO! You did nothing wrong. Don't communicate. Delete/Block her off Facebook/Twitter/whatever. Just get your shit out of the apartment and be done with the whole situation. You didn't bring this on yourself so don't drag it out. \n\nNow what I can tell you is that it is gonna suck to see her in any public place. Just try to ignore her. I haven't fully been able to figure out exactly what to do but I just reply very coldly whenever she tries to talk to me. It seems to work I suppose. \n\nGood luck on finals man. ",
            "I'm so sorry ): Best thing is no contact and just do you. You have a great head on your shoulders and people who are really there for you. Use their support and focus soley on school. You have bigger things to do than waste your time on scumbags",

            "Guy in a similar situation chiming in.\n\nYou were composed enough to write this out thoroughly so I'll assume you have the self-control that I do, and I saw this advice before but whoever gave it was absolutely right.\n\nSometimes feelings are fleeting and there's nothing you can say or do that would have stopped this from happening.\n\nIt's going to hurt. But be greatful that it wasn't your best friend as you initially expected. After the living situation is figured out and you know how YOU are going to move forward, try your best to forgive her. I guarantee she knows she fucked up. Don't forgive her and take her back. Forgive her and let her know that it's understandable that feelings change and sometimes it's inevitable. Let her know that what she did was wrong and will have an impact on not only you and her but both of your best friends as well so that she knows she was being selfish as well. Forgive her but move on, because there is no coming back from something like this when you don't have a marriage, or children, or family to fight for. It will haunt any semblance of a relationship between you two now. Do not let it take your focus and ambition for school. Learn from it. Make sure she learns from it. But do not lower your self-respect and allow your heart to trick you into thinking it will be okay. \n\nYou'll be stronger, More confident in yourself and your decisions, and if she is truly sorry and not just sorry that she got caught then it will haunt her but it's deserved. \n\nIf you don't respect yourself and leave now, you will worry in future relationships, you will struggle to trust and to let yourself be that close to someone again, and it isn't worth it.

It's the fucking worst. \n\nBut! She's shown her true colors here, and one day you'll be grateful she did now, instead of years or decades down the line. You seem like a decent fellow. Continue to be. Don't let this event define you. Lose yourself in school for now, and process it after finals. ",
            "First of all I am really sorry you have to go through this. Being cheated on is one of the worst feelings in the world.\n\nSecond, this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her true character. She hid it well for a long time but she is not a good person. Do not allow her behaviour to derail your study and career plans, you need to start looking out for yourself now.\n\nThird, tell everybody exactly what happened. There is nothing for you to be ashamed about, the shame is all hers. She may well try to turn your friends against you. All you can do is tell them the truth, you can't force them to believe you.\n\nLastly, you have to let yourself accept that this relationship is over. The days and weeks ahead will not be easy and you will need to stay strong and remain focused on your goals. Do not allow this girl to ruin the rest of your life because your best days still lie ahead. You might not think so right now but you will be happy again, and life will get better. You literally have no idea right now just how great things are going to get.\n\nGood luck to you.",

Now she betrays a really great guy that she's in a serious relationship with over the douche next door- and uses every stereotypical \"I got caught cheating\" phrase invented ever. \n\nGo on with your life. Even if Brooke isn't your friend anymore, it doesn't really matter. College friendships aren't everything. Concentrate on finals, thank the friend you're staying with appropriately, find a new living situation that doesn't potentially involve relationship drama and find new friends if you need to. Don't stress over such a dumb bitch- I wouldn't want to be her friend, but I bet a ton of girls would want to be your girlfriend.

I was making myself happy. \n\nAnother tactic that helped me cope came from seeing my heartbreaker behind us on the road one day. There was a green stuffed animal I'd never seen before on her dashboard. My heart sank for a moment as my imagination ran wild imagining the people / story behind it getting there.\n\nI figured maybe I could switch some things around in my life, that way if I see her out somewhere, _her_ imagination would wander. The easiest thing to do at the time was put this black leather case I had laying around on my silver cellphone. Maybe she'd think I got a new phone or something, uknow. I also painted and mounted a front lip on my car, got Sirius Sat Radio... bunch of little shit that I planned on doing but didn't because of the breakup.\n \nOne night we end up a the same party in close proximity.

Fuck her, fuck that, go team /u/Enort! Yes it hurts today, slightly less tomorrow and eventually she is just a faded memory. You'll see. By then you will be somewhere else. Make sure it is where you want to be.\n3. Don't worry what people might think. They will not think less of you. And if somebody does, you don't need that particular person in your life anyway. People come and people go. Some people stay. Others don't. \n4. Accept the pain. It will hurt for a while. Sometimes pretty bad. Don't self medicate to numb it. Time will make it go away, promise.

When I was a freshman/sophomore in college, I was dating a deadbeat guy who moved in with me not long after we met. I was stupid, head over heels. I was new to the area, and he introduced me to his friend (a girl, let's call her Judy). We became fast friends and all 3 of us would hang out often.\n\nWe dated for maybe about a year; he didn't have a job so he'd use my car, money, etc. A huge moocher. I knew he had cheated on girls in the past, but I thought I could make him change (laughable). Turns out he had been cheating on me since we met. I sort of knew it in the back of my head, but could never get the courage to ask him about it. One day he sat me down and told me he was leaving to marry Judy. I felt like an atom bomb had been dropped on my heart.\n\nHe left with Judy and I started to get over things. It took a lot of time, a lot of crying, and a lot of sappy songs. Unfortunately, Judy went into the army and my ex came back. PLEASE DO NOT FOLLOW MY STUPIDITY. Do not let her back, even if she says she'll change and never do it again, yadda, yadda. I did not follow this advice and it was the dumbest thing I ever did.\n\nTake a deep breath and know things will get better. It's going to suck, I won't lie.

She was friggen gutsy to do it in your house. Just stay strong and focus on school. That is all that matters now. Betrayal is one of the worst things you can experience, but it will work out in the long run. The last time it happened to me was a relationship of four years.

Best way to go about it is move out immediately, cut all ties with her (block her number/social media) and lick your wounds.  \n\nGuys tend to bottle it up and use drinking or drugs to cope, don't go about it that way. Talk with people about it, whatever friends you have. If that isn't enough then go to mental health services at your university, people go there for serious mental health issues as well as relationship issues.

I know how much this sucks because I have been in a similar situation (my gf of one year who was also heavily involved with my family  cheated on then once I found out broke up with me and dated the other guy) and it really sucks but the things that I have learned is that you will survive and things will get better. I had lost contact with most of my friends and after this happened had to slowly build relations back up with them but the one worst thing for you to do is to shut yourself out from the world and pity yourself. Yes you had a girl who you were thinking you would spend the rest of your life with and now that is gone but if she did this to you she probably wasn't the best wife material. The cliche saying \"there are always more fish in the sea\" is so over used but is very true. It might take a while ( it has been almost 8 months and counting for me) but eventually you will get back out there and find someone who you deserve, someone who will treat you right. After it happened to me I think I cried everyday for about a week and sometimes if the right trigger words come up I can still break out into tears but for the most part I am over it and am in a better place because of it and if you ever need to vent or get some advice or just wanna talk feel free to message me.

And you helped her through anxiety attacks?? You are way too good for her and i want to bitch-slap her. Good luck man",

Use this emotion to fuel yourself for better things, primarily academics.\n\n\nThat neighbor that tipped you off seems like a real bro. People like that are hard to come by. After you've settled down emotionally, take him out for a beer or something. That could be a new friendship in the making.\n\n\nOther than that, focus on yourself in other ways. Mae yourself a better you. Exercise, learn, explore.\n\n\nIt is better off that you found out, as heartbreaking as it is. You saw who she truly is, so you mustn't waste any more time on her. Take this time to pick yourself up. And yes, as someone who suffers from anxiety,  she deserves the worst of panick attacks for such actions.",

I'll see you guys on \"insert date you might be going back.\" The thing is if Alexis tries to say much, she'll start painting herself as a bad guy to them in my experience. She's gas-lighting you right now - - saying she was just hanging out, but who knows when that'll turn into more excuses, and then she will likely start blaming the reasons to why it happened on you, but don't you listen to a word of it, she's an adult, she made an adult choice, and has to deal like the consequences like an adult. Just keep in your mind how little she respects you.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this and I'm sorry you're hurting, but I'll all work out in time. ",

I had a long term depression where I kept wondering what I dod wrong and missing my ex even though she hurt me.  I thought she was \"the one\".  I wondered if I'd ever find anyone else.  All of that.\nAfter a while I realized that the girl I had loved didn't really exist.  She was made up in my head from what she had showed me, when really she was a different person.  After I figured that out I felt better and I began thinking a lot more about myself than my ex.  I dated many other girls in college.\n\nOddly enough my ex-wife also cheated on me.  This time around I was able to figure out that it was her that fucked up and not me.  \n\nNow I'm with someone who is a genuinely sweet person who I trust.  It takes time and you are always a bit paranoid at first, but it gets better.",

A guy like that who would do something good for a stranger might be the type of friend you need to get through this.  Definitely take him out and see if a more substantial friendship develops.\n\nAlso, do not feel bad about any of this.  Shit happens.  Go to grad school with a clean slate.

            "That sucks big time. I'm sorry that happened to you, but if there is a silver lining to all this it's that you found out now instead of later when you possibly could have been married with kids and shit.\n\nMy advice like many others is to completely cut her out of your life. Absolutely zero contact. You could call her and yell at her or try to talk through it or just tell her how much of a bitch she is, but honestly that will just make things worse. I am a firm believer that ignoring someone is way better than telling them off. Not only will ignoring her be good for you and allow you to move on, but ignoring someone is the biggest insult of all; basically you are saying that they are not even human and not worth recognizing. To acknowledge someone is to acknowledge their humanity. Ignoring someone is the same as saying \"you are less than human, you are nothing, you are less than the fly I swat at, you are less than the scum I avoid stepping in, you do not even exist\". It is more insulting than actually insulting them with words, e.g. calling them a bitch or whatever. Because when you tell someone off you are at the very least saying \"I acknowledge your humanity. You are a shitty human, but a human none the less\". Ignoring them communicates that you feel that they are not even human. Furthermore by ignoring someone you give them no chance to respond and defend their humanity which completely marginalizes them and de-humanizes them. I hope I'm explaining it well enough. Ignoring someone is the most brutal form of de-humanization ever.\n\nOtherwise focus on yourself and your future; grad school, self improvement, new hobbies, new friends, clubs, etc. Good luck out there.",
            "As many others have said: NO CONTACT.  Amputate her presence from your life and cauterize the wound as soon as possible. The person you thought she was never existed. Block her number, and delete her from your life while you focus on you.  Consider it an investment that didn't pan out, and keep your eyes on the prize.  If anyone mentions her name, your canned response is \"I don't know who that is\" because you really don't.  If she forces a confrontation, she's just some crazy drunk chick from a campus party that you want exactly no part of.  Treat her accordingly.\n\nThe best revenge is living well.",

            "My dude, first thing's first -- you're going to be fine. I know that sounds like such a trite, flip thing for a stranger to say, but it's true.\n\nI've been in nearly your exact shoes. Caught my highschool sweetheart cheating on me red-handed after we'd been together for 8+ years. I was in the middle of my first year of Grad school finals. She was essentially already a member of my family, so the whole scenario felt pretty earth-shattering.. All I could think was \"this is going to ruin my life\" and \"I wasted my college years being faithful to her\" etc. etc. A few tips on how to get through..\n\n**1) Don't Dwell:** Stay busy after your finals. Plan a trip. Catch up with friends. Join a winter sports league. Don't mope around your local haunts with old mutual friends. Don't sit in your room on the internet all day.\n\n**2) Move on, ASAP:** It may not feel like it at the moment, but dude, you just dodged a HUGE fucking bullet. Imagine if you'd married this chick, had kids, and *then* found her with your neighbor... I consider myself a pretty respectable/responsible dude but I'll be the first to admit that **the absolute best way to get over an ex-girlfriend is to meet a new girl.** Now, I'm not necessarily talking about meeting the next \"love of your life\", I'm talking about going out for coffee or drinks with a new girl. You don't have to marry her. Shit, you don't even ever have to get serious with her or even see her again, but get out there and interact with other (potentially better) girls.. You'll quickly begin to think \"why was I wasting my time with Brooke?\"... I cannot stress this enough. I've had some of the craziest, hottest, mind-warpingly manipulative crazy girlfriends in the past and the best way to get over them was to just spend some time with someone else. Now, you sound like a \"relationship guy\", which I also am. So a huge key to this is to not get hooked on the first (or every) girl you meet. You're young, getting good at something requires practice and iteration. This applies to dating and relationships as well. Go out there, get some strange, keep it casual but mature and responsible, and figure out what you want out of a relationship (and life) and don't settle until you've found exactly what you're looking for.\n\n**3) Go cold turkey:** Don't talk to Brooke anymore. I'm sure you'll need to work some logistical things out, but keep it over email or text. Don't get drawn into some apology or \"we can make it work\" type of conversation. It. will. not. work.\n\n**4) Expand your horizons:** I get the sense from your posts that you live in a familiar area with lots of family and friends nearby. This sounds great, but consider living somewhere else for a while. Do a semester abroad, or interview for jobs in a different city. You're young and now is the time to figure out where you \"fit\" into this world, before its too late.\n\nGood luck dude. You're a lucky guy who just dodged a bullet. Don't waste this opportunity.",

It took me about a 2 years to eventually find my way back to...life.  That's okay really, I wish I had found it sooner so I could have saved some of the precious time we have in life, but I needed it to be that long I suppose.  In the end you need what you need, so don't be afraid about however long it takes.\nOn the bright side, I used the affairs my ex-wife had as a positive.  It's my never ending source of motivation, my permanent chip on my shoulder.  It drives me like nothing ever has before.  I married absolute fucking scum, so what am I, scum as well?  No, no I'm fucking not.  I blew my life up and re-made it, achieving things I never thought I'd ever get around to doing.  \nSimply put, don't let this destroy you, let it destroy her.  Let this fuel you forward, take you to a legendary status of human being.  Conquer the fucking world.  Make her rue the day she fucked up a relationship with a guy that women usually only get to dream about, not actually be with.  Make her feel like my ex-wife, left in my dust, hating herself until the end of time, knowing she blew her one shot at having someone better than the norm.

You're probably not going to want to, just do it.\n\nPut the pain and frustration into something productive. Gym, hobbies, projects etc.\n\nYou will cry. Some nights will seem hopeless. Just let it out. There's nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nCut off all contact with her. Trust me. I did this with my ex and looking back it's the best decision I made. No long paragraphs to regret. \n\nYou seem like a good guy. Don't know where you're located but if you're near Vermont Id be happy to get out of the house for a night with you. \n",
            "damn that sucks man. I was with a girl and had the same doubts and little things like that pop up the whole time but unlike your situation, she was pretty sneaky and I didn't have anyone to back me up on her cheating. I let her lie to my face because in a sense I wanted to rationalize it and believe that it wasn't true but deep down I knew. even though I went along with her side of the story it created so many trust issues that it wrecked what was left of the relationship. girls like her cheat because they don't know how to get approval from men in any other way and they have low self esteem. if they were really hot shit, they'd have the confidence to dump you and seek somebody that makes them happier, but they don't - they just want to revel in the attention they get from different people. fuck her. use it as motivation to finish grad school and find a better person than her.",
            "I haven't gone through such a deep relationship but a very passive one that i took very close to my heart, that even for today considering the breakup happened 2 years back, still eats my head every night, There is no advice that can keep you at peace, but i believe telling your parents the truth about this would be the toughest, i wish you all the luck and support, you are a brave man, you did no wrong, nothing wrong will happen to you, just stay put and do your god damn job!",
            "God damnet dude I am so sorry. Same thing, sort of happened to me.  Youre a bigger man for walking away.  If you are in the Denver area I will buy you a beer, whiskey, and a steak dinner.",
            "Well, your neighbor was still a bro. Just one of them. \n\nSorry man.",
            "Buy your neigbor a beer and channel all that energy you have now on school.",
            "You handled it a lot better than most - definitely better than I probably would have.\n\nMove on, you don't need that. You will never be able to trust her, and based on her frantic texts after she was caught, she'll do / say anything. No offense to Alexis, but those texts were sent by a selfish person (\"panic attack, help me\" and \"it wasn't what it looked like\" and \"you're always so jealous\"). It's pretty apparent that she did most of the taking and you did most of the giving.\n\nThere will be an inevitable tough spell coming. But you will be wiser for it, and you have your whole life (not with Alex) to enjoy. So many great women out there that don't do something like this.\n\nOur minds do a wonderful job of only reminding us of the good times when we are doing are absolute best to stay resolute and move on. While it's really hard to do, don't break.\n\nGood luck man\n\n",
            "Sorry to hear what happened. I have been in similar situations, but not to this extent. School is important and if you love what you are studying put all you have into it, that is what helped get me through tough relationship times. I know it sucks and hurts like hell but I recommend cutting all ties when possible, understanding that there is still a lot that needs sorted out so you may not be able to do that right now. If your friends are true friends they will be there for you, and who you are with now seems like a good one. You may find that people who you are not close with become extremely good friends when situations like this arise, that is how I became close with my best friend. In the end when all the dust has settled you will be better off, and who knows this could be the start of good things even though I'm pretty sure that's not what you want to hear right now. Cheaters are the worst and don't deserve good guys like you. Best of luck and try to keep a positive mental attitude.",
            "Shit will get to you but just do your best to keep on going. I didn't catch mine but later discovered some messages she had deleted from another guy. This was all in the beginning months also which could have been an easier end but it carried on for almost two years until I saw that and couldn't deal with it. If she keeps trying to say she will fix her ways don't take her back, a cheating SO will always be a cheating SO no matter what you guys try to do that thought will always be with you. You dodge a bullet and a liar time to look forward and one day you'll meet a better person that will have your best interest at heart like you have theirs.",

She will continue to seek out self gratification at any expense.  \nYou, my good sir, are way ahead on this one.  \nOne word of caution: refrain from being 'that guy'... sure, you've earned the right to bitch, moan, morn, and get this off your chest - for a week or two... at some point, move on. Don't let this change you. Don't let your next relationship suffer because of this one person's actions.  \nDon't miss out on enjoying life because you develop trust issues based on one person's shitty actions.  \nDon't stop being the awesome person you obviously are because one person put their own personal satisfaction over the needs and goals of the team. You may even experience this again - but who gives a shit.  \nYou have lost nothing but time - so don't let yourself lose too much more time - every second you waste lamenting about this situation makes the loss of your time greater... take a little bit, get over the loss, and move on with a clear head - we are ALL pulling for you!\n",

Like other people have said, it is extremely important you finish strong on the finals. I wasn't strong enough to do that and it really hurt my progress in school. Keep your head up, and know that this too will pass.",
            "Absolutely get ahead of it in regards to your mutual friends. When I got cheated on my ex convinced a good portion of our friends that I was overreacting, because I didn't want to explain what she's done to them, as I thought that was sleazy. ",

But I took her back after a couple of weeks of her terrorizing me with her crocodile tears and it was just terrible after that, theres no way of going back to how it was because you cant trust that person anymore.

There are plenty of fish in the sea, love yourself and your life first and foremost. Then if a someone fits in with your lifestyle and plans and there is a connection it will happen. \n\nBe smart, your education will carry you further than someone who cheats behind your back. She threw away what could be the best thing that ever happened to her, let her stew in her own unhappiness due to her own fault. ",
            "Dude I'm so sorry to read this, You are probably feeling pretty low right now and all I can say to you is you will feel better in time, and yeah telling family is tough especially when they pictured you married,  but be glad you aren't telling them in a few years time that you are getting a divorce, good luck man",
            "It's a sad fact that talk is cheap, and that talking about the future doesn't guarantee that future. \n\nYou're the victor here, you found out who your real friends are, and you still have your future ahead of you. Take your time to grieve the friendship and romance, and go do awesome shit. You have better times ahead. \n\nI'd tell you how to cope with losing your girl and best friends, but I'm not there yet :P I'm betting you'll beat me to it.",
            "Hey sorry that happened to you. I went through the same shit last year. I found out my gf was sleeping with my old best friend and It was awful. I've effectively cut them both entirely out of my life and moved on. It sucked ass for about a year while I tried to understand what the hell was wrong with me. Why would my closest friend fuck me over so bad? Why did the girl I thought I loved think I wasn't worth ring faithful to? And after a long time I realized that I wasn't that messed up. They were. They were stupid selfish and evil people. They didn't want to hurt me but they didn't care enough to not hurt me either. You are better off getting rid of people like that. They are poison. It's the guy who tried to help you out you need to care about. Hope things get better man! ",
            "Hey man, I just read both of your posts. My heart broke for you. I'm so sorry. On the bright side, it wasn't your best friend. And you aren't officially on the lease. Hopefully Derek will be able to help you through this. "

We have a surplus of candles that he completely ignored. Can/should I forgive him for this? If so, how?*\n\nA few people have PM'd me in recent days asking for an update so here it goes. \n\nMy original post was the day before Thanksgiving. Eugene and I had planned to spend Thanksgiving with my parents but that did not end up happening. \n\nOn my way home from work, I stopped at a local craft store to pick up supplies to make a new memorial candle for Carrie. Thank you /u/70ms for the amazing, heartfelt suggestion. My parents and I spend a day remembering Carrie and making a new candle using some of the wax from the original candle. I also ended up purchasing a locket and having some of the remaining wax from the candle put inside and the locket welded shut by a friend. \n\nOn the evening of my post, I got home and Eugene said he wanted to talk. I agreed we needed to clear the air before Thanksgiving so we sat in the living room and started to talk. I was not ready for what he told me.\n\nA few commentors from my original post seemed to hit the nail on the head in a way. Eugene told me that when we first met, he was extremely turned on by the fact that I was essentially a damsel in distress. I just lost my sister recently, I was in a massive depression, I wasn't myself. And that turned him on both sexually and in a \"protective\" way. \n\nOver the past few months, I've started to become more myself. I got promoted at my job, I've joined a cooking class and have gotten out more, and I've definitely moved away from being a damsel in distress in the eyes of Eugene. \n\nHe went on to explain that he burned the candle in hopes that it would throw me back into that phase because that is the only time he felt he was attracted to me. That's right, he is not attracted to me unless I'm upset, crying, and a damsel in distress. When I prodded for more information, he told me that every one prior to me that he had dated had either just experienced a loss or was \"in need of rescuing\". \n\nEugene told me he was no longer attracted to me. He dreaded having sex with me because he could no longer be the \"hero\" that was rescuing me which is what turned him on in the first place. He didn't like go in public with me because I had started to put myself together more (like not just wearing a t-shirt and jeans like I did when depressed) and that attracted the stares of other men that he saw as a threat (taking away his damsel in distress). Eugene had a whole laundry list of things he hated doing now because I wasn't in a funk anymore.\n\nI told him if that was the case then we needed to break up. He agreed and said he would go stay with a friend until he could make new living arrangements. My name is the only one on our house and I told him I would give him 60 days to vacate the house which he agreed was fair. \n\nOver the past few weeks, I've spent a lot of time with my parents and with close friends. I don't really feel like I've been dumped, or broke up with someone. I just feel like me. \n\nCarrie's candle sits on my desk where the original was and I wear the locket every day. Thank you Reddit for listening. I appreciate it more than you know. \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Ex only likes damsels in distress. We broke up. I'm happy.",

They quickly got sexual. Both were under the age of consent (he was young), so nothing was illegal, but it's clear that a 14/17 age difference is quite significant at that age. She was young and inexperienced, he got to \"show her the world.\"\n\n- GF2: She had a tough past, and still struggled with drugs. He thought he could lecture her and save her. She looked to him for guidance. He delivered, but became boring, and she left him looking for something more exciting, and got back to her old friends who treated her like an equal, not a pupil (and of course, ended up getting back into drugs)\n\n- GF3. Very similar to GF2, I won't go into it. \n\n- GF4. He met her and found out she was clinically depressed. Became a shoulder to cry on. He genuinely liked her, but probably was too attracted to the thought of \"saving\" her to like her for anything outside of her beauty (she was hot), and vulnerability.

Without that jerk, and moving on in your life, and continuing to do great things. You sound like you have so much going for you. You deserve someone that feeds off of your positivity, not your sadness, and that works with you to push you to become the best version of yourself. ",

It sounds like he's utterly unremorseful, and like he thinks specifically targeting vulnerable women isn't predatory as fuck behavior (did he seriously call himself a 'hero' for being that creepy dude that only hits up girls when they're grieving?). Someone seriously needs to let this person know that he's fucked up in the head.",

A few weeks in and someone vandalized it horribly.\nThis could have kept escalating, but now it won't. Congratulations. I'm happy he told you. Good luck, and glad for the happy ending. On the 60 days thing, I would be pretty inclined to knock it down to the legal minimum.",

Try and take some solace that your sister is watching over you, with that candle, she lit the way forward for you, propelling you to a future without a nutjob of a boyfriend. What a beautiful sentiment, having some of the wax in a locket. May you and your family have peace these holidays. x",

            "That's so scary.\n\nThere was a guy I was interested in once, who also liked \"damsels in distress\" and I was just not that. I was pretty obvious in my flirting and trying to get his attention. He friendzoned me. \nBefore he graduated college I told him that I was into him and asked why he wasn't into it. He said he liked a women that needed the help and made him feel needed ie. one of my Bffs. \nSo that made me go from seeing him as this sweet caring, kind person to just selfish and needing to fill his own void. \n\nI was just to confident in myself ",
            "I'm glad You are able to be happy while putting this mess behind you. \n\nI'm really glad that Eugene admitted to his issues. But I'm still puzzled by why would Eugene try to make relationships last. He by now has understood that, no one remains down trodden forever, sooner or later then come back to being normal. Then why move in with people. I'm sure he one day wants to get married and have children. But how will he be able to do that, when the moment a woman gets her confidence back, his insecurities rear their head and he no longer feels attracted to other. \n\nIt's likely you are going to run into him again. Can you please sit him down and get him to seek help. He is on a path to destroy not only his own, but any body he potentially gets attracted to in the future. He will think of more elaborate ways of keeping his partner in a rut, this could potentially take some one into depression and drive them to commit suicide. \n\nI really hope, he listens to you and tries to work on his confidence. He needs to understand that women do love men even when they don't need to rely on the man. That just because a woman isn't physically or emotionally reliant on her partner, doesn't mean she'll stop being attracted to him and it doesn't mean that she will necessarily respond to interests from other men. This is what trusting each other is about.",

            "In a way I actually feel for Eugene. What he did was disrespectful,  but the guy has such low confidence in himself that he needs to be in a position of power,  to feel needed..  Otherwise he essentially feel worthless.  Hope this break up helps him access the help he needs too. \n\nOf course,  I feel for you op..  I hope that you're surrounded by loved ones who can support you through this time.",

            "Holy SHIT",
            "I think this guy has 2 things: very low self image and a sociopathic disorder. He can only see himself as a hero if the woman is in distress, and feels threatened by all other men as soon as he is with someone that he feels they would be interested in. \n\nThe sociopathic side is that he doesn't feel remorse for hurting you to try to achieve what he thinks he wants or needs. \n\nThe combination is toxic. I would recommend informing the police; what if the next woman is recovering from a medical problem or an addiction? Will he put them in danger? On the other hand a psychiatrist might be able to help him form more healthy attitudes.",
            "I would've punched him in the face, straight up. That is probably one of the most disgusting things I've ever heard of. Wouldn't have even given him the courtesy of 60 days, would've just kicked him out, then and there. Glad he's out of your life, you deserve better. ",
            "Holy shit, this is a thing?\n\nMy ex took a screen cap of my reaction when he broke up with me over skype, and often would initiate sex when I'd been crying to him about something. This is falling into place in a really fucked up way.",

            "Wow. What a nutjob. \n\nI'm sorry that happened. That's a really shitty facade for him to hide behind in a relationship. Not to mention toying with someone's emotions surrounding the death of a loved one. What an ass. \n\nThat said though, I'm a believer that things happen for a reason. As heartless and devastating as the candle incident was, I think you needed to experience that personally to progress through your grief. I've been in your shoes and it's extremely difficult losing the physical remnants of a person after they're gone...if only because it's a reminder they *are* gone and aren't there to give that physical remnant back. \n\nI'm so glad you \"feel like yourself.\" Your sister's looking out for you and undoubtedly proud of you handling this incident with such grace. \n\nEdited: typo",

You're happier being out of it, for sure.\n\n*Edit, he only liked being with me when I was depressed, so he could be the hero. Once I figured out how to get happy, he was disgusted with my flippant, happy ways. Oh and if I was depressed, I was not allowed to cry. No one in HIS family would cry over anything unless they were getting their arm sawed off at the time. (actual quote from him).  So I had to be depressed but not have any outlet. In other words, be like him.  \n\n",

My dad had signed over his old truck to me so that we could fix it up to be my first car the day before he killed himself after dealing with a silent battle with mental illness. I kept that key on my keyring years after he died and the truck was long gone, deemed unsuitable for me to drive after he decided that the driver's seat was where he decided he should die. It's kinda of fucked up and morbid, but I'm sure you kind of get it after what happened to you. \n\nI had to go through the pain of explaining that the key went to when my boyfriend and I were still in the \"getting to know you\" stage just as you had to explain the candle. \n\nOne day, I was about to go to work and my boyfriend threw my keys down from the deck to me because I had forgotten them in the house. Usually being a good catch, I fucking lost it when the keys glanced off my hand and landed on the pavement, snapping the brittle and worn 18 year old key in half. I could not help but blame him for throwing the keys when he knew that could happen to the obviously brittle and old key I carried with me everywhere.\n\nLooking back now, I was being stupid. It's just some piece of metal I was hanging on to. It doesn't take away the memories of riding around with him, or the happy moments I remember of him. It seemed important at the time, but as I grew, I realised i was clinging to it because I could not cling to him.\n\nI was hoping that you would soon post an update finding the same wisdom. I'm terribly sorry this happened instead.  You'll be okay though, because you are strong and you are taking care of yourself. You have made it this far, and in the grand scheme of things you've already overcome, this is only a bump in the road. \n\nI wish you all the best with your healing process.

Link to original: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/70q1an/my_29m_former_fwb_25f_claims_to_be_pregnant_feel/\n\nOriginal tl;dr: Former FWB who lives in a different country says she's pregnant and keeping the kid. Don't know what to do. Advice please.\n\nAt the time, lots of you saw many red flags that I didn't and you were pretty sure she wasn't actually pregnant. You were right, she wasn't! After telling her I'd only continue talking to her when there was a paternity test, she initially agreed. She then made up more stories about hospital visits, problems with the pregnancy and got angry that I wasn't being supportive. I held my ground and told her I wouldn't communicate further until the paternity test was done.\n\nAbout a week later, she finally admitted it - it had all been a lie to get my attention. I sent her a message asking her to get help and never contact me again. Blocked her everywhere.\n\nThat was over a year ago, and I've had occasional messages (from other numbers) since then, either asking for forgiveness or getting angry with me for not offering forgiveness. I generally ignored them, though she did get in my head once by sending a message that she was so worried she'd damaged me and I replied telling her that I'd moved on and forgave her. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, she text saying she was visiting the city I live in and wanted to meet up for a chat. I ignored it and blocked the number. Didn't think much of it.\n\nThen, 1 month ago, while I was on holiday, the receptionist at my work sent me a text. Someone had enrolled in a course in the where I teach who was asking about me. 27-year-old Russian. Holy shit, it was her! I had to tell my manager the story and she agreed to me taking some extra holiday and working remotely to avoid any unpleasant situation. \n\nI received a few texts from her, telling me she had enrolled in that school by coincidence (no chance) and finally one to 'congratulate me on avoiding my idea of hell'. Her course finished last week and I found out from some social media stalking that she's now in another city. I think (hope!) that's the end of the story.\n\nThanks for the help reddit.\n\ntl;dr My ex wasn't pregnant. One year later she travelled to my city and enrolled in a course to try to see me. I managed to avoid her and it seems like it's finally over.",

I doubt that this is gonna be the last of her bullshit. She came all the way over from Russia to see you and enrolled on a course where you teach. Depending on what kind of school this is, she could do this again and again. (But that also depends on any visa she holds - that's an area I really don't know a lot about). Make sure all your doors and windows are secure at night and don't hesitate to call the police if she tries anything. I'm sorry dude but I really doubt this is over.

They got married when I was an infant, so I've known both of them just as long. Doesn't matter that she and I aren't blood related, she is my absolute favorite aunt and it broke my heart that she thought we might stop being family without him around. \n\nShe started to date a new guy a few years ago and he is understandably uncomfortable coming to our family stuff so he doesn't always join her but I'm always happy when she shows up. \n\nAll that said, I'm sorry for your lost and hope the rest of your holidays aren't too bad for you.

I finally saw him last weekend for the first time in about seven weeks (he invited me over). He seemed happy to see me at first, but things just seemed a little...off. Like we didn't know what to say to each other.\n\nI stayed with him on the Saturday night. Had a shower Sunday morning and the first thing I saw was a bottle of camellia-scented body scrub that was definitely not mine and I can't remember ever seeing it before. He lives alone. INSTANT RED FLAG. Stupidly I didn't confront him about it straight away, I wish I had.\n\nOver the next couple of days I tried to make conversation with him and he either left me on read or sent really short replies. Finally, on Wednesday night I'd had enough - and I'm not proud of how I acted but I was so hurt by the anxiety and the pain of feeling rejected - I blocked him on Facebook without any warning.\n\nThe following afternoon, I got a text message *\"Hey, ummm...so did you block me?\"*\n\nI responded:  \n*I did. I give up. Life's too short to be someone's afterthought.*  \n*Whether you've just lost interest or whether there's somebody else (when you jump in the shower on a Sunday morning and see girly body scrub that isn't yours, you gotta wonder), or both, I really don't care. I deserve better and it's not worth feeling like a dirty little secret and feeling like shit when I could be happy by myself, or go find someone who lifts me up and genuinely wants to be in my life and vice versa. I'm angry at myself for letting this drag out for so long. I should have let go ages ago but I guess I hoped that things would get better. More fool me.*\n\nHaven't heard from him since so I guess the trash took itself out! He clearly didn't care about me at all. I'm 31 tomorrow, looks like I'll be spending it free and single! \n\nTL;DR - saw partner for first time in 7 weeks, things seemed off, found girly body scrub in shower that didn't belong to me, saw red, blocked him on social media. Now single.",

Then acts indignant when he realises he's blocked.\n\nYou wrote a great response back.  You weren't sad and begging for answers, you weren't angry and accusing him of something he could deny. You just laid it out like it is: this is a sorry excuse for a relationship, and you're not going to waste anymore time on it. I'm sure your feelings are all a mess inside, but you gave a very cool, calm and collected response as to why he isn't worth any of your energy. Well done. \n\nYou handled this brilliantly.

            "I was reading this and thought I got it wrong. Hell, I used to drive 40k every day to see my boyfriend. Now I know there are cultural differences and distance is a bigger deal in Europe, but if he wanted to make you a priority he would. Glad you\u2019re rid of him.",
            "You read it right!  There was nothing he could say to make you doubt your conclusion- he knew he was so busted!  I kinda wish you would have tortured him a little haha!  Your next will be all about you :)",

            "Yeesh. 40km away isn't even *medium* distance. My mom had a longer commute for work than that for like four years. Not seeing you for two months, bailing on a date night, *and* having red flag signs of other women having been in the house? You made the right call.",
            "I think you handled this so well! It takes a lot of people a lot longer to break things off in a bad relationship. If it helps at all, my husband had a very similar situation in his prior relationship\u2014she was basically ghosting him over the last few months. They finally met up, she barely even talked to him, and he found out she was setting up a date with some other guy. He broke up with her, cut the trip short, hopped on a plane, and hopped back on okcupid.\n\nWe messaged one another practically the next day, and the rest is history.\n\nCongrats on freeing yourself up for something much more fulfilling!",

Whether it's him bringing me a meal during my break (12 hour hospital hours) or me coming over to just sleep in his bed and repeat another 12 hour shift the next day. \n\nGigs are usually only evenings/night.

It will drive him crazy and don't respond to his contact. Provide a little bit of Karma. Because of the distance, he didn't make you a priority. Cancelling when you haven't seen each other in a while means he's not really into you.  He should have been excited to see when you did see each other. He's no good, a cheater and sneaky. Find someone in your town who shows he really likes you.  Good luck and kick him to the curb.",
