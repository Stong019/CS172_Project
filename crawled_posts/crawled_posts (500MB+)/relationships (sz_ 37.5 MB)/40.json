        "selftext": "[Link to original post:](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nk1p9w/i_dont_know_what_to_expect_for_my_23f_date_with/)\n\nMy head is still spinning from our date last night. I was so nervous that I felt sick and I literally almost canceled last minute, but I'm so happy that I went through with it! I told him beforehand that I had anxiety about not knowing where he was taking me and I didn't know what to wear. He still wouldn't give away the surprise but he did tell me to dress comfortably, so I just wore one of my nice casual dresses. He made us an outdoor drive-in movie theatre (don't ask me how he did it because I'm hopeless with technology) where we watched my favorite movie and he brought popcorn and my favorite chocolate! Afterwards he took me to this new bookstore cafe in our town which had just opened and I had been dying to go to. I was so happy when he finally kissed me even though I had been previously dreading that he would. We actually kissed quite a bit. I found that my heart was beating not from nerves this time, but from genuine excitement. Now I look forward to intimacy with him and I feel like it'll just make us even closer. It's still unbelievable to me that this is happening, but it doesn't scare me anymore.\n\nI never thought Connor would ever make me feel like this. In my head it just wasn't a possibility since we were such good friends. I couldn't be happier that I decided to give him a chance instead of just immediately shutting it down in fear of ruining the friendship. In reality, our friendship was never in any danger. Yes, there are real differences between dating and just being best friends but there are WAY more similarities than I was expecting. The conversation still flowed the same way it did when we were only friends and we still have plenty of fun and laughs. I'm overjoyed that our friendship dynamic hasn't changed because I was mainly worried that things would be awkward now and I wouldn't know how to behave around him. Now it feels like we're friends who just happen to be dating and IMO that's exactly how things should be. Seeing how happy he is just feels like the cherry on top.\n\nTL;DR: I was terrified to date my best friend. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and I had fun on the date. Thank you so much to everyone who calmed me down and told me to be honest with him about my anxiety beforehand because your advice really helped!",

            "A wise woman once told me \u201cto make sure I marry my best friend.\u201d That woman was my grandmother and she was married to my grandfather for 50 years. Although I am just now reading your story I am so glad you gave him a chance. He already knows everything about you so the hard part of deciding wether or not you will like each other is long gone in 7 years. A random guy you meet could not nail the first date the way he did because a random guy is not going to know your favorite movie or favorite candy. Definitely though make sure you put as much effort into dating him as you would any other guy. If you normally get dressed and dolled up for dates do the same for him. Just because you have hung out in PJs before doesn\u2019t mean you should slack on dating attire. Congratulations OP I am glad you didn\u2019t over think the situation to the point where it didn\u2019t happen. Trust me he is just as nervous as you and thinking all the same things you are!",

            "LOVE this! Started dating my best friend after 2 years of friendship, now been together for 7 with our first baby on the way \ud83e\udd70. Dating your best friend is THE best.",
            "So happy for you! My partner started out as my best friend too; we\u2019ve been together almost 4 years now and we\u2019re planning our wedding! We have the same easy, fun relationship we\u2019ve always had, just with added depth and the bonus that I get to kiss his handsome face any time I want. Some nights we still end up staying up too late giggling. Falling in love with your best friend is truly the best \ud83d\udc95",

            "You deserve this! I\u2019m so happy for you!!!",
            "This is an amazing update and I am so happy for you. Many relationships thrive that have a foundation such as yours. Many also fail, and often times, it's because the pressure put on this relationship, due to what is at stake with your changing dynamic, sets up unrealistic expectations of nothing but pure happiness.\n\nI know I'm just some stranger on the internet, but I just want to say that there will be bumps, mishaps, and times when you're unsure if you made the right call to change your relationship into a romantic one. Only time can tell but it sounds like you're off to a great start. You're both ready, open to the idea, into each other and you have a friendship already.\n\nFinding someone who you genuinely connect with, can be friends with alongside the romantic, is a gift. Enjoy it. Treasure it. Be true to yourself and trust your gut, but be open to new perspectives as they come along together. Weather the ups and downs, uncertainty and doubt, with humor and kindness towards one another and you'll be happier than you ever thought possible. My wife is my best friend. I treasure our small, seemingly unimportant moments more than she can ever know. She's my smart, sexy wife, but the most important thing is that she is my best friend.",
            "Good on you for giving it a chance. 5 years ago I confessed feelings for my best friend, but the situation was different in a few respects. Ultimately we never took a shot at it. I chose to remain friends with her and things are more or less the same and as good as ever. But I\u2019ll go to my grave contending we could have had something very special. Wishing you two the best.",
            "I married my best friend! Besties for 8 years, then dated and been married 16! Good guys do finish first! And I remember his words that hooked me! I\u2019ll be the man that holds your hair when you throw up! So romantic! \ud83e\udd23",

There was no awkward talk about exes either as we both knew everything! Best of luck",

We were way to young for it to last but I will always remember it fondly. I\u2019m a strong believer in the friendship part of the relationship being the most important",
            "I loved reading this!\n\nAlso, for others (hopefully OP won\u2019t need this in the future,) once someone develops romantic interest, the friendship is pretty much over, anyway.",
            "I could relate this story to my life at least except I'm the male. So, basically I had my first ever crush on this girl when we were both 15 and two years later we started being a very close friend. I don't think I've ever met such a wholesome girl in my life and I made a firm decision to not ever confessing my love so that I wouldn't jeopardized our relationship. If there's one thing I would  hate the most is not that I'm not able to date this girl but rather to completely lose her as a good friend.\n\nNow I'm 24 and I'm in another country doing my Bachelor. Although we haven't contacted as much as we used to before I left the country, we still remain as a good friend and periodically texting asking about each other. I also knew she had her first boyfriend for two years during her college time and she had a breakup and was hurted by it a lot. I feel really bad her that I wish I could be by her side at that time consoling her but alas all I could do is just texting her.\n\nI was single the whole time and never been in a single relationship until now. Even though, I'm attracted to someone, there was not a single girl who is as interesting person as her. So, I ended up not dating anyone because I was comparing everyone to her lol. \n\nMaybe just maybe, if we ever meet each other again in the future perhaps 3 years later after I finished my Master, and we were both still single and she still remain attractive to me, I would consider confessing my love and ask if we could start dating. \n\nReading your story give me a lot of hope. \n\nPerhaps dating your best friend is the best after all since you understand each other like and hate a lot more than a normal relationship and you could enjoy a casual and easygoing life with each other because admit it, being romantic the whole time is tiring and I don't want to be in that kind of relationship personally. I want to be able to talk everything with my partner and not hiding it because I'm scared she would dislike me. Besides, being a best friend means your personality are compatible with each other and that's a key for a stable romantic relationship because you could discuss problem you guys had with a cool head.\n\nI'm not sure if this true but your male friend might start liking you earlier than you think but chose to do the same as me. One day, when you get closer maybe you could ask him if you're curious. To be honest, I'm jealous with you but I'm so happy seeing your relationship is working well. Good luck girl!",
            "So happy for you, congrats on taking the risk and getting out of your comfort zone. I'm glad it worked out :)",
            "so wholesome. keep us updated on how things go",
            "My lil heart is dancing with happiness for you both \ud83e\udd70",
            "I\u2019m glad this worked out and I\u2019ll tell you why: all the right components were there PLUS chemistry. That\u2019s the difference between doing this first date with a best friend who ends up feeling more like a brother (no chemistry) versus doing this first date with a best friend who ends up feeling like a boyfriend (chemistry!!)",
            "I'm so dang happy for you. The best relationship I've had is the one I'm in now. We both say and feel like you get to have and be around your best friend and feel comfortable all the time, but also get to kiss and love them, and it's the best.",
            "Congrats on going through with it. My girlfriend knew more about me than anyone but only knew me a month.  So love is crazy",
            "As another person who went from friends to dating to long term couple inject this directly into my veins. It's always a unique special joy when someone at the start of a relationship goes just utterly perfect and you are just so happy you feel like you are just floating and a light breeze could lift you off your feet. \n\nBut just a thing I would add is always make sure you keep your friendship intact where even if you reach a point where maybe you can't continue together romantically that you just transition back to friends. In the winding road of my relationship into marriage that's what kept us together and able come back to each other even when we thought that maybe we couldn't make it work as a couple.",
            "Thank you, your story just made my day. Sure reads alot like this is a keeper. Treat eachother right and things will be fine. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc- OP!",
            "My partner and I became best friends after we started dating, and you're right there are SO many similarities",
            "This is so cute and so perfect. I'm so heartened to read it because it seems like I never get to read stories like this that are so...so much like real life fairytales.\n\nPlease remember that it will be hard to top that level of amazing perfection, and while you probably have quite a lot of amazing, loving, fulfilling experience ahead of you, you have to have realistic expectations! These are the relationships worth working the kinks out in and doing the hard work to make work. Congratulations.",

BUT that thing that made you guys friends (laughing together etc) is what\u2019ll keep your romantic relationship so strong down the road.

            "My husband and I were roommates for 2.5 years in college. I lived with 4 guys Some of which I Bartended with bc I\u2019m not a big fan of most chics. \n\nMy future husband was a random dude i didn\u2019t even meet before I moved in. He was dating a girl already for the first 2 yrs we lived together. I never thought of him as anything more than a roommate and then friends eventually. \nAll roommates became very good friends. We partied, worked and lived together. My now husband and I became close friends and he honestly made me laugh the most, we pulled pranks on each other, etc. \n\nAbout 6 months after I moved out, we were all suppose to get together for a lunch reunion and none of the other roommates could make it but my future husband. We had a good lunch, but actually talked about his ex a bit. \nDecided to grab lunch again just the two of us about a month later. \nWe continued to be really good friends but then it just clicked and we were both actually scared to tell the other one we were liking them more than friends.\n\nThe rest is history, almost 17 years of it.  We still make each other laugh a lot",
            "Congratulations on such a great date! It sounds lovely!\n\nMy SO was a really good friend for years and we always found it incredibly easy to be around each other. Then one day we'd gone out to see a film together and for some reason we'd both dressed up more than usual.

        "selftext": "My husband and I have been together  15 years and married for 11. He\u2019s a physician in the US which, as most everyone knows, comes with a hefty price tag. We got married right out of undergrad and the summer before he started medical school. I had to change which masters program i was going to last minute but i was able to get in and get a job and was able to support the both of us with this job (that I loved) while he finished med school. When he graduated, he got a residency in another state (and barely even consulted me about it before he applied and interviewed and decided. I put it behind me and packed up and moved with him and was luckily able to find another job that was better salary wise but I hated and was able to fully support us both while he was able to put all of the money he made in residency towards his student loans. After he finished, I was able to get a different job thats better than I ever could\u2019ve dreamed of and got a major promotion near the end of 2018.\n\nSince January 2019 my husband has been pushing for us to start trying for a baby. He also doesnt want strangers \u201craising\u201d his children so he doesn\u2019t want to put them in daycare or have a nanny when we have them. We also don\u2019t have any family close by nor do we have any friends that would be able to take on that responsibility. He also doesn\u2019t want to quit his job or go down to part time in his job to take care of said kids, but he expects me to be a stay at home mom. I\u2019m not ready for a baby right now.  I\u2019m not ready to sideline my career and leave my dream job that I have worked my ass off for.  I told him as much which resulted in a fight where he told me that I should leave my job because his is more important than mine since he \u201csaves lives everyday\u201d and I don\u2019t and ultimately most people could do my job with a \u201clittle bit of common sense\u201d whereas his is way more than just sitting at a desk all day (which I don\u2019t even do). When the subject of kids came up years ago, he said no because he wasn\u2019t ready and wanted to finish his education. Despite what I wanted, I accepted it and moved on because I understood where he was coming from and respected his feelings.  When I brought this up he said I was throwing it in his face and making him feel guilty for wanting to pursue his dreams. \n\nI had to walk away because I was so furious and hurt by what he said. And since that fight, I\u2019ve been thinking about it over and over and have found  myself thinking things i probably shouldn\u2019t and wanting to bring up how my unimportant career supported his ass while he accomplished his dreams but he didn\u2019t complain about how unimportant it was then. I supported him mentally, emotionally, and physically too and if he was up at home studying I was up helping him study, I made sure his clothes were clean and that he ate and slept and was comfortable when he came home after he had a long day despite me also having a long day. I dealt with my father passing away on my own because he was unavailable due to his training. I gave up my dream program, my original dream job, the place I loved and wanted to live forever and my desire to have kids so that he could accomplish his goals. I was depressed and miserable for years at a job I didn\u2019t like, in a city that I hated because it meant he was able get what he wanted in life. I know you\u2019re not supposed to do things with the intention of being paid back or \u201ckeeping score\u201d but I did all of those things because I love my husband and expected that, at the VERY LEAST, he would respect me and my career and be understanding and supportive of my wants and needs like I have been with him since the moment we got married. It just seems like I\u2019m the only one sacrificing and being selfless in our marriage. And not only that but my job is important. I may not be an MD or \u201csaving lives\u201d in the moment but I am making a significant difference and change in the lives of my patients and helping improve their quality of life and leading them to be healthier overall and work alongside several physicians who have recognized the positive impact I\u2019ve had on the lives of many people yet the one who matters most to me doesn\u2019t recognize or believe this and it hurts like hell honestly.  I\u2019m mad and hurt right now but I know that if the resentment fully sets in it\u2019ll be the worst case scenario. How do I stop this from happening and how do I stop feeling this way towards my husband? \n\nTl;Dr: Husband is being a jerk about my career and I feel myself starting to resent him and don\u2019t want these feelings to get any worse towards him. How can I stop having these thoughts about him and our marriage?",

            "I would double up on birth control because you guys have way too many issues to sort out in therapy before you ever get pregnant. You can\u2019t stop resenting him until he sees you as an equal partner and since he\u2019s a super important Dr. that\u2019s not going to happen easily apparently.",
            "This sounds almost exactly like a guy I grew up with, so I\u2019m going to give you the advice I wish I could tell his wife: you also get a say in your life together, and a partner who honestly believes they are more valuable than their partner is not someone to spend your life with. I\u2019m not saying you have to abandon ship now, but I am saying that now is absolutely the time to have a conversation about goals and your life together. You are not a terrible person for feeling that you shouldn\u2019t have to set aside everything you want. I can tell you as someone who did discuss and then moved twice with a partner and did want to stay home while our child is little that it is still hard, even with a husband encouraging me to go back to work or do what will make me happy. Definitely hold off on kids until you\u2019re both in agreement. Ask him to see your perspective. Your feelings are valid.",
            "I\u2019m not sure that you *should* stop having these thoughts about him or your marriage, because you\u2019re absolutely justified in feeling this way. He\u2019s marginalized your career - the same career that was good enough to support him through med school - and expects you to give it up to raise your children... you know, the ones he\u2019s too busy and important to raise himself. \n\nHave you considered marriage counseling? Does he know how you feel, and why you feel you\u2019ve accommodated his dreams all this time only for yours to be brushed off like this? Does he understand that he\u2019s basically saying that what he wants is more important than what you want is?",
            "Hi OP! Other commenters have touched on the worst of the situation here. I just want to make sure you know that everything you\u2019re feeling is so, so, so valid. It really sounds like your husband will not compromise. Do *not* quit your career for him right now. Your husband has, so far, gotten everything to go his way because you\u2019ve allowed it to. \n\nTell him everything you said here. How your \u201cunimportant\u201d career carried him through everything he ever wanted in his adult life, and that career wasn\u2019t just a placeholder for you. You have made sacrifice after sacrifice and left everyone you care about behind, just for him. You emotionally, physically, and financially supported him because you love him. Tell him what you\u2019re thinking - that marriage isn\u2019t tit for tat, you didn\u2019t make those sacrifices only to cash in on them later... but that you have compromised on every major thing you have wanted in this marriage, and goddamnit, he needs to be open to compromise, too. \n\nNow is your time to be selfish. You *get* to be selfish. Your life\u2019s work is significant. If he wants a kid so badly right now, he can research some good childcare options, because that\u2019s your line in the sand.\n\nDraw the line. Put yourself first. Because it sounds like you haven\u2019t in a long time.\n\nIf he isn\u2019t interested in compromise, then do think hard about what the future holds. Allow yourself the chance to feel your feelings. You only get one opportunity to live your life, don\u2019t throw all your desires away on someone else\u2019s behalf.",

He does not support you emotionally, he does not see you as a fully accomplished human being. \n\nYou guys need counselling, and I don\u2019t know if there is any hope even then.",

Got married out of undergrad and mom worked at a bank until dad finished residency. She moved all over the country for him- away from her family where she wanted to be. They\u2019re still married but haven\u2019t been happy for extended lengths of time for as long as I can remember- they\u2019ve started trying recently. It\u2019s definitely the  \u201cphysician\u201d mindset in my dad that makes him feel entitled and above the rest. It\u2019s HARD to have a dad and husband like that.. very hard. Demeaning to my mom and incredibly hard on my siblings and I. I can\u2019t put words in my moms mouth, but I can\u2019t imagine she would go back and do it all over again.

But I want to address the \u201cdon\u2019t want strangers raising my child.\u201d  If you have a nanny, they are NOT a stranger and quickly become a beloved part of the family as they help you take care of your child.  I have a 3 year old and she had a nanny from 9 - 20 months.  The nanny was amazing and really felt like a part of the family, not a stranger at all.  At just shy of two, we realized that my daughter needed more mental stimulation than my husband (who was the stay at home parent) could give her and we enrolled her into a Montessori day care.  She is thriving!  She loves her school, learning, and seeing her friends and teachers.  She\u2019s incredibly social and if we have a long stretch of days off, I can see where she gets antsy to go back to school (she\u2019s 3 now).  I have friends with a kid who is less social and that kid also thrives in daycare despite not needing as much social stimulation as my daughter does.\n\nPoint is...\u201ddon\u2019t want a stranger raising my child\u201d is a shitty thing to say, especially when he\u2019s not willing to give the time to be a part of raising the child. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s a controversial thing to say, but frankly, if you can find a nice school, I think putting a kid in a daycare/school is good for their development...\n\nAgain, your husband sounds like a real piece of work...",

            "Most people have already said the various things I'd say, but I want to make two points. \n\nOne - you say he was \"unavailable due to his training\" to help support you when your father passed. The death of a parent is a difficult and awful thing to go through,  especially since it seems likely you were still a young adult and should have been able to expect your father to be around a lot longer. I understand med training is very difficult,  but someone who couldn't make even a small effort to be there for you through something that difficult is not very likely to be there for you through other difficulties. And as many people have mentioned - raising kids is hard.\n\nTwo, I'm super suspicious of the timing. You mentioned getting a large promotion end of 2018 and then he starts pushing for kids and you to leave work only a few months later? That reads to me, with everything else you've said, of someone who enjoys the lime light and being the important one and the Big Job in the relationship. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out he's jealous of your promotion and wants to clip your wings a bit because he's used to you being in his shadow and only supporting him. \n\nPlease, please do not bring children into this marriage without couples counseling, a pronounced change in his attitude, and you getting to choose whether you stay at work or not. And if you do wind up having kids and staying home? Make very sure you have a close eye on and joint control over finances and keep a decent chunk of your own money separate.",

            "Good lord this is like reading a snippet out of the book about my mom and dad.\nMy mom was a teacher and my dad was a kidney transplant surgeon/urologist. \nMy dad expected my mom to quit her job when he was done with residency and have kids.\nShe already had two from a previous abusive marriage, but felt it would be selfish if she didn\u2019t give him his own biological kids too. He wanted 3, she had two.\nThe world revolves around his career. My sister and I hardly ever saw dad. Mom did everything, maintained our huge mansion, every softball game, gymnastics meet, doctor\u2019s appt, etc. She helped start his practice, maintained his books, did his taxes, etc.\nDad drank more and more every year. He had a quick temper that alcohol makes 10X worse.\nMom became disgusted and resentful. She became depressed.\nDad begins to obsess over a new hobby every 6 months, so whatever \u201coff\u201d time he did have was now sucked up with golf, painting, gardening, etc. \nTwenty years of marriage and she gives him the ultimatum: quit drinking or we are done.\nHe was out the door. Had a new girlfriend within a month and bought her a Porsche the next month. \nHe didn\u2019t feel my mom deserved a dime of \u201chis\u201d money. He went to school for a decade and saved lives so why should she get anything? He didn\u2019t pay her a cent of child support or alimony until the divorce was final. He kept appealing, stalling, delaying and filing motions in court. He had the deep pockets and said to my sister and I \u201cI will keep taking her back to court, which forces her to pay her lawyer, until she is broke, homeless or dead.\u201d\nAnd we knew he meant it.\nShe had three suicide attempts that year.\nSo my sister and I, along with our half brother and sister, decided to try and stop him.\nWe wrote a letter detailing how much my father drinks, how he is drunk every night, how we have witnessed him give orders to nurses over the phone while drunk and have seen him stumble out of the house drunk on the way to the hospital because a kidney retrieval has become available. \nWe sent it to his lawyer and said if he didn\u2019t leave Mom alone, accept the final divorce decree and leave Mom alone, we would send the letter to the state medical licensing board.\nIt worked.\nHe finally left her alone, but didn\u2019t speak to any of us \u201cspoiled\u201d kids for years.\nI feel really bad for you OP, and hope your husband is t as much of an egotistical, narcissistic person like my father is. I am glad to hear you know there is something wrong and I hope counseling will really help you both.\nIt takes two parents to raise good kids. My siblings have really suffered, one is in prison for 11 years, one has such bad mental health issues she can\u2019t work and no one in our family speaks to her, my sister is bulimic and has only recently gotten a job at 38 and I married a guy just like my dad and divorced him when I finally realize it.\nStay strong and know your worth.

I have always been adamant that his paychecks are our money, me staying home allows him to have the life he has, I put in at least equal work in the relationship, making money is not half and he still has to do stuff around the house and with the kids, etc.\n\nMy husband saw that I was right with all of these things; he doesn\u2019t just go along with it to keep me happy.

I'm sorry if that's too blunt, I really feel for you.\n\nThere are plenty of awesome comments here already, but I wanted to add something else about having children, if you do want to have children at some point. Even if you are both on the same page about staying at home vs childcare or nanny, even if he was supportive, even if he was involved in their care, in taking care of household chores, thought load etc. Having kids is HARD. Rewarding but hard work. It might be hard to conceive them (it was for us); there's a possibility of morning sickness, pregnancy complications, birth complications, premature birth, etc. So many things that have a non-negligible possibility of occurring, that you would need time off work, appointments, someone to take care of you or provide emotional support. Then the baby is here - the relentless nature of feeding, diaper changes, sleep deprivation, mountains of washing, sickness, tantrums etc. What if the child has additional needs? Then there's still the thought load and household chores of shopping, cooking, cleaning, medical appointments, daycare pickups (if this is possible), paying bills, etc.\n\nI am not pointing out any of this to put you off ever having children - but to ask if you would really consider ever having a child with this man who will leave everything I've listed up to you. It's harder if you have a partner who doesn't lift a finger and demeans you at every turn.

All the loving parent/child things - will he be there for those? I can promise you that will build resentment in you as much as him not being there in the trenches.\n\nYou have these feelings for a reason; consider counselling for yourself to explore these feelings, and remember that it is okay for you to expect your partner to respect you, respect your dreams, compromise and discuss, and put the welfare of his relationship and family ahead of his ego.",

I can't seem to find that part.  \n\nBy my read, it seems like you have busted your ass to make his dreams come true, but he has paid little or no attention to your dreams or what you want from life.  This is a perfect example- HE wants a baby, you are expected to drop your dream career and raise his kid because he wants you to.  There is (as far as I can tell) little or no consideration about what YOU want.  \n\nFurthermore, he sees your job as unimportant because you aren't saving lives.

Your problem is that you and your husband have an unequal relationship.  You give lots of support to him, and make his dreams come true, but he doesn't give that support to you or try to make your dreams come true.  He is so worried about his own dreams he does not even consider yours.  \n\nI would strongly suggest have a sit down conversation with him.  Pick a time when you are both not stressed.  Tell him, without yelling at all, that you love him and care for him and want him to be happy, but you feel like the things in life that make you happy are not a big consideration for him.  DON'T be accusing.  You want him to sympathize with you, and he won't do that if he's defensive.  Tell him about how you happily sacrificed your life and career and whatnot because it made him happy, and now he's got his dream career as a doctor and you are happy for him.  But you feel like he is not at all considering what will make you happy- he's only going for what makes him happy and you feel like you're just a support system for his happiness, you want to be his partner.  And that means that now that you both are established, you make decisions as a team, so you both are happy.  \n\nIf that doesn't work, you should get some counseling...",

            "  \n\nSo to recap:  \n \n\n\\* You supported him through med school and whatever he was making eventually, he put towards his student loans.  \n \\* You have changed your Master\u2019s program for him.  \n \\* He got into a residency program without really discussing this with you and you moved again for him.  \n \\* Because of this moving, you ended up in a job you hated but with it you supported him with his education/training. Any money he made he put towards repaying his student loans.  \n \\* He is now finished with residency and you have a job that you love and you got a major promotion in it last year. (yeay for you!!!)\n\nHw seems to have a very different view on what the distribution of tasks/roles should be in your marriage/life together once there are kids:\n\n\\* He doesn\u2019t want a nanny/daycare for your future children.  \n \\* You have no family to support you two because you moved away (for his career).  \n \\* He does not want to quit his job or cut his hours.  \n \\* He expects you to quit your job or cut your hours.\n\nHe does not respect your job role in any way because he compares it to his job which, in his eyes, is about saving lives, and he thinks most people could do your job just with common sense (eehh, I bet that\u2019s why you have degrees, right, because you could get this job just with a high-school diploma only?). It sounds like the topic of kids came up in the past and he said no because of his education/career. I think that is fair, because kids cost a lot of money and ideally you would be fairly settled and not have to up and move, let alone more than once, when they are small. However, now that your career is going really well, he wants you two to start a family.\n\nConsidering you are both 33, it is fair to really start trying for a family now. You are young enough but waiting much longer to start would be really pushing it, since, on average, female fertility decreases as we get older and takes quite a bit of a nose dive from 35 on (again, these are averages, there are women who have no issue to conceive at 40, but there are also women at 35, or even younger, who do not manage to get pregnant).\n\nHowever, I can understand your resentment because when you were ready, he didn\u2019t feel ready. Now that he is ready, he doesn\u2019t accept that for you it is not the best time.\n\nI think that especially when both partners have a lot going on in their lives (career, volunteering, own business, travel) having kids is never a good time. Because it will mean giving up a lot. People who don\u2019t have much going in their life won\u2019t feel they are making as many sacrifices as very active people.\n\nIt sounds as if he\u2019s not willing to give up his career, and he shouldn\u2019t have to considering the tremendous effort, sacrifice, debt, hard work, etc that comes with pursuing a medical degree, residency, to become a consultant. In his eyes, your career is \u2018worth less\u2019 because it may only have taken an undergraduate or 4-year degree to get this job, not realizing all the things you\u2019ve learned through your different jobs, that ended up in your current position and the promotion. I don\u2019t know what your job is, but in some ways I can understand his reasoning. Consultants/specialists are very rare and take many many years and lots of money to become. I think there are few jobs that really compare on that level with regards to how rare it is, how much it costs both wrt tuition, time, effort, commitment, and sacrifices. However, he doesn\u2019t get to decide for you that your job is insignificant enough to give up for kids. That is something that you should want yourself and it\u2019s clear you don\u2019t want to at the moment.\n\nHave you two never talked about what the expected roles would be for when you would have kids? Maybe he assumed you\u2019d end up quitting your job because you are the woman and he\u2019s the one with a medical career. Maybe you assumed you\u2019d both cut hours and share the responsibility for care. Did you not explicitly talk about this, and when to start a family? If you wanted children years ago and he wasn\u2019t ready, what did you expect would come from postponing it? You are 33 now, you can not keep postponing pregnancy. Do you want children enough that you are willing to take a few years out of your job now to have children with this man? If you are unwilling to do this with him, but you do for sure want children, what are the alternatives? Divorce, and then be a 33-34 year old single woman looking for a man to basically start having a family with NOW? That means you may not find someone that is as \u2018good\u2019 as your current partner (in whatever aspect that matters to you for a committed relationship) meaning you may end up settling or childless (because you may not conceive a few years from now).\n\nYou can\u2019t change anything that happened in the past. I suspect you two have never explicitly talked about a time line for children and who would do what, and you are now in this terrible situation. You have indeed sacrificed a lot for him and his career and he now expects you to sacrifice even more.\n\nMaybe you can send him a letter in which you explain all the major ways you\u2019ve made sacrifices over the years. That they were sometimes very hard, but you did this because you love him and wanted to support his education and career. That you were miserable in jobs but kept them because you were the only breadwinner (even if he was making money, if all that went to repay loans, he wasn\u2019t contributing). And now that you have found something you are good at and love doing, he expects you to sacrifice all that again to care for his children. That you wonder whether he understands all the sacrifices you made, or just thinks nothing of it. \n\nHe honestly sounds incredibly selfish, and you sound selfless. I think you need to decide if you really want to have children. If you aren\u2019t super set on ever having them, maybe reconsider this whole relationship. Him expecting you to bend in whatever way is best for HIS career is not a good basis for a relationship. It would have been fine if from early on, you would have said you wanted nothing more than a family and would be flexible wrt his education/career. There are women who are happy in this role. It doesn\u2019t sound like you are, but that he expects you to be this type of person.\n\nSorry L.",

And if you tell him and he gets angry, he is crazy then. So, if he doesn't want to go, you should go, because it's causing you to feel down and changes begin with oneself. I'm not saying that you are wrong, I'm saying that with a little help you can approach this moments with the support of a specialized person in that matter. Without all the heavy charge in your back. Maybe with that help, you can convince your husband to go together at a professional. And he knows it! It's just his ego is beyond his head now, he needs to calm down. Every job is important and we people with a little sense of common know that. \nHope everything goes ok.\n\nPD: Plase don't have children with a person like that. Good parents are happy parents with a healthy relationship.",

If he isn\u2019t interested in that sounds like he wants only the fun parts of progeny without the work and nobody has time for that sexist 50s bs. \n\nCompromise is important but you\u2019ve got to learn to say no or ah hell no because he\u2019s been going jump and you\u2019ve been asking how high and now you have a spoiled brat on your hands",

If everyone was a clinician, then who's going to teach, to make sure the medical supplies are stocked, machines are functioning, staff are paid, patient's are reminded of their appointment, payments are processed, etc etc. All of these \"unimportant\" jobs are every bit as important. \n\nYour feelings are valid, and being in a relationship is all about compromise and sacrifices, but it's not one where one party only gives, the other just takes. You need to push back on this and consider counselling. Talk to him. Tell him everything you wrote here and make a list of your points. As it stands, it doesn't seems like he sees you as an equal partner, but someone who provides the things he needs.",
            "I think there's a difference between \"keeping score\" and expecting your partner to treat you with the same love, respect and support you treat them with.\n\nMy advice is to take a step back and calm down so that you can explain how you feel to him rationally. You're right, you shouldn't let the resentment sink in. Before that happens, you need to make sure that you clearly tell your husband how his actions have made you feel. Theres a chance that some of your emotions or expectations haven't been communicated to him cleary, but if thats the case then if you lay them all out you can both start working towards a solution to the issue.\n\nIf you've made everthing clear and he still responds negatively, you might need a more drastic solution that involves major compromises if you want to stay together.",

I forgot that somewhere during my marriage. I can state what I want, and what I need, and that\u2019s enough. I don\u2019t need to *convince* my partner that my feelings are valid, and I certainly don\u2019t need to tolerate invalidation.\n\nFWIW, my STBXW and I still share a full time nanny for our two daughters and it\u2019s awesome! A Nanny couldn\u2019t possibly replace actual parents. In fact, in my opinion, it enhances parenthood so much more.

You stop feeling this way by not being in that situation anymore. Put your foot down on the children thing first, because you don't want to have any before this is resolved. Then figure out what's up with your husband - is he reflexively working from cultural scripts without having deeply thought about them and their implications or realized that they are unacceptable to you, such that he can be made to come around, realize how disrespectful he is of your life choices and be better? Or does he actually not respect you? In the former case you can fix things, the latter not so much.",

Sometimes you have to sacrifice for your partner but that is a two way street. You cant be the one always sacrificing your wants and needs for his. You have done so much for him and yet he wants more and he doesn't take your wants or needs into account. You need to stand up for yourself and have a conversation with him and how you feel.

            "it sounds like he's been able to be completely selfish through med school and residency because he really didn't have to worry about anyone but himself. he had you do do everything for him (pay his bills cook his meals wash his clothes emotionally/mentally support him) and never gave anything back to you (not even when you lost a loved one). He's learned to be selfish in the relationship because that's the only expectation that has ever been set. It would be really hard to change that now, especially since he sounds like he's also turned into an incredibly condescending, arrogant asshole. If you did decide to have kids with him, does he really even sound like he would make a good father or a supportive partner? He basically expects you to quit your job and raise the kid by yourself while he continues to focus on himself by dedicating all his energy to his job. This really doesn't sound like a give and take relationship. It sounds like he only wants to take and that's incredibly unhealthy. You are completely right to be having the thoughts you are having and you've handled all of this way better than most people would which clearly shows you love the guy but it doesn't sound like he's willing to be an equal partner to you and if that doesn't change the relationship will never get better, it will get worse, and these feelings will never go away, they will get worse too. He needs a reality check and some couples counseling before I'd even consider staying in a relationship with him, never mind bringing kids into it.",

So if you do go the childcare route you'll be fine!

Have any affectionate \u201cthank yous\u201d and other similar supportive and validating statements ever been conveyed by him to you throughout this journey?\n\nWith all that in mind, I have to say that there seems to be a lack of communication on two critical things: First the degree to which you value your job and how important it is to your sense of fulfillment, and second the entire dynamic of having kids. Either these conversations were already had and your views were clearly articulated, or he doesn\u2019t care, or they were held (or at least tacitly understood) but both of your value systems have since shifted course to a pretty significant degree and are very different from how they were during the time when he was in residency. The friction may be arising out of an inherent realization by you and him that your respective visions together may have diverged, and stems also from a lack of emotional validation by him to you.\n\nWere you willing to quit before but have now advanced far enough in your expertise/position/capabilities to where your career is more important to you than a few years ago? If that\u2019s the case, then your guys\u2019 values have definitely changed. When you wanted kids back then, was there ever a discussion on who will raise the kids once that time comes? Has your career always been this categorical to your life goals and fulfillment?

He didn\u2019t mind the stability you provided throughout his training, and now that he\u2019s done, he has this lucid vision for how the future will play out. These things need to be 100% crystal clear from the beginning of a marriage and any shifts in course are only going to be as seamless as the extent to which you guys are emotionally supporting one another and functioning as a true team.\n\nWhat needs to happen: He needs to realize how important your contributions have been for you to get to this point together. There needs to be an assessment of who raises the kids. He needs to know 100% where you stand on your career 30 years from now. He needs to be emotionally available and validate you in every sense and vice versa. Do not live another 30 years together with the approach that got you two to this point.",

            "I agree with a lot of comments. He really seems to hold himself highly. Which to me is such a turn off. Especially since you supported him for so long regardless of what you wanted. In a lot of relationships there's a giver and a taker. It's definitely NOT healthy but ends up happening a lot. And you are obviously the giver and the one who sacrifices what you want/need for your partner. And he's the taker where he lets you sacrifice while he gains. This dynamic is NOT good. Combined with his self righteousness...not good. I would suggest marriage counseling. But you are 100% valid in your feelings. Relationships should be 50/50 effort. He's not putting in the effort and so you feel resentment towards him. Either you guys go to counseling and he sees where his flaws lay and tries to change, you decide to just deal with it and stay in an unhappy situation, or you divorce.",

Does he have any plans to pay back all the money you\u2019ve invested in him? Or is his idea of that making you quit your job and start breeding, & looking after his spawn full time? Cause you are gonna get exactly zero help. And since homeboy has never supported himself in his adult life, what happens if he gets stingy as soon as he controls the money?",

            "Reading your story made me sad because of just how unappreciated you are by your husband. If anyone should be changing how they feel it\u2019s your husband. You have gone above and beyond for your relationship and your job is not less important than his for a) you care about it and b) it\u2019s the only reason he has his. Having kids is something both of you should be ready and willing to make sacrifices for. I know if you bring it up again it will lead to a fight again but I see your point of view and he should too. \n\nSo in conclusion the only advice I can give you is to talk out your feelings with your husband perhaps in therapy so that there\u2019s someone else and it doesn\u2019t lead to anger and having those feelings be unheard.",

            "33M, physician here.  I am still single (in a relationship...just not married yet).  I have never had to personally experience this, but being the non married guy through college/med school/residency/early career I have witnessed a variety of different dynamics when it comes to physician's relationships.  \n\nThe ones who are in long term relationships during training.  The non physician supports the person through training and when the physician finishes, that person either stops working or works much less.  Most of the time, this has been agreed on for years and there are no fights.  Also FYI, I know at least as many couples who's husband was the one who quit their career so I don't think this is necessarily a \"sexist\" thing.  \n\nAnother group are the couples who both have \"important\" careers.   This is a lot of time 2 physicians, but could be anything.  (I am using the word important in the sense of \"important to them.  I am not trying to get into the pissing contest of who has the more important job).   Sometimes this works great with each making their own sacrifices, but at the end of the day each respecting what the other does.  \n\nSometimes this does not work out so well.  They are not willing to sacrifice for each other and their respective careers end up being more important than the relationship.  This never ends up working out in the long term in my opinion.\n\nI get it that so far you have been the one to sacrifice and certainly it sounds as though it is his turn, but I would think of it in simpler terms.  Both of you have careers that you find important, but at this point neither of you are willing to sacrifice what it takes for the relationship (at least in the eyes of the other person).   I would try to keep the discussion focused on this.  Pulling out some sort of list of things you have done for him up to this point is only going to start more arguments.  Just tell him your career is important to you.  You want a family, but are only willing to do so if you can continue your career.  If he is not willing to discuss a way forward with those terms, then I don't think you guys have anything left to talk about.  You are 33 with a good career and no kids, there are other fish in the pond who are more than happy that you work.  He's 33 with a good career and he can certainly find plenty of women who will stay home and raise kids.

            "I\u2019ve dealt with the same issue in my marriage early on.\n\nThe key for me was leveling the playing field and humbling him. Everyone is smart and important. We have wants and needs specific to us, and in our relationships we deserve to have them fulfilled as equals. Sometimes that means compromise, but never willful neglect.\nWhen you marry someone, you are both agreeing to take care of one another. That \u201ccare\u201d is usually something we make up in our mind based on our perception of the world. And, many times it\u2019s not suitable for another person. That means we have to be open and talk about our wants and needs, and also listen wholeheartedly. In a relationship, you should want to see your partner happy, successful and thriving. So, if they communicate what they want, you should be amenable. \nBut, not everyone is so flexible, and I\u2019ll get to that below. \n\nFirst, you should tell your husband the things you\u2019ve been thinking. You worked very hard while he was working very hard. You spent hours of your time struggling to make money, study, and deal with what came in life so he could focus on med school. Neither of those things would be possible without you both. If you wanted to be together and he wanted med school that had to happen. He should see you as an equal in that struggle. You need to tell him, and also make note that he should never belittle you or your efforts again. You are his partner, not a dependent.\n\nJust because you aren\u2019t a doctor doesn\u2019t mean your job isn\u2019t important. Whether you sell hot dogs out of a van or are a nuclear physicist, if your job makes you feel successful and fulfilled it is important because YOU are important. Your happiness is key here. All of the time you spend are hours that matter. Chances are too, that you are the lead in this relationship. You likely clean or cook, and make decisions about where to be when. You may also be the emotional raft in the relationship, keeping up his needs for intimacy. He is seeing you as beneath him, yet you do as much. Your time and effort are equal to his. Things need to be leveled. \n\nBack to the flexibility. When I had this blow-out with my husband, he was amenable. He tends to tuck his ego away in arguments with me, because he sees me as an equal. We had to work on this though. When we started our relationship, I said I needed honesty and communication. If he couldn\u2019t give me that I\u2019d leave. It took a while for him to learn how to communicate, really. He had to be open and thoughtful in ways he\u2019d never been. It mattered to him that I was happy, so he pushed. We had many fights, it was tough but we both wanted it to worked so we kept going.\n\nIt could be hard for you to level with him if you don\u2019t have an open channel of communication. He may not want to go that far because he doesn\u2019t perceive value in what\u2019s not already in his head. He might try and brush it off. He might fight, say you are nagging, or say it\u2019s not important. He may be very comfortable in the relationship now if he hasn\u2019t had to compromise much.\n\nIf any of that is true, you need to push. You have to become an equal in his mind. You need to openly communicate how you feel and figure out what\u2019s best for both of you. You both need to value each other\u2019s needs/wants.\n\nSome questions to think about:\n\nHave you and your husband talked about your life plan? What you both see as important, and what the timeline is for it all in your head?\n\nHas your husband talked to you this way before? What have you done when he\u2019s said or insinuated stuff like this?\n\nHave you made clear the importance your career holds for you?

Residency is a different animal and you MUST apply everywhere so you don't short change yourself. An automated lottery system will match you to one place and one place only after all your interviews.

And you certainly must enforce those boundaries by following through with the promised consequences for crossing your boundaries.",
            "I think you are 100% right to feel this way. It seems like you have tried to be reasonable and self sacrificing at every step of the marriage and he is reluctant to even try to compromise now that you both have settled into careers. \n\nYou have goals and dreams that you want to pursue. It is your life too. How can he expect you to sacrifice it all because of some ideal situation he wants that he never mentioned to you at all during your relationship before?  You Being a stay at home mom would have been something he should have been open about a long time ago. \n\nYou have been extremely helpful in the pursuit of your husbands career and understand the value of him being a physician. But he is lording it over your head and making you feel powerless. \n\nI think you basically need to tell him what you have just written in the most civil way possible. That you made all the sacrifices you did and supported him because you loved him and wanted him to reach his goals. But now that you are settled and you are also finally happy in your career that you feel hurt that he is not even trying to compromise or do the same for you but instead has these unfair expectations. And insults the nature of your career because it\u2019s not directly linked to someone\u2019s life and death.",

            "Wow... lots of comments already here. And almost every one of them, I agree with. He is selfish and arrogant. He does not value you, and I'm not even sure he sees you. It's sad that he cannot see past his fantasy world of how things will work out. I know a lot of people are saying to just get out... and I'm not sure that I wouldn't agree... but if you want this to work out, then here's what you need to do (and this is coming from a guy who used to be a selfish jerk with a perfect plan... that didn't work out): you need to sit him down, phones off, with eye contact, and \n\n1. Be 100% honest about how you feel he is treating you. Let him know that you feel used, neglected and marginalized.\n\n2. Discover why he does not value your input on his plans for your life together.\n\n3. Communicate how important your career is to you at the moment. That you're not ready to leave it. If you choose to bring up all you've done to help him get where he is, take note of two of the ways he might respond (I don't know his personality,  so these are guesses). If he truly doesn't know, then informing him can put him on the defensive, you'll have to pull him back to the middle to continue the discussion. If he does know, then he might just shut down because it will feel like you are keeping score (and his score is obviously based on his career and how many \"lives he's saved\", not your career or y'all's relationship). You can possibly open him up again with questions about what he thinks would have been better alternatives. Hopefully, he will be in a moment of clarity and see the difficulty of what he's asked you to do.\n\n4. Identify why its important to him that you are the one raising the kids? Did he have a prior bad experience maybe? If there's no logic behind his notion, then you bringing logic on your side will be more convincing.\n\n5. Work out a long term plan. How long do you want to stay in your current job? Is there any point you could see taking a break for 3-4 years? How long does he see staying on his job? Is there a point where he will want to move again? So on and so forth. He's not going to include you in his plans unless you make them together... so try to do just that. In fact, you can tell him that. It might stick with him just enough that he'll try to include you a bit more in the future.\n\nUnfortunately, none of this works if he's not in a clear, open mind. If he comes into this thinking that you're gunning for him, he's going to shut down before any discussion starts. If he comes into this worn out, he'll say anything and agree to anything to finish the discussion without intent to see it through. Based on how he responds to the first discussion point should tell you if you need to discuss the rest with a counselor present (very likely, imo).\n\nI will say, even if he changes the things you have mentioned, he is still an arrogant, selfish, egotistical person and I would carefully consider if you even want to have a family with him. \ud83d\ude25",

Ending the relationship solved all my problems.",
            "How do you stop resenting an entitled, selfish, ungrateful husband? You either pretend nothing is happening or acknowledge why is that you feel resentful. First of all: Besides all the sacrifices you have made for this man because obviously you love him and wanted the best for him and your marriage... What about you? He is now a doctor, in part thanks to your support (financial, logistical, emotional, etc.) and the way he is repaying you by his lack of respect towards you is something that is unacceptable. If you \u201cforgive\u201d his behavior,  the resentment will be shoved down your body because you aren\u2019t listening to it. You might get sick, you might even get depressed, anxious, or start hating this man. \n\nListen to what your body and mind is telling you about your husband. You helped him grow but instead he wants to disregard your concerns and use you. Put a stop to it. Say NO. You have done more than enough for him and you need to think about yourself this time. What is he doing for you now? Humiliating you. You sound like a smart woman and staying with the horrible person he has morphed into now would mean pain for you. Consider all your options because deep down you know you don\u2019t want to have kids with him.",
            "It doesn't sound like you need help not resenting your husband, it sounds like your husband's behavior and entitlements have given you perfectly legitimate reasons to resent him. There's no amount of self-work you'll be able to do to stop resenting him over this because the problem doesn't lie within you, it lies within him. \n\nAs much as you may want to be able to fix this all on your own, to some extent this is out of your control. Whether these feelings go away is dependent on your husband turning around and appreciating you and doing his fair share of housework and prioritizing potential childcare (and following through, I've heard a lot of horror stories of men who promised to 'help out' with their kids and then didn't). And to some extent it'll be dependent on him finding it within himself to value you on his own, because if you have to lead about or give him ultimatums to get his respect then that will be a valid point of resentment as well (you don't have to fight with a good spouse to get them to value what you do). \n\nTL;DR: When your husband devalues you until you resent him, that's a him problem, not a you problem.",
            "Your husband does want a nanny.  He wants you to be the anny.\n\nAlso, people in the childcare industry are often trained in how to educate children.  So take his comment and twist it like this:\n\nI don't want anyone else teaching my child quantum physics, so you, dear wife, who knows nothing g at all about quantum physics, should be the one to do it.\n\nDoes that make even the slightest amount of sense?  If he thinks it does, he's not ready to have children.",
            "\n\nI see one good solution for the both of you but it will be a compromise on both sides. You reserve the right to your body but as husband and wife I mean I\u2019m sure you expected children at some point and if you both have stable jobs I don\u2019t see why not. A baby doesn\u2019t come in 1 day, it takes 9 months and that is plenty of time to get to know people and find someone trust worthy to help care for you child. Because to be honest this is the best solution for you two. You get to keep your career and he gets to have a child. Personally, I am like your husband in the fact that I really would hate my child to be cared for by someone else especially at a young age but this is the west and it happens all the time. Kids don\u2019t have to hold you back, and you and your husband can also work out a schedule together for caring for your child. He needs to give up his traditional thinking because there is absolutely nothing traditional in our generation. Don\u2019t resent each other ! those 15 years are not for nothing! You guys are just both mad and need time to cool. \nPersonally, I wish my husband was a dr so I could stay home take care of my child, cook, home decor and such but I understand how hard you\u2019ve worked on your career and it\u2019s so annoying to give it up. because then what was the point of it all? Idc what culture, race or religion. Women have it tough because we are the baby makers lol!",
            "This does seem like a conversation that should have been had before marriage. I don\u2019t think this is going to work out long term in my opinion. Side note, daycare is very healthy for a child both academically and socially. Perhaps more research on the subject and tours of facilities will help him sway his opinion on \u201cstrangers\u201d raising your children. School settings are a part of life for children, of all ages.",
            "Do you think that maybe you repressed a lot of feelings so that you could do everything you could for your husband? It doesn\u2019t sound like the same has been done for you, in fact it sounds like it\u2019s been pretty one sided. Normally I\u2019d advertise not to keep score, but in a situation like this, it sounds like he\u2019s just pursuing his own dreams, with little regard for you, and now expects you to do as he says. \n\nHonestly, I can\u2019t blame him. You have a very spoiled husband that got everything he ever wanted from you. If he receives anything less than the same treatment, he will feel as if he is being cheated, the same way a spoiled child will expect to be coddled. I can, however, blame him for going along with this treatment without reciprocating. No one can maintain the level of one sided dedication you described for long and I\u2019m baffled that you managed to do so for as long as you did. Don\u2019t repress your feelings any longer. Don\u2019t control how you are thinking. Take some time alone and collect what you\u2019re thinking and feeling into something tangible so that you can tell your husband how you feel. Write it all down if you have to. If you\u2019re scared  he won\u2019t back down, that should give you all the reason you need to continue. People that refuse to legitimize a person\u2019s feelings regarding a situation, and remain fixated on their own, are also the kinds of people that want others to break before them. Don\u2019t back down until you are heard. You\u2019ve been catering to his needs for far too long to deserve anything less.",
            "I agree that he shouldn't expect you to sideline your career. I suggest since he is a physician maybe switch his shift to work nights while you work days. I know many RN families that swear by this. It is a bit of a juggling act but it is workable. Ultimately he is throwing this MD entitlement in your face. Just because he became a MD doesnt mean he is better than you. Marriage is a partnership and should go both ways.",

Speaking as someone who is about to start residency, it can be so difficult at times because those going into medicine can be very unavailable emotionally at times. It is a very rigid process and for the most part, a single pathway that the spouses have to choose to get on board with. I am concerned about the lack of consultation with you on where to go for residency. The fact that he\u2019s completely dismissing all that you\u2019ve done for him and expects you to give up your dreams for having kids is not right. Your husband is seeming very inconsiderate of your needs and desires and it appears this has been going on for some time. Marriage counseling would be your best bet here.",

            "To answer your question, you need to find a way to forgive him. But he does sound like a jerk -- if he's not willing to move at all, you need counseling at the very least, or you need to somehow get across to him how important this is to you.\n\nReading your comment, I'm just as frustrated as you with him. But the way to get rid of resentment is to move to forgiveness. Just be smart about doing that -- if you can forgive with a whole, loving heart, great, but also don't be a doormat, or give someone forgiveness when they haven't shown any remorse or empathy.",
            "I don't know that you can or should stop having these thoughts. Your anger is completely justified. The only thing that may help prevent future resentment is communicating how hurt you are and why you are not going to give up your job for a child. Also... I'd say for you not to resent him, he'd have to agree that you aren't having a kid when you're not ready and you're not quitting your job to be a stay at home mom when and if you do have a kid. You could try writing down a list of your most important points so that you remember them all for the conversation, but wait until you're relatively calm and let him know you want to discuss things he said that were hurtful. If he starts fighting, end the conversation. The thing is, you have given him everything so that he can have his dream and he responds by actively trying to take your dream away and then belittling it. That's not something you just have to accept and get over. He disrespected the *years* of physical, mental and emotional work you did to get him where he is.",

            "You have every right to feel this way but I would get him to agree that you won\u2019t quit your job until your maternity leave is up. You won\u2019t know how you feel until you have a baby. I\u2019ve seen women who said they wanted to keep working (with husbands who really want them to also keep working) decide it wasn\u2019t going to work after the baby came and they figured out a way to make it work. I\u2019ve seen single moms who wish they had the option to stay at home. It doesn\u2019t mean your feelings aren\u2019t valid but I think you should leave as many options open.

Can you both agree to give it six months? Maybe plan a really fun vacation you can only enjoy without children. I think it\u2019s possible once he stops pressuring you and you have a full year in your new job you may feel ready. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d only agree to be a stay at home mom with this man if he agrees that you need to employ a part time sitter so that you can get chores done/get out of the house alone and do things that will make you happy and be the best mom/wife to him and your children. This will take the whole I don\u2019t want someone else raising our children off the table. You will need help - especially if he has a demanding speciality. If he can\u2019t agree to that then you may need to really reconsider your relationship because he\u2019s just being controlling.",
            "Marriages are supposed to be equal. Both parties matter equally. It's ok for one of their careers to take priority, if both parties agree and are ok with it. It should never just be expected from either party. Both parties deserve equal consideration and neither has the right to demand things from the other. I would never demand my husband give up his career to raise our future children. I would never even pressure him to do that. We'd discuss, as a team, what would work for everyone, him, me, and the kids. Your husband just wants you to do what's best for him and what he thinks is best for your kids and doesn't seem to care about your happiness. And that's messed up. A partner shouldn't be someone you expect to sacrifice everything for you so you can be happy. I definitely think marriage counseling is called for, but he also needs his own personal treatment, because he seems very confused about how to treat people and what they owe him.",
            "OP, as a doctor married to a non-doctor, I can tell you that telling my husband that my job is \"more important\" than him because I \"save lives\" is a fast track to our marriage being doomed. He enjoys his career as much as I enjoy mine. He's sacrificed things to help support me through my medical training, which I greatly appreciate. We've also compromised on things I want because that's how a partnership works. I would never demand that he quit his job to take care of children. You both need counseling (if he's willing to go) or to find a partner that values you (and your job/career) equal to his own."

Thank you to everyone who offered help and advice.  For those that offered monetary assistance, Jonah and I were in a stable position financially -- I'm going to be comfortable until I decide to go back to work.  Your willingness to help was deeply appreciated, however, and I'm truly bowled over by your kindness.\n\nI took the advice of the majority of comments, and called the chapel where Marjorie was planning her service.  I spoke with the pastor, who immediately told me that he had been trying to get in touch with me regarding the service -- apparently both Jonah and Marjorie had grown up in that church (I am not religious, and neither was Jonah as an adult).  My voicemail has been flooded, so it's definitely plausible that I overlooked his call. \n\nHe immediately expressed how sorry he was to hear of Jonah's loss, and said he had received my contact info from Jonah's great-aunt who still attends there.  He said he was surprised when Marjorie asked to have a service for Jonah, but she had claimed that Jonah and I were separated and I didn't want to be involved.  He had been trying to follow up with me, but obviously that didn't happen.\n\nHe was very apologetic, and said that we could cancel the service, or move forward in any way that felt right to me.  He said that he knew the church members would appreciate the service, since many of them remembered Jonah as a boy, but obviously Marjorie would no longer have a role.  I agreed that the service could go forward.\n\nHe called to speak with Marjorie after our conversation, and informed her that she was no longer welcome to participate in the organization of the service after her behavior.  He wouldn't tell me all that she said, but says she was distraught, and he recommended some mental health/spiritual services to her that he hopes she accepts.  She apparently apologized for lying, and asked to speak with me -- but I declined.  I feel bad if she's truly contrite, but I just have too much on my plate right now.\n\nWe had two beautiful services for my husband -- first the one at his hometown church, and then the non-religious one that I planned.  Everyone that came wanted to honor Jonah, and that's all that really matters.  I was told a dozen stories about him that I'd never heard before, and I laughed so hard I cried, then cried some more.  My cousin was on the lookout for Marjorie, and I honestly didn't think about her the whole weekend.  She turned up for the first service, and the pastor ended up speaking with her (unbeknownst to me).  My cousin says he was sympathetic but firm, and told her that her presence there would be inappropriate.  Surprisingly, she left without fuss.\n\nI'm still not sure this situation is entirely resolved, but I got to lay my husband to rest in the way he deserved, and that's the most important thing to me right now.  \n\nThanks everyone for your support.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: Called the chapel, spoke with Marjorie, and had two wonderful services for my husband.\n\n[UPDATE 2]. I debated whether or not to even mention this, but this community has been so awesome I thought I might as well -- I realized this weekend that I'd missed my period, and I'm usually like clockwork.  It could just be stress, but I'm going to take a test later.  Can't decide if I'm incredibly hopeful or absolutely terrified.\n\n[UPDATE 3]. Not pregnant.  It was a long shot.

It seems the teachings missed their mark, or perhaps they didn't prepare her for how tough life can be. Then again, there's a lot we have to learn through from experience that nobody can prepare us for.\n\nIt's obvious she loved your husband, and that she probably felt some form of negativity towards you because you \"stole\" him away. Once he died, it probably hit her even more because she was consumed with thoughts like, \"why couldn't it be me?\". I can't help but feel sympathy towards her, however, as I feel people should be forgiven in the long-run. I hope Marjorie can learn to get over her selfish feelings, and to learn to appreciate what was instead of what could have been.\n\nMaybe not now, but one day in the future you two can get together and cry over a very special person you both lost.",
            "Honestly, she was an important part of your husband's life for an extended period of time and, while I certainly think she went *waaaaay* off the deep end, I think you did both her and your husband a disservice by excluding her completely.  At the very least I think you should have spoken to her yourself.   \n\nGrief affects different people in different ways.  However sad and pathetic this may have rendered Marjorie, I think a more gracious approach would have been to offer her a chance to apologize, attend quietly, and grieve as well.",

But use your own reactions to things as a guide. For example, if you were having the worst day ever maybe you would be snippy and not very nice, but it\u2019s also likely that if it went that far you would apologise immediately.",

            "I commented on the original and thought he was so bizarrely paranoid. I did not predict cheating (many others did) or future psycho. That is so scary.

You know that. You sure as heck could have done nothing to prevent his abuse. In the future, you WILL see red flags quicker--BUT, again, this was not the man you knew for a year. You were really, earnestly trying to convince him you were loyal. \n\nIf this happens in the future (or to anyone else), IDK what you're supposed to do. Say, 'dude, I've told you 50x I'm not cheating, been totally transparent with you. You continue to persist. Are YOU the one cheating?'?? I mean, you *could* say that, but wouldn't the paranoid cheater just lie? \n\nWhat I *DO* know is that you need to stay safe. I'm glad you can avoid him, but stay vigilant. Pissed-off abusers who got dumped tend to become REALLY pissed off once they've been arrested/have a court case/record, etc. Hopefully, he'll take his community service or whatever and slink his cheating a@@ under the nearest rock. I know you're still reeling from all this, but false imprisonment is extremely serious. Be safe at all costs. \n\n(I went back and looked for the Scooby Doo villain guy, but it must have gotten deleted. That must have been one heck of a Freudian slip. But yeah, screw that guy.

By that point, I didn\u2019t even care - I was ready to break up with him anyways. He was so paranoid and it was driving me insane.

It's surreal.  The best thing you have going is that he exposed a very nasty side of himself... which is your parting memory.  So lingering doubt like \"did I do the right thing here?\" isn't gonna nail ya (or likely won't).   As stupid as it sounds, I would recommend at least going through some exercises that people who deal with abuse go through.  For me, the cops urged I went to a shelter and speak to the counselor there.   Initially I felt very stupid and lame.  I mean I'm a guy, she weighs like 100lbs less than I do (wet) and I'm feeling like a total wimp... but then they start talking to me and pointing out patterns of abuse I never was seeing.   It unravelled a little more and then I really understood what I had (and didn't have).\n\n\nBest of luck to you!  My only other parting comment is that some people have insecurities that aren't from their own sin - so if you are with someone else and they start getting paranoid about you cheating... well don't take that as an obvious sign that they are like your ex, but try to use the same skills you cultivated this time around ;)",

So unhealthy though. Stuff like that can really mess with your head/life. \n\nAt least you know. Flags are red for a reason. And it sucks when you really do like the person but that person didn't fully exist: they're a false self constructed to hide the monsters they really are - and THEY KNOW THIS. They really do, regardless of what they say, lies they weave, or bullshit they drop on your dining room table. They have no respect for themselves or others: if they did they wouldn't behave like this.\n\nIt's sad but now you can find someone better. Sounds like you might be new to dating disordered people, so don't be surprised if you get sucked back in at some point in the future (likely by someone totally new but you see the same red flags).

            "I'm so sorry. It isn't really that uncommon though, to have a sudden escalation in abusive behavior. Cheaters always see their own actions in others, too.

Like, I was totally isolated from every other person besides him, and he still would tell me over and over again that I'd \"cheated on him and was in denial\" to the point where I genuinely thought I might be crazy. Meanwhile, he'd cheat in really obvious ways, that'd he'd gaslight me over afterwards so I felt even crazier. Despite this, he never laid a hand on me until the last few months. It can just... bubble over, you know? I'm so glad you got out and that you're safe. You're probably going to have like a LOT of people tell you how to feel, but just trust your own feelings and process it in your own way.",

Nothing worked because he never stopped\"the cycle.\"\n\nI was going to study abroad in Asia in December and I did not need this on my mind before I went. So very impromptu on Nov. 16, I decided I could not be with him anymore.  I was sick of feeling used and lied to about something that he didn't need to lie about. I didn't have solid proof. I just had it mentally because I felt he was hiding something from me. And he wasn't trying to fix our relationship at all, even though he swears up and down he did.\n\nInstead of handling it well, he shows me an engagement ring his mom gave to him as I was breaking up with him and begged me to stay again. We didn't speak at all while I was away and I wish it stayed that way. I came back early January and our lease isn't up until February so I decided we could live together until then. And it was great until Monday, or at least I thought so anyway. We were talking openly about our feelings and he kept apologizing for everything that went wrong.  He still wanted to be my friend. (Hard no.)\n\nIt wasn't until this last Monday, that he got a new phone and switched over his sim card to his new one. While he was at work his old phone kept going off so I looked at it. I fully acknowledge that since we aren't together I had no right to go through his phone but the shit I found makes me feel no guilt what so ever. If anything, I'm proud I can see him for who he actually is.\n\nI found out he went to see one of the doms he was cheating on me with in LA and never stopped talking to her, even before we broke up. And in $15K in debt from sending multiple doms money (SN: he always told me one of the traits he doesn't like about me is how badly I handle money. HAR HAR. Projecting much?)\n\nAfter I saw this I puked, packed a bag and left. I texted him that I am leaving and unless it was about the apartment, I never wanted to hear from him again.  We've been avoiding each other since. I've been slowly moving my things out and putting it in storage and I just feel emotionally defeated.\n\nI went through three months worth of messages and found a few interesting things other than the nudes, videos and pretty subpar sexting. He acknowledges that he lied and that he had an intimate connection with her. To which she replies, \" That's called deceit not cheating.\" He's glad that it was her. Glad that he can finally make someone happy. Glad he can please his goddess. Glad to be \"free\". Upset that I never understood him.\n\nwow. what a goof lol.\n\nHe is so disillusioned and addicted to this lifestyle that he genuinely believes she cares about him and that he's in the right. He thinks she's actually his friend, while she goes out to dinner with her boyfriend with his money and using him for emotional support (something he complained about to her about me. And how he loved emotionally fucking with me.)\n\nShe is being paid thousands of dollars to stroke their ego though, so I think I would understand that you have to keep the customer happy. She got $500 off of that LA visit which is pretty impressive if you ask me.\n\nI feel like I should say that I respect sex workers and everything they do A LOT. But this specific dom is manipulative and has no boundaries. She is a half baked amateur at best who really has no clue on how to even pretend to know what she's doing. She gives actual doms a bad name.\n\nAnyone who is a proper dom and actually cared about their subs well being would never do the shit that these two concocted. Like sending me a picture of her ass and saying she only did it because he asked her to. Asking him how he's going to spoil me today and him telling her that he's going to take me to get my nails done as a surprise. Him telling her how unappreciative I am of his gifts because they don't feel genuine (which they weren't lol.)\n\nI never consented to any of this and this shit has fucked me up for life. But get this, she's an advocate for mental wellness. What a joke.\n\nShe praised him for getting out of a toxic relationship and was glad he could be \"free\" from all of my nagging and that I wouldn't hold this over his head anymore. (again, either she's really good at customer satisfaction or a really shitty person. More than likely both.) But he never told her that I was the one who actually ended the relationship.\n\nBut yeah, he never changed. He talked a big game but is so deep into his addiction and himself that he's willing to risk everything for it.\n\nI should have listened to everyone's advice and left when I had the chance. I shouldn't have moved in with him. Instead, I was emotionally abused by a narcissist who felt that \"he did everything he could.\" A direct quote he said to the findom he never stopped talking to for the past six months.\n\nTo those that are questioning and still have hope for the hopeless, get out while you can. You can\u2019t change anyone that does not want to change themselves. You can\u2019t convince someone they\u2019re in the wrong once they see that they\u2019re in the right. You may think that other people may not know them as well as you do. It\u2019s just something you tell yourself to avoid the actual truth that you\u2019re sacrificing yourself for someone who won\u2019t even do the same for you. Take care of yourself first because you\u2019re only damaging yourself in the long run.\n\nSorry if this looks all over the place btw. As happy as I am that I made the decision to leave, I am super depressed and feel like I failed. I know this is all his fault, but I feel like I should have seen this coming. That besides this one thing, he was amazing. But it was a lie. Reddit really helped me the last time and that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m posting here.  Because I haven\u2019t slept in the past three days and could really use some support and will probably regret posting this later lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr; I left my lying findom addicted ex and while I'm emotionally destroyed and angry, I'm glad I left. Send good vibes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update:** Holy Canoli! I went to sleep and came back to 1.0 k upvotes. Thank you for the Platinum and the Silver! I truly appreciate it. The comments are overwhelming and I'm trying to upvote them all but I am beyond grateful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n* For those that don't want to google, **findom is financial domination**. A more direct definition is ***financial domination*** *is also known as money slavery and is basically a fetish of people who want to be controlled by another person in exchange for money. They pay people for controlling them and the one in charge is known as a financial dominatrix. Usually, a male is the submissive who is referred to as a pay pig, a money slave, and even a human ATM because the findom can shell out as much money as they can from these subs.*\n* I don't have a problem with findom. We actually tried it together. I was uncomfortable with it mainly because I linked it with his cheating and lying. I expressed that I wanted to be monogamous and he stated that he wanted \"help\" and felt \"sick\" and wanted to change. I said that if this is what he wants to do that's fine, I'm fine with that but I don't want to be deceived and used. Just communicate with me. But as I found out from the messages, he loved emotionally manipulating me and loved to see me hurt. He got off on my pain, a direct quote. He got off on mentally abusing me, and that's not ok.\n* He also had a homewrecking fetish but I guess it loses the appeal if I consent to it I guess.\n* mini-rant: **DON'T DO THIS TO PARTNERS WHO HAVE NO INTEREST IN YOUR KINK OR YOU HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT THEY ARE OK WITHIN THE RELATIONSHIP. COMMUNICATE! GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO DECIDE ON WHAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH, NOT WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE OK WITH. DON'T HURT SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY EXPRESS DISINTEREST AND GIVE YOU AN OPEN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, BUT YOU ARE SO SELFISH THAT YOU RATHER LIE TO THEM AND PUT ON A FACADE OF \"WANTING HELP\".**\n* you can probably find his post on r/stopfindom. I won't link it here but if you're curious it may be still there from like a year ago.",

            "You likely won't see this, but you are not a failure. You did not fail. As I read your post from a year ago and your update, I couldn't feel like you were me (except the man I dated for 3 years was addicted to video games and cam girls). The progression of everything you wrote (I did the thing- I snooped; I shouldn't have, but I snooped again) was just ME and honestly, I hated being that person.  \n\nWhen we finally broke up, it was during a period of things being \"fine.\" No fighting, no signs of video games or cam girl expenditures. But his phone went off once in the middle of a netflix and chill night and I thought, \"Huh. I am never going to be able to hear things like that and not cringe or get a sinking feeling in my stomach.\" The sound of him receiving alerts on his phone was like a Pavlov's reaction for me to feel like shit. So I ended it.  \n\nI just want you to know that what happened to me didn't ruin me forever. I met my husband six months later (and we've been together almost six years).  \n\nThis is your learning experience. You will learn to love yourself first before you can love someone else. You have learned to NEVER be taken advantage of again. You have learned the signs to walk away early. You have learned not to ever waste a minute of your time on someone who makes you feel like crap.",

            "[removed]",
            "I\u2019m sure other commenters have probably covered what I\u2019m about to say, but here it goes anyway:\n\nI am proud you walked away. You know in your heart you did the right thing. You are probably going to feel like shit for a while. Like you weren\u2019t good enough on your own for this man. Don\u2019t think like that. Here\u2019s why:\n\nHis fetish revolves around the fantasy of a woman he will never be able to attain, no matter how much money he throws at her and how much he metaphorically grovels at her feet. No woman he ever meets in real life will fulfill his desires because the \u201cgetting to know each other\u201d process is inherently unsexy to him. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if his internet findomme is less beautiful or less interesting than you, because the simple fact that you love and care about him is a sexual turn-off for him. That is a fundamental part of his sexuality; that will never change. He likely loves you, your body, and your personality romantically, just not sexually (enough).\n\nHe will always need a fantasy \u201cgoddess\u201d who only exists in his mind as a one-dimensional perfect being: she\u2019s always dominant, she never expresses weaknesses or emotions, she always has her hair and makeup done, and she exists only to subjugate men. She never feels sadness, compassion, or love (unless it\u2019s for another man who he fantasizes about cucking himself to). She has no interests, goals or aspirations outside of dominating men and spending their money. Her only goals are to buy shoes, makeup, clothes, and use his money to go on dates with other men. It is humiliating and therefore arousing for him to be financing her dates with men he sees as better and more \u201cworthy\u201d of her than him. Meanwhile, he thinks you should be grateful for his scraps, such as him offering to pay for your measly nail appointment while he pretends he\u2019s broke and PayPals her hundreds of dollars. \n\nIn reality, she\u2019s probably just using his money to pay her rent, bills, and debt, but that\u2019s not a very exciting idea to a man who is into findom. In his mind, this goddess is a woman who is wealthy purely off of her subs\u2019 money and live a luxurious lifestyle spending other people\u2019s money on things she doesn\u2019t need. He gets off on the fantasy of her wasting his money instead of spending it wisely (like a real responsible human girlfriend would, because a girlfriend actually cares about him). Her entire persona is to pretend she is someone who is better than everyone else and doesn\u2019t care about his needs. \n\nOf course, none of the aforementioned traits embody how she actually feels or behaves in real life. She\u2019s just a regular human being who happens to be good at sex work. I guarantee she has absolutely NO interest in either your life or your ex-boyfriend\u2019s life. The photo of her ass she sent you was your ex-boyfriend\u2019s idea. It probably comforts your ego to believe that it was her idea to text you and that she\u2019s just an awful human being all on her own and she wanted to hurt you, but the truth is that he paid her to do that. To hurt you. So he could masturbate to your tears and heartbreak. Let that sink in. He pushed your boundaries more and more and became more and more obvious with his hurtful thrills because he got off to your distress and knew you would keep forgiving him. At the end of the day, the only thing that mattered was his orgasm, not you and certainly not his relationship. He was a monster to you because that aroused him and he didn\u2019t care if he lost you. You were just a pawn in his findom fantasy. Once it gets to this point, it\u2019s not just a sexual fetish. That is his personality. He is selfish to his core, has absolutely no self-control, and feels no remorse lying, cheating, and sneaking, regardless of the consequences. \n\nIf he got to know this woman outside of her sex work, he\u2019d immediately lose interest. It\u2019s the \u201creal woman\u201d factor that turns him off. He didn\u2019t want you to be his findomme because you\u2019re too real for him. You\u2019re not dressed to the nines 24/7 and treating him like a piece of dirt stuck to your shoe. Even if you were a perfect findomme during sex, doing everything he likes, he\u2019d never be able to get into it as much as his internet ladies because he knows you as a person who exists outside of his sexual fantasies. Don\u2019t take that personally. \n\nNo single woman on this earth will EVER be able to fully satisfy him both romantically and sexually, because in his mind, the two are mutually exclusive. Excuse my armchair psychology, but he probably has a Madonna-whore complex. Even if he got with a Victoria\u2019s Secret model, the second she expressed her love for him he\u2019d be out chasing a woman who rejects and insults him. His self-esteem is so low that he believes he\u2019s not worthy of love. In his mind, any woman who genuinely cares about him is defective, because he can\u2019t find anything worth loving about himself. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t value you. These self-esteem issues probably manifested as a young teen and he may have had an early history of being rejected by girls in school. He probably jerked off as a teen to the popular girls at school that rejected him or didn\u2019t notice his existence. Some people internalize stuff like that and let it shape their sexual development and fantasies until it later warps into something as extreme as findom (thanks to porn culture). He has to have a girlfriend to 1) play the part in his fantasy, and 2) provide emotional support and fulfill the need for companionship. One woman will never do it all for him. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to be broken for a while. Just know that none of this is about you, and his behaviour has absolutely nothing to do with you as a person or anything you did or didn\u2019t do well enough. He is going to continue doing this to future girlfriends. He\u2019s never going to stop, he\u2019s just going to become better at hiding it (if he wants to keep his next relationship). The one positive to take away from this experience is that you were fortunate enough to meet him early enough in his life where he wasn\u2019t already an expert at keeping this a secret. His next girlfriend may not be so lucky. \n\nIn a few years you\u2019re going to look back and laugh at this pathetic man who is still pissing all his money away on internet women. Who one day is 35, 40, 45 years old and still doesn\u2019t have a house or a car or a retirement fund because he wasted his life and money on findommes. Who will never be in a happy relationship because he doesn\u2019t have the ability to be satisfied by a real woman. You\u2019re going to be so glad you got out when you did. You came out the winner. He\u2019s broken and you can\u2019t fix him. Who knows if therapy will, but I\u2019m glad you realized that sticking around for years to see if it does isn\u2019t worth the pain. Be strong and don\u2019t give in to him when he inevitably tries to crawl back and beg for your forgiveness when he\u2019s lonely.",

            "Sometimes you really need to let a relationship completely die to be able to properly move on, let it end when there is NO doubt that it's a shitshow. So that you don't end up having nagging what ifs or feeling uncertain, and just to feel you have confidence in your decision and that you did the right thing and are looking out for yourself. So don't beat yourself up about not ending it sooner. You loved someone and you were trying to do your best for them and for yourself, and in the end that led to you knowing you did all you could, but that it was definitely time to go. \n\nMost people have been in relationships where they kind of knew it wasn't going well, they'd been cheated on, lied to or treated badly, or just weren't compatible anymore, but they let it drag on with the hope it would get better and just because they were attached and clinging on to memories of better days gone by. Honestly in those times, it's a good thing when the hope completely dies, because that frees you, and now you'll know better what you want from a relationship in the future and how to stand up for yourself and how to know it's time to go. So all in all you've had a really really tough time, but you'll be okay, you've done the right thing, you haven't really made a mistake staying with him longer because you were doing the best you could and you gave it a real chance and you've learned a lot. Don't let this awful person make you feel bad about yourself, it's quite clear that none of his behaviour had anything to do with you, he'd do the same to anyone else, including this woman he's been talking to.\n\nYou'll feel angry for a bit, and sad sometimes probably, but in no time you'll have moved on and filled your life with other people and other things, and you'll look back at this one day and laugh about how you dodged a bullet and it'll only make you appreciate your life more, realising you could've still been stuck with this guy for years. I've been there, and the fact I went through that actually makes me appreciate my life, as it is now, more, and makes me feel proud of myself that I made a good decision for myself. So I hope that's how this experience ends up for you too :-)",

Absolutely nothing worked during, and only after I said I can't be with him anymore did that spur any sort of real action..  but not really. I even tried to blame myself saying maybe I don't recognize the actions. I would ask what he was doing or what working on it meant to him. Didn't get much of an answer. Just not really interested in it. Constant emotional neglect and feeling like I was taking care of someone else for two years. I felt pretty stupid too, when I realized that nothing will change. The only change will be not being together. Now I'm totally empty inside because that took so much more out of me than I imagined. Forgiving myself for letting it go on so long is a process.",

From my extensive break up experience Replaying all of the worst aspects about the relationship and all of the ex\u2019s worst qualities in my head felt helpful when I felt guilty or wished things were different. A lot of us were raised to be accomodating and try and work on problems and to be selfless and a nice person, and that can keep us in relationships with lots of red flags and unhappiness for a long time. While being willing to work on problems is a good quality it needs to be balanced by a understanding of what we need in relationships - like honesty, communication and respect (all notably absent in this case as far as his behaviour). Relationships should not make you unhappy, distrustful or betrayed.

That alone is an adventure worthy of being happy and unattached to things that only drag you to the bottom.   \n\n\nIt's not your place to mother him and ensure he's not giving some random woman money for some kind of kink. You're right, he needs to be honest, not just with who he's with, but himself too. If you ever feel like you have to hide stuff in a relationship then you shouldn't be in that relationship. It only devastates your partner because they're not being told the truth and being lied to. You didn't deserve that.

            "It's awful that you went through this. And you sound extremely cynical about it - understandably so! Thinking you were foolish to stay with him when people told you to leave, advising people in similar situations to leave instead of wasting their time on someone who doesn't deserve it.\n\nNow I'm in the \"it's totally fine that r/relationships tells people to leave very often\" camp, but I also think that the impulse to stay with someone because you love them is understandable, and not only understandable but good and admirable and part of the glue that makes humanity possible as a social species. It's the Prisoner's Dilemma issue: if people can cooperate they will do better than people who don't cooperate, but taking advantage of people who cooperate is better for the person taking advantage than cooperating would be. Social species work by using various techniques to get around this - such as developing signals and strategies to figure out other people's motives, developing innate tendencies towards altruism that make one trustworthy to others who wonder whether to cooperate, remembering which people have been trustworthy in the past and which have screwed others over and cooperate only with the former...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you've run into, is (what I believe to be) the comparatively uncommon case of a defector who successfully exploited your cooperative impulses. It is understandable, and probably even correct to be somewhat less trusting in the future, to try and identify retrospectively which signs would have allowed you to get out of this earlier. But I think you shouldn't completely renounce on your cooperative impulses to begin with, because they're what can make you successful if you run into cooperative people in the future. In other words, just because this guy never deserved it doesn't mean your impulse to love him and forgive him and help him was stupid or wrong. That same impulse could have led you to a very happy relationship with a different person; it's what can allow a relationship to survive and flourish between people who are different and conflictual but fundamentally well-meaning, and that can drive those people to become the best versions of themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying this to put pressure on you to open yourself to others right now. This just happened, you will need time to heal and come to terms with what happened. I just hope that even as you draw lessons from what happened, you look with some compassion at past you and understand when she made the best decisions she could with the information she had at the time.",
