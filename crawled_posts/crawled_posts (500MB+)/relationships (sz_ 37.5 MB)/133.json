        "selftext": "Before I elaborate I just want to say that neither me nor the rest of my family share my son's beliefs. I have no idea where they came from but I'm certain when I say it has nothing to do with how my husband and I raised our son.\n\n\nMy son went to college across the country and graduated last spring, and thankfully he got a very good job close to home o now he's back and living with us. On all fronts, he's doing great in life and is shaping up to have a very successful future. I've always considered him nothing short of perfect but recent events have taught me that my son holds incredibly disturbing beliefs.\n\n\nMy son has always been very protective of his younger sister (18F), she's currently in her last year of high school. Well, he found out a few days ago by looking at her texts (he said he wasn't snooping, but saw an unsavory text pop up and read further) about my daughter's sex life. Now I don't pry into what my daughter does in her adult life nor do I feel the need to, as my daughter practices safe and responsible sex. My husband and I both know she is sexually active but as she's going about it as an adult, in a healthy and safe way, we have no problem with it.\n\n\nMy son blew up and called my daughter all manner of horrible words, particularly \"filthy whore\" and \"putrid slut\", demeaning and humiliating her without mercy. I've never seen my daughter cry so hard, she was absolutely devastated especially since she adores her brother and looks up to him. He refused to apologize and then berated both me and his father for \"letting your daughter become a whore\".  \n\n\nWe were all shocked by this and didn't know how to react, really. It seemed so surreal like a scene in a movie, and his father asked him how he could say things like that. My son explained his beliefs and we learned he's frighteningly misogynistic and sexist and violent. For example, he believes all adulterers should be stoned to death and praises ISIS for doing so. He thinks modern women are all disgusting sluts and that there's no good women left. I don't want to list his other beliefs because just typing this makes me upset, but you get the idea.\n\n\nWe tried to reason with him but he simply won't budge on these horribly ignorant and harmful beliefs. Worse, he won't entertain any conversation about this issue with us as he believes he's completely right about these ideas. So for the past few days the atmosphere in the house is incredibly tense. He's carrying on like everything is normal but both my husband, my daughter and myself are constantly in disbelief that he could be like this. I have no idea how to even broach this topic again without him shutting me down instantly. I've raised my son to be open-minded, a true gentleman and I'm saddened that he completely abandoned that. What do I do? How do I even go about restoring the family life we used to have?\n\n   \ntl;dr: Recently learned son is a huge misogynist/sexist. The family atmosphere is very tense and uncomfortable, I have no idea how to approach him about this since he dismisses both me and my husband immediately.",

            "He snooped, then gave an offensive ranting lecture about your daughter's sex life (which is absolutely none of his business), then disrespected you and your husband in your home. That's a pretty awful way to treat people you love. \n\nAt this point I would be making a big deal out of this and laying down some ultimatums: (1) apologize to his sister for snooping and calling her names (2) apologize to you and you husband (3) either group or individual therapy and (4) no longer welcome to live at home if he behaves like this again. ",
            "Personally, I'd tell him that if he is going to treat his family that way, he isn't welcome in the home.  In fact, either he apologizes or he's out.  I don't know where he's gotten these beliefs, but making his stay at your house contingent on him getting therapy would be something else I would seriously consider.\n\nYou cannot just let this go.  You need to step in, even if only to defend your daughter.  ",
            ">Well, he found out a few days ago by looking at her texts (he said he wasn't snooping, but saw an unsavory text pop up and read further)\n\nThat's the definition of snooping. \n\nLook, your son can believe whatever misguided or backwards thing he wants. You don't have to give him a free place to stay in light of it. Tell him he apologizes and keeps it to himself, or he leaves and isn't welcome back until those demands are met. ",
            "...the Internet. The Internet is where he got these ideas. My guess is he got burned bad by a rejection and jnstead of dealing with it like an adult, he sought out an online echo chamber that fanned his anger and hurt into full-blown hatred of women. I have seen it happen and it is goddamn heartbreaking. Doesn't matter how he was raised. He chose misogyny over maturity because being able to blame others for your failures is seductive to people of all backgrounds.\n\nSet an example. Do not tolerate hate speech from him or anyone else, and abruptly end conversations and visits if it arises. Continue to respect your daughter openly, and reassure her that her brother is very wrong and you and your husband do not share his views. Beyond that, he is an adult...you can hope he grows out of it and realizes how deeply he's hurt his sister, but that's up to him. I'm sorry. ",
            "So all  of you are living under one roof and your son has developed some stupid ideas.\n\nFirst off, your sons beliefs are not you doing.  Somewhere along the line he came to those beliefs in a twisted strange way.  You tried your best to raise him but at a certain point people discover their own values.\n\nSecond, there is something you can do to maintain a safe environment for your daughter who seems to be doing all the right things and that is taking a firm stance with your son.  He lives in YOUR house, and you don't have to take that kind of behavior from him.  \n\nSimply put, tell him to not act like a misogynistic asshole when he is around the house or get out.  He shouldn't talk to his sister like that, nor should you allow it.  I'd make it known that he is free to have those twisted views if he wants, but that under no circumstance is a repeat of what happened (with the yelling etc) to occur again.  If if did, he should be prepared to pack his things.  Because that shows a gross disrespect for not only you and your husband, but his sister too.",
            "It sounds like he's fallen in with a bad crowd at Uni. Are you guys Muslim ? Because if you are, a long sit down talk with your own Mullah might be the way to go. Muslim extremists are very active on campuses, and he might simply have fallen in with a bad crowd. A chat with your own Mullah about what is going on here may well set him straight.\n\nIf not, he needs to see a psych, stat. He needs to be talked down from whatever this influence is.\n\nI know you're being told to kick him out, but it must be heartbreaking to see your baby boy turn nasty like this and he needs to be fixed. The risk is, that if you just turn him out, he'll continue in his appalling beliefs.\n\nYou and your husband need to sit him down and make it very clear to him that his behaviour and language is **reprehensible** and that you are disgusted and horrified with him, that this is not how you raised him, and that his behaviour is deeply disappointing to you and wholly unacceptable. He must apologise, wholeheartedly, to his sister and he must attend counselling. If he refuses, evict him.\n\nThe inappropriateness of his behaviour must be brought home to him in the strongest possible terms.",

            "Put his ass OUT. I mean, his headspace is totally fucked all the way up but I'm gonna overlook that in favor of a more pressing issue- the message you are sending your daughter if you let your son treat her so badly under your roof, which is supposed to be a *safe place* for her. Not to mention the fact that this IS your house- he has no business dismissing *shit*. \n\nI feel so bad for you, though. I really do. I would be so mortified if that were my kid. ",
            "If your son can't treat his family with respect, empathy, or even a shred of decency, don't allow him in your home. Put your foot down. He sounds like a disrespectful brat who can't be bothered to look past his own views to even treat his own family with a tiny bit of compassion. \n\nIf he lives there, kick him out. If you wont, get him therapy if he wants to stay. I do think kicking him out would be better for your daughter. \n\nTalk to your daughter. Reassure her that she is not anything like what her brother thinks. Since she looked up to him, she needs someone to come in and undo the damage he probably did to her. He verbally abused her, and she should limit all contact with him unless he learns how to respect and love her for who she is. \n\n\n\n",
            "I made an account just to say this:\n\nThis isn't just disrespectful. This is dangerous. He is willing to degrade and abuse his sister, someone close to him, without any remorse. How had his relationship with his sister been prior to college? How has he dealt with extreme stress in the past? (You don't have to answer me but consider them yourself.)\n\nIf he's willing to act this way to his sister, how will he act toward the next woman who rejects him? Or his next romantic partner if she upsets him?\n\nI can't imagine the position you're in and, despite his behavior, I'm sure you love your son and want him to be better. But he needs therapy. I don't know if the ISIS comment is religious extremism as others validly suggested, or if it's just an example in how he views violence against women to be acceptable and right. Since he's an adult I don't know if you can force him into therapy but if you're financially supporting him, cut him off on the stipulation that he gets help. If not, you need to set hard boundaries. He shouldn't be allowed to act as though everything is normal and okay after what he's done. Either he apologizes to his sister and agrees to get help, or you'll treat him like any other adult who screams at your daughter, calls her every misogynistic name purely to hurt her, and refuses to show either you or your husband an ounce of respect.\n\nI guess I'm echoing everyone else but I wanted to drive it home that this isn't just acting like a bad house guest. He said women deserve to be murdered. He yelled it in the faces of his family. His implication is that his sister, who he called a filthy whore, should be stoned to death for having safe and consensual sex. That is not something you can take lightly.\n\nYour son is genuinely frightening.",

            "This sounds very much like radicalization.\n\nI know you might not want to hear this but I think you and your family need to entertain the thought that your son has changed and there may be nothing you can do about it. I would suggest you retain the services of a private investigation firm---and a lawyer---to look into your son's activity on the internet and off of it. To the extent that is legal in your state, hence my mentioning the lawyer. In the world we live in it's not a far-fetched idea that your son could be radicalizing and going down a very dark path. You need to think of your family's safety right now.\n\nI would certainly kick him out after you had a chance to let the investigators do their work only because it's very important that, if he is indeed radicalizing, he is identified and investigated by the FBI or DHS. This isn't acceptable behavior and the only way you can show that is to remove him from your household. I've known my sister to be sexually active since she was 16 and I would never say such awful things to her.",

            "I haven't looked through all the posts, but the top few didn't mention this. I really think you need to consider that he could pose a danger to yourself and your daughter. The ideas he is expressing are violent. Supporting the stoning of adulterers is disturbing. However, adulterers is a term that is heavily influenced by perception. I've heard that people can be punished for adultery even if there isn't proof in some corners of the world. Furthermore, at least in the Bible, there is a verse that says if you get divorced, you're committing adultery with any future partners. The point I'm making is that when it comes to women, rules about sex, and extremist views, all bets are off. If he thinks stoning adulterers is a good idea, there is a high chance he might feel that harming your daughter is also acceptable. Obviously I can't know that, but I would be getting him as far away from her as possible. I would not feel safe with him around. These are scary ideas he has and, while I don't want to freak you out, I don't want anything bad to happen either. ",

He needs to apologize and never touch her phone again. \n\nThis whole thing is really gross to me. He needs to get his head out of your daughter's sex life. ",
            "As a parent, you have two opposing issues right now, protecting your daughter and 'fixing' your son.   I grew up in a fundamentalist religion and have seen this issue tear families apart many times, so I hope I can offer at least a modicum of help here.\n\nFirst, are all his beliefs Muslim? Or is it a hodgepodge of crap from various ideologies?   I ask because you got two different paths there.\n\nIf it's just a hodgepodge of crap, may I suggest the standard counseling and discover the root issue. Hopefully just a stupid phase.\n\nIf he's going down a fundamental path with Muslim beliefs (or any Abraham based faith) don't bother trying to debate with him that women shouldn't be treated so, or she can do what she wants as an adult.   Because, to him, no she can't.  God said so, AND god said the male(s) in the family are duty bound and judged to make them so.    Quite simply, you can't trump what God said.  You can try the bit about respect your parents and in this house you will do X, but again, you're asking him to ignore God's commands in your house, so I wouldn't count on it.   Sadly here, isolation is often a reinforcement that they were right in the first place and is as likely to harm your goals as help.\n\nYou really only have three likely outcomes depending on his level of exposure, and mindset towards other issues.  \n\n* First, something about this view appeals to him and he's closed to all other thinking, there may be nothing you can do hear but try and find out what appeals so much and try and deal with that.  Some are so accepting of their new ideas, they almost literally cover their ears for points one and two.  If so, isolation to protect your family may be your only choice.\n* Second, discuss the root of his new faith.   The contradictions in the koran, the idea of flying horses, muhammaded being a pedophile, the allowance of sex slaves.   do a bit of research and point these things that his new friends likely haven't.  But do it kindly and as if you were trying to learn about his new beliefs, not from a hey, here's why what you think is crap.   If you present it wrong, you'll be done before you start.\n* Third, Science.   Fundamentalists cling to young earth, the flood, even flat earth in muslim science.   Watch cosmos, have him look up his objections to evolution on talk.origions.   Anything you can do that might open his mind to the idea that he's taking his morality from people that never talked to any 'God' at all.\n\nFinally, it sucks.  And I wish you all the best dealing with this.   Do everything you can to save your son from the path he's on, but set clear boundaries, and repercussions if he crosses them.   Secondly talk to your daughter, and make sure she realizes that his crap is his crap.   She is not responsible for his issues, and she should feel pity for his broken mind, not shame for the shit he says.",
            "Is he a Muslim? Is your family Muslim? It sounds like he got radicalized by an extremist Muslim Cleric, which results in massive and sudden shifts in personal beliefs and principles. \n\nIn which case this issue with your daughter is just a symptom of a much more terrifying reality.\n\nThat comment about ISIS really pulls at me. ISIS cuts the heads off of innocent people. They aren't praised by people casually. That isn't something that is casually tossed around.",
            "Maybe it's overboard but I would call the cops. College is prime recruiting territory for groups like ISIS. Now, I'm not saying this is what happened but at some point he was exposed to it and had it repeated enough that it is now engrained. The fact that he believes in such things makes him extremely dangerous not just to you his family but all women in his vicinity. \n\nHonestly, for your safety, especially your daughters, he needs to be out of the house.

You'll also lose valuable time with him from estrangement that you'll never get back. \n\nYou should urge him to see a counselor. He most likely feels some sort of alienation from his peers.

            "I am so sorry.  I don't even know what to say.  I have an 18 year old son and a 15 year old daughter.  Did your son get hurt badly by a girlfriend?  Or could he have some kind of physical problem that is causing him psychological issues (like something wrong with his penis?)  Something drove him to start to research these beliefs and whatever is bothering him made him reinforce those beliefs in his mind.  \n\nI know you can't MAKE him go to counseling at this age, but I would try, and definitely he should not be around your daughter.  I would almost be afraid he might do something violent because he seems so sure of his \"beliefs.\"  Please be careful, protect your daughter and yourselves.

I am with everyone that his beliefs are very misguided and messed up but the point to focus on is the behavior. Everyone is entitled to their beliefs no matter how messed up they are but how they choose to act on those beliefs is the most important thing. ",
            "OP!\n\nYou need to find out if your son is radicalizing. Can you get access to his internet history?\n\nEssentially his beliefs make it very unsafe for you and your daughter (as a woman you shouldn't go against him etc) to be around him but if he's further radicalized, no one is safe around him.\n\nYou can google signs a loved one has radicalized, see if they fit, if they do and you can get any evidence at all, then you can report him to the authorities.\n\nYou should also kick him out of your home, you are passed the point of a normal family with him unless he agrees to therapy and change, but he should do that whilst not living at home for your daughters sake.

            "To all of the people here saying she should kick her son out. Are you insane? Have you ever had a kid before?\n\nWhat happens when this guy's family does not support him? He loses the one thing he can turn into. And he will drive deeper into his weird world views, with people who will feed these thoughts. (I assume he was influenced by at least some people, and he will be forced to depend on them, and not the family) The \"my house, my rules\" will drive him further away. \n\nTalk to your son, OP. Ask him what does he think of you and why does he think that way. It will be painful. But better than abandoning your kid into a world which only nourishes hatred.\n\nIf he praises ISIS he probably is in contact with someone trying to recruit him. This is how they grab followers. Maybe contact the police, and report him as a threat. They can monitor his communications and catch him if in any case, he tries to leave the country.",
            "This will likely get buried, but I disagree with most of the posts. I just don't know if hardening your parenting on your child will accomplish anything. Alienation and feelings of abandonment won't convince him to turn a new leaf on his beliefs. This isn't about disagreeing on beliefs. I think it's more about getting in touch with the deeper issuers your son is dealing with to get to this conclusions. \n\nWe all have different opinions. But this is not about that. He's projecting whatever issues he has, be it with women and politics, onto how he believes his family members should act. Now is not the time to kick him out or win him over with anger and a hotter flame. It's about patience and a little kindness, something that maybe he's not feeling at the moment particularly with the opposite sex. \n\nIf that fails, then you did your best to show him love and what's right. Teach and demonstrate why his beliefs are hateful. Not about telling him who's boss and what he should be thinking when truthfully as a person he's free to decide his thoughts and beliefs. \n\nJust my thoughts. People are a little too quick to fierce response here. I don't agree with your son's beliefs but you want your son to be the son that you think he is. I just don't think the methods mentioned here will do that. \n\nAll this is easier said than done. But he didn't develop this thoughts over night. Neither will showing him otherwise. You may have a long road ahead with this. Good luck. ",

        "selftext": "Hi guys, I'm using a throwaway and avoiding names for anonymity.  \n\nSo, I don't really know where to start. It's almost a decade of my life and I could write about it for days, but I'll try to pick out the unimportant bits.\nI [23F] have been with my boyfriend [28M] for 8 years. \n\nI know it's pretty much impossible to paint a good picture of someone through a few paragraphs of a story, especially considering I'm mostly pointing out problem areas, but please keep in mind that he's a good person. He's loving, gentle, cares about me than anything and absolutely devoted to me. But we have tangled this relationship into quite a mess.\nLike everyone who posts here I have countless reasons to want to stay, but I'm having trouble taking off these rose-colored glasses. Please help me, Reddit.\n\n**Backstory:** \nWhen we started dating I was going through a lot of shit, and he was the first guy I have ever been with. I was the one who was always compromising and always finding ways to go see him. He very rarely came to see me, and if he did he would get irritated and complain that he shouldn't have to. He would ask me to come over every single night, saying he missed me and he couldn't sleep. I lived about an hour away, and I didn't even have a car, so when I'd find rides to his house (bus, friends driving me, etc.) I was excited to see him. I'd get there early in the day, and instead of seeing him, I'd sit on his couch alone for HOURS while he played video games. It was infuriating, because I played games too, but he always told me not to bring my console because I could use his (he had literally zero games for it), but I always ended up just pacing around his house, waiting for him to give me a second of his time. As bad as this sounds (and it was), he was so sweet and sincere when he would finally get done, he told me how glad he was that he could keep up with his legion and still have a girlfriend (he said although he ended up breaking up with his last three because of fidelity problems, they hated him gaming.)\n\nI was young and stupid, and caught up in being the cool girlfriend.\n\nI used to have a lot of fun, going to clubs and parties and all kinds of things. I had a ton of friends, mostly male. He would get upset if I talked to them, even the ones I had known since I was a toddler, and he said that since he didn't talk to girls then I shouldn't either. (Little did I know, he actually was talking to a few girls all this time.)\n\t\nHe said I love you two days into dating, and proposed after a few months. I told him I wasn't ready, that I loved him but I was too young and I needed to get to know him better. He was different after this, like it hurt him for me to say no. \nAfter a few months together, I'd tell him I was about to do something (like walk to the grocery store since I had no car) and he would SCREAM at me over the phone. He said I was an idiot, going to get myself killed, women can't walk alone, especially near nighttime. I know what you're thinking, why would I stay with a sexist asshole?? Well, he had never made it seem like he was sexist before, and would deny saying it. He would say he never said any such thing, and that he was only worried about me. I'd ask why he screamed, and tell him it wasn't okay to treat me like that, and he'd say \u201cI have never and will never yell at you.\u201d\n\nAt this point I'm already doubting my sanity, but the other 75% or so of the time, he's so incredibly sweet to me. I moved in with him about 10 months in because my mother died, and I had no where else to go. I had a job, but didn't make enough to support myself. His family owned farm land in the south, and had bought him his own house.\n\nAbout a year into our relationship, I found out that he'd lied about every single thing he'd told me about himself. The way I found out was the worst part; he just told me. He forgot that he'd lied in the beginning, and he'd start randomly telling me things like, \u201cI almost married my high school sweetheart, but she changed her mind last second\u201d and \u201cmy tenth or so girlfriend calls me every weekend to say she wants to fuck.\u201d This is after telling me that he's been with only three others before me, and that he doesn't talk to any exes. None of this would've mattered to me if he'd been upfront in the beginning, but because he lied and was using the whole \u201cI don't talk to girls, you can't talk to guys\u201d bullshit to keep me from having male friends, I was pretty upset. \n\nA few weeks after that, I told him I was going to the movies with a female friend for her birthday. I told him the movie was at 7 and I'd be back before midnight. We wouldn't be drinking, partying, anything like that. Well,at about 9:30 I start getting horrible texts. I'm a \u201clying bitch,\u201d I \u201cbetter enjoy the dick I'm getting because I'm never getting [his]\u201d again, and that he doesn't want to see me when I get home.\nI was crushed. It was the first time I'd seen ANY friend since we started dating, and she had never met him, but she saw what he was sending me. I ignored him and ended up getting home at 11 pm. The house was trashed, and he was up waiting for me. When I asked what the hell he was talking about, he slammed the door in my face (literally, it hit me really hard in the nose) and screamed \u201cfuck off!\u201d\n\nI slept on the couch. The next day he left without saying a word to me for a softball game he'd been planning with his friends. I was still pissed, so  I called him as soon as I woke up (btw, he was OUT OF STATE, and would be sleeping in a motel room with multiple single girls/guys for the next five days) and I told him he's an asshole I'm done. He was absolutely desperate over the phone for me to give him another chance, but I hung up. I packed everything I owned and tried to leave, but he showed up right before I could and was very sincere about getting help. \n\nThe next day, he stayed out until 5 am at a strip club and came back without his promise ring on. He said he'd put it in his pocket so he wouldn't lose it, but he smelled strange and was acting strange and I just know that he cheated. He vehemently denied it, saying I was insane for accusing him and that we should just break up if I wasn't going to trust him. I said okay, and started packing AGAIN. Then he said he'd never said any of that.\n\nAfter the fight earlier, he said he'd go to therapy, stop punching holes in the walls, pay more attention to me and even let me go to clubs again and resume contact with my male friends. Well, he did start therapy. He went for three months, and nothing changed. He continued to punch and break things, scream at me, tell me everything was my fault and that he couldn't stand me. He turned to drinking and when he'd get violent and drunk, he said I was the reason he was forced to drink. Because I was causing him so many issues. Well, things got better then they got worse, they were up and down for a while but we had a good period of about four years. \n\nThere were several large fights over the years, here a few that stand out:\n\nThe day my favorite aunt died, I was with her at the hospital. I drove a shitty vehicle there that was known for breaking down. After she passed I was a mess. I told him I was leaving and would be back soon. We lived only a few minutes down the street, but my car broke down and I was about 15 minutes late. I got home and he was furious, said I was cheating on him and that was why I was late, screamed that I was a cheater and the landlord who was our neighbor heard the whole thing, he always hated me after that. No apology after he calmed down, instead it was my fault for causing him to worry.\n\nI was feeling depressed about the amount of porn he watched versus how often he was interested in me. We used to have a ton of sex, we had six different FFM threesomes with multiple girls he chooses and I tried everything to satisfy his kinks. But then I just stopped being enough. Hint; he preferred porn and good ol' Jennifer Haniston. (hmm it's not very funny in this context huh?) \nGuys, I have zero self-esteem at this point, and I'm just dreading waking up every single morning. \n\nOne day, after a month of no sex, he locks himself in the bathroom and I can hear him in there, I get so sick to my stomach and have an anxiety attack (I'm a very in-shape, busty girl. I'm in gymnastics and have always been told I'm generally attractive, so it's not a weight issue or anything. I suspect porn addiction). I'm hyperventilating on the floor when he comes out, and he's sweet for a moment, asking what's wrong and to please talk to him.\n\nWell, I trusted him and I shouldn't have. I told him in the most calm voice I could that it makes me feel sad when he chooses porn over me, that we've had sex 4 times in three months and I wish I had more from him.\n\nHe completely lost it. He grabbed my shoulders so hard his nails dug in, he shook me and screamed that he doesn't even watch porn, that he is so whipped by a stupid bitch, that his life is shit because of me.\n\nI have always been very sensitive and I cry at the drop of a hat, I know that makes him feel like I'm trying to manipulate him. But even if I lock myself in the bathroom to cry, in private, it's still my fault and I'm using it to control him. I don't have anywhere to go, and I cannot NOT cry sometimes, is there something I could have done to show him I just need to cry sometimes?\n\n\n**That brings us to now.**\nMost of the year was good, but the past few months he's been screaming a lot more. He's told me that I am a horrible person for trying to leave him years ago, and that I don't deserve him and will never find another guy who'd put up with me. He always denies things and tries to make me sounds crazy, so this time I recorded it. Later when he was more calm I played it for him, and he accused me of inviting guys over the pretend to be him so I could get him in trouble. What the fucking fuck???\n\nHe's done much more. He's gone through every file on my computer and set the only dirty one he could find as my background to humiliate me because he knew his family was coming over. He wanted them to see the filthy shit I look at. Remember earlier how I said he has a porn addiction? Yeah, he's at a level of hypocrisy that I just can't understand. \n\nI know this is incredibly toxic and I am so sick of feeling suicidal.\n\nI just wanted to know one thing; am I the one who is abusive? I know I didn't give very many examples of things I've done, and maybe if he posted his side you'd agree with him, but what about my trying to leave? Was that a horrible act of betrayal? Because he is convinced it's worse than cheating, and says he is abused and is a victim. I am just so confused and feel constantly devastated and lonely. I have no one if I lose him :(\n\nPlease, send help\n\nTL;DR: Toxic relationship becoming too much for me to handle, and I'm confused about my role in it. Am I a horrible person? What do I do?\n\n**Edit:** I guess it doesn't really make sense for me to ask if I'm being abusive since this is from my point of view and for all you know I could just leave what I do out, so I don't really know what I'm asking. I guess I just want to see what others think. I feel like I'm crazy.\n\n**Edit 2:** He just texted me that he saw my post and is coming home\n\n:[\n\n**UPDATE:** I'm somewhere safe now! I'll post a full update as soon as this post dies down because the one I posted got removed!\n\n THANK YOU ALL SO FUCKING MUCH.\n\n**UPDATED POST HERE:** [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43wk5m/update_my_23f_boyfriend_28m_of_8_years_says_im/)",

He preyed upon you when you were 15 and he was 20 and he has been abusing you ever since then because he has always had the upper hand financially and you have been very helpless.\n\nYou need to look up Gaslighting and read about it, please. That is a very well known technique that abusers use. It's when they try to make you think you are crazy. Or they deny reality and try to enforce their made up version of \"reality.\" He is gaslighting you anytime he says or does something and then denies it afterwards. Or when he does a certain thing and then accuses you of being the one who does it. Gaslighting is just an extreme/manipulative form of lying. But that's basically what it is. Lying.\n\nI'm so sorry that you're in this situation. It's not normal at all. Most guys are not like this. \n\nPlease learn to see the signs of abuse for what they are. \"Gaslighting\" and so on.

Please stick to your guns and don't let him worm his way in. \n\nSo much of your post - in between descriptions of his abusive, controlling behaviour - centres on you trying to change yourself and behaviour to pacify him. This never works and, as you've experienced, just spirals out of control. \n\nOnce you are physically free of him, you will be able to start being emotionally free from him (strongly suggest therapy!!) and I really hope that day comes soon.

I was in an abusive relationship before too, and I've also been the abuser in a relationship. Abusive people make you feel like you're the crazy one. But there's a very simple way to tell-- if you're questioning your sanity, then you're not the one who's crazy. Abusive people never question that anything they do is wrong, ever. They often have to have a VERY dramatic event happen in their lives to give them an objective perspective and cause them to realize the truth of what they've been doing to people. For me that was being left completely alone during an unexpected pregnancy. As awful as that sounds, it was the best thing to happen to me, and many abusive people aren't so lucky.\nYou would really benefit from leaving this relationship and seeking therapy. It's very likely you're codependent and have some serious issues with abandonment that will lead you to attract abusive people over and over. Just think, what will your life look like 5 or 10 years from now if you allow things to stay the same?\nPlease seek proffessional help immediately. Best of luck.\n",

He is distancing you from your friends, and making your life centered around him.\n\nFrom what you described, just get the fuck away from him. Just reread everything you wrote here. There is nothing for you in this relationship. Absolutely nothing. The last eight years you invested in this is gone, they can't be redeemed or relived.\n\nCall the police now. They can chaperone you if you suspect your partner is going to abuse you.",

In the end it turned out that I wasn't crazy, that he was not only treating me poorly and cheating on me, but he reveled in the fact that he could convince me that I was crazy for even wondering such things. \n\nThis sounds like a very similar situation to what you are currently dealing with.

I would always chase, he would call me \"stupid, bitch, clingy, crazy\" etc. And while the worst he did to me was put me in debt and borrowed a shit ton of money from my friends (without paying back), so he could move to Utah, your boyfriend might seriously hurt you.

She did leave him eventually and went back home with her kids.\n\nHe is a sociopath and the pinnacle of Narcissist. He will never change. He will never treat women properly.\n\nHe will make them feel great at first. He is very charming, very fun, very intelligent.\n\nHe will then wear them down over time and isolate them from their network (family/friends).\n\nHe will then use and abuse them horribly when he knows he has them trapped.\n\nHe will never change and neither will you BF.\n\nAnd the things you described, is exactly the things he would pull.\n\nYour BF is a fuckwit and you need to go.\n\n ",

        "selftext": "I was home for the weekend when I received a text from Eric, my ex-boyfriend from high school. He and I attempted long-distance when I left for college last year, but I ultimately ended the relationship because I didn\u2019t see it going anywhere. But I did still care about him, and breaking up with him wasn\u2019t easy. \n\nHe invited me over to a small party at a mutual friend\u2019s house, so I went. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. Maybe I would see him and change my mind about the whole thing, maybe I wouldn\u2019t, but either way, I still decided to go because I missed him.\n\nIt was nice to see Eric again. A little while into the party I was fairly certain that I wanted to reconcile a friendship with him. As far as a relationship or anything of the sort, it still didn\u2019t feel right. But catching up was nice.\n\nThere was a lot of alcohol and a lot of weed at this party. I\u2019d never drank and smoked at the same time before, but I was with people who I trusted, so I thought I\u2019d be fine. I was wrong; I smoked and drank so much that I lost track of how many drinks I\u2019d had, to the point that I vomited and then passed out in the host\u2019s (old friend from high school) bed. Or maybe it was just a really deep sleep. Either way, I was completely out.\n\nI woke up with my dress pulled up and my ex having sex with me. It hurt. I was completely dry. It took me a moment to register what was happening, but once I realized, I tried to push him off. He was heavy and stronger than I was. I was still having trouble even keeping my eyes open. I told him to stop (slurred, more like) and he acted like he didn\u2019t hear me and just kept going. He finished (pulled out and came on my dress) and left the bedroom without saying a single word to me. I was laying in the bed, my dress still hiked up, trying not to pass out again, but I did. \n\nI woke up to him bringing another girl into the room and having sex with her while I was half-conscious in the bed next to them. I felt so disgusting. When I completely woke up around 6:00 AM, everyone was still sleeping, and I just left. I\u2019m home now, with a hangover from hell.\n\nEmotionally I\u2019m a mess. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if I should tell someone. I feel like I should, but I don\u2019t know who. Not to mention that I was drinking while underage and on drugs when it happened. And he was drinking, too. A part of me just wants to forget about the whole thing, but this really doesn't feel right.\n\nTlDr: Ex invited me to a party. Got very drunk and very high, to the point of passing out. Woke up to him having sex with me and wouldn\u2019t stop. Passed out again. Woke up to him bringing another girl into the room and having sex with her as I lay next to them in the bed. Woke up again, drove home, at a loss for what to do now, or if I should do anything at all.\n",

            "This is 100% rape. Don't wash the dress you were wearing if you haven't yet, his semen in evidence if he says you're lying. There's no excuse for letting him off and if I knew where this was/who either of you were I would have called for you. Let someone know who you trust if you can't do this alone. ABSOLUTELY do not let this go. This man is a danger to you and anyone else who he just happens to find passed out. ",
            "You were raped, put your dress in a ~~plastic~~ paper bag, don't shower and go to the hospital and tell them what happened. They will call the police and bring in a counselor for you to speak with and sort out.",
            "Go to the hospital. Immediately. Get rape tested. If it hurt they may be able to document abrasions or physical evidence that will be very important in getting this reported. Call the cops. The hospital will probably have a rape counselor or personal on staff that will get you in contact with the right people and the right resources. Bring the dress he came on for evidence. Drinking and drugs do not give him the right to rape you and I guarantee you will not be charged. ",

            "Listen carefully, cause this is very important. Quick background, I've worked in the medical field for over 6 years and have dealt with rapes, murders, kidnappings, and chain of custody with police. DO NOT SHOWER. DO NOT CLEAN THE CLOTHES. Call 911, report it for what it is, a rape. Ems doesn't care about drugs, underage booze, strippers, or anything else. A horrible thing happened to you, and you need help. They can take you to the hospital or someone can drive you there, but you need a rape kit test done, you need blood, urine samples taken asap. Those will help if you think he drugged you. Keep this post saved. DO NOT CONTACT HIM. Let me repeat that, DO. NOT. CONTACT. HIM. I don't care what he says, does, tries, messages, friends say, or anything else. Don't fucking talk to him in any way shape or form. Not to him, about him, don't fucking think about him without the prosecution present. Clear? Moving on, after evidence has been collected, they will question you. This part sucks and takes hours. It will be hard, but it will make it easier to catch him and put him where he belongs. After you can go home, shower, take a bath. Do whatever you want, just don't be home alone. Once shit for brains gets picked up, and trial is done, you can put this night behind you. I'm sorry for what that fucking sad excuse of a man did to you. But don't let him get off free with it. Go get help. Make him legally pay for the crime he commited. Hopefully him and the guy from subway will meet each other in jail.",

This is something that no one should ever have to live through and I am so sorry that this happened.\n\nThat being said, it's ok that you were drinking and it's ok that you smoked some weed. Honestly, those are pretty minor offenses, and I am 99.9% sure that the cops won't care that you were doing them. That information IS crucial to tell the police though,and I 100% recommend going to the cops as soon as possible. The police will want to know that information because it solidifies the fact that were you incapable of consent. That you were absolutely not ok with him doing what he did to you. Let your mom know, she's going to be a little upset with the drinking, but more than anything she's just going to want to make sure you are ok. \n\nPLEASE go to the police. PLEASE press charges. Anyone capable of doing this to someone they loved is capable of doing it to anyone.\n\nI was raped when I was 15, and I want you to know that if you don't go to counseling as well, it can really stay with you and affect your life in the future, I would recommend finding a counselor to talk to as soon as you can, they will also help you with dealing with the police officers and your parents. But I promise you, people are going to want to help you, they aren't going to want to shame you, and you are going to get through this and come out ok on the other end.\n\nMessage me if you need anything at all. You are strong, you are a completely innocent party, and you are going to be ok.\n\n*edit for formatting*",
            "First off, I'm so sorry that this happened to you. No one deserves this, and I can only imagine how much is going through your head right now.\n\nI hope you're in the company of loved ones and are receiving proper care and support. I know you posted this a few hours back, but as a California certified rape crisis counselor, I wanted to give you some additional information that may be of some use to you. Although this information is based on my knowledge and training in California, I would imagine that similar policies and practices are in place elsewhere.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nTo begin, I cannot assert enough that this is not your fault. You are not to blame, the alcohol and the weed are not to blame---this person took advantage of you when you were incapacitated and unable to give consent. That being said, you have various options you may consider whenever you feel ready:\n\n\n- Given that the assault happened very recently and you mentioned that you were hurt in the process, I implore you to seek medical attention, if you haven't already, ASAP. Find the rape crisis center for your designated county based on where the assault occurred or where you're from (which matters because of police jurisdiction and funding) and tell the staff there that you were assaulted. You should been seen for free, and you don't have to perform a rape test kit if you don't want to. There, the hospital staff can at least treat any injuries and give you preventative medicine.\n\n\n- Should you decide to perform a rape test kit, bring your clothes and whatever else you can in a paper bag, and if possible, do not shower.\nThe rape test kit itself may entail collection of evidence such as swabs around your vagina and uterus, taking pictures, as well as some other tests. **That being said, it is completely your choice as to whether or not you want a rape test kit done, and even if you've already begun, you can stop the test at any time.**\n\n\n- Also, you may have the right to have a person of your choice, as well as a medical advocate to be in the room with you during the process. With that, if possible, I would recommend requesting a medical advocate, as doctors, nurses, and if they show up, the police, are all mandated reporters who each have their own objectives and agendas. That isn't to say that they're bad ones---they just might be different than what you want. However, a medical advocate's job is to make sure you're alright, and legally, they are the only person who can provide full confidentiality. In other words, if there's something you want to say that you don't want others to possibly report, take your medical advocate aside to speak in private. *note that advocates also become mandated reporters if you might hurt yourself and/or others*\n\n\n- Afterwards, you may want to look into local organizations and rape crisis centers for further support and resources. Some may offer services such as case management, peer counseling, crisis hotlines, and/or may be able to put you in touch with other folx who can provide such. They also may be able to give you referrals to therapists and other organizations beyond the realms of sexual assault. \n\n\n- Lastly, take care of yourself in whatever way is necessary. No matter what anyone says, you know what is best for you, and everything from here on out is your choice. **There is no right or wrong way to go about this; you are the expert in your own healing.**\n\n\nThat's everything I can think of off the top of my head, but if I remember anything else, I'll edit it in. Also, feel free to message me at any point if you have any questions or just want to talk. I wish you the best.",

        "selftext": "Hello everyone. So I've had this crush on my coworker for a few months now, and it's really not good. We only see eachother in passing, and he's only talked to me once about something work related. Even though we don't talk, we do look at each other sometimes, so we notice each other's existence. He's very outgoing and friendly with other people on my team. He's also very attractive. I enjoy being around him, but I'm way too nervous to talk to him. Honestly, I basically just admire him from afar. I'm not interested in a relationship with anyone right now, partially because I need therapy to heal from past relationships first, so I'm definitely not trying to be together with him. I just like him.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad, except it's become unhealthy for me. Whenever he's around, I get so overwhelmed that it's difficult to concentrate on my work. Sometimes I have to walk away and take deep breaths to calm down. I just get so nervous and preoccupied with my thoughts. I realize this sounds ridiculous, it is. I also can't stop thinking about him. It seems like I spend the entire day looking forward to seeing him, then once he's gone I feel empty and sad. I recognize this is really unhealthy and potentially creepy.\n\nI work with some good friends and I genuinely enjoy their company, I also like my job a lot so it's not that work is boring without him. I'm actually a very talkative and happy person with everyone else. I really want to get over these feelings because they're useless and only hurting me. To be honest, this isn't the first co-worker I've felt this way about. At my last job, I also had a crush on my manager and it was on the same unhealthy level. So I feel like becoming fixated on people is reoccuring problem, and I really would like to know how I can change this pattern.\n\nI welcome your honest thoughts on this situation.\n\nTL;DR: I have a coworker that I really like, even though we never talk, and it's become an unhealthy crush because I get so overwhelmed when he is around that it's interfering with my job. I already accept that we won't (and shouldn't) be together. I just need advice on getting over him and changing whatever is causing me to feel this way.\n\nEDIT: I seriously can't believe how many people have responded to my post. Every single comment has something very relevant and beneficial to say, and you all have given me a lot of insight about my feelings and ways to cope. All of your compassionate and understanding words are helping me tremendously. I'm sincerely thankful for all of your responses. I will take your suggestions to heart, and as some of you advised I'll bring this up during therapy when I get the chance to go. I will take some time to reply to individual posts soon, but please know I'm reading all of them and am truly grateful for your input. Also, that so many of you can relate to having unhealthy crushes makes me both happy and sad. It feels good to know I'm not alone, although I wish the best for all of us, that we can move on and find fulfillment in our lives. Thank you all so much.",

            "Well done acknowledging that this crush isn't a positive thing for you right now. You said that you need therapy for something else right now, so why not bring this crush up as an issue as well? The two things may be more related than you think, so working on these two issues concurrently with your counsellor (the crush and your other relationships) could actually help you get to the root of your issue quicker.",
            "It may be a reach but personally I used to have a similar issue and I believe it was due to low self esteem and a need to attach myself to others in order gain their approval and validation; I felt that, if this cool person accepted me and chose me, then I could allow myself to feel valuable. Realistically though it was an unhealthy coping mechanism. How is your self esteem? Do you validate yourself largely through external relationships?",
            "Therapist here!\n\nCRUSHES ARE SO FUCKING HARD. They're hard because there's a lot of mystery behind a crush. We typically meet them in environments where we are around them often, even if they're not deliberately close to us in that environment. It's also easy to look at someone and imagine this fantasy that you're not even sure really exists. Good on you that you recognize the unhealthy nature of this crush and honestly, the way you're responding to it makes sense because there's a LOT of tension I bet. This, like anxiety, can cause a physiological experience that can be uncomfortable and interfere with our day-to-day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't like giving advice but what I will say is sometimes to either a) break that mystery by getting to know that person a little more or b) tell your mind that this person is more than the way you are envisioning him/experiencing him. Sometimes we can just train our brains to notice the shit we're making up versus the shit that actually exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this was helpful!! It's happened to me too <3",
            "Ummm...  everyone is telling you therapy. That's good advice.\n\nBut also, when you see yourself developing a crush, why not just try talking to the guy?\nI mean, it's true that it's just the idea of the person you've fixated and dreamed up. So, shake up the dreamland with reality.\n\nI've been attracted to men--and then two minutes into the conversation, all chemistry died.\n\nOr maybe it'll turn out that you guys become friends. Idk. It just seems like you're making this very \"either or\". Black or white. He exists and so do you and in the same workplace.",

            "https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/bthu2j/how_do_i_19f_look_for_people_in_real_life_without/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nI have (had?) the same problem, especially when I'm new to a place. I got a lot of good advice on this post, but in my experience, the main things that help are:\n\n(1) Focusing on your own goals. You say you know you're not ready for a relationship right now, so stick to that. I know it's easy to say \"I'm not looking for anything right now\" when you don't have any prospects and then throw yourself at the first one you find, but if you do you're gonna have a bad time. Is your job related to your \"dream career\" or is it just something that pays the bills for now? Right now I'm very focused on my education, and it's so freeing to be fulfilled by something outside of myself, rather than being wrapped up in other people (crushes or otherwise). If not your job, maybe a hobby you really enjoy. This is also a good way to meet people who you're actually compatible with once you *are* ready for a relationship.\n\n(2) Thinking about what you actually want in a partner. When I was younger, I was so desperate to have a boyfriend that basically any average-to-hot guy in my age range became a \"situation\", and the vast majority of them I was incompatible with in hindsight. It's a sign of low self-esteem, but you have to have your own standards (not necessarily in terms of physical looks, but what kind of personality do you like spending time with? What interests do you want to share with someone?) and, if it's important enough to you, dig deeper to find out whether he actually meets them- and be honest with yourself about whether or not he does. My \"friends\" tried to push me into another situation (after a year of complaining about how annoying they were...) months after I wrote that post based on nothing but one conversation, and I didn't even like the guy like that. In most of my previous situations, if I had thought about it enough I would have realized that I didn't like the guy like that. By overcoming the \"decent looking male = romantic interest\" conditioning, it allows you to develop genuine connections with people and *then* see where they lead.\n\n(3) The fact that this is a pattern could be a sign of codependency and/or an insecure attachment style. You might want to consider bringing this up with your therapist- I did, and I've made a lot of progress on this in just a few short months. Even being aware of the problem helps me to recognize it and nip it in the bud- \"no, these weird feelings don't mean that I like my TA, it's just the effects of laughing and prolonged eye contact. There's nothing about him that would make me attracted to him, besides being male and existing in my vicinity. Proceed as normal.\"\n\n(4) If nothing else works, time eventually puts everything in perspective. There was this one guy I was obsessed with for the better part of my freshman year of college, and the first time I spoke to him as a sophomore, I completely *forgot* that I used to have a crush on him until after the conversation was over. (I was way too proud of myself for this, lol.) The thing is, time doesn't always stop you from making the same mistakes with new people.\n\nHope this helps!

            "Hi! (Happily) married person here who tends to get a lot of crushes. Good for acknowledging that the crush isn\u2019t working for you. Something I\u2019ve noticed with myself is that whenever I develop a crush on someone, it\u2019s usually because there is something about them that I wish either I had more of myself or that I wish I had in my life at the time. Like if someone is funny and outgoing, maybe I wish I was a little more that way. If they\u2019re a stable older person who seems to have their stuff together, it\u2019s because I wish I had a little more certainty in my life at the moment. If you can identify the things about him that you like the most, and then try to add these things into your own life or work on them in some way - this can make the crush sometimes disappear or at least dramatically diminish.  Also, remember that crushes are totally normal, and are sometimes completely biological... maybe your brain just *really* likes the smell of his pheromones. Just remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to feel how you do, and try not to fantasize about him or build him up in your head. Hope this helps!",
            "Hey! This may be some stuff that\u2019s lurking under the surface from your past relationships or even childhood that might have traumatized you in some way- sounds like therapy is definitely a good idea!\n\nMaybe just also try to remember that you don\u2019t even really know this guy - you\u2019re idealizing him a lot in your head based on his appearance and the limited interactions you\u2019ve seen him had with others. For all you know, he\u2019s a racist or not a nice person! (Obviously exaggerations but you get what I\u2019m saying). I think if you maybe just stop whenever you feel those things and remember the feeling you have is just about the idea of this dude rather than the actual guy, that may help a bit?",
            "I have this same pattern of obsession with people. It's funny, when I'm in this rut it feels suffocating, but when I'm out of it I always wonder when I would ever like someone to that degree again. It could be years or never. So don't have any regrets when making your decision :)\n\nAnyways, if you've decided that you don't want a relationship (and not just because you're scared and making up other excuses), I think there are two solutions based on the situation.\n\nHave you know him for a long time? There's a difference between liking the idea and potential of someone you recently met and liking someone you've knows for years and know deeply.\n\nIf you really don't know him that well. Try talking to him some more. This usually reveals that they're a human being like the rest of us. And gradually you'll probably become more comfortable around him. Note that this doesn't mean you would stop liking him as a person. It's getting over the obsession part. I would start out by going to group events and talking to him there so there's not too much pressure.\n\nIf you know him deeply (I'm guessing this is unlikely since you avoid him), well that's tricky. Let me say though, you are probably getting jittery at the thought of being with him, because he's single and available. I feel like you wouldn't be so obsessed over him if he were in a stable relationship, for example. At this point I would go for trying to create more physical distance...\n\nI'm not a therapist!",
            "Bring this up in your therapy sessions. Talk through everything you wrote here and let your therapist help you figure out ways to diminish fixation at this level, in addition to helping you figure out *why* you feel crushes so intensely. You're right...it is unhealthy to feel this strongly about someone you do not even know, but it's a great sign that you've acknowledged it's not a healthy mindset because then you have a much better chance at learning methods to handle those feelings in the future.",
            "It's ok. I am married and had a similarly intense crush on another student. These things happen. I even cried in yoga class one time when they weren't there. What helped me A LOT was consciously trying to let the thoughts pass. \"Ok, I am feeling the butterflies. That is ok. Instead of fixating on this feeling, I am going to breathe and let my thoughts drift.\"\n\nTime helped...a lot. Are you able to work on location for a bit, work from home temporarily, or take a vacation?",
            "Maybe this is a skill that you learn if you grow up having to hide your bisexuality, but crushes don't have to be sexual or romantic. Having a crush can be a good feeling (although I recognize that \"too much\" can be bad, too much excitement for example is basically anxiety), try to enjoy it.\n\nIf you can rule out a romantic or sexual relationship in your mind (maybe easier said than done) you might be able to put that energy into a completely platonic relationship, so long as the other person isn't trying to push it in a different direction.\n\nYou need the discipline not to be overbearing on the other person but I have some very good friendships that started off as crushes.\n\nEdit: I'm not sure if this is applicable though, just a perspective on crushes that may be helpful.",

            "Hey OP, I went through this same thing earlier this year,  so I know the struggle. Unfortunately I let an infatuation pretty much rearrange my life, and I\u2019m not sure what could have been done about it. Sometimes life just throws you a curve ball I guess.\n\nSo my crush was/is significantly younger than me (early-mid 20s, I\u2019m in mid 30s), and never showed any interest or anything beyond very minimal pleasantries. Right from the get go I knew the dynamic was hopeless and creepy (I\u2019m not exactly the most handsome or charming dude around), but at some point I realized I was MASSIVELY infatuated with this girl. To make things worse, I had been in a long term, loving relationship, and the crush (I admitted it to my ex, without trying to cheat) effectively dismantled that - it was brutal and painful, and we tried to work it out but couldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been single and dating since then, but my ex is almost certainly \u201cthe one who got away\u201d. I live with constant regret now, of what could have been. \n\nI ultimately asked out this coworker (over text, and without any \u201csoftening up\u201d so to speak), and was politely rejected. It was rough but expected, and I believe I\u2019ve handled it well - returning to professional and friendly interaction, without bothering her again; hopefully she isn\u2019t creeped out by me now, but I\u2019d bet she is. The thing is, the infatuation never stopped and has only become worse - it\u2019s been like 10 months total and I still consider this girl \u201cthe one\u201d (as in, if she gave me a chance I\u2019d do everything in my power to make it last and ultimately tie the knot...trust me I know how crazy that sounds).\n\nSo it\u2019s a crazy and scary rabbit hole to go down, this infatuation thing. If you don\u2019t have anything to lose by entertaining the notion, then by all means GO FOR IT - when you\u2019re this into someone I believe it\u2019s your body/mind trying to send you in the right direction. It can cause terrible damage too, but maybe that destruction was inevitable regardless and it was just a matter of time. I don\u2019t know. \n\nThe point I\u2019m at now is to just try my best to live and work and deal with it, knowing that I\u2019m super into this coworker. I still have foolish hope, like \u201cwell now she knows I\u2019m interested, maybe she\u2019ll stew over it and reciprocate over time!!\u201d, but it causes me so much turmoil (the other day I fucking CRIED after a team lunch type of thing, since just being around her is overwhelming). I hope that one day I\u2019ll be able to move on and no longer believe that she\u2019s the most beautiful and charming person I\u2019ve ever seen (and that it\u2019s possible for me to find someone else I feel this way about, who will like me back), but I just don\u2019t know. This one is just unreal, like a unicorn created in a lab to be absolutely perfect to me. And I\u2019m getting older, if I don\u2019t straighten up I\u2019ll be alone forever (I\u2019m dating successfully, but honestly I just want that one unicorn and it scares me how long I\u2019d be willing to wait).\n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about my situation and what it all means. I think that if you ever run across someone that you\u2019re THIS into, even if there seems to be very little realistic chance, you owe it to yourself and to THEM to at least express some interest and let them know (of course without being pushy, creepy, or threatening. And you have to accept NO when it comes). Because on my side, everything is already there to create an amazing story and life together - it\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s focused on someone who couldn\u2019t care less. Every time I see her (or even hear her voice, ugh), it\u2019s like getting blasted with EVERY AMAZING LOVE SONG EVER WRITTEN, all at once. It\u2019s fucking obliterating. I also don\u2019t want to hurt anyone else while I wait for my perfect unicorn... but it\u2019s starting to look like hurt is inevitable, since being alone sucks (I know that isn\u2019t fair to the other party, but should I be alone forever then?)\n\nI can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m insane or thinking more clearly than I\u2019ve ever been, but I\u2019ve never had this type of reaction to anyone. I knew this would be a wild ride as soon as it started.",
            "2 things:\n\n1. Ever hear how attractive people have it easier in life? Reasons like this are why. We are automatically predisposed to like attractive, outgoing, people. Initially, our liking them has nothing to do with who they actually are as a person but rather what they represent. I've been guilty of it myself. What has helped me greatly overcome this pro hot people bias is humanizing them.In the simplest of ways, I think to myself, no matter how good-looking or awesome someone seems, there's someone in their life that they annoy. Maybe they're not a very good brother or son, maybe he's dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings, maybe he's stubborn to a fault, maybe he never cleans dishes up after himself. He's got faults and maybe pretty bad ones at that. Guaranteed there is someone in his life that actually knows him and he pisses them off to no end.If this humanization technique doesn't work start mentally creating a list about the most unattractive things about him that are probably true or have been at some point. For eg. He's eaten his own booger, he has $40,000 in CC debt, he cheated on a college exam, sometimes he finds shit streaks in his underwear and wonders if anyone smelled them, he spends 20 minutes fussing with his hair every time he goes out gets super mad if anyone tries to touch it, he thinks 10% is a good tip, he secretly thinks women shouldn't be allowed run in politics cause he thinks their periods mess with their judgment, he doesn't rerack weights at the gym cause he knows other people will clean up after him. Long story short - humanize him. These ideas about him you come up with don't even have to be true, it's just a technique to start practicing seeing him as something other than godly. Trust me, he isn't perfect, not even close. In fact, a lot of the very good looking people I know are significantly more messed up than my average-looking friends.\n2. Recognize within yourself that you are not in love/crushing on him, you like the idea/story you've created about him. You don't know him. You don't even know how old he is. You only know his work persona which is probably quite different than how he acts in his personal life. You've attached good feelings to his presence, but what does he actually do to make you feel good? You've admitted you hardly interact. In fact, if we slip on the reality lense here, your feelings for him are damaging your mental health and work productivity. Those aren't positive things at all!\n\nI'm not saying this to be mean. I've been in your position and also came to the realization I was taking my crushes way too far. You're addicted to that high feeling, not him. If it wasn't him, it would be some other guy. Just acknowledging to yourself that the fantasy you've created around him is not really real. It goes a long way in being able to let it go. I know sounds silly but next time you see him, think \"shit-streaked boxers\" over and over and you might find yourself feeling a little silly and relieved when the spell has been broken. Be aware of what you're doing in the moment. He's just a dude. Born with a nice face, that has given him a leg up in life. You don't know him and you don't need to. He's just another dude you work with. Exhale. Take him off the pedestal.\n\nP.S. This got a lot easier for me with age. I also dated a really attractive dude for a bit and he wound up being super pathetic and probably one of my biggest dating regrets. Biggest spell breaker of all.",
            "I needed this post so much",
            "It seems like you're the female version of me... Something similar has happened to me about a month and a half ago, with a girl who works at the same company as I do but with another team. My case was made worse by the fact that I found out she is engaged and it hurt a bit to know I couldn't pursue that crush further.\n\nI then noticed on myself the same pattern you did of becoming attached and fixated too easily to people. In my case, it's probably because I never had that many friends growing up, nor any potential romantic relationships. So anything that I see that could turn into one I cling onto it like my life depended on it because it feels that opportunities like these are too difficult to come across, as my mindset stems from a place of scarcity. Therapy played a huge part on this discovery, so it was important to have someone help me search those things within myself; while I'm not saying your case is similar to mine, you might discover something about yourself along those lines.\n\nAnyway, what I have been trying to do is basically getting to know more people. Like, as many people as possible, regardless of the setting. The more people you interact with, the more you learn about others and in turn, you discover things about yourself as well. And by immersing yourself in this, the idea is to abolish the thought that one single person is so special that they deserve your undivided attention and be the sole focus of your fantasies and desires. Having an abundance of people coming and going through your life is the key to avoid falling into these kinds of pitfalls.\n\nLastly, crushes come and go. It's normal to fantasize about people. To desire them. It's part of the human nature. What we do with them is up to us, and we have to learn how to control our emotions instead of having them controlling us. Kudos for you to walking a path towards emotional self-control.",
            "First of all I want to say I'm not a therapist. I'm also somebody who particularly enjoys what you are describing, crushes on my co-workers make the day that much more fun and I feel like I have a reason to get dolled up. And a little friendly flirting boosts my ego. \n\nWith that said, I completely feel for you because it is overwhelming, especially when you aren't into it. My random person girl-to-girl advice would be to try and find things about him that are not attractive. Bring out your inner vanity and focus on them. If you guys are ever talking just socially, try and bring up another girl and talk her up to him. Put your relationship firmly in the friend zone. Sometimes feeling like I've given him a signal that there's absolutely no chance helps me stop seeing someone in that light after a while because it's like I've closed that door. Maybe it won't work, but that's helped me in the past.",
            "I actually really understand this, and can relate a bit. When I was young I always had a crush on someone, it would be the soul crushing kind. But I NEVER actively pursued them or wanted to them to know. Many times I barely socialized with them. They also all had something in common. They were unavailable to me, unattainable, unreachable, and the more off limits they were the harder I crushed. \n\nI've recently come to understand that I am incredibly scared of intimacy. Vulnerability and intimacy make me really uncomfortable. When I take these two things I think they're related. \n\nPerhaps this issue with crushing you're having stems from the same kind of issue?  I don't know why your last relationship didn't last or why you need therapy for it, but maybe a fear of intimacy could be part of the problem?",

            "Hey OP, totally know where you're coming from. Question: are you a person who suffers from anxiety and/or can get really hyper-focused on things (whether work, hobbies, or other)? If so, you could be experiencing something called maladaptive daydreaming. I've noticed about myself that when I'm under a lot of stress, my mind tends to obsess about something unrelated to the main source of stress. Sometimes this means I do a lot of online shopping-- like I get this vision of the \"perfect\" outfit and can't stop until I've done price comparisons and bought all the components. Other times, I get an intense crush on someone and get really carried away. \n\nI finally realized a few years ago that this was just my brain's unhelpful way of siphoning off stress from whatever was really bothering me. Now, I can usually stop it as soon as I realize, \"Uh oh, there I go again!\" \n\nMaybe this isn't you...but putting it out there just in case!",

You\u2019ll either realize he isn\u2019t perfect like you think and get over him fast, or you\u2019ll at least hopefully get over the \u201cwow this guy is amazing and I can\u2019t think of anything else while he\u2019s around\u201d \n\nMaybe bring this guy up in your next therapy session?",

            "Okay so a few years ago I worked at a place and we had a customer that would come in frequently that was just gorgeous. He had stunning eyes and a perfect smile. He was also very friendly and personable. He would come in and look at me with his eyes and smile at me and talk to me in a flirty way, and I would just melt. I developed a crush on him and looked forward to him coming in. A few months of this, and he ended up getting a job there. I got to know him a lot better and we became friends but we had very different viewpoints and I also started to see him as more human and less idealized. I still had a crush on him but it was very mild because we were so different. So maybe get to know the guy and take some of the shine off. But then again I have had this backfire once with a different guy who I ended up having a lot in common with and we got on like a house on fire. So your mileage may vary but I have found that getting to know someone usually helps more than it hurts.  \n\n\nI agree with the folks that say to discuss this in therapy. This is something you could work out and they can give you coping tools and strategies for when you are around this person.\n\nOne more thing, I don't want to sound condescending, but when I was your age I still got really intense crushes, but over time I became less prone to them. So it might be something that happens less as you get older.",
            "I\u2019m yet another women who has had to navigate unbearable crushes. My most recent crush happened a year ago, including the excessive eye-contact nonsense. He\u2019s a classmate and I most definitely put him on a pedestal. A portion of my attraction to him was probably a wish to see some qualities of his personality in my own (for example, gregariousness). As others here have have suggested, I tried talking to him more, hoping to find a quality that turned me off of him permanently, but that quest failed. He was also single, so that didn\u2019t help. I talked to my boyfriend about this crush as the internet advises one to do, but that didn\u2019t help either, and our newly long-distance relationship kept struggling. Lucky for me I tend to lose interest in someone after getting rejected. I was 99% sure he was not interested in me. But I guess that 1% was still there and my crush wasn\u2019t fading with time. A few months into the school year I told him I have a crush on him and I needed him to reject me so that I can stop having a crush on him. He kindly told me he was interested in a girl from back home. I apologized for the uncomfortable conversation; he was very nice about it all. I started to get over him! I do feel a bit creepy and selfish for forcing that conversation on him, but I don\u2019t regret it. Whatever you decide to do, good luck, your not alone, and hugs.",
            "I used to experience this whenever I really liked someone.  I went to therapy for several years...not for this but this type of thing came out. I realized it was a lot of anxiety because I have attachment issues because I ONLY felt these feelings with people either I didn't know or in the long run were not good for me.\n\nPart of what helped eventually is daily I'd remind myself this person could be a COMPLETE asshole. I know NOTHING about them. They could be abusive. The beatles lied, love is not all we need. We need respect, trust, communication, etc. and I had no idea if this person embodied all of the things I needed. And that feeling I had that I labelled a \"crush\" was actually an anxiety response because of early childhood  shit that caused me to prioritize others over my own well being.\n\nEventually as I resolved internally what was going on and learned to ground myself in the reality of the situation,those feelings resided. It's like internal parenting. Set guidelines for yourself to do what you need to do. Your world is more important than someone you hardly know.",
            "And even if this person is GREAT, humanizing him a little more will lessen the intensity of the crush. It\u2019s weird but it\u2019s true.",
            "It happens and that is that.  Do you really know if it is unhealthy?",
            "Your mind is fixating for a reason. Even though this is actually hurting you, there\u2019s a part of your mind that thinks it\u2019s helping by doing this. What are you getting out of this fixation? What is it protecting you from? You did say that you still have fun at work, so it probably isn\u2019t doing this out of boredom.\n\nYou mentioned that you\u2019re healing from past relationships. Could it be that your heart is yearning for someone to love, but doesn\u2019t feel safe, so you\u2019ve fixated on someone \u201cunattainable\u201d as an outlet?",
            "I had a crush on a former co-worker that was so bad that I actually had to quit and find another job.  At my new job I'm at, I'm so thankful I have my own space and that I don't see people much unless they come up to my station.  There's this guy at my new job, too, that I'm interested in getting to know but because of my last bad experience, I haven't been pursuing it.  If I run into him, cool, but I'm not going to go out of my way to run into him.\n\nPlus, I don't know if he has a girlfriend or not.  Usually the ones I meet who have stable jobs already have girlfriends so I'm willing to bet my new crush at my new job already has someone.  \n\nI've been keeping my distance so it doesn't end up like my last job with me quitting.  Having my own office space where I don't see much of anyone helps in not running into the said co-worker.\n\nIf you can, keep your distance from him and only see him if you have to - like don't go out of your way to see him just to see him and remind yourself keeping a job is more important than a temporary crush.",
            "Work relationships are not a good idea.",
            "Find things you don't like about him and repeat those thoughts when you find yourself thinking of him. For example, \" he's really kind to me...but he doesn't like cats so i could never be with him.\" Or \"the way he talks/dresses remind me of my brother, I could never date him.\" Etc. Just create and find ways to not like him.",
            "I think the technique you should be looking for is \"mindfulness.\"\n\nYou recognize that you really don't know this guy and that a relationship is not something you need right now.\n\nSo the problem that remains is that he takes up your thoughts, fantasies, and also affects your bodily responses like heart rate or breathing. \n\nWhen you see him and your body responds with a racing heart or irregular breathing, practice mindfulness. Focus your efforts on slowing your heartbeat and breathing normally. \n\nWhen you find yourself thinking about him, focus your efforts on something else. What are the most important or most interesting things going on in your life right now (aside from your coworker)? Focus your thoughts on those things.\n\nFantasize about other things. A relaxing vacation on the beach. Your ideal life after therapy. Or whatever else you dream about.\n\nThis will take time. But these mindfulness exercises teach your body and mind how to respond how you wish them to respond. \n\nGood luck!",
            "I acc had a totally creepy crush on this guy in my year for like 5 years and then wham he got with me out of nowhere and we fell in love, didn't last long but the moral is its only creepy if they don't find you attractive so you might as well find out",
            "Seriously, just don't start masturbaiting to him and you still have hope. It may be a feeling you'll have to work through and that takes time.",
            "It sounds like you don't actually like how you feel or act when you're around him. You could focus on that, because it is something that is within your control. When he walks in, take a moment and notice things about yourself. Is your heart beating faster? What do your hands feel like? What emotion are feeling? Notice the differences in you when he is near you versus when he is not, and then when he is near you, do your best to replicate or remember how it feels when he's gone. Take some deep breaths, focus inwards and give yourself a lot of self compassion as you work towards acting the way you want, regardless of how you feel. \n\nTherapy is also good. I learned these particular skills in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), as well as Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR). Traditional talk therapy was good at first, but I discovered I needed more concrete tools to change my behavior. Happy to send you resources if you want help tracking this stuff down. It can be extremely difficult to navigate the mental health field alone.",
            "Keep in mind, your crush probably knows you like him.  I'm in a similar environment but on the other side playing the role of the \"very attractive\" male and I know who likes me a little more than just the friendly co-worker.  I had shadow banned the whole building  when I started working there ( NO DATING ) as a rule, your guy might follow the same rule .  That being said, I love bumping into them outside of work, they are ridiculously pretty where I work.  Damn the ban.",
            "I\u2019m not a therapist. I have had a similar issue with a crush in the workplace but it conflicted with my don\u2019t shit where you eat policy because if there\u2019s a breakup I don\u2019t want to have to see that person again. For me it was an attachment issue because I felt that the coworker really understood me in a way most people don\u2019t. I asked him out after changing jobs but he wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. There were feelings from his side that I didn\u2019t know about until a friend of his told me. Anyway I have since moved on to healthier relationships with reciprocated feelings and expectations. You can do it too! Just wait until things are more settled in your life to make these relationship \u201cmoves.\u201d",
            "Just talk more and maybe become friends. Attraction is a great precursor to friendship. Get to know them and the more human they are to you, the less \"oh my god\" you'll feel whenever you see them, and the more comfortable you'll feel.",
            "It\u2019s 2020. You chase that tail girl! But as a dude that hooked up with a coworker in a relationship don\u2019t do it. Causes people to quit!",
            "I had something similar to this but not as severe. I ended up getting the guys phone number and upon getting to know him i realized he was a giant asshole.  (I meantioned i had a little crush on him and he just said \"well i think youre hot, buttttt\" and then later on he basically said the only good thing about me was my body. Im very smart, told so by lots of people and my academics reflect this. So it isnt just a hot body i have going for me.) So if you only see each other in passing maybe exchange phone numbers and just text him a little. He might reveal something that totally ruins your crush on him. The opposite could happen, but then maybe you would try harder in therapy if you thought he was a great guy and wanted to be with him, but you know you need to be healed and happy first. Maybe when you start seeing a therapist for your past relationship issues you can mention this dilemma. A therapist will definitely be able to give more insight on how you can change your feelings. My advice is to choose to get to know him and end up either really liking him and going to therapy to get better so you can date him, or you fond out you hate him as a person and no longer like him. Your choice.",
            "Good for you for realizing you need to work on yourself first before entering a relationship :)\n\nSo... this may sound weird, and it could possibly backfire... but since you don't want to leave your job, the best thing to do is to actually force yourself to start talking to him more.  This will hopefully normalize him, rather than continue to unintentionally put him on an emotional pedestal. You may find things about him you don't like that pushes away your feelings. Should you find yourself liking him /more/, then you just need to work on your self-control; continue to catch your feelings, as you are now, and tell yourself it can't happen now.",
            "Why can't you talk to him if you see him so often? Maybe he would like you? If he doesn't at least you can shut it down in your mind. But if you keep it at this level you probably won't be able to move on",
            "I was in your shoes when I was in high school 3 yrs ago.i had a crush on a girl in my class.we didn't talk...At all.maybe here and there a bit about upcoming events and stuff.I used to look at her but not talk.I think she did the same...Coz sometimes when I looked at her she would be looking at me and abruptly look away.i didn't tell her that I liked her...This is the most regretful thing I've done in my life.i still haven't told her.she has a bf now.when I left school I had dreams about her everyday.not in a bad way...I don't even remember what the dreams were.I'm still single and still have a crush on her.i haven't seen her for 3 yrs..Only on Instagram.\nI highly suggest you tell him...Maybe he likes you too and is too shy?What's the worse thing that's gonna happen? You'll be awkward around each other and it's not like you talk a lot.look at the pros:you'll be concentrating on your work.you'll be more confident when around him.",
            "I didn't think it is unhealthy. Hear me out. First, you are not in a relationship now. Second, when we have a crush on someone, we tend to be a more soft, better person. Use that in as an advantage. Consider this crush as motivation rather than jail. Motivation to heal from a prior relationship that caused you hurt. Feel the fire in your hear again. It's a beautiful feeling to feel attached to seeing someone because there will be a time when you will hate everyone. \ud83d\ude0a",
            "Talk to him honestly. If it\u2019s really bothering your work, you should handle it now before it gets any more intense. \n\nHe sounds like a guy that would understand and appreciate you trying to get him to understand your struggle. Plus, he probably feels oblivious to you and your crush of him, so it might shock him to know you\u2019ve been low key obsessed, but in a good respectful way. You recognize that you\u2019re not ready for anything close to a relation, but you also recognize you can\u2019t just ignore these thoughts, they can quickly turn into a negative spiral of self hate and self sabotage. \n\nPlease be careful, and do what\u2019s right for you, don\u2019t think about how he\u2019ll take it think about how you need to express yourself so y\u2019all can have a coercive work environment.",
            "I don't know if this will help at all, but one of my first hard crushes grew very bad over months, i started dreaming him. He wasn't interested at all, so I wrote him a long letter about everything I feel and think about him, it felt like getting him out of my system. I intended to burn it but couldn't bring myself to do it. It also turned up longer than I thought it was going to be. In the end I felt like it helped to pour everything out, it was like i got rid of it. Hope this helps someone!",

He's also very attractive. I enjoy being around him, but I'm way too nervous to talk to him.  \n\nHe might feel the same way about you. You should keep in mind that he is a human being as well. Being attractive does not mean he does not have insecurities of his own.  \n\nI would also second therapy to try to get to the root of the issue.  \n\nAlso, if he likes you back, there is probably a lot he is willing to do. You should ask yourself what you want from him. If you just want someone to talk to, he might be down for that.",
            "Have you ever heard the term limerence? That might apply to you. It\u2019s an obsessive kind of love, usually on someone who\u2019s just out of reach but is close enough that you have little interactions with them throughout the day. It can become obsessive and take over all your thoughts. You should look up resources for this. Some people have limerence and some don\u2019t. Your friends might not get it but there are online communities for it.",
            "I [29M] have a very similar crush towards a co-worker [early-maybe-mid-20sF]. Actually broke down about it yesterday when I went on lunch for work. If it's really eating away at you, to the point you can let out some emotion over it, I highly advise it. It's still there and it might never leave till I leave the job, or she does, but getting a lot of emotion out at once makes the day-to-day easier. Good luck homie.",
            "my 2 cents is to try therapy. psychiatrists and or therapists are great at helping people work through these types of circumstances",
            "When are you starting therapy? A good therapist can help you use this experience to work through it and grow. It's a really good idea not to get involved with people you work with, especially if you have issues you need to work on. \n\nTherapy would be the #1 step if you have access to it. \n\nYou could also start looking for things you don't like about him. Most of the reason you like him is probably based on fantasy and his external appearance. So you could start looking for his flaws (in his appearance, the way he talks to people, etc). None of us are perfect so that might help lessen the intensity of your feelings toward him. And keep reminding yourself that a lot of this obsession is based on fantasy, not reality.",
            "Story time!!!!\n\nOnce upon a time, I got hired in a store that i used to shop in a lot, to get groceries, etc. I submitted my resume at the age of 18, and the manager immediately thought I\u2019d be a great addition to the team, so she hired me on spot. \nI did not know that a handsome, young and mysterious man worked there.\nDays pass and I become uncomfortably attached to him. I will explain the crux of this attachment down towards the bottom of the story. \nHe ended up loving the attention I gave him and he manipulated me for 4 more years. He would get to know where I went to college, enroll in my classes, flirt with me, invite me to his house alone, went on small dates, then would constantly make sensual remarks that my mentally ill brain thought was his way of expressing love. We ate each others energy up and I couldn\u2019t bare the days where he wasn\u2019t there with me. I told people about him and how close we were. Every stare, every move we would make at me just drove me more and more ill. There came a day where I confessed my love for him and he shot me down, extremely painfully and abruptly. He said that I only got this way because I let myself fall, letting him revel in the unhealthy power balance. I fell into a suicidal depression, and then got diagnosed with various personality disorders. I am under very strong medications now. By the way, I did not have a history of falling for anyone like this, so hard, in the past. \n\nTLDR: I became obsessed with my coworker, confessed my love for him, he shot me down and admitted he only liked manipulating me for years.\n\nLISTEN TO YOUR INSTINCTS. Don\u2019t let your mental health slide for a man who could easily make you 1/8th of a person you are now. Talk to a professional and get help before a power imbalance manifests between the two of you. Yes, my story is extremely dramatic and rare, but it is a lesson to learn when you don\u2019t rely on instincts and ignore warning signs in the first place.",

Even if you aren\u2019t a writer! Use it to fuel a creative endevour you have. Then delete it when your done. It\u2019s not bad to have the feelings, it\u2019s about what you do with them.

If they are happy you are and if they are sad you are too. Sort of in that direction. Maybe if you worked on yourself and your identity, you may feel a stronger sense of self. Maybe do some identity and boundary work...and self in that way to get a stronger handle on yourself in our own space and environment...not that it\u2019s bad to have a crush.

I tried to talk to him, but he just made excuses and blamed his behavior on me, so I broke up with him.\n\nThis morning I decided to sit my boyfriend down and explain how hurtful his comments had been. He became very defensive and stated that the labia comment was meant as a compliment. Furthermore, he expressed that he thinks I'm far too sensitive, lack self confidence, and that nobody else would be bothered by his \"negging\". From the responses friends have given me when I've mentioned this (and from the comments on my previous post), I really don't think that's true. Constantly picking apart your significant other's appearance is the abnormal behavior. \n\nHis reaction really drove home for me how selfish and insensitive the dude is. I could name numerous situations during the course of the relationship where he played the martyr, disregarding my needs and feelings entirely. \n\nCases in point (All entirely true- sadly):\n* He managed to break a sex toy (that he had purchased and that I hadn't even wanted to use) so forcefully that it cut me \"down there\". I got to go to urgent care bleeding from the vajayjay and he texted me saying how much it \"sucked that he hadn't gotten off\". \n\n*He demanded to use my laptop to play video games while on vacation, caught the charger cord with his foot while he flailed around playing World of Warcraft, and smashed it to the ground. He had a fit when I asked him to pay for the repairs and went home 10 days early (without me).\n\n*He wore threadbare gym shorts to my grandfather's funeral and watched porn on his phone during the service.\n\nPoint being, the guy's a selfish, disrespectful jerk. I put up with it for far too long and I'm just done. Nobody's significant other should make them feel as crummy as he did me. I hope that he is able to change his behavior and find happiness in a relationship in the future. As for me, I will take my \"lady garden\" somewhere that it will be appreciated in future.
