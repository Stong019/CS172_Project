Chrissy asks Jill if I've got any eligible friends, which I do. \n\nI don't want to set my friends up with Chrissy. I'm not crazy about Chrissy. I've got nothing against her, but she's not someone I'd consider a good match for any of my friends.\n\nShe's the type to swipe through Tinder and make nasty comments about what ugly losers the guys are despite being, uh, not a beauty queen or great success herself. She's loud and brash. She hasn't got much going for her, as far as I can tell. She talks a lot about reality TV, but I've never heard of anything like a hobby or a social life outside of happy hour and internet dating. \n\nI don't judge my wife's friendship with her - some of my friends are jackasses too, whatever. Maybe Chrissy's a fun drinking buddy. But I just don't consider Chrissy a catch and don't want to be responsible for setting her up with my friends. I picture a hypothetical single me being set up on a date with Chrissy, and later telling my matchmaking friend not to do me any more favors.\n\nMy wife, Jill, has brought this up once or twice. The problem is that Chrissy keeps asking Jill about it, and has mentioned it to me once or twice. Chrissy clearly isn't letting this go.\n\nHow do I tell my wife that I rate her friend two thumbs down and get rid of her without being nasty? \n\n**tl;dr**: My wife's friend is an unattractive person inside and out and I need a nice way of telling my wife that I don't want to set her up with my friends.\n\nEDIT: That was fast! Problem solved. Jill saw me OP'ing on /r/relationships, assumed it was about *us,* and asked if there was something I needed to talk about, so I pretty much just spilled it thusly: \"I don't like your friend and I don't want to introduce her to my friends but I didn't want to be a dick about it so I asked reddit what do do.\"\n\nJill laughed and rolled her eyes knowingly - apparently she's not blind to Chrissy's foibles - and said she'd take care of it.",

I went from being a college student living my normal life, to a mom overnight.

My only advice is to just try to be as understanding as possible and take one for the team. Her sex drive may skyrocket and/or plummet; let go of your expectations for a while. \n\nIf the day comes that you decide you don't want to be together anymore, be absolutely sure you have your separation mediated by a third party--which means you should absolutely get a lawyer, even if the breakup is amicable. \n\nBest of luck.

After three days of pushing in the hospital, with no luck, I (the baby) tested positive for meconium aspiration and fetal distress. She had to get an emergency c-section, and it was very dangerous for both she and I. We were both hospitalized for days after the birth as well due to the complications. The hospital bills were also very expensive, and my parents, who were both going to college at the time, ended up having to pay the debt off over the next several years. My youngest aunt also had a very difficult pregnancy and severe morning sickness for most of her first.\n\nYou will also have to figure out how to care for the baby once he/she is born, how to pay for diapers and clothes and other baby supplies, and figure out day care. As a piece of advice, my mother and grandmother both used reusable diapers that my grandmother sewed from cloth. Using reusable diapers can also save a *lot* of money, as opposed to buying disposable diapers all the time, and are much better for the environment.\n\nPersonally, I'm child-free and would get an abortion if in your SO's place, but I respect your SO's decision to keep the baby. However, I do have some experience, as my aunts have had a *lot* of babies (my cousins) in the past. As the eldest cousin by 4+ years, I was expected to help care for them.",
            "The younger you are, the healthier that baby is likely to be.\n\nThe younger you are, the harder it is to afford a child.\n\nThe thing is, it's a lot better to struggle with squat at a young age.  Doing kids when you're older means you can afford to buy them more things, but can't keep up the energy to play with the kids.  Most kids don't need things, they need time with their parents.  If I had gotten that through my skull twenty years earlier, I wouldn't need a chiropractor and steroids to fix my back from picking up my kids all day.\n\nOne suggestion, figure out day care asap.  It's could very easily be your biggest expense for the next 5 years.  I'm excited that two months from now, my day care bill will finally be less than my mortgage.",
            "When my girlfriend at the time got pregnant my world was turned upside down. I was also 17 and she was a lying scumbag who said she was on the pill... but that's another story. \n\n\nYou're not alone, despite the feeling of impending doom. You're doing the right thing, and I commend you for that. Many guys would run - and they do. How? I don't know. I don't know how id live with myself knowing that I have a child out there and I'm not caring for them. I love my daughter (6). Is she stressful? Yeah, kids are, even the good ones, which she is. But you'll fall in love with them. Just be a loving and caring father.\n\n\nAlso, just because you have a child doesn't mean that you NEED to get married. Those are two totally different aspects of life. You should only marry her if you're ready and she's the one.",

Having a kid really sheds some light on who YOU are personally. It will bring out the best AND the worst in both of you. You both may fall in love with each other more. You may fall out of love with each other. Can go either way. Just remember this one important thing though my man. You do not have to be with your girlfriend to still be a great father to your child. Do not beat yourself up daily wondering about your past decisions and how much you may or may not have fucked up. Just remember that no matter what be there for your child and the best father that only you can be for your child.\n\nI have been in this exact situation right at the exact same age as you right now. I KNOW personally what you are going through. If it was anything like my situation it makes sense why you guys are even having that conversation. I feel for brother. I really do.

My significant other had stopped talking to me out of nowhere and a week later I found out I was pregnant with what would be my 3rd child. I sent him a pic of the test, telling him we need to talk, and he begged me to come over and discuss. When I showed up, he was lovey-dovey, wanted to 'work things out' and be together forever, cruises and vacations and a marriage- he wanted everything I wanted.\n\nExcept, he didn't. He wanted me to get an abortion. I sensed that was the real purpose of the meeting and told him I couldn't/wouldn't. He got engaged, disengaged, lost 40 lbs, started a cocktail of anxiety/depression medications, shut off my phone, and spread lies about me. He met our daughter when she was about 3 months old. Then he sued me for custody. \n\nAlmost 3 years later and we're 'together' again. He's lost everything. I love him and I am weak- I don't think he loves me anymore...but he loves his daughter. I just wanted to give him the opportunity to feel unconditional love toward another human. \n\nIt won't be easy but it will be worth it to know you didn't push her to injure her body to appease you and most importantly, when you lay eyes on your daughter/son and realize how powerful such a little life can be. Thank you so much for not destroying it- and for not destroying your girlfriend's faith in you. \n\nThank you for being a man.",

        "selftext": "Today, I happened to stumble across this throwaway. Furthermore, I noticed that it happened to be the throwaway's cakeday so I think *someone* is prodding me to do an update on this!\n\nI posted a year ago about how my wife had [given up alcohol for good and how I was finding it hard to deal with](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40im59/my_wife_30_f_has_given_up_alcohol_for_good_and_i/).\n\nI'd like to thank everyone that commented on the original thread. I did read everything even if I didn't reply to everyone. There were people who thought (as I expected) that I was selfish, that it shouldn't matter that my wife was making that decision and that I likely had my own hidden drinking problems. There were others, though, that understood and could see my point of view.\n\nThe TL/DR of my original post is that my wife had decided to give up alcohol for good, had told me she thought she was an alcoholic and so was going to quit. She was not an alcoholic in the 'traditional' sense i.e. she didn't get drunk all the time, wouldn't drink in the day but she did have two or three glasses of wine pretty much every evening after work. A lot of people do that. When she told me she was quitting booze for good, it was a complete shock to me and I felt a very real sense of loss. I really felt heartbroken because I felt like there would be things we would 'miss out' on in the future together - sharing cocktails by the pool on holiday, sharing a bottle of nice wine over a romantic candlelit dinner, popping a bottle of champagne on New Year's, toasting to our (currently non existent) children on their wedding days. I felt like that had all been taken away from me. I knew that this was small fry compared to what others went through and what she could be going through but that didn't stop it hurting. Everyone's problems matters to *them* even if an abstract observer can clearly see that one person's problems are much worse than anothers'.\n\nWhen I googled for help and advice on the matter, nothing really came up so I want to keep my original post up and supply an update to let others that might go through the same thing that they're not alone.\n\nAs I mentioned above, some people were adament that my wife's decision to not drink ever again shouldn't affect me in the slightest. Basically, it had nothing to do with me and if I felt like it affected me then I had my own problems. A year on, I can defiantly tell those people that they are wrong. In a marriage, at least in the kind of marriage I believe in, you and your partner's actions and choices are intertwined. The whole point of a marriage is to *share* the rest of your lives together. I had expected and hoped for a long future together, sharing experiences that typically included alcohol. Our society, as a whole, is intertwined with booze. We first met when we were both tipsy at a student bar, pretty much all the social occasions we've ever been to have involved some alcohol - that's just where our society is. Drinking was, in some ways, a 'shared interest'. If you met a partner through rock climbing and you climbed together several times a week, got married, carried on climbing together all the time then suddenly your married partner said \"sorry, I'm never going to climb again\", you would feel hurt. Like something core to your relationship had been taken away.\n\nSo, what have I learnt in the past year? Well for one, your parter giving up booze really doesn't matter. You just adjust. I'd be lying if there were times that I miss us sharing a bottle of wine together but those thoughts are few and far between. It's far more important to me that she's happy and feels much better about herself. She's healthier, has a better outlook on life and when we are out togheter, we actually spend more 'quality' time together. I've never been a big drinker so if we were out, she'd get tipsier way before me so in a way, we weren't on the same conversation level by the end of the night. Now, we can talk 'properly' throughout. There are lots of benefits too, we spend much less on drinks now, of course - especially at home. We do, however, spend more on food. That's something I get more enjoyment from anyway though.\n\nWe've been on holiday, we've been to weddings, we've been out to loads of dinners, we've had Christmas together. It's all been fine. I always knew it would be - other people don't really judge much once you just say 'you don't drink'. As long as you don't make a big deal about it. My wife still doesn't tell people that she's an alcoholic; the story is still \"I gave up for dry January and found myself really liking it and felt better about myself so I gave it up for good\". It's just easier, makes less of an issue of it and draws much less attention. We're probably happier than we were before (although we were plenty happy then too). I love my wife and I love spending time with her.\n\nFor what it's worth, I do still drink. I didn't drink much before she gave up and now I do drink less. I'd share a bottle on nights out before but hardly ever drank at home. I'd say I had, on average, 2-3 units a week. Now I'm more at 0.5-1 units. I.e. Once every two or three weeks I might have a couple of beers. I hardly ever drink when we're out together. Only if I *really* fancy it. When I just 'quite fancy' it, I'd usually choose not to out of solidarity with my wife.\n\nOne change I have noticed is that I judge the shit out of restaurants that have a crappy soft drinks selection or lack of non-alcoholic cocktails. High end restaurants tend to have several great options and will go out of their way to cater to you. Other restaurants do seem to judge you for not getting a bottle of wine, likely because they make a healthy profit off of alchohol. Annoyingly, we're not doing it because we want to be 'cheap', we'd happily pay for an overpriced mocktail that's basically just tonic water with a cucumber in. I do enjoy being 'prepared' for my wife now though - i.e. if we're at a function where they're handing out champagne and nothing else, I will do what I can to get her something else; I'll happily be a bit of an arsehole if a place hasn't thought about providing non alcoholic drinks. There are plenty of people that can't drink for a number of reasons after all - religion, health pregnancy etc. Places really should be prepared.\n\nI've rambled on for a while here, it's a bit disjointed as I wasn't planning on spending loads of my day writing about this! I'll happily answer any questions others may have. What with it being 'Dry January' for a lot of people, this could be something others might be thinking about.\n\nI'd like to thank a few people from the original post for their comments; /u/gravityline and /u/Spectrum2081 for making me realise that it could have been a *lot* worse, she could have opted to go vegan instead which would have been bloody *awful*. u/lofwt and u/ShelfLifeInc for their points of view as non/little drinkers and for giving substitute suggestions. Also u/gooberfaced for saying that our life probably lacked any 'real' problems. That really made me laugh and see the truth in it!! There are many more that commented and helped in my original post but I can't list them all. Oh, also a shout out to r/stopdrinking; I got my wife to sign up to reddit for that sub and she's found it really helpful several times over the past year. :)\n\nTL/DR: My wife decided a year ago that she was quitting alcohol for good as she felt she was an alchoholic. This was a shock for me, I didn't think she was and I felt feelings of loss at the thought of a future where we wouldn't drink occasionally togehter. A year on, everything's been fine, we're happier, she's healthier and still doesn't drink. It hasn't been a big deal. I still feel some feelings of loss but they're so insignificant now and I realise that. Life is great.",

Glad to hear it has been working out.\n\nI think I would feel that same sense of \"loss\" if I had been you, even though logically I would also realize it's better for her health and general well-being. It's still a social thing that does bring us together. But luckily for you, your relationship was based on more than that :) Good for you guys.",

            "This is a good update to hear! As a note, based on your post, it sounds like you're British. I lived for a while in the UK and the drinking culture is very different from the US--so I think it's a lot harder for people from the US to understand just how pervasive drinking is in the UK and just how many activities are oriented around drinking, so I understand your initial reaction. Regardless, I'm really glad that you were able to push past it and support your wife. Congratulations!",
            "I'm glad you've adjusted.  Just so you know, if she was drinking 2-3 glasses of wine a night, every night, she did have a problem with alcohol by most standards.  Anything over about 7 drinks per week for women is considered more than \"low-risk\" drinking according to the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcoholism.  Some people find that they can reduce their consumption to \"low risk\" quite easily and not be tempted to drink any more, but others find that complete abstinence is more effective, or just choose to go that route because that's how they want to see themselves.  I commend your wife for quitting, it is not an easy thing to do even if you aren't drinking very heavily.",

            "When I quit drinking my (ex) husband was very unsupportive. He would pressure me to drink.

We often share a bottle of sparkling non-alcoholic whatever. We still get to have the fun bottle with the foil and the popping cork. We still get to pour it in fancy glasses and talk and laugh and drink. It just isn't boozey. And really, I don't miss it. We don't miss it.\n\nI gladly toast the little champagne glass I'm given at a wedding and set it down on the table and go on with my life. New Year's Eve? I'm more than happy to be sober for that occasion. \n\nReally, after some point I mostly wonder why I ever needed or wanted it in the first place. \n\nI wish you luck!

Good for you man! \n\nRemeber that all those moments you thought you lost can all be replicated with non-alcoholic beverages :)",
            "> Our society, as a whole, is intertwined with booze. \n\nAnother way of putting it is cultural brainwashing. As for whether or not your wife is an alcoholic, can I recommend the book \"The Easy Way to Quit Drinking\" by Allen Carr for a different perspective? He's better known for his stop smoking book. He points out that being an alcoholic or not is not actually black and white the way we usually say. Also it explains why giving up alcohol is not giving up anything of value.",

There are plenty of people that can't drink for a number of reasons after all - religion, health pregnancy etc. Places really should be prepared.\n\nThere needs to be more people doing this. Even people who do drink like occasionally something without alcohol.\n\nWhat I noticed as an occasional drinker, with strong preference for nonalcoholic beverages is that if I bring to a group party something nonalcoholic (instead of a bottle of booze) people may look odd at you at first, but soon they realize that even if they set out to get hammered they do enjoy to have something without alcohol on hand and 6 liters of juice disappears faster than anyone would think. On some parties I attended we even decided to get more juice when we started running out as the general reaction changed from \"why it is not alcoholic\" to \"it tastes good mixed with alcohol\" :)",

My daughter is 7 this year and I've not drank since.\nIt was a choice I am glad I made, I can still enjoy myself with friends without acting like a fool or becoming sick or having a hangover. \nWhen people ask I politely say no thank you, I don't drink. And I always get \"Why?\" Whilst they give me a funny look.\n\nBecause I don't want to. Simple as that. It's insane how people react to the fact you don't drink, like you've just pissed on the floor or something. \n\nSo it's great to know that youre supportive towards your wife in this.",
            "For several years I was drinking five beers a week, one with dinner, most nights.  I stopped drinking at one point, and was amazed that it took three weeks before I felt completely 'dried out'.  There's a sensation in my gut that took that long to go away. I went another three weeks without drinking.  I felt better overall without the alcohol.  Now I have one or two drinks a week, and that just feels like plenty.",
            "I just want to genuinely thank you for your update. I have been going through this for the past six months with my SO. People who say it doesn't affect you are full of shit. Society is *absolutely* intertwined with alcohol, and if you haven't given it up before you would be hard pressed to recognize this. I gave it up myself as well, and have never felt better. It's slightly more difficult for me because I'm a bartender, but I've embraced the fitness excuse. I'm not interested in sharing with people the fact that my SO has PTSD that gets triggered by alcohol, or that he's potentially an alcoholic, so we rather be safe than sorry.    \n\nLPT: don't ask people who say they don't drink *why* they don't drink. ",
            "Interesting read. Thought I'd share my two cents on alcoholism, from my own personal experiences, as well as my wife's. I have struggled with alcoholism from the time I started drinking, at 18 years old. I have been through almost 10 years of therapy, not to mention run-ins with the law. Prior to meeting my wife, I imposed \"rules\" on myself, although those rules had nothing whatsoever to do with the actual drinking. The rules I had in place were that I didn't drink during the work week, and the only times I **would** drink would be on Fridays or Saturdays, or both. The only times I would drink on Sundays is while watching football. \n\nLike you, I met my spouse at the bar. Initially, you have great times and great conversations over a drink. She was divorced, and had a little girl. After a relatively short period of time, I made an observation which was rather alarming:\n\nMy wife liked to drink. A lot. To the point to where she would intentionally make arrangements to have her daughter stay with family or her father, in order to be free from any responsibility, in order to stay out until 2 in the morning at the bar. She would stay out late during the week, and miss work as a result of being hung over. This happened multiple times in the months I was getting to know her. I also found myself breaking my own rules that I had set forth for myself, and that I didn't like at all. \n\nThe more time went on, the more observations I made. For example, whenever she was drinking and she got past that \"point of no return\", there was no leaving. If I was tired and wanted to go home, this would start a fight. I was the asshole, for ruining her \"fun\". She would drink to the point of being barely coherent. She would delay as much as she could before having to go back to the \"real world\" of being an adult. She equated drinking, or being drunk, with having \"fun\", and herein, my friend, lies the problem. \n\nThrough counseling, I've learned that there are two primary types of alcoholics: \n\n1. The Functioning Alcoholic: The Functioning Alcoholic is the person that feels they \"need\" to drink in order to get through their day-to-day. Be it having a glass (or three) of wine with dinner, or drinking a beer to pump their gas, this person feels the need to drink in order to function.\n\n2. The Binge Drinker: The Binge Drinker is the alcoholic who can not touch alcohol for days, weeks or even months at a time, but when the Binge Drinker starts, they can't stop. They will go on benders that will last for days or even weeks, sometimes even incorporating other drugs.\n\nI fell into the latter category, while my wife fell into the former. Combined, this led to a level of toxicity that I had never experienced before in a relationship. \n\nI also learned through counseling, and through first-hand experience that the alcoholic is manipulative. They will give every excuse in the book to justify their drinking. Whether it be stress from work, stress from being a parent, stress with family, or even celebrating. Had a hard day at work? Let's get a drink. Got a promotion? Let's celebrate and get a drink. That lead finally email you back after two years? Let's get a drink. You had diarrhea all day and your stomach is finally settling down? Perfect! Time for a drink. Virtually anything and everything you can think of. They will try to use anything they can in order to quench that thirst, to scratch that itch, to satisfy that inner demon. It was getting to the point to where my wife would go to the bar, and not tell me where she was until she knew I was almost home, so she didn't have to explain why her car wasn't in the driveway. \n\nThe other thing I learned through therapy and counseling is that alcohol changes people. Nobody in here could name a single person who behaved exactly the same sober as they do intoxicated. Not one person. Whether it be they are more friendly, affectionate, or downright angry and mean, nobody behaves the same. Not me, not you, not anyone. \n\nThe culmination of events that led to our sobriety involved alcohol. We were not yet married, and were out \"celebrating\" our engagement. We had one of my co-workers with us, and we went home as he was inebriated, and I was tired. My wife was more than angry at this, and while my co-worker was in the bathroom puking his guts out, in a drunken rage my wife took off her engagement ring, threw it at me and then called me an asshole. \n\nDoes she really think I'm an asshole? No. We are married, and have a baby on the way. It was the alcohol. Is she a terrible person? Hardly. Did she make poor decisions involving alcohol? Absolutely. It was after this episode that we went to our therapist, and we had a long discussion. At the end of that particular session, our therapist asked my wife for a verbal commitment to not drink. Not only did she ask this of my wife, but she asked this of me as well.\n\nI took my last drink March 11th, 2016. My wife has had a couple of missteps along the way, but I can't blame her. It's difficult going from the need to involve alcohol in order to \"have a good time\" to being stone sober. \n\nDuring one of those missteps, I indulged her and went to the bar with her, and sat at a table and drank Coke while she proceeded to drink six beers in the course of about two hours. Watching a rational adult transform into a petulant child who refused to leave the bar was almost shocking, and it only steeled my perseverance to stay sober.\n\nI gave up drinking because I would rather be stone sober than watch my wife struggle with her issues with alcohol abuse by choosing to indulge myself. I would, will do and will continue to do everything in my power to support her in sobriety. Has it been hard? Sure. Not for the co-dependency issue with alcohol, as what it sounds like in your post, but for my own personal struggles with drinking. Hell, the idea of drinking with my wife today gives me anxiety, as I have no idea who I'm going to get - the person I married, or a child who is throwing a drunken temper tantrum. Old habits die hard, and sometimes a beer just sounds absolutely delicious. \n\nMy wife actually suffered from the same mindset that you do (or did) in that if she wasn't drinking, she would be missing out on having \"fun\". You are correct, in that alcohol is seemingly intertwined with our every-day-lives, to the point to where people look at you like you have two heads if you tell them you aren't drinking. \n\nThat said, it doesn't bother me one bit. I've found strength because of my alcoholism. I own it. I **am** an alcoholic. However, it's because of that alcoholism and the struggles that came with it that has been partly responsible for who I am today. While I have found strength as a result of the alcoholism, I find even more strength in sobriety.\n\nOP - trust me when I tell you there's nothing to miss. It's quite the opposite. Now the world is open to you, and take in every possible moment. I wish both of you the best of luck, and I encourage you to join her in sobriety.\n\nedited for clarity",

You owe them more than to tell them they were wrong.\n\nOne of your actual examples of things you said you'd miss out on is your kids will not be able to sip wine with their lunch.

My point is that I have some perspective here that I think means something when I say:\n\nYour mourning at the time absolutely made sense. I don't miss getting drunk but it took a long time before I stopped feeling a little twinge of sadness every time a social moment where alcohol is considered important came up. I felt so weird warning someone beforehand, when they invited me to Seder, that I couldn't drink the wine. (I lucked out on that one -- they had grape juice because Great Uncle Steve or something couldn't have alcohol with his meds, and they didn't want him to feel left out.)\n\nI got engaged recently and my fiance is also a sober alcoholic. We didn't want alcohol, but we wanted the cultural, social moment of celebrating with drink. So we got that fake sparkling \"champaigne\" made of juice. We kept the bottle. Those moments are important and promote bonding. They are old and meaningful and have been repeated through generations, sometimes for many centuries. The moments have meaning, and the alcohol symbolizes that. \n\nFortunately, you've discovered all that can be worked around while still having those important moments. Yay! \n\nIt's hard, very hard, to mentally separate the moments from the traditions of food and drink that come with them. But once you do, things are still as good as ever.\n\nAnd I'm glad your wife is still sober.\n\nMy best wishes to you both.",

I just liked having fun with you back in the day, and I kinda looked forward to that in the future, and I'm just a little sad.\" \n\nif you approach it from the POV of wanting to be close to her, I think that's more honest bc that seems to be your true motivation. \n\nI think if you come at it like trying to control her behavior, it's prob not healthy but I honestly don't think that's your goal here. \n\nAnyways, thank you for your post.

Let me put the background information out here:\n\nShe has always been critical of my work and always considered it \"not a serious job\" and \"only a hobby\". When I was dating my now-husband, she would always advise me to get a \"real job\" and do this on the side as she argued \"I can never make enough to support myself doing this\". At some point she said \"you don't want to be a welfare queen for the rest of your life\". To her disappointment actually I've been very successful in the past few years and make more then her son does right now. \n\nMy SIL (her daughter) has 5-year-old twins and it was their birthday a few months ago. I offered my SIL to make a large drawing of the kids for free. There was a lot of reasons for it. My husband and her sister are close and she's always been very nice and helpful to us in every way possible, and is one of our best friends. I love her and her kids so I offered this and she accepted.\n\nMIL saw the drawing, apparently she liked it and asked me to do one of her and her husband. She gave me some instructions about the size and I told her that I will get back to her with a quote. For what she requested I usually charge around $5000-7000 so it's not a small thing. I usually offer 20% discount to friends so I was planning to give her that discount as well (I told her that she'd get 20% discount). She said \"are you going to charge me for it? I thought you'd do it for free like the one you did for [SIL]\". I told her that it's not possible as that was a birthday gift for her children. She said \"fine don't do it then you so-called artists aren't so different to gold-diggers\". I said \"welfare queen to so-called artist is an upgrade, I'm flattered\". I left then. This happened a week ago.\n\nToday I realized that she's been badmouthing me to everyone for the past week. She is saying that she asked me for a favor and I gave her an invoice and requested payment beforehand. She is going on about how she would have moved heaven and earth for her in-laws and would have never asked for anything and that this generation have no respect and responsibility to their parents and went on and on and on. She also posted stuff on Facebook about this, although without mentioning my name.\n\nHow do I handle this? My husband hates family drama and is away right now at a conference where he as a lot of responsibilities. I don't want to put this onto his plate as well. He knows about the initial conversation between me and MIL but not about her badmouthing me. He'll be back in a week.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: MIL asked me to draw her and her husband which typically costs $5000-7000. I told her I'd give her a quote and offer 20% discount. She was offended as she expected me to do it for free. She is now badmouthing me, claiming I'm some sort of gold digger. ",

I know (as I think most people do) that large paintings take a long time and know you can't be giving them to people for free, willy-nilly. \n\nOf course if she has sycophantic friends, they might immediately paint you as the bad one, but just know that not everyone would have the same opinion as they would.\n\nIt sounds like she doesn't want to have an actual discussion about it. You've already told her your view on it, so unless you want to argue about it, I don't think that there's much more that you need to do.",

No matter what you say, she'll just find a way to hold it against you. \n\nWhat I **would** do is make her son aware of it. Maybe wait until he's back from that conference. Then let him handle the drama. It might be time to go no/low contact with her altogether for a while, as she seems to be seriously lacking respect for you. ",

I simply tell them they can't afford me and that if I give away my skills then it means they're worthless.\n\nOnce you start giving your skills away it will never end.

She will get her reputation when you, if asked, calmly \"explain\" the situation.\n\nYou are making a living out of your art, and as a family member, she should acknowledge that - also, that you are not obliged to draw her just because she suddenly wants you to.\n\nIt is your time of your life - she has been resentful all the years - you are not obliged to spend your time (and thus money) on a disrespectful person.\n\nYour husband should get your back.

Everybody will understand something along the lines of \"I can not work a month free just as a favor\". This will also make her request obviously ridiculous to others.

We talked on the phone for a good while of what she wanted, and at the end said, \"well just know that I want to pay you!\" I had already assumed this, because there was no way I was photographing for a whole day and then several days editing for free. I told her my rate for her wedding, but also mentioned I was taking **$500** off the price because I consider her family. She kind of went quiet and then said, \"well great, I'll get back to you if I want your services.\" Prior to the price, it was, \"Yes! Of course I want you to be my photographer!\"\n\nLong story short, she ended talking to my mother (who actually understands my profession) and tells my mom how she really didn't expect to be paying so much for photographs.

It may be cheaper to buy a new one, but (repair place) may also be an option. That generally does the trick. If it's something I'm fine working on, I'll do basically what you did: \"Sure, I can do that. My normal rate is $150 an hour, but I can give you a 50% friends and family discount. That should normally take around 2 hours.\" This establishes the value of my time, lets them know I'm doing them a favor, and generally prevents the offer of a 6 pack for hours of my time, which I have little of free these days.\n\nI think you did all of that, but your MIL has a track record of not respecting you or what you do anyway.

All your doing is tracing, so it's not like you're doing an actual job.\" It's really frustrating and has led to more than one argument. Even how much I charge for a piece of wall art gets attacked. I have some pieces that I've put 30+ hours into and only ask $150 for. A skilled laborer makes upwards of $100 an hour in my city. That's $3,000 by that calculation. And the $150 I'm asking gets laughed at for being greedy. \n\nPeople will always disrespect how much work and dedication goes into being an artist. They fail to appreciate all of the things we do to make a great piece of artwork. How much time we spend on educating ourselves, honing our skills, finding new materials to work with. And speaking of materials, BEING an artist is expensive. I've had to steal art supplies because I was too poor to afford them. \n\nStick to your guns. You did the right thing. That's your livelihood. Not a hobby. You're successful. Many artists aren't. Be proud of that. And don't be afraid to demand to be treated with the respect that your years of hard work and training have earned you. ",

Her own brother (who is admittedly a scumbag), practically demanded a free tattoo, and after she refused, he has since stopped talking to her.

It would be the same if you were a musician, or a photographer, or a writer. You decide if you are willing to give up your time and energy to create something that otherwise would be paying for your ability to live. She has no right to demand such from you on the basis that you did it for someone else. That's not how this works, and if she wants you to have a \"serious\" job that you can live on then she can't expect you to do said \"serious\" job without you getting paid if you choose. You will never make enough to support yourself if you give away your work for free to everyone connected to someone you gave work to one time.\n\nIf she expects free work, then she also has no right to determine what quality you should give her. She's getting it for free, so she should shut up and be happy with anything you spend time on to give her even if it's not up to your usual standards.\n\nAs for what you should do.. This may not be advisable, but personally I'd lambaste her on social media for all your friends and relatives (and hers) to see. She belittles your chosen career as being unprofitable, then attempts to guilt you into giving her free stuff because as a gift you gave another family member something that you felt they were worth. I'd make it clear that your normal cost is $5000-7000, that you'd offer a discount for family, that at no time did the sister ask you to give her that gift. You did so because you feel she is worth giving a $5000 gift to. People that belittle your profession then demand gifts are not worth $5000 dollars.\n\nThat may not be advisable. And neither is telling her to fuck off, but I'd probably do that too. So take my advice with a grain of salt.\n\nAlso, I highly doubt she'd give you $5000 worth of anything as a gift just because you asked for it.",

I can work out a price estimate for you, too.\"\n\nBy allowing her to describe her whole plan first, you allowed her to get fully excited about it, only to have it all dashed. This was disappointing to her. Plus she was probably embarrassed at having shared something personal with you, only to have you say, \"Yeah. Nope.\"\n\nSo disillusioning her sooner could have reduced her tantrum.\n\nSecondly, by saying, \"No, the other picture was a gift,\" you suggest that she doesn't deserve a gift compared to them. Of course, in the circumstances she doesn't! But she feels rejected, having reached out to you.\n\nSo I would have given another reason in addition. Something like \"I've been very busy with paying work lately. I can't afford the downtime for a non-paying job.\" That way it's not just about her not deserving a picture the way someone else does.\n\n(But ultimately, she's a bit crazy, so there's not much you could have done...)",

I learned how to do it years ago, and I've made a lot of jewelry and art pieces over the years. My MIL and my SIL have both wanted me to make things for them either for free, or deeply discounted. As in \"well I know you sell that necklace for $150 but I only want to pay $50 for it\" and when I said \"No, I'm sorry, I can't do that\" kept asking every few months if I'd sell it for $50 yet. MIL wanted me to make her a sterling silver bracelet for free. When I declined (silver is frigging expensive), she bought her own beads and then sent me a bag of loose beads with the expectation that I'd put it together for her. I simply didn't do it. I left that bag of jumbled beads on my workbench for months. Oh, and the repairs..\"I broke this necklace/bracelet/pair of earrings and lost half the beads but you can fix it for me for free right?\" someone once handed me an opera length pearl necklace and wanted me to re-knot the entire thing because it had broken. Pearl knotting isn't even something I do. I directed them to a jewelry store to get it repaired. I now turn down all repair jobs because I was sick and tired of coming in to work to find yet another bag of broken jewelry on my desk. My husband's co-workers were even trying to send home their broken jewelry for me to fix. I can count on the fingers of one hand how many people actually offered to pay for it, and usually it was \"$5 is good, right?\"\n\nI also crochet, knit, paint, garden, sew, and embroider. People always expect that I'll make them something for free, re-do or actually dig and plant their gardens for free, make christmas gifts for them to give to other people for free, etc..etc..etc..or if not free, a huge discount. It's incredibly irritating. I'm currently learning graphic design and I'm sure that's going to bring in a whole new set of requests as well. \n\nIt's one of the least fun aspects of having any kind of skill that people want to make use of.

Whether she understands or not, do that and then move on. If she decides to pay you, then do it. Otherwise ignore the request and don't worry any more about that.\n\nSometimes the people of the family do crazy things.

And then react from there. If she's insincere about her opportunity to redeem herself - you can tell her to fuck off. But you might, MIGHT have had an opportunity to have a moment where she realizes she was wrong and apologizes. \n\nI understand this woman was a huge bitch to you and it probably felt awesome to be a bitch back to her, but I always strive to imagine the ideal and most civil way to address these issues. Maybe it's not too late for a moment like this. \n\nOne of the big reasons I want to give you this perspective is because the top answers here are just validating yes men. It's often hardest and not satisfying to take the high road, but I always encourage it because it's the only door for the best ending possible. The rest of the answers demonize and dehumanize your MIL, side with you and don't offer any new or interesting information because they just want to validate validate validate for the fix. I know it's hard when she's been so mean but she's a person too, who gave birth to your husband and raised him. We should try to understand those who've wronged us in the most compassionate way we can, especially if it's someone important in the family like a MIL.\n\nHope this helps and I hope you and your MIL can come to some kind of reconciliation.

I don't paint for people often so I discussed it with my mother and grandmother. Grandmother suggested $100, mom suggested $40, so I found a comfortable place for myself and said $50. I go up to her, give her the price I decided and she pauses, gets this shitty fucking disappointed look on her face and says: \"ummm, what about $40\".

I wonder if she'd ask any other professional people she knows, like a doctor or a builder, to do a considerable amount of work for her for free?\n\nSounds like your best bet is to first talk to your SO about this in-depth, ask his advice on handling his mother. He may hate family drama and he shouldn't have to get involved but if his own mum continues to be this disrespectful and rude to you he may have to. I'm hoping he sees his mum's behaviour towards you is not appropriate, at least. It may even be worth asking your SIL for advice too as you seem to get on quite well. You may feel it best not to involve her though.\n\nDepending on what he says, it may then be worth talking to the MIL directly and telling her you do not appreciate her rudeness and further explaining the quoted amount (explaining that canvases and art supplies aren't cheap and that drawings take a long time, etc). Though maybe, depending on the sort of person your MIL is, this may not help.\n\nBest of luck with whatever you decide to do.",

            "She sounds like a Narcissist, plain and simple. I could write paragraphs about it, but I suggest you simply do a Google of Narcissistic Personality Disorder.\n\nIf this is a constant pattern of behavior, which it sounds like, you probably can't change her. People like this don't have revalations and suddenly become nice people, nor do healthy people obsess so much about people they do not like.\n\nNow, how to deal with her. First of all narcissists do this kind of shittalkibg constantly, and they can be very good at it (telling very convincing lies, etc). You absolutely should not get into a war with her on this front, as you shittalking her in return will only legitamize what she's doing. Instead, act surprised when you hear about her gossip and gently correct any lies. Also do your best to say *good* things about her (even if you don't really mean them, but do practise your \"acting\"), and even compliment her.\n\nYou may feel like a bitch doing this, but in reality you're undermining her believability. It really looks poorly on someone when they shittalk a person who says nice things about a person. It makes them look untrustworthy, bitter, and unfriendly.\n\nIf she escalates to openly engaging you, break off contact with her and sadly tell everyone how you really want her to like you but can't seem to win her over.\n\nIn other words, do the opposite of what she's doing to cancel it out.",

I also doubt that her sense of entitlement stopped at your time and art.\n\nSo my advice is don't worry about it. The people who matter will instantly know that her story is exactly that - a story. Because they will have seen her in action and she will have pulled crap like this on other people.\n\nIf there are those who believe her wholeheartedly, they probably aren't the kind of people whose opinion you need to care about. \n\nIf anyone asks you directly (or brings it up) just ask them for $6k and several days of their time, as a gift. When they look at you with total disbelief, say \"That's what she wanted from me.\" If that doesn't get it through their head nothing will.\n\nOtherwise, ignore her antics. She can't actually do anything other than be nasty, and by being nasty she is hurting her own reputation not yours. ",

They receive financial support from my parents (they're wealthy, and generous), have good jobs, and as such, have decided to have a baby. Currently, her wife is about six months pregnant, and the two of them are visiting for holidays. I'm in college, so I don't see them very often (yes, my parents give me financial support as well- everything is fair and square), but I'm really excited for their baby. My sister and her wife had been dating since their senior year of college, and were friends since childhood before that. I'm 7 years younger, so I was kind of left out of the loop. I never knew my sister's wife until they got married, and even then, I was swamped with my first year of college, so I didn't *really* ever get to know her. I was really excited though for this trip, since we'd get some one-on-one time together!\n\nOur parents live about two hours away from my sister and her wife, and I flew in from across the country. We're all staying with our parents, who are not yet retired. My flight got in yesterday late at night, so I slept in. My parents went to work, my sister went to go do some shopping. My sister-in-law stayed in with me, but I didn't realize she was around until she came downstairs while I was making lunch. She's pretty obviously pregnant, and I haven't seen her since her wedding- so I was really excited to see her. She was not. I said hi, and went to hug her, and she backed away. I apologized, and she just kinda looked at me weird, and went looking through the fridge.\n\nI tried to make small talk with her, so I asked when she was due. She gave me a really weird look, like I'd asked what her cup size was, and then just said March and kept making her food. I said I was really excited to have a niece or nephew, then asked if she wanted a boy or girl. She sighed really loudly, said she didn't care, and moved on. My sister had mentioned that her wife had PTSD due to a previous pregnancy, so I worried that might've been it. I tried to shift the subject, and asked how her work was. She set her knife down really loudly, stared at me for thirty seconds, then said \"fine\" and went into the dining room without saying anything else.\n\nThroughout the day, I kept just trying to interact with her. Offered to get her a drink while I was in the room, she just muttered no, asked what she was watching, \"you wouldn't know it\" (it was the *Simpsons*), said I was really glad she was spending the holidays with us, a very begrudging \"yeah.\" Really, I thought this must just be how she is. Then, my parents and sister came home, and she was super cheery and nice to them. My dad was asking if they had names picked out, and she just wouldn't stop chattering on. My sister said she wanted a family name, and her wife insisted on a unique name. My mom pointed out that my name (Anais) isn't very common, but it's also a family name (same as my grandmother), and they should consider it. I said I wouldn't mind having a niece with my same name, and my sister was really enthusiastic about it. Her wife gave me a death glare.\n\nI just ended up getting the silent treatment! At dinner, I asked if she would pass the potatoes, and she didn't listen. I repeated myself, she ignored me, and then my sister told her I had asked for her to pass the potatoes. Suddenly, she was all bubbly and giggling \"guess I didn't hear!\"\n\nWhat do I do? Should I tell my sister? Directly challenge her? I have very positive relationships with my parents and my sister, and I want to be really involved with my niece/nephew, so I really don't want to go 100% no contact or anything. How can I try to resolve or at least get over this?\n\nTLDR: My sister's pregnant wife is weirdly cold and kind of short with me. What to do?\n\nUPDATE (as of this morning): So, we all had breakfast together. I sat across from my sister, between my parents, with my SIL kitty corner to me. My SIL actually SPOKE TO ME!! But it wasn't all that positive. She asked if I was seeing anyone, in kind of a snarky tone. I said no, school was really busy, I just didn't have time, etc. She responded, \"Well, not everyone finds someone.\" My sister tried changing the subject, asking my parents whether or not they'd gone to their winter home yet (they're those rich people). My SIL was *so* nice to them. She was saying what a gorgeous house it is, how grateful she was to have been able to take a vacation there with my sister last month. My mom is easily flattered, so once my SIL got started, she started gushing about her, and it was just a mush fest.\n\nAfter breakfast, I offered to go take our dogs for a walk. When I came back, my parents had left with my sister to go shopping again, and my SIL was the only one home. She asked me how I was liking college, and I said I was liking it a lot. I major in pre-dental, started talking about it a bit, and she rolled her eyes. I apologized for oversharing, and she said, \"No. It's fine. You just have a problem with reading the room, I guess.\" Then, she walked away. When my sister comes home, I'm definitely going to tell her about it.",

            "\u201cSister, you noticed that strange moment at dinner with the silence from your wife when I addressed her. I was hoping it was a one-off but she\u2019s actually been pointedly cold and short with me since arriving. It\u2019s important to me to be part of your life and part of your support system. I love you a lot so I\u2019m asking if you know of any reason why I\u2019m feeling very dismissed by her behavior.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d say. She was pointedly, publicly rude to you. \n\nIf she\u2019s rude to you again, before or after you address it with your sister, call her on it kindly. \u201cIs there an issue here I\u2019m unaware of?\u201d Ask it gently but with confidence. This is your home and your family, and you dont deserve her treatment, pregnant or not. If she denies it, \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that. I\u2019d hate for any issues in our family seeing as we all love you\u201d. She\u2019s being a brat.",
            "Your situation actually pissed me off while reading this. Omg. I'd have a conversation with your sister and parents in private. Not sure how your family dynamics work, but I really think you should have a talk about this with the most appropriate person to go to. This is **not** okay.",
            "just ask your sister privately 'have i done anything to offend your wife? shes kindof short with me, but thought it might just be because she tired with the pregnancy. im trying not being sensitive here, because i really want to spend more time with you both. i just want to know if theres anything ive done wrong'",
            "So you said that the longest time you spent with her was camping (from a previous comment) and the wedding. Could you elaborate on the wedding? Did you interact with her at all? Were you in your sister\u2019s bridal party?\n\nBut I agree with other commenters, you\u2019ve just gotta talk to your sister and/or parents to see what can change to make this better for the rest of your stay.",
            "You'll never know unless you reach out to your sister, but here's an uncomfortable possibility: just because she is your sister's wife doesn't mean she will ever be nice to you, or kind to you, or sisterly with you. Which is a crying shame because you sound quite nice and like you've been trying, so absent some backstory where you drop kicked her dog off a balcony, who knows why she's like this to you? All you can do is be polite and kind to her at all times. But it is very clear she doesn't want to be close with you. \n\nYou are entitled to her being polite to you, though, so for that reason alone, if you are close with your sister, just ask her in person if there's any reason you may have offended or hurt her wife. It may not fix anything but it should put her on notice for things like passing you the frigging potatoes. How petty of her.\n",
            "The only thing that I can think of is that maybe SIL got used to the family dynamic while you're away across the country, and your presence is a harsh reminder that she's not a \"real\" daughter, and you are.  It could be jealousy coupled with pregnancy hormones, like somehow you're challenging her place in the family.  \n\nAnyway, I'd ask your sister first.  \"Have I done something to offend Patricia?  It really seems that she's upset with me about something, but I really can't figure out why.\"  And if your sister doesn't know or won't say, you can gingerly ask your SIL herself.  ",

There is no need to be abrasive or rude in to her, just call her out in a serious tone. You\u2019ll find a lot of people will immediately stop treating you badly when you learn to do this. Mostly because they\u2019re only acting the way they are because they think they can get away with doing it to you.\n\nI learnt this in my mid 20s, I should have learnt and practiced earlier. Here are a few other phrases you can use which are effective\n\n\u201cI beg you\u2019re pardon?\u201d\n\u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe you said that out loud.

That way they can keep a closer eye on your interactions and address it with her from their own observations. ",

I would also ask her not to say anything to her wife just yet and first observe your interactions with your SIL for a day to see if she notices anything, and then she can address it with her wife. \n\nI don\u2019t think your parents need to be involved just yet. It\u2019s an issue between your SIL and you, and your sister is the connecting factor. The parents come in when it\u2019s confirmed, dedicated hostility that isn\u2019t going to change. ",

That's full on schoolyard bullying. Not someone who's just having a bad day or something. Not someone who's just \"introverted\".\n\nDefinitely talk to your sister, but do so diplomatically as others have suggested. If nothing changes or your sister takes her side, honestly at this point you should talk to your parents. SIL is being rude and antagonistic toward you in your own damn home, and that's not okay.\n\nThe way she acted in that update is honestly unbelievable.",

            "Do you and your sister get along well? Did you do something that might have upset her? Your SIL might think badly of you because of what your sister told her. Or she is just not nice with you because she can. She has to be nice to your parents because she receives financial help from them, so if she doesn't actually like your family she can unleash that on you.\n\nIf you feel like that would be ok, you can try talking to your sister about this, but unfortunately you shouldn't expect your SIL to end up liking you.",
            "Talk to your parents and sister in private. If she does it again, publicly, call her out. Be respectful and even toned but say \"you know what, I don't know what your problem with me is. I've been friendly, cordial, and respectful. You have ignored me at best and been openly rude at worst. If you wish for me to not speak with you, fine.

Don\u2019t apologize for any of your actions. Let her do the talking, call her out on any BS she spews. This woman sounds like a royal B. \n\nIf she says her reactions to you are PTSD related I would consider an apology for any triggers that may have been hit, but I would also ask why she feels more comfortable talking about those things with *literally* everyone else but you. Ask her how she would prefer you to broach the subject. You\u2019re going to be an aunt, your niece is family and is important. She needs to get that. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s a super crabby morning person? Doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior. \n\nShe owes you an apology. ",

However you go about it, just make sure you don't stay quiet on this subject as your SIL could be a part of your whole life, and you don't need a thorn in your side.",

It doesn't sound like there was, but who knows.\n\nIf your sister has no good answer, I'd ask the wife the next time you have some alone time.  \"Hey, did I do something that upset you?\"  It's possible she classified you as the annoying little sister and hasn't considered that you're no longer 11, or it's possible she's a jerk.  Or maybe there's something else.  Whatever the case, I'd try to resolve it with her directly, and if you can't, I'd write her off.",
            "Next time she does that, defend yourself. Make it blatantly obvious to everyone that she is kind of bullying you by making you feel excluded in your own home. In front of everyone, try and make conversation with her and have everyone see her brushing you off. If she ignores you afterwards and then says guess she didnt hear you, just straight up and not in an accusatory way say \"I've been trying to make conversation with you all day to make you feel welcome, but I've been shafted all day and Im not surprised you didnt 'hear me' for the milliionth time today. I dont know why you feel that acting this way is appropriate, but I dont have any animosity towards you. If you feel like apologizing or developing a relationship, Im always open but I cant take any more cold shoulders in my own home\". Go to your mom, shake your head and just say that you hate bullies. \n\nLet me tell you, girls who feel comfortable with these micro agressions and bullying do so because no one stand up for you, especially not yourself. When you do, thats when they stop. Fuck asking if the wife is mad or annoyed at you, you deserve better than to chase after her btch ass. ",
            "I would talk to your sister and just keep in mind that in life not everyone is going to like you without really getting to know you first.  The only way SIL has interacted with you were camping when you were a kid, her wedding where she was super busy being a bride and this moment you have described.  She may just need more time.  \nA side effect of being obviously pregnant is that for a lot of women they become \u201cpublic property\u201d.  A lot of strangers feel entitled to express opinions about their body, their baby and will even touch them.  Meanwhile pregnancy takes a toll on your body and I feel like around the holidays a new mother is still expected to be \u201con\u201d when it comes to family gatherings.  Maybe she just needed some introvert time watching TV.  \n\nI\u2019m also surprised no one brought this up but I found the whole name conversation thing to be really weird.  You didn\u2019t mention the names SIL suggested but did tell us about your family wanting to name the baby with your name.  What if SIL has a special name picked and 4 people including the 3 most important people to her just strongly suggested using a different name?  It was not your intention but she may have felt outnumbered and not even able to name the baby that she\u2019s currently carrying.  ",

Just noticing a pattern, from her perspective:\n\nYou didn't get to know her early on because you were busy with college.\nYou asked her to change her wedding date because of finals (college).\nYou stopped talking to her at the wedding so you could go talk about college.\nYou clearly annoyed her again today by talking too much about college.\n\nCollege seems to be a huge focus of your life.  If she has any hangup about college (ie didn't get in, couldn't afford, etc), the whole thing would probably be tough to take from her end.",
            "Your SIL doesnt like you, for some reason. That much is incredibly clear. You could ask her directly if you did something to upset her but I would suspect, given what you've written, that she wouldn't tell you what the issue is. \n\nI would suggest talking to your sister and telling her basically what you told us. That you understand that preganancy is a rough time but that you were concerned that the short behavior seems only directed at you (give your above examples). You want to be there for your sister and her wife so if you've done something upsetting or offensive, you would like the opportunity to know about it and correct it. \n\nDid you ever express a dislike of your SIL or uour sister being gay?

It sounds insane... but you don't want to be the odd-woman out if you can't provide proof that she's treating you that way.

It does seem strange that you didn't, and maybe that's the issue--she feels like you are uninvolved in her and your sister's lives, and she dislikes you because she thinks you don't like her, or care enough to get to know her. Some of her behavior was reasonable (not wanting to be hugged by someone she doesn't feel close to), some was downright rude, but you might have to give her the benefit of the doubt if you want to bridge the gap.\n\nEither talk to her, or your sister, and with an open mind (in other words, being ready to hear something you might not like), ask if there's a reason she dislikes you. Since you say your sister has a deep need to be liked, she might not be the best person to talk to, since she might evade the issue or sugar-coat it. OR, instead of asking SIL if she doesn't like you (because she may deny it and just shut you out further), tell her you would like to get to know her better, and then follow through by keeping in touch and maybe asking your sister to help plan times for you to all hang out together. This may or may not be the issue, but if it is, SIL may warm up once she sees you are serious about having a relationship with her (and not just her future child).\n\n",

            "I doubt OP will get answers she wants or confirmation that she\u2019s being treated unfairly by SIL. \n\nMain reason, SIL has the best excuse: pregnancy brain and hormones. And most people give passes to pregnant women when they act out of character.\n\nThe best outcome would be to talk to sister and parents and just kind of sanity check the situation. Bring up how mean she was to you while they were all out, and then the mashed potato incident. Even if they come to her defense about being pregnant \u201cshe\u2019s grumpy because she\u2019s uncomfortable\u201d, that maybe they can still correct her when she\u2019s mean. Like when your sister said you wanted potatoes.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what the outcome will be if the family does notice what\u2019s going on. Hopefully your sister would at least tell her to cool it with her shit, even if she can\u2019t get a direct answer as to why she hates you.",
            "Why did you keep mentioning how rich your parents are? You come off as superficial, the sister in law stuff aside. ",
            "Hey, so I\u2019m not trying to excuse her petty behavior, but it\u2019s possible that she\u2019s upset about your prying questions right off the bat.  You think asking a pregnant woman her due date is making polite small talk?  When she was clearly not into that, you pressed on to ask a gender preference?  Look, people in general start to feel entitled to information about what\u2019s going on in your body once you\u2019re pregnant, and I doubt she needed more of that when just getting up from someone she (based on your description) barely knows.  I mean, at least you didn\u2019t ask her how much weight she\u2019s gained or if she plans to have a vaginal delivery.  Those ones are the worst, ugh.  Also, a lot of people will also pry/judge about your decisions to work or not work while pregnant, so in context your question about work also pushes that \u201cwhy the hell do you want to know that?\u201d button if it\u2019s someone you don\u2019t know well.\n\nAnyway, I still think she\u2019s handling this is a pretty immature way.  Sure you could have been a little less socially awkward and pressing with her, but if she doesn\u2019t either get over it or talk to you about it soon then that\u2019s on her.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get people saying that the questions you asked are just fine to ask someone who is basically a stranger to you.  Those people I\u2019m sure are the same kind of people who go around pressing all pregnant women for answers to oddly personal questions. Lots of people telling me how little or much time to take off work before/after the baby is what got to me the most.  ",

            "I would (depending on the state you live in) record any private conversations you have with her. Maybe you're reading too much into things, and maybe if someone else hears her bullying they'll understand. But people like her thrive in the shade and we all have the technology now to throw a huge spotlight into their darkness. Even if you don't go playing it publicly to embarrass her, knowing you have the right of the situation can prevent her from gaslighting you.\n\nAnd also keep in mind that some people are just mean, and having a baby gives them a weapon to bludgeon others. Don't be surprised if you do something incredibly minor that causes her to force your parents to choose between you and their grandchild. ",
            "You can ask to spend the day with them. Try not to jump to the conclusion your SIL is being purposely mean. Maybe she\u2019s just cold around you because she doesn\u2019t know you as well. Maybe she\u2019s stressed and feeling hormonal. She might not realize she\u2019s being mean to you. She might be more polite to your parents out of respect since they are older/ she\u2019s a guest in their house.\nIt could be an age thing also. You are younger so she might just be annoyed by that. Not saying it\u2019s fair but she and your sister are obviously dealing with a lot right now. She might be slightly annoyed that your a \u201ccarefree\u201d college student. \nThese are just some things it might be. I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have a right to feel hurt or upset but try and avoid confrontations.\nJust ask your sister if she\u2019s like to hang out. You can mention how you feel you aren\u2019t close and you\u2019d like to be more involved. You can try and ask your SIL some more questions. If she seems annoyed just drop it and give her space. "
