        "selftext": "I live with my brother so we occasionally have dinner at my parents to see them and my little sister. I've missed a couple dinners and my brother brought up that I must've been with Brit, my second gf after my high school gf of 4 years and I broke up. \n\nSo, Brit has celiac disease along with alot of allergies and dietary restrictions. I know all her allergies, and the PDF of her allergies from her allergist spans about 5 pages. I even have a \"what to do\" PDF on my phone in case she goes into anaphylaxis. She even has asthma and a deviated septum so she has issues with breathing.\n\nMy mom brings up that I've been missing dinners and suggests that I bring Brit to dinner one day so she can meet the family and catch up with me. I tell my mom about ALL her allergies, I even made suggestions on what she could cook for her. Basically told her, no to gluten, dairy, all kinds of peanuts, and alot of fruits. No one in my family has any allergies to anything but she said she'll take care of it for Brit and look up some recipes I suggested. \n\nEating out and making dinner for Brit is pretty tricky but I've assured her that she can enjoy all the food my mom is preparing. We get to my parents place and everyone's on the patio waiting for us. Brit has a place card next to my mom with a couple of burger buns and fries already in front of it so we assumed they're gluten free and specially made for her, that my mom didn't want to get them mixed up with everyone else's food. Brit had one bite before she looked at me in horror, and asked me to inject her with her epipen. \n\nWe're at the hospital and Brit doesn't even want me in the room because her symptoms included diarrhea and she's very self conscious about her hives. My dad texted me apologizing for my mom saying \"Sorry, she didn't realize the fries were cooked in peanut oil before they were packaged. She didn't know Brit was celiac -- you said no gluten, and who has THAT many allergies? Mom thought she was just very high maintenance.\" \n\nThe last time Brit had an allergic reaction, it gave her such a horrible asthma attack she was hospitalized for 7 days. She's missing days of work by being in the hospital for observation. How do I let my mom know that this is unacceptable? Brit could've died so I'm not taking this shit lightly. \n   \n**tl;dr**: my mom didn't believe my gf had so many dietary restrictions, it's put my gf in the hospital",

            "Dick move. Even if your GF had been lying, your mother specifically *requested* that she come over and that request was accepted with the stipulation that she get her needs fulfilled. Your GF didn't show up to a barbecue and start making demands or something. All this required was a little extra prep. And instead of respecting your GF's wishes, she decided to prove a point that ended up being false. \n\nI mean, what was the end goal, here? To smugly say \"Hey, did you like that burger? Well, it had gluten in it, you little liar.\" Who treats their child's SO that way?",

Be assertive with her: \"Because you thought you knew more about my gf's allergies than she did, she's spent 7 days off work in observation. What are you going to do to compensate her for her hospital bills and lost wages?\"",
            "That thing your father texted wasn't an apology. It's deflection, blaming Brit for having illnesses. I hope they offer to pay her medical bills.",
            "A severe peanut allergy is nothing to fuck around with. I have a peanut allergy that was pretty severe as a kid. When I say I can't eat peanut products of any kind I'm not telling you about my fucking fad diet. I could literally die if you feed me peanuts. Your mom was astoundingly irresponsible and owes your gf a massive apology. Your dad's non-apology text was also complete bullshit.",
            "The freaking packaging will list if peanuts even were used elsewhere in the manufacturing facility. Your mom disregarded your talk and decided she knew best.  \n\nYour dad's non-apology was horrible too.  You need to address both separately.\n\n\"Mom, your lack of trust and selfish disregard of what I told you almost killed another person.  I am deeply disappointed in you and am angry that your thoughtlessness harmed the person I love.  You damaged her body, caused her to lose wages and incur medical expenses because of your negligent behavior.  I expect you to personally apologize to Brit with no excuses of how you thought she was just being high maintenance or justifications for your behavior.  I do not know if I can forgive you for your actions and I will be taking some time away from you and dad to help Brit heal from your assault.  The only contact I expect from you right now is witnessing your sincere apology to Brit.\"\n\nYou need to be there if an apology happens to shut it down and escort your parents away if they try to shift responsibility onto someone or something else.",
            "Your mom is paying the hospital bills right? As well for the missed wages?",
            "Mom, I made it clear during our discussion Brit's dietary needs, and the reasons for them. I put my trust in you, confident that you would take her health seriously when you welcomed her into your home. I have learned now that my trust and confidence were misplaced. \n\nPlease understand that you not only risked Brit's life, you have cost her a great deal of money in medical bills and lost wages due to her hospital stay. This is not, as dad put it, \"high maintenance,\" but in fact the realities of life-threatening illness. I implore you to read up on her conditions, such as Celiac, wherein gluten not only causes an immediate allergic reaction, but can also cause permanent, irreparable damage to her body. \n\nI expect that you will give Brit a sincere apology. It's important that you apologize to her, and not me, as she is the one whose life was endangered. Please do not expect me at future dinners, as I will be pursuing extra hours at work to help cover her medical expenses, as they were caused due to my misplaced trust.\n\nLove, OP.",
            "You tell her absolutely straight. That's serious bad behaviour on her part. You look her dead in the eye and say \"I told you her restrictions. There's one of two options. Either you thought it was acceptable to try and poison her, or you didn't care enough to listen to what I said to you. Neither of them is okay, neither of them is fine. Both of them mean my girlfriend ended up in hospital.\"\n\nNow, plenty of people here will try and defend your mum. But speaking as someone who will die if someone puts peanuts in their food, I am more than happy to say that this is really really important. I will happily bring food to gatherings that have peanuts + shellfish because I understand my allergies are hard to cater for - but I will not accept deliberate and intentional efforts to harm me. \n\nThere's two ways here. Either your mother makes a full, compete and unprompted apology to your girlfriend for doubting her word, or she tries to double down and insist that nothing was wrong. That will influence you - a genuine mistake can be over looked, but a sanctimonious and shitty attitude can't be.\n\nETA: I understand that some people can't be as blunt with their parents as I propose up above. So here is an alternate prompt. \"Mom, I know you didn't mean any harm but you characterizing my girlfriend as high maintainence for having allergies hurt her and me. In future, can you clarify with her if there's any problems?\" If she cuts up rough over that, then I'd be wary as shit - if I'd accidentally harmed someone, I'd be falling over with apologies. ",

Your parents have demonstrated that they don't take your or your girlfriend seriously.\n\nJust don't pressure your girlfriend to be okay with what happened. She's allowed to be upset. It was probably pretty scary and she probably feels just as bad emotionally as she feels physically.",

            "Your mother needs to pay for all her medical bills and lost wages for work.  She should write out a very lengthy apology going into very specific details as to what she did wrong and why this is unacceptable.\n\nIf your girlfriend died, your mother could be charged with a crime because she knowingly let her eat food you told her she was allergic to and she didn't care because she wanted to \"prove your girlfriend was just high maintenance\".  She deliberately did it so that she could \"point out\" that your girlfriend wasn't allergic to any of that and it backfired.  It's a good thing that your girlfriend is smart and takes care of herself or she could have died from this incident.  You should emphasize that to your parents, in a very not so nice manner.\n",

She should be both sorrowful and ashamed of what she has done.  \n\nI'm wondering why dad texted you, and not your mom.  It makes me wonder whether your mother is home causing a big commotion, making the incident all about her, how poor mom made a mistake and you over reacted.  \n\nI know that sounds really mean.  I'm probably too suspicious after reading in the raisedbynarcissists subreddit.  If that is the case, however, then that is a subreddit which you should be reading.\n\nI do apologize for the mean thoughts if your mom was actually so upset about what she did that she was too upset to contact you directly.\n\nI hope that your girlfriend has a speedy recovery.",

Smh.\n\n\nYour parents should offer an actual apology, and compensate her for medical bills + lost wages. \n\n\nAdditionally, never ever let your mom cook for Brit again.

Don't even call it that. \n\nI don't understand why your mom would put out a place card, where if I was  your GF i would assume; ah this is the food i can eat that she SPECIFICALLY made for me. THERE IS EVEN A CARD WITH MY NAME, so she did make it allergic-reaction-free for me and my boyfriend did tell her everything and suggested food to cook for me. \n\nYour mom has to be the one to pay for the medical bills. Even if your gf *was* high \"maintenance\" why risk that when someone could die if there's even a 1% chance they aren't? You have got to defend your gf on this, your parents seem like they're going to victim blame her and i'm sure she's insecure about her issues, having two grown adults attack her for it and blaming her for it is going to make her feel like it's her fault.

Insist on this point, let it sink, keep repeating that you gave the entire list of allergies to your mom, that you didn't leave anything out, and that your. Mom. Could. Have. Killed. Her.\n\nRinse and repeat until they feel ashamed for their criminal behaviour.",

Mom thought she was just very high maintenance.\n\nFirst of all - let me say that I am highly skeptical of going gluten-free as a dieting fad. That being said, if someone tells me they don't eat gluten - I will not care if they have celiac disease or they believe it's unhealthy - I'm not going to fucking give them gluten. If someone says they don't eat a type of food, it should not matter their reasoning, you don't give it to them.\n\n\"No gluten\" means \"no gluten\". It doesn't mean \"maybe gluten, because I will not have a visceral bodily response to it!\". It means No. Gluten.",

I have friends with allergies and it's honestly not that hard to be careful. \n\nHaving said that, a lot of people don't know how to read food labels properly.\n\n Not blaming you, but it might have helped if, instead of telling your mother, you would have printed a list of no-go foods and ingredients  and hung it on her fridge! Let's give your mother the benefit of the doubt and assume  she didn't want to kill Brit. Before you ever take her home to dinner again why not go through the list of approved foods with your mother in detail and discuss exactly what she's cooking before you get to the house. Alternatively, why not take food that you've made. Then no one needs to worry about the poor girl ending up in hospital.",

Her husband found her, but not in time.\n\nThis is so so so serious, and your Dad's text is ridiculous. It's not normal to be so dismissive and cavalier about someone's LIFE. Your gf should go to the police about this. Your parents need to realise how serious it is to ignore what people tell you about their food restrictions, and it doesn't seem like your gf being in hospital is enough to get it through to them. Maybe they themselves need to face some consequences of their own in order to get it.",
            "I read this and I can relate so much to your girlfriend. People just don't understand, especially those of the older generation. Just because you don't LOOK like you're sick or have issues, doesn't mean that you're making them up. I went to Five Guys once with some friends and never again. They cook all of their fries in peanut oil. My lips started swelling and I just acted like nothing was wrong. My classmate baked gluten free brownies, but then used sunflower oil instead of another oil, and I got sick from eating those too. Some people take criticisms about their food really personally, and others, like your mom, probably aren't offended but think that your girlfriend is rude. ",

Also, it should be pointed out that what this means for Brit is that the next time she has an allergic reaction, she's going to be this much worse. Extreme allergies and anaphylaxis are not a joke. Her parents must be livid! ",
            "OP can you imagine if you had kids with allergies and your mom thought she knew better than you??",
            "Wtf? As someone with multiple allergies myself I don't understand why people think it's a joke when someone says they can't eat something. You need to demand an apology from both of your parents, and stress the fact that your mom could have literally killed her! If I were her I'd have a hard time ever speaking to them again after that op. ",
            "Your parents are pretty shitty in this situation and if you can kindly tell them that they were then maybe you would get a proper apology from them. Stand your ground because they really brought harm to Brit due to their own intentional neglect.",
            "As a celiac myself, I would never trust someone I was meeting for the first time to prepare a safe dinner for me. Ever.",
            "I know this is at the extremely dramatic end of the spectrum, but negligent homicide is still homicide... \n\nYour girlfriend could have DIED from a severe allergic reaction and I think you need to make that extremely clear to your family. They owe you both a very serious apology, because this deflecting shit should absolutely NOT fly. \n\nYou're both very young and this is unlikely but if you were to have children and they had similar allergies to your girlfriend would you feel safe leaving that kid in your parent's care? Your mother's judgment on this was terrible. \n\nThis is the worse part of gluten-free becoming a craze. Now people with actual issues are (incorrectly) viewed as \"picky\" or \"needy\" eaters. ",
            "sort of off topic but deviated septum surgery is very easy and non invasive. everyone I know who had it said they went home literally the same day ",
            "Basically, react the exact same way you would if your mom attacked your girlfriend with a knife completely unprovoked and put her in the hospital. Because it's the exact same thing.\n\nAnd that means you should be threatening to go low-contact with your parents unless they pay for all relevant medical bills, beg, cry their eyes out, and promise never to do it again. And then still go low-contact, because fuck your parents.",
            "Lots of people have already given you good advice about what to do with regard to your parents. \n\nThe peanut oil sounds like it could have been an honest, if careless, mistake. I have an anaphylactic tree nut allergy, as well as some more minor food allergies, and the only time it's been an issue is when there are nuts in things I wouldn't expect.  Once I accidentally drank a White Russian made with almond milk (that was a shitty way to learn that I have to check EVERYTHING). So while it's terrible that it happened, I find the peanut part less surprising, just because for people unaccustomed to checking labels it can be easy to mess up. That's NOT to say that it excuses the ignorance, but that part doesn't seem malicious to me.\n\nThe majorly concerning part is the second half of your father's text - that they thought she was just being \"high maintenance.\" These assumptions can kill people, and they're made worse by the fact that certain people DO fake allergies to avoid certain foods. But in the end, the people who suffer for these assumptions aren't those who are \"high-maintenance.\" They're the people with actual severe allergies like Brit, and they could die.\n\n When I was a college athlete, we had four girls who didn't eat gluten, but none of them had a diagnosed condition (and all of them would drink beer...they just ate gluten free \"to make healthier choices\"). My coach would roll her eyes, but since there were four of them, she'd get us trail mix and gluten free snacks on buses to games...all of which contained almond flour and nuts. So I couldn't ever eat anything. Then she'd get annoyed at ME, claiming that the gluten-free girls could suck it up and eat normal food, so why couldn't I? :( It still pisses me off, because if I hadn't thought to check the granola bars, I could have gone into shock right there on the bus.\n\nI would tell your mom exactly what you said at the end of this post: that her ignorant assumption could have killed Brit, and that you hope she is willing to make up for the lost time and wages Brit is suffering as a result. And stress that you hope Brit's family isn't going to sue her for deliberately trying to \"teach Brit a lesson\" about HER OWN medical conditions. I might even show your mom this post and the comments, if you're so inclined. Just my two cents.\n\n",

Bring her flowers, her favorite movie, a heating pad...anything to help pass the time and ease her symptoms. I think you should not speak to your mother for a while, and honestly I think you should let Brit decides when the next time she wants to see them should be.. That is completely insane of your mother to basically poison someone, and I feel like ignoring her is apparently the only way to get across to her as your father's text was definitely a deflection of responsibility.. I am so sorry for Brit. CD is so tough and already a very anxiety-inducing disease since so many social situations revolve around food. ",

            "I dealt with this all the time as a kid. My grandma raised me and has a looong list of food allergies (including all seasonings but salt, certain fruits, and vinegar). Going to a restaurant was always a risk, and her cooking was very bland. I never fully understood how real her food allergies were, until a shitty waitress ignored her when she said no seasonings. Scariest moment of my life, and I never  joked about her allergies again.",
            "Ok. What I'm going to say here might be a little controversial. I personally have very sensitive allergies to gluten, dairy and pineapple. Not quite hospital level sensitive, but I will be sick for several weeks from just one bite.  Because of this, I am hyper vigilant about what I eat. Nothing goes into my mouth that I haven't verified (or my husband because he's pretty educated as well). \n\nNobody else is going to be that vigilant, nor educated. I know almost all ingredients that could go into prepared foods, how they are cooked, common mistakes for food prep. I double check everything, and if the server shows any uncertainty, I don't eat it.  I consider it MY responsibility and don't expect others to be so educated about hidden foods. \n\nIn that light, how did this happen? While your parents need to learn to take this seriously, SO DO YOU. They were flippant and ignorant. But you will find that everywhere you go. Never take anyone's word for it. They don't get the severity of it, and they never will until they themselves are put in the hospital for a cracker crumb. \n\nIt's unrealistic to expect people who have no experience with allergies to know about all the hidden foods, the unlisted ingredients, the gluten count blah blah blah. Be mad at them for being flippant. Be mad at them for making a mistake. But also take some responsibility for what happened here. \n\n",

The fact that she outsourced this to your dad (who doesn't offer an apology at all and instead blames you guys for being dramatic) shows they're both wildly out of touch with reality and take no responsibility. \n\nIf I were you and Brit, I'd seriously look at pressing charges. They could have killed your girlfriend. At the very least, they should pay her hospital bills. If I were Brit, I would never see your parents again, let alone eat under their roof. If I were you, this would end my relationship with my parents. God forbid they killed your girlfriend. What if you have kids with peanut allergies and Grandma thinks, \"These kids are just being dramatic! I'll prove them wrong by feeding them peanut butter cookies!\" Your mother is a menace.",
            "She poisoned her thinking your gf is just being dramatic. Your father is an enabling and covering for your mom.\n\n\nSounds harsh? Maybe.

If they say they can't eat something then you don't serve that. And now, since she has caused a serious medical problem, she can be sued -so let her know second guessing other people and deciding to ignore their concerns can carry a variety of prices, from causing suffering, to causing to death -or even just causing yourself to lose a lot of money in court.",
            "You need to confront your mom AND your dad, your mom for not taking the list of allergies and food suggestions seriously, and your dad for his piss poor \"apology.\" Then you should kindly tell them that you won't be attending dinner or any other events at their house unless they're going to be considerate of Brit's needs. And be sure to shut that \"she's high maintenance\" victim-blaming right down. ",
            "Talk to your mom. You're dad is trying to speak for her but that may not be representative of how your mom feels. It's possible she feels absolutely horrible, and your dad is trying to defend her and deflecting on her part to protect her. It's quite possible that your mom really was trying, but having never had to cook a special meal before she truly didn't understand how serious it is, or just how tricky.\n\nDon't jump to the assumption that she was completely dismissive. Don't assume he worst about your parents. It sounds to me like she really was trying, and just didn't get it quite right, she made a mistake, and your dad is trying to be dismissive about it to defend her.",
            "You tell your parents that a full apology is expected PLUS reimbursement of medical expenses. Don't accept any excuses. Be firm. You gave them written instructions that they willfully ignored as evidenced by \"Mom thought she was just very high maintenance.\" Yeah, MOM is the one that is high maintenance here. What a ****. \n\nI've had to deal with terrible food allergies in my life that nearly killed me on more than one occasion. I have been accused of being anorexic because I won't eat certain foods, of being a nut job, all sorts of things. It's not a joke. Spending a night in the ER is anything but fun. Most people do not understand that an amount smaller than a pea can cause a serious, if not fatal reaction. They also don't understand how many ingredients are in prepared food. I read the labels on everything, because ingredients can vary from brand to brand. But you explained this to your parents and gave them written instructions and they chose to ignore them.",
            "My boyfriend's sister is extremely gluten intolerant and has a lot of other allergies that have landed her in the hospital. The few times that she has come over to their house for a meal, my parents have been meticulous to make sure that they care for her needs. I don't know what the hell went wrong with your parents but this is absolutely unacceptable behavior. They ought to give a massive apology along with an offer to cover the medical bills.",

            "Holy FUCK that's infuriating.\n\nI have a kid brother who's special needs and has a severe dairy allergy. It's so bad he can't be in the same room as a pizza without getting a hive breakout. \n\nHe once had a day care provider give him a cup of whole milk because she thought my mom was high maintenance. Lol, when she had to call my mom and admit she'd given him milk and that he needed to go to the ER...\n\nThis is outright unacceptable, dude. When someone is coming into your home as a guest and warns you of their allergies, you find out what their reactions are like and then you accommodate them. What your parents did was blatant neglect. In the legal world, this could possibly even be assault or attempted manslaughter.\n\nI'd be apt to contact a lawyer. Yup, even to my own family. ",
            "That was some high level manipulation on your mom's part. ",
            "If I was Brit, I'd be pressing charges for assault. And if I were Brits parents and she didn't want to because she loves you, then I'd press charges on her behalf. Her medical bills are going to be astronomical!! That was a super fucked up thing for your parents to do to her and you should tell them they must make it right. And if they don't then you know what kind of horrible people they are and I would suggest getting as far away from them as possible. \n\nCeliac isn't just discomfort, it's horribly painful. It causes bleeding and intestinal inflammation that can be dangerous. The fucking peanut thing is REALLY dangerous!!  I can't express to you enough how awful this is. If you live Brit you have to back her on this. ",
            "I have celiac disease and from the title I thought your mom must have lied about the ingredients to find out if she was really allergic. \n\nFrom the story it doesn't seem like sh did, she just wasn't as careful as she needed to be.\n\nDid you actually say she had celiac disease?\n\nIt may be true that your mother didn't believe her allergies. But it is also very likely she legitimatly didn't understand the severity.\n\nMost people will not know how to handle that many restrictions for a whole meal.\n\nI have celiac disease and my in laws are very accommodating, but it's been years and I still ask to see all the packaging and quiz them on exactly what ingredients are in the food they've cooked for me. \n\nYour gf needs to take responsibility for what she eats. Meaning she should verify for herself that she is eating is in fact safe. Don't assume that the buns must be gluten free. Find out for sure. Ask the question. Be vocal about her need.\n\nIt sucks and it is annoying to have to do this every time you sit down for a meal. But the truth is that unless she prepared the meal herself she has to verify that all ingredients. I would rather annoy everyone for 5 minutes than sped 5 days in the hospital. \n\nUltimately what goes into her body is her responsibility. No more assuming things must be safe because someone was breifed on her restrictions. ",

You don't fuck with a persons life just to prove a point. Your mother should be in jail as far as I am concerned, what she did was very serious and can't be justified by any stupid text message your dad sends. Your mother nearly killed your girlfriend and has probably given her complications that will go beyond her hospital stay, just to prove a point. What a nasty person.",

My MIL has always been over protective about it and will go out of her way when she would cook shrimp for her and DH. My best friend also has a bunch of food allergies and I'm extra carfull when she comes over with what I'm cooking . I would be giving your mom and dad a ear full and never eating there agen.",

After this incident blows over, I recommend you alternate where the weekly meals happen. She should also talk to your family to make sure she won't offend if she brings her own food. This way mom doesnt have to special cater, and when they eat with you guys they eat your food.",
            "So I find that a lot of older people just don't sort of get allergies. I know this sounds like an excuse for them but it's not. It's just that I've seen people be careless and it's not out of malice but a lack of understanding. I wouldn't let the peanut oil slide exactly but it would be a little understandable because the thought process might have been 'these are just potatoes so they're fine.' So then Brit has a reaction, they check the package, and go 'oh shit they were cooked in peanut oil. I would have never thought to consider that!'\n\nIf that was where it ended and you got a sincere apology, I'd still be pissed off, but at least I'd be able to follow the thought process and understand where the mistake happened.\n\nThe problem I have is that it doesn't seem to be just a simple mistake. There was the peanut oil as well as most likely gluten which they gave Brit because they assumed she was just being overdramatic. And then their apology was to basically blame Brit which is horse shit. If this were me, I'd be so incredibly sorry for this. And your parents aren't. Which speaks to what happened. This wasn't an accident. Either it was a test to see if Brit was just high maintenance and an attempt to catch her in it or it was just disregard because they figured it didn't really matter because she was just high maintenance. They didn't take her allergies - or you when you explained them - seriously.\n\nI don't know where you go from here.  Maybe Brit is more forgiving than I would be but this is something I'd never be able to forgive.",
            "Direct the energy from your anger towards calmly making sure something like this doesn't happen again, either with your parents or other people.\n\nKnowing how to train someone to do something is generally considered a much more advanced skill than being able to do it yourself. People break rules and cut corners all the time. For example, a lot of people drive faster than the speed limit. People die in collisions that would not have happened if the speed limits had been followed, yet people keep doing it.\n\nGet in the habit of always carrying around some food for your girlfriend, so that if she's ever anywhere where she's not completely sure about the food, you can give her something to eat. Something that will stay good in the bottom of your backpack for weeks. She can carry stuff, too.\n\nBuy her a big thermos for carrying her own hot food to dinner parties.\n\nFor dinner invitations, she can decline; eat before she goes; bring her own food, openly or surreptitiously; insist on eating only packaged food straight out of the package; or you or she can be in the kitchen during the whole time food is being prepared, helping and watching.\n\nRather than eating something just because her name is next to it, gf can ask a lot of questions, like \"Could I please see the package this came from? I'd like to double-check the ingredients.\"\n\nDon't assume your mother or anyone else will transform into a competent allergy cook without extensive training. Don't assume your mother will start knowing what to do and doing it after this incident. Maybe they should, but people don't always do what they should."

Looking back I was probably overreacting some because it was so personal to me.\n\nBefore I do the update \u2014 a lot of people mentioned that they weren\u2019t aware of how Tourette\u2019s can manifest itself. I also got some PMs about it, so here is just a bit more information. Basically to be \u201cqualified\u201d for Tourette\u2019s, you have to have multiple tics, both motor AND vocal. Funnily enough, although I had tics since around middle school, I only learned about Tourette\u2019s through watching a South Park episode about it in my first year of college. So if you are interested in learning more (they give a great overview of the disorder) and also laughing a lot, I recommend you watch S11E08 of South Park, \u201cLe Petit Tourette\u201d.\n\nSo on to the update \u2014 I had my interview on Tuesday when I made my post. On Friday afternoon, I got a call from HR; she asked me how the interview went. I wondered if something had been mentioned, so I said it went well except for this one awkward exchange, and I explained briefly what happened. She said she was sorry to hear abut the unpleasantness, but she was calling to let me know that every person I had met with had great things to say about me, and they unanimously voted to give me an offer.\n\nSO I got the job! It was a good offer with nice benefits. It\u2019s not my dream job, though, and I was actually in the later stages with another position that I really, really wanted. I asked them if I could have a week to respond; they said yes.\n\nYesterday, I got a call from this second company, and they gave me an offer too. The offer was a ton more money than the first one, like over 30% more, it\u2019s the exact position I have been looking for for months, and it\u2019s right by the beach! I of course accepted. I am ecstatic and will find a new apartment and start the new job in June, which is after my May wedding :)\n\nThank you again for your kind words. I appreciate it. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions about Tourette\u2019s!\n\ntl;dr I got the job I had the awkward interview for. I got a great offer from another company with my dream job, which I accepted. I\u2019ll be making lots more money, living at the beach, and getting married in less than a month!",

            "I never saw your original post until now, but I am so glad I saw this. I actually got a little emotional while reading it because I can relate to this so much. I am also a twenty-something female who has Tourette's and OCD and I coincidentally had a big job interview last week. While my interviewers did not say anything to me specifically about my tics (eyebrow raising, grimacing, winking my left eye, arm and leg jerks, basically anything exaggerated looking, low hum, etc.), I am always worried that they could hurt my chances. Like you said in your previous post, I am able to control them most of the time, but sometimes one will force its way out. I am always concerned that people will think I am making faces at them or what they are saying, especially when meeting for the first time. Or just that they will think I am a weirdo, since the general public doesn't know much about Tourette's Syndrome (in my experience).     \n\nAlso like you said before, it is very hard to be constantly aware of every muscle in your face, when trying to appear relaxed and \"normal\". If someone mentions something about it, it destroys my confidence in my self-control for a moment. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten upset about people's comments, especially in a previous customer service-type job. I have had people ask me if I am on drugs, if I am cold (I guess sometimes it looks like I am shivering), what disability I have, if I am winking at them, and the common \"are you ok?\"    \n\nAnyway, I don't know anyone irl with Tourette's so it is great to hear that your situation worked out so well. I also agree with what some previous comments said about the interviewer backpedaling because he felt uncomfortable. Most people rarely or never meet anyone that they know has Tourette's, so he definitely did not know how to handle it. Or he did not realize that tics can manifest themselves in ways that sometimes look like normal facial expressions, only they are involuntary. \n\nJust wanted to let you know I am happy for you, and so glad that you posted because it can be very hard sometimes to have this thing that makes us different. Good luck at your new job and congratulations on your wedding!",

            "Congratulations and thanks for sharing your tale of good fortune with us.  This lifted my spirits while reading it.\n\nSo a great update.  Hope we get another one... with photos of your wedding!\n\n",
            "Congratulations OP! \n\nWhen I read your original post I thought it was likely a good sign that they were offering you constructive feedback and indicating the belief that it was something they could relate to (even though they didn't really listen to your response). As someone with a not immediately noticeable disability, I completely understand why their reaction was upsetting and offputting, so it's fantastic that you weren't left in a position feeling like you should accept a role where you may not have felt totally comfortable. The two offers in a week certainly tells me that you have no reason to be self-conscious about this, but if you are then you could consider letting people you'll be working closely with in your new role know that this affects you so sometimes they might notice unusual facial expressions or movement but they shouldn't think relates to them and if they are unsure if you are reacting to something they have said or not they should just ask. ",
            "Read your last post.  I'm frequently a hiring manager or participant on a panel for professional level jobs.  When you ask someone the question you spelled out, it's unlikely that people will actually be honest with you, but you found one that did (the nodder likely not).  If it were me, I would have noticed and I would have said something similar.  Many good managers (I hope I'm one) are actually very sensitive people that are also good at managing their own emotions and reactions.  The thing is, we don't know what we don't know.  I wouldn't have guessed a diagnosed condition, just the exhibited behavior.\n\nOne of the hardest things one of the people that work for me ever did was admit to mental illnesses.  I can only imagine what that takes.  Since then I have used this knowledge to help that person navigate problems and negotiate on their behalf so they are not exposed or stressed unnecessarily.  I'd like to think it helps, but I can't ask, and they are under no obligation to tell me.\n\nI guess all I really had to say is I'm happy it worked out and you got a great job.  Try to work with management assuming you think they are trustworthy and decent human beings, and maybe they can help you where you need it.",

I totally agree about the South Park episode, it was so well done, I also recommend it to people who want to understand it better. \n\nAnyway, as a fellow 'sufferer', well done on getting the job and keep being awesome!

            "OP, a few thoughts.\n\nI really like Jake. From your original post: \n>Jake then said, \"No no, it's not tics, it's everything -- your eyes, your eyebrows, your mouth. I don't mean to insult you, but since you asked I think it would be useful for you to know. I used to suffer from the same thing.\" \n\nWow. What a window for connection!\n\nBut I really like you even more!\n>The tics come and go and change sometimes; if there's a really extreme one I can usually suppress it so it is very slight, or I can basically adopt a new tic and stop focusing so much on the other, more embarrassing tic. The tics still happen, but it is very restrained and I usually do it when someone has looked away. Some of the tics I have now are eye blinking, eye movement, eyebrow arching and furrowing, and grimacing with my mouth. Most people have no idea I suffer from this because I have gotten so good at hiding it. If I tell someone about it, they can pay attention and see the little lapses I have pretty often, but I don't think most people would give it a second thought if they didn't know to look for it. I am very proud of myself for having been able to restrain my tics so much. \n\nYou go on and on like this! It's amazing. You should be proud. You have taken the lemons of a potentially debilitating condition and mastered it to make lemonade. Jake could appreciate this, I'm guessing Albert could too. Which is why they were so willing to hire you. Take a guess at how many job applicants they get with that level of self-mastery. \n\nLast thought. Jake is inviting you into the Adult Tourettes Club. I'm a member myself. ",

That truck was his identity and part of who he was. \n\nI told him I knew he didn't want that car he bought and he told me I was right. We talked more an enventually figured out something that would work. He sold the car he had and we agreed he could just use mine. Our schedule works out to where he could take me to work and pick me up on time. It wasn't a big hassle and I was going on maternity leave soon anyways. He found a totaled truck for sale and the engine was still in good condition. It was the engine he wanted. He bought the truck for what was supposedly a really good deal and him and a couple friends ripped everything out of it that he needed and got rid of the body. The engine is in our garage now. It took him a couple weeks but he found a truck to put the engine into and him and a friend are going to pick it up this weekend. He's back to his old self again and baby is gonna be here soon and we couldn't be more excited!!\n\n\nTldr: husband had to sell his truck because of our baby and he wasn't the same afterwards.

            "I was speaking with a psychologist recently, friend of mine, and he said one of the most interesting things that has come out of research on child development is that parents who have active interests and hobbies are more likely to have gifted and intelligent kids.  This was very comforting to hear and confirmed something I've felt since day one of being a parent - if I put aside everything that I like about life to focus on parenting, not only will I be miserable, but my child will grow up in a barren and joyless environment and no amount of DisneyTM FrozenTM themed party favors and napkin paper plate sets is going to offset the despair.  Everyone in the family needs to be having fun in life, not just the kids.  Someday when your husband is working in the garage and is showing his little girl or boy how an automatic transmission works and he sees that spark of curiosity and the questions coming out faster than he can answer... That's when he'll understand why the truck needs to stay!",
            "Thanks for figuring out what was up, and respecting him and his interests.  It's easy for people to judge down on other people's hobbies or desires, without thinking about what it means to them.\r\rI'm not a truck guy, but I can totally see how being really into trucks could be important to someone. They're rugged, they let you haul around stuff, you can take a bunch of gear on camping trips with them, etc. All things that an active, outdoorsy man (or woman!) might want to do.\r\rAs a parent, let me offer something: Being a parent takes over your life, for a long time. Little things that you used to do, that were easy and fun and in retrospect were important to you, become difficult or impossible to do, for years, because your kid needs your time, attention, and money.  And you will miss all of those little things. Day trips down to the lake. Meeting up with your truck buddies, etc.\r\rYour husband's truck is probably part of a lot of these things. It's a lot more than just a truck, it's part of his life and identity.\r\rSo, thank you for figuring that out and respecting it. Guys take a lot of shit for *supposedly* being unemotional or stoic or whatever, but that's bullshit. The manliest man still has wants and needs. And when a new baby turns your life upside down (and it will), getting those needs met is going to be harder.\r\rAlso, as a kid, I grew up riding in a lot of pick-up trucks. Holy hell are they fun! Just don't let anyone ride in the back -- hard rule. Dad + mom + truck = good times.",

I haven't owned a car for a few years, and the only thing I ever did with it was get oil changes.  What is there to do with a truck?  Was it just super old and needed repairs?  Was he painting it or something?  Or... upgrading... the... tubes?  Are tube upgrades a thing people do?  What does one *do* in a truck club?\n\nI'm happy things worked out for you guys, but this whole thing is just super mysterious to me, and hints at a whole world I didn't even know existed.\n\nAlso: you guys should get some bicycles!

            "My first car was a 1968 Mustang. My dad bought it for me before my senior year of high school, and I loved it with all my heart. It was part of who I was: the blonde girl with the turquoise Mustang. Fast forward 3 years, and I was run off the road on the highway going to a U2 concert; my beautiful car totaled. I was devastated, depressed, I cried all the time, and to make it all worse, my dad gave me a 1970 something Chevy Malibu to drive. It was horrible, not having my beautiful car, and having to drive the giant ugly car. We ended up replacing it with a 1987 Mazda RX7, which was a fun little car, but I still miss that beautiful Mustang. \n\nI have bought and sold many vehicles since then, but one of them that I traded in, I sat in the office signing papers for a newer, fancy vehicle, sobbing like my dog had died. The car salesperson was very understanding and said it happens to other people. Losing a vehicle is losing that thing which was part of a lot of fun and memories. It's kind of like part of the family after you drive it so long. I have a Volvo now, and it's totally bitchen with all the neato features, but it didn't haul my kids around in their carseats, and I didn't play The Little Mermaid DC for them in it, and we didn't sing and laugh and cry in this car. \n\nIt's weird to bond with a vehicle, but since you put so much of yourself into it, it's really not surprising that you can bond with a vehicle.",

        "selftext": "[Link to the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4kird3/i_27_f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_27_m_of/)\n\nFirst off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread. \n\nI never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter. \n\nHe was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great. \n\nApparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect! \n\nYeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it! \n\nI waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely. \n\nWe were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift.\n\nWhile he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future. \n\nThe language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)   \n\nSo that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife!\n\nGod, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy! \n\nTo all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks! \n\n**tl;dr: I proposed, he proposed back, we both said yes! He declined my offer of fully paid tuition fees for studying at university and the language course idea, and said he would much rather spend time with me abroad, just the two of us! Getting married in winter, so we're going to combine the honeymoon with the trip.**",

            "This is a huge red flag. I can't believe you'd even want to be with someone like this. You should definitely dump... Wait, a happy post in /r/relationships?! Congratulations! Your story is adorable.",

            "I know this shouldn't be noticeable even but I was so glad to see a woman do a proper proposal on here, to a man. And hilarious that he'd been plotting the same thing. Congrats so much!!!!! You clearly care so much about this guy. ",
            "Well this is just delightful! \n",
            "Just a small thought: I would caution against thinking of spending money just on him as a \"gift\" going forward. There's always the chance that if you continue thinking of or referring to such spending as a gift, it could build up to a problem over time. This is your life together, and the \"gift\" implication is sort of contrary to the teamwork aspect of a strong marriage. \n\nThat having been said, you guys sound like you'll be really happy together. I wish you all the best, OP. ",

            "This just made my weekend. You both sound like genuine, down-to-earth, communicative, and mature people. Beyond happy to read this update and this sweet proposal story that you will love telling for years to come. Good luck wedding planning and enjoy that time abroad! ",

            "Awesome update and I am very happy for the both of you, sweet Internet strangers!\n\nMaybe a long honeymoon to the country whose language he'd want to learn is something to consider.  In any case, congratulations!",
            "This is awesome!  I am literally in tears! ",
            "This is such a wonderful update, I'm happy for both of you.\n\nSince the \"gift\" has morphed into spending time abroad, you might consider just moving to another country for 6 months to a year.  You could still live simply (particularly if the country is not a well-developed one) and relatively cheaply while gaining a wonderful experience *together.*  \n\nInstead of it being just a \"gift\" it will be a life experience that you will have both shared and will likely further cement your relationship bond.\n\nThe money you might have spent on a gift can be used to make things convenient during the travel and moving process.",

I wanted to point out that summer isn't the same all over the world, and is considered the coldest season for countries in the southern hemisphere! ",
            "Truly an 'awww' moment if there ever was one. And I love that you grabbed the bull by the horns and proposed to HIM. Congrats!",

He said he understands that he should have told me, but that he had kind of hoped that she was just having a weird moment and that it wouldn't happen again and we'd avoid the entire thing completely.  I told him that from now on I want him to be upfront with me about this kind of thing. I also told him that if he was worried about if I'm going to believe him over my \"friend\" or not he shouldn't be. Because I honestly suspected that she was into him anyway, I would have definitely believed him. \n\nAnyway, I feel like he totally understood where I'm coming from. If anything this whole thing kinda made us be in on the same page about this type of stuff. \n\nI want to thank everyone for the advice because I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before and my friends are kinda cynical so they expected the worst which me made me do the same. Ironically because of this whole thing and the talk we had after, I feel like I can trust him more. For now I'm gonna try to stop assuming the worst. \n\nThanks to everyone who chipped in. \n\nTLDR: My boyfriend and I had a talk about what happened. He explained to me his point of view and I explained to him mine. He understood why I was upset and I feel like we really got on the same page. So, everything worked out for the best.",

If so, I totally understand why this was such a novel relationship experience for you! I'm glad you guys were able to resolve this and come out stronger on the other side. :)",
            "Glad to hear things worked out.\n\n> I was honestly getting paranoid because I've been cheated on before.\n\nDon't ignore red flags and the need to reasonably check on what your partner is doing (in general in relationships), but also keep in mind that only YOU have this paranoia and trauma from past relationships.  \n\nHe doesn't, so I totally see how this attempt by your friend to hook up was a non-issue for him, he shot her down hard, matter was resolved in his mind, and thus not worth mentioning.  He should have told you (so you could build trust), but the point I'm trying to make is he didn't do it out of malice, he just didn't have the same mental perspective as you because he didn't have the trauma.\n\nAnd you should take care of that trauma by talking to a therapist.  If you don't, you're basically burdening him with it.\n\nBut, good that things worked out, and wish you guys the best for the future.  Keep that communication going, it really strengthens the relationship.",
            "This is the important difference between communication and comprehension.\n\nYou can speak as much as you want, but if your partner cannot comprehend where you're coming from, communication will resolve into nothing. \n\nIt's fantastic to see that you and your partner are on the same page all together! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc4f",

            "Sounds like everything worked out perfectly. It's nice to hear a happy update.",
            "Communication is key.. it provides perspective and understanding. Your friends need to see your side of this too so they arent constantly trying to be suspicious of him too. And you definitely dont have to assume the worst, but that doesnt mean you go all the way to the other end and assume he cant do anything wrong either.\n\nEverything has to be within reason and understanding and maturity. But I'm really glad this was so easily settled",
            "Maybe you need new friends then if they feed into your paranoid tendencies? You are who you surround yourself with so if you're around cynical assholes all day, you're likely gonna be like them. If you surround yourself with positive people you'll have a better outlook on life.",
            "Also keep in mind that if your BF knows that you've been cheated on in the past, his bringing up the fact that your best friend was trying to get him to cheat could trigger a huge stress response from you.   Not only do you need to worry about your BF, but you need to worry about your best friend as well.     \n\nI'm glad it worked out, communication is key.",

            "This is a weird one. The dude was totally in the right. That was the best response for him to have but he got into some sort of hot water with you for perceived reasons why he didn't come forward with it? He even told you why when you found out. I guess I'm just baffled why this needed to be a story on Reddit to begin with is all. Anyway, glad it worked out!",
            "I remember reading your original thread but didn't get to comment before the lock. From your original post.\n\n>My friends think he hid it from me because he was interested.\n\nAnd from this post:\n\n>...my friends are kinda cynical so they expected the worst...\n\nIt really sounds like your remaining friends are also trash to be honest. This idea doesn't make any sense because he presumably would have made a move in the couple of weeks following, but didn't, and instead did literally everything right.\n\nI would take this as an opportunity to evaluate the kinds of people you surround yourself with.",
            "Honestly... it's cool that you were able to communicate, but he should have told you. I'm glad you dropped the friend. You are 20 years old, you're not going to know these people forever. There's a whole wide world of non-assholes waiting for you.",
            "Honestly, I would've done the same thing your bf did. The way I see it, there is a long-time friendship and a 4-month old relationship. I wouldn't think a woman I have been dating for 4 months would take my word over a long-time friend. I am glad it worked out in the end!",
            "Men don't give us enough credit. We can usually tell when a woman is acting weird towards a dude. Same goes for guys and telling if other guys actually want to be friends or if it's just a play lol\n\nHey good on your for being a reasonable person. It sounds like your partner wasn't sure you are in fact a reasonable person. Hopefully he had a bit of a lesson too. This will only go towards strengthening your relationship and bring you two closer together.",

This won't be the last time a girl hits him up as it tends to happen more often when a guy is in a relationship. Sounds like you got trust issues.",

            "I\u2019m so glad this worked out for you. I\u2019ve been there before. My ex bf would hide things from me because he \u201cknew I would be upset\u201d not realizing that when I found out about it eventually I would be every MORE upset that he hid it. It just makes it seem like the original situation was worse. Like if you were honest with me from the start, I would believe you. But because you hid it it makes me feel like you had something to hide. Problem was, no matter how many times I tried to explain this to him, he never changed. \n\nLater on I learned the term \u201ctickle truthing\u201d which basically means they tell you a version of the truth that\u2019s consistent with what you already have knowledge of. Every time you figure something else out, the story changes to the least bad version of those facts you have.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to plant suspicions in your mind. There really are lots of good guys out there. But there are also lots of not good guys and you\u2019re still so young. (God I\u2019m only 25 and telling a 20yo they\u2019re so young, I feel old and gross \ud83d\ude02) My point is, you\u2019ve talked about it and he\u2019s indicated on some level that he gets it. That\u2019s great. But make sure his future actions actually reflect that. I told my ex so many times that it makes me feel MORE anxious and MORE shitty when I catch him in a lie like that but he still kept lying because it was more convenient for him. If you give him a few chances and he STILL doesn\u2019t seem to get it, consider other options. Don\u2019t stay with a guy who prioritizes his convenience at the expense of your feelings. You deserve better than that. I hope your bf really did get what you were saying and I\u2019m so happy for you if it works out! Just be careful! Love you babe.",

            "I think he\u2019s lieing altogether about the ages and really is in late thirty\u2019s and the validity of the story at whole is quite questionable to say the least weather or not the person writing the story knows it. Do not be to fooled about how twenty year olds are able to communicate so effectively.   \u201cDon\u2019t pee in my leg and tell me it\u2019s raining\u201d i think is appropriate in this case.",

            "Huh??? What??? Talking to your partner about problems can solve those problems??",
            "what a great outcome. well done!",
            "Glad that there was reasonable advice in that first post, and that you listened to reason. Best of luck going forward!",
            ">So, I told my boyfriend that I understand why he did it and that I get that he wanted to avoid hurting me but that he doesn't get to make that choice for me. He said he understands that he should have told me, but that he had kind of hoped that she was just having a weird moment and that it wouldn't happen again and we'd avoid the entire thing completely. I told him that from now on I want him to be upfront with me about this kind of thing. I also told him that if he was worried about if I'm going to believe him over my \"friend\" or not he shouldn't be. Because I honestly suspected that she was into him anyway, I would have definitely believed him. \n\nWhat are you, some kinda mature adult??\n\nGood for you guys :)",
            "I like that this has a happy ending. That's so unlike most of the things we read here on Reddit",
            "At least he told you eventually not like my ex and I found about it later.",
            "Honestly, looking at everyone's age and life experience, this is all to common and not-unexpected. Everyone's hormones, emotions, and thinking skills are still developing. Chalk this up to a learning experience. A persons brain doesn't really stop developing until age 24.\n\nI wish we would tell young people that their 20's in many ways will be more difficult than their teens instead of them learning the hard way.",
            "So, did the other girl fuck your boyfriend or was she just trying to behind your back? I would stop hanging around her no matter what the answer is to that question. Anyone who would plot to bone your boyfriend is NOT your friend. Any boyfriend who would succumb to your friend\u2019s seduction is not someone you want as a boyfriend.",
            "Just a comment about how you worded something in the last post: he can only come off like a cheater if you believe he is. Keeping a secret from your SO can easily be seen as hiding an affair, or a surprise gift. He maybe didn't think you were the kind of person to get upset about that, or the kind of person to assume he was cheating. \n\nRegardless, communicating about it was the solution. The entire relationship will be smoother if you take time after conflict to let your emotions calm, then think out loud together.",
            "Yes. Maybe he should have but understand that he might have felt...creeped out or \"put in a position.\"\n\nIt's happened to me (I'm a man) and it was pretty creepy. No one tells men how to react and it doesn't happen that often (to me and I assume men in general)...sometimes \"victims \" kind of \"freeze up.\"\n\nIt happened to me three time when I was married and my thought process (after processing the creepy factor) was...\"if I tell my wife...what if creepy friend told wife I hit on creepy friend?\"",
            "Sounds like he is a very caring person who thinks of others feelings but just has to learn a little bit about trust in commication and have a strong belief in your relationship he is OK but I would definitely have a serious word with your friend as this is not a person you want in your life as she is quite obviously a person with low moral standards and no respect for you",
            "Sounds like your relationship is moving in the right direction! Good job talking it out. That\u2019s extremely important",
            "Congrats on working through everything! I just wanted to leave a quick comment because a few of these ones and from the original post were bothering me :). While I\u2019m glad to hear your boyfriend didn\u2019t cheat on you, he still mishandled the situation. I saw many comments really downplaying your feelings as projection from past experiences or being \u2018dramatic\u2019 because he\u2019s a golden boyfriend for not cheating. His actions were a red flag, and your concerns were one hundred percent valid! I hope that even though it was resolved you don\u2019t take away that your feeling we\u2019re unfounded or caused by anything other than astute, rational concern over his actions; which while worked through, were definitely wrong and could have been a sign of bigger issues that had nothing to do with cheating concerns. You were totally in the right mind and you took your concerns and discussed them. Which unlike many posts was not \u2018dramatic\u2019 or \u2018unfairly grilling\u2019 your angelic boyfriend. Women don\u2019t need to be lied to because we\u2019re too dramatic or fragile and boyfriends don\u2019t get a gold star for handling a situation poorly just because they didn\u2019t cheat on you; that\u2019s pretty much the bare minimum in a relationship lol. Glad to hear he ended up being a decent person and communication was the key! Best of luck and keep being your intelligent, thoughtful self!",
            "Hello I'm down here for a hookup",
            "From this and the previous post your friend group sounds pretty bad. One homewrecker and the others are cynics who whisper in your ear. Take what they say with a grain of salt next time.  And \"you don't get to make that choice for me\" needlessly confrontational phrasing."
