        "selftext": "I don't where to begin. I feel so embarrassed coming here and asking for advice.\n\nMy boyfriend Steve and I have been dating for over a year in a half. I met him in one of my upper level classes two years ago. At the time he was finishing up his degree, before moving on and working on his masters. Since we started talking, seeing each other, and dating casually; I really loved our entire relationship. Steve and I had a lot of similar interests, which included traveling. We did a small trip to South America a couple months ago for a few weeks (Peru and Chile). We had an amazing time! It was once we got back form our trip that I saw our relationship in a  whole different way. We travelled well together, and bonded in a new way. I knew I was in a great relationship! \n\nI thought we had a great relationship, until I got some news a few days ago.\n\nThree days ago, I went over to drop a macbook charger over at my best friends house, Chenelle. Chenelle and I have been best friend since we were in high school from the age of 16 years old. I have always considered her to be my number one, and closest person in my life. I have noticed that the past 6 months we haven't hangout in the same capacity that we usually have. Both of us have been busy with our lives (school, work, relationships, etc). But, I kinda got the feeling after this past year of university around April, that she was starting to drift. She had a shitty relationship with her ex that lasted under a year. He cheated on her with a coworker, and the rest is history. They broke \"officially\" around the end of January.\n\nAs I went over to drop off her extra charger that she borrowed, I talked with her mom for a bit. Chenelle ended up getting called in to pick up an extra serving shift at the restaurant she has worked at during her degree. Her mom wanted to talk to me about a few things. I was puzzled.. Chenelle's mom was always really outgoing and funny. We had known each other for over 8 years at least. But, she wanted to have a serous talk.\n\nChenelle's mom, \"Karen\", went on to tell me that she saw Steve and Chenille sneak around the back of the house about a month or so ago. Karen went on to explain that she noticed this happening two other times. At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. She told me that I should talk to Steve and Chenelle ASAP. \n\nSteve and I were supposed to go out for dinner last night. He picked me up, and off we went. I felt really gross and humiliated the entire time we were out. We ate dinner, had a couple drinks, but we didn't talk much. Steve kept asking me all night what was the matter. I told him \"nothing\".\n\nFinally, when we got back to my place, we sat in my room and I asked him. I asked him, and told him what Chenelle's mom (Karen) told me. He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white. That gave me the answer I needed. I broke down and Steve tried to comfort me. I didn't want him touching me. I didn't even want to hear it! I told him to leave, but I basically had to force him to leave. I tried calling Chenelle and texted her that I needed to talk to her. I got no response. Not one. Basically, two of the closest people I have had in my life betrayed me. This is so terrible and I feel so shitty. I have like no one right now.\n\nSorry for all of the grammar and title mistakes.\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: I [24F] found out from my best friends mom Karen [late 40ish] that my best friend Chenelle [24F] had sex with my boyfriend Steve [26M]. I am so upset, and I can't believe it. There is more detailed information in the post - sorry. I really don't know how to move forward and proceed in this situation. ",

            "Wow, Chenille's mom did you a solid beyond what any normal person would do.  She's the hero in this story.... but I think that this story might have a very shitty middle... but a happy ending.\n\nDump Steve.. and your ex-bestfriend.  These two people betrayed your trust and showed their true colours.  You will NEVER have self respect if you let these two people stay in your life.  You didn't do anything to deserve what happened and you deserved a lot more from both of them.\n\nSo... in short... start over.  This is your chance to find two better people in your life.  I would personally make sure Steve came and got his stuff.. or... you got your stuff and moved out before Monday... and I would block all contact from him.  I would simply never speak to Chenille again and send Karen flowers thanking her for saving you from her daughter and a horrible relationship.",

            "Count your blessings that you found out at 24 and not later on in life that your friends a home wrecker. Cut them out.",
            "I would ghost Steve, to be honest. He doesn't deserve any sort of closure.\n\nI'm sorry this happened to you, OP. Cut them both out of your life. Let mutual friends know what happened, so that they know who they're dealing with.",
            "1.  Cut all contact with both of them right now. Don't tell them you're cutting contact, just do it. They need no explanation from you. \n\n2. Buy Karen flowers or a thank you card, or even a bottle of wine or beer. You know her best. She really did you a favor that not many people would have done. You owe her that. \n\n3. You need to tell mutual friends what happened. As many as you can, but confide to them from a place of hurt and friendship. You need to do this because I would not put it past your ex-best friend and ex-boyfriend to lie, but you'll also find from your friends support and empathy (if they don't, then you know they're not your friends). But tell people your side of the story. It will help to talk about it and you'll find friends who support you. You're not alone in this. Also tell your family. You need all the support you can get right now. \n\n4. Focus on yourself. Cry all you want. Eat what ever you want. Binge watch sappy movies on Netflix. Whatever. And when you're done and feeling a little better (you won't feel much better, but you'll feel a little better) start hanging out with friends and family. Start FORCING yourself to get out of the house. You'll literally have to force yourself, I've been in your situation. Go to the gym, go shopping, volunteer at the humane society with kitties and puppies, hang out with friends at every opportunity and at the end of the day...it's okay to just cry. Day by day you'll start to feel a tiny bit better. \n\n5. Absolutely. Never. Talk. To these two people again. Never. Ever. \n\nLots of hugs. And you're not alone. Absolutely do not feel embarrassed. Feel angry, feel upset, feel hurt. But do not feel embarrassed. You have no reason to. You did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing wrong. The embarrassment is on them. 100%. \n\nYou've got this, lady! You can do this. ",
            "Karen is the true friend here. She could have covered for her daughter and said nothing, instead she did the right thing. Unload your friend and your BF there is no coming back from this. I am very sorry this happened to you.",
            "I was in a very similar situation many years ago and I tried to forgive everyone involved because I thought it was the right thing to do.  It didn't work.  My former best friend and I became very competitive about everything.  I never trusted my ex again.  And I was miserable until my life situation changed enough where I didn't have to see either of them on a regular basis.\n\nLeave them behind and move on.  You deserve better.  And consider traveling on your own if you feel comfortable doing so - it was a very liberating experience for me.",
            "You've got to be a real scumbag to bang your best friends SO.  Good riddance. ",
            "My boyfriend of seven years cheated on me with one of my best friends  and all I can say is leaving them and cutting them out of my life has been the best thing for me ever! I am a million times happier than I ever thought possible. It so sucks that people so close did that. But don't worry your life will be so much better. Keep busy and work on doing things you love.  Go out with other friends and make new ones! If you ever need to talk PM me. ",
            "First of all, her mom awesome.\n\nSecond, I would ghost him so he gets no closure. Since he doesn't even deserve it.\n\nAlso *Hugs* ",
            "Hugs. Sounds like he already gave her a heads up and she's too scared to face you right now.\n\nGive yourself some space. You've only just found out about this and it's going to take a while to process this. Perhaps talk it over with a therapist if you're having trouble moving past the hurt of it. For now, talk it over with someone you can trust.\n\n",
            "Don't let this experience cloud your views going forward.  This is a grotesque betrayal beyond the norms but there are still good friends out there and you deserve them.",
            "Karen is a model human being. I hope her daughter learns her damn lesson from this: when your own family won't defend your shit deductions, it's time to make better deductions.",
            ">Basically, two of the closest people I have had in my life betrayed me. This is so terrible and I feel so shitty. I have like no one right now.\n\nBut Chenelle's mom did the opposite of betray you in fact she stuck her neck out even though it went against her own daughter.\n\nI'm so sorry you are in this situation because it is truly fucked up and awful. And it is a huge betrayal. It absolutely sucks. People do betray us and act shitty and it can really fuck with us.\n\nI just wanted to point out the one ray of hope here. ",
            "Karen is a true girl friend. Sadly, her daughter is not. Chenelle is a coward for ignoring your calls.\n\nCut Chenelle and Steve out completely and start fresh.\n\nI hope you don't lose faith in people after this, though. Karen showed you that there are good people out there.",
            "Step#1 Cut out Steve and Chenelle\n\nStep#2 Buy Steve's mom a bottle of wine or a six pack\n\nSteve's Mom was awesome and didn't hesitate to tell you her suspicions. As for your \"friend\" and your bf: they both decide that their temporary pleasure trumped their relationship with you. They had absolutely no problem lying, cheating behind your back and potentially exposing you to STD's (you should get tested). And they would have continued to do that if they didn't get caught.\n\n I know that doesn't make the here and now better, but if you ever get an inkling to bring them back in your life you should remember that. They aren't looking out for your best interests, just their own, and that's what you should be doing now. Focus on yourself, drop the trash, and work on moving past this all. That includes blocking them both on everything (facebook, emails, texts/phone). No need to listen to their lies and rationalizations for betraying you. ",
            "I would ghost Steve, too.  No way can you ever trust him again.",
            "Listen OP, this is a shitty situation. I understand how upsetting it is to feel like you've lost very close people.\n\n However, that being said, you are 24 years of age. Not sure why the universe works this way but I know a lot of individuals who have to do a complete reset of friends around this point. I think that this time is when people change and grow up to bigger things, or stay steadfast in that early 20s mindset.\n\nDo yourself a favor, pick your head up and move on. Don't look for explanations or reasons why this happened. There aren't any. Don't hold grudges. Move on. Make choices that empower you and make you happy. \n\nYou only have this life to live and you should do it the best possible.",
            "Karen is a fucking legend, fair play to her. \nI'd get rid of the other two and be glad that you found out now rather than investing any more time and feeling into your pos,  fuck nugget bf.",
            "i had a similar situation. i know its hard to let go, just do the best you can to let go.",
            "Tell her mom thank you because she didn't have to tell you this. She saved you a lot of time wasted on this cheater. Ditch the guy and your friend, there's no going back from this",
            "I had a similar situation with my ex. We got along on so many levels and I really thought I'd found my other half. But I was so very wrong. It took me taking him back many times and all of the same betrayals to happen many times before I finally realized that he really didn't respect me enough to keep his dick in his pants. I blocked the friend on every social media and any other way possible. \n\nI strongly suggest cutting both him and the friend loose from your life. A real friend wouldn't ever do that and as for your BF- you have to think in terms of trust. Can you ever really trust him again? Probably not. There will always be a nagging little part in the back of your mind running what ifs when he takes too long to call you back or goes places without you. If you can't trust him, then there's nothing left for you two. \n\nYou deserve better than someone who would so blatantly disrespect and betray you like that. Someone once told me to learn to accept the apology you'll never get. If you never talk to either of them again, at least you'll come out knowing it wasn't you who did wrong in the situation. \n\nA word of advice: always try to keep an open line of communication about everything regarding the relationship and ask them to do the same. A hurtful truth at the beginning is always better than a gift wrapped lie after the fact. ",
            "My now ex friend hooked up with my now ex boyfriend. It sucks at first OP not gonna lie. I spent a few months in bed not wanting to do anything but time heals all wounds. In the end it'll be a blessing that the trash took itself out. Sending you all my love and hugs",
            "I have been exactly where you are. If your \"friends\" are anything like mine, they will come back with excuses and \"i love you\"s and your history together. Do not fall for any of their shit. There is no going forward with either of them, because that would require them no longer being fucking terrible people. That doesn't happen over night. It will also never happen if you let them think this behaviour is okay. You need support, but not from them. Call your parents or any other friends you have. You maybe think you don't have other friends because you've spent all your time focused on Chenelle. There are lots of people you know or will meet who would love to build up a friendship with you. You will get through this. ",
            "(((hugs))) Something similar happened to me. It was earth shattering. I went for years without any friends at all. \n\nMy advice to get counseling if you can. Being able to talk to someone about it, for hours if you need to, will help you a lot. \n\nTry to stay busy. Make some memories that don't include either of them. There are people out there that aren't that shitty and selfish, and you deserve to be friends with them. \n\n(((hugs)))",
            "I am so sorry that you got caught up with such a pair of vipers. \n\nHonestly,  just take care of yourself. Consider them as dead if it helps, but do lots of nice things for yourself, if you stop taking care of yourself it will compound the bad feelings so go to the gym, watch movies you like, buy a few pieces of nice clothing, get a massage, spend time with people who really love you.",
            "It wasn't meant to be. Trust me when I tell you : once the trust is gone, it does not come back. How could you ever trust either of those two again? I hate to say this, but you need to get rid of both. So sorry. There are better people out there. ",
            "I've known people who got this kind of news when they were further into the relationship, with marriage and kids! It still *sucks*. Dump both of them out of your life, OP. Not friendship OR boyfriend material.",
            "This happened to me about 5 years ago... I still will get stray feelings of horrified anger on occasion... what they did is unfair and heartbreaking, but it will get better after some time. Try to focus on yourself and obviously dump them both and don't give them the benefit of ever being able to talk to you again. Give yourself a good few months of \"mourning\" and then pick yourself up and go do good things with and for yourself. I'm sorry this happened to you. \n",
            "welp time to cut out your best friend and current bf and buy that mom Karen Dinner!",
            "Everything you do now, you do to better yourself and for yourself. These two people, however good to you they were in the past, have done something they can't take back or repair. AND they did it more than once. You didn't deserve any of it. It sounds to me like your bestie was so broken by her last relationship, she needed to watch the world burn. If all that shit could happen to her, why does anyone else get some perfect relationship? Fuck this perfect relationship. Anyway, that's how I see it. I'd go no contact and not allow them to see you for closure. They will want to apologize and explain. They will want to do that to alleviate themselves of guilt. So ask yourself, will that help you or them? Is it even worth helping them alleviate their guilt?\n\nTo best punish them, you go live a wonderful life. You get your own place that you set up just how you like. You join clubs, teams, whatever hobby makes you smile and feel proud of yourself. You heal and move on. You find a new best friend who treats you how you deserve to be treated.\n\nThen, when the pain is mostly gone and you look around and realize that life is pretty good without people like them, you date. Now you know what things you value in a relationship (travel etc.) and that will help you find someone else who is compatible and loyal. They exist. \n\nThank Karen. Send her a letter when you are settled and happy and thank her for the life she gave you. She did a wonderful, selfless thing. She set you free to find a better life. She cared about you more than your \"best friend\" and your boyfriend. \n\nIn the immediate future, get some ice cream and watch the movie that makes you feel most like yourself, for me that's Star Wars, or Empire Records, but I'm old. If you don't have one of those movies, maybe watch How to be Single? It's good for a few laughs and is somewhat relevant... \n\nIn a decade you'll be my age and this will be a blip on the radar of your life. Looking back, you'll want to be able to say to yourself, \"I handled that super well and look at me now! Fuck those people!\" Imagine how many more places you'll have been in a decade! Make a list of where you want to go, and if you can, start tackling that list on your own. Now think back to ten years ago when you were 14. Back then, did you think your best friends were the most important people in the world? They were then. How many still are now? And if the answer is one or none, is that fine? That's how you'll feel about these two people in ten years. You'll have others in the future who mean just as much to you, if not more. \n\nYou've got this. \n\n",
            "cut ties with bf and friend. they are shitty people and you dont need them around",
            "Cut them off completely--this is not forgivable. If anyone asks you why you broke up/are no longer friends, calmly tell the truth of their actions. You don't owe them to lie for them and their cheating is NOT a reflection on you--you have no reason to be ashamed. I understand the feeling of being betrayed as well as the sense that you can't trust other people but most people are not like them. ",
            "Ugh. And your former best \"friend\" knows how it feels to be cheated on! \n\nKeep your head held high, lady. You will get over this. It's painful, but just know those two cheating jerks will feel the wrath of karma eventually. All you can do now is start fresh, with your chin up and show them you're better off.I'm so sorry tho.

            "A similar situation happened to me when I was your age as well. I'm not trying to say that I know exactly what you're feeling, but I have a good idea. Betrayal, rejection, insecurity, anger...I felt all of those things. It was awful. For me, the visceral pain lasted for months and months. But even for a year or two afterwards, I still felt psychologically fucked up. I dated a girl after and was convinced she was going to do the same thing (we broke up but she didn't and we still remain friends).\n\nThat was eight years ago now. Since then, I've made great friends who I know would never do that to me. I realized that the life I was living with my ex and my former \"friends\" (I lost my two closest friends in the process) was not a healthy friendship or relationship. I've grown much more than I ever did with them and not attached any of my internal self-worth to their actions. As weird as it may be to hear, I am kind of happy it all happened.\n\nDespite ruminating every day for months on what happened, I now hardly even think about it at all. That's what will happen to you, too, I'm sure. I am deeply sorry for everything that happened, but know that you can take this event and make it into a turning point in your life. You have the ability to meet new friends, start new relationships, and in the end you will see everything that happened as just another bump in the road.\n\nI hope that helps. ",
            "Seriously, these two can go to hell. U don't owe them shit. That being said I agree with everyone else. Don't speak to them again. Send a little thank you to Karen and move on.

My best friend and one of my exes apparently were cheating on me for quite some time before I found out. It was a horrible feeling and it personally took me more than a year to heal from that wound. I cut them both out of my life right away and looking back, I think it was the best thing that I could have done. After blocking then out, I hung out with friends more and joined some clubs and that helped keep it off of my mind. I hope you can figure something out to distract you or move on to. Just remember, don't rush yourself into any relationship anytime soon. Good luck, I hope you can recover.",

            "They're both disgusting, they deserve each other. Cut them out of your life, text Karen a thank-you, and move on with your life. Focus on yourself, your work, your hobbies, making new friends. It gets easier with time. I'm sorry, OP.",

            "This is messed up, but it will be okay. You often find out in university who your friends are and some of them become friends for life and others just aren't there for you in the way you deserve them to be. Boyfriends in university rarely last forever, too. \nLook, this is a pretty extreme case of betrayal. The girl you thought was your best friend turned out to be selfish and vile. She was probably jealous of you or messed up over her own failed relationship, but what she did was inexcusable. But it could be ten more years down the line and she could be sleeping with your husband. Be grateful you found out whilst you're still young and have your whole life to make real friends and find someone who truly deserves you. I'm not trying to take away from your pain right now, but every cloud, right? \nIt's natural to be angry, to want revenge or to allow yourself to crumble, but the best thing you can do is to pick yourself up, thank your lucky stars that her mum has a moral compass and get out with some other friends and move on. Happiness is the best revenge after all! \nI really am sorry though- I can't imagine how it feels and I get that it's all too easy for us to sit here and dish out advice. It's understandable to be devastated, but this isn't going to break you. You can and will get through this and at the end,you'll be rid of two toxic people who ultimately didn't deserve your love. \nXxx",
            "Did Karen talk to her daughter, Chenelle, before disclosing to you?  As a mother I would care first about my daughter's ethics and her loyalties as a friend, before disclosing to said friend that my daughter was cheating on her.\n\nIt's this omission that does not track right for me in the story.",
            "Steve's just an asshole, no excuses there, but on your part a year and half into a relationship is about when guards start to come down. You thought Steve was a great guy because he was an asshole, but one who was good at covering it up, but after a year and half it slipped. That's not on you, that's on him, you have to trust people in relationships even if there is the possibility that they are abusing your trust from the start. If you don't trust your partner, you doom the relationship. I'm sorry this happened to you, but don't let it affect the way you approach relationships in the future.\n\nBut for Chenelle I'll play devil's advocate for her. Depression does funny things to people. I had some serious issues with depression earlier in my life, and looking back on it the one thing that really stands out to me is how selfish depression made me. I had this attitude of 'my life is so much worse than everyone elses, nobody should mind if I do this one thing for myself at their expense'. The scary thing is that while that looks like pure selfish insanity to me now, it seemed OBVIOUS to me at the time, like there was no other possible conclusion that even warranted consideration.\n\nWhat Chenelle did to you was bad, real bad. But two things stand out to me, a) sounds like she was going through a tough time in her life, b) from the mom specifically seeking you out to tell you about it, this sounds like she's had a good upbringing, has been a good person for most of her life, and this is really completely out of character for her.\n\nShe could just be going through a really rough phase in her life, and while what she did to you was beyond not okay, even in that context, it might be worth thinking about if she comes to you in the future with an earnest apology, that she isn't all that bad of a person at heart.",

This is definitely a huge betrayal and you are going to have a hard time, but I promise you, you will get through it. Don't let this jade you. There are good people out there...you just happened to get caught up with two very shitty people. But Karen is one of the good ones. I can't imagine how hard it must be to \"tell\" on your own daughter, but she did you a huge favor in doing so. ",
            "I'm so sorry this happened to you. I know it will be terribly painful to excise two people from your life, but the alternative will only lend itself to more pain.

At first, she thought we were all hanging out. But, Karen told me that she got a weird gut feeling on this situation. \n\nAnd then\n\n>He didn't answer. In fact, he went pale white.\n\nAnd that's it. You have absolutely no confirmation of what went on between them. They could have been talking. They could have been making out. Yes, they could have been having sex. But *you have no idea and you're jumping to the worst possible conclusion.*",
            "In the beginning of your op, you stated that you and Steve were dating casually and that it wasn't until you took the trip to Peru and Chile that you decided that it was something else. When did this cheating happen? Was it before or after the Peru trip? If it was before, would have it been that big a deal if you found out before the trip? I mean it would be for me, but then I don't get the \"dating casually\" thing, which sounds more like a FWB thing. Also, you stated that after the trip you realized you were in a great relationship - did you discuss that with Steve? Did he feel the same way? Or was this still just a 'dating casually' thing to him.",

Taking yourself from their lives is not punishment enough since you're not that valuable to them to begin with (if you were they  wouldn't have done what they did). Either personally, or in a text or email, let them know not that they hurt you, but the shity kind of people they are. Them cut them out and start fresh. One thing I've learned is that nobody is irreplaceable. And they obviously agree since they thought that of you. So give them the same treatment, get the closure you deserve and walk out.

If you're not 100% sure you want to cut them out entirely, I'm sure there are different ways to go about this that still take into account the severity of their actions. \n\n\nPersonally, I don't break communication unless the communication itself is the problem. I think it's always better to have more knowledge than less and I never think covering your ears doesn't help unless your ears are in fact the problem. This doesn't mean you need to actively talk with them, just means you don't ignore them. That way you can stay informed about anything else you may need/want to find out from them, such as logistics unrelated to your relationship.\n\n\nFrom your post it's clear, you're extremely upset about this. So, I'm sure you won't be taking this lightly. I hope you manage to get through this without too much pain. I know that burning this bridge may be for the best. But, I think it's perfectly reasonable for you to leave the bridge in tact and just take another road.",

Can we work through it?**\n\nNo, we couldn't because he cheated. I found out this morning through anonymous Facebook message that he wasn't loyal and there was more to the breakup than I knew. I called him twice with no response. So I sent him a text about the message. Still no response. So I decide to check his phone records. Lo and behold, a mysterious number popped up like the day things started to go downhill for us. He'd call the number on nights I was working and text it throughout the day. \n\nSoon after I saw that I checked Find My iPhone (he got his first iPhone and I helped him set it up like 2 weeks ago). His GPS showed at a random house near downtown that I know none of his friends lived at. Soon after that he called me. He denied it all and was trying to be all supportive. The moment I said I had proof he was hiding things from his phone records, his entire demeanor changed. He specifically stated \"I didn't sleep with anyone.\" Which was odd since I never brought up cheating. \n\nAs he was talking I checked find my iPhone again and from the distance, it looked like he left wherever he was and called as soon as he was in the car. I asked where he was and he said driving. I asked from where and he got very defensive saying it wasn't my business since we weren't together. I reiterated I knew he was hiding things from me (I still never brought up accusations of cheating yet). He called me creepy and stalkerish. I asked who the specific phone number belonged to and he refused to answer saying I was crazy. So I said I deserve to know and he said a friend from work (for the next few minutes he refused to assign it gender pronouns). A little bit later I pushed it it was a woman and he admitted it. So I asked who it was and said if it were the few women I know, then I get maybe he was venting to them. He refused to answer. \n\nSo yeah. We can't work it out. \n\nAlso prior to this he was already acting like a hot and cold jerk for the week after he  left me on the day of my bridal shower. Either acting like he didn't care one bit about me or that he wanted me back because his life was falling apart. Needless to say, I became more relieved that the relationship was over and was more mourning the fact I was in the position I was in (cancelling a wedding after a failed engagement). I realized he was very selfish and I took on every responsibility in wedding planning and our relationship while he had nothing to do but work and come home to play video games. For the record, I like video games but only when I have the time. Basically this was the icing on the shit cake and any bit I had left hanging onto the relationship went right out the window. \n\nI honestly feel relieved. I don't feel sad. I feel... free. And happy. I'm not sad being in the apartment we shared anymore. My sister had helped me two nights ago set up a new bed that help change the entire look of the bedroom. \n\nAlso Monday I'm going to a theme park with a coworker. While I'm not exactly trying to jump right into anything, he's a great guy and we have the same interests. It's just nice to have attention from someone I get along with. \n\nTl;dr ex-fianc\u00e9 cheated. I moved on. \n\nEdit: Yes, I'm getting tested ASAP",

Best of luck to you in the future!",
            "The issue here is if you are both in love with each other or not. You don't have to have a wedding or a marriage to be a couple. It should be based on what your hearts are telling you. I don't know how each of you viewed your relationship status after the wedding was cancelled. Did your SO still view the two of you as a couple and then he went out with another girl? That would be cheating; if he thought that you also felt you were both still a couple. This needs to be further defined. Then there's the cheating. Sometimes people might have a very brief, non-sexual bit of flirtation after a breakup and then change their mind right back where their heart was before. If your SO visited a girl and changed his mind right away; before anything happened, it is possible to work around this. If you are still happy and relieved in a week, then maybe you will want to move on. My point is that sometimes the shock of a change like a cancelled wedding could bring on TEMPORARY thoughts, behaviors and soul-searching and that a couple of weeks might be needed for both of you to work things out and make lasting decisions.

        "selftext": "Background: My sister and I were born into a terribly abusive, poverty-stricken family. Because our parents were either always drunk or high or never around, my sister basically had to raise me by herself. The minute she turned 18, she took me with her and we ran. We were homeless for a short while but my sister always took care of me. She worked wherever she could, always made sure I was fed and clothed, even made sure I went to school! I owe her more than you can imagine. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to go to college and a high school diploma doesn't open many doors. When she turned 20, she started working as an escort. A client of hers was really taken with her and proposed they start a sugar daddy/baby relationship. She continued on with this relationship until she was 24, pretty long for a relationship like that but my sister and this guy really liked each other and continue to be friends. My sister has always been upfront with me, and while it did take me a while to work over my feelings about my sister being a sex worker I realised that it didn't change her as a person at all. I felt guilty that she had to do all of this for me, but she always insisted that being a sugar baby was great for both of us. Her sugar daddy was this nice middle-aged Japanese man that taught her the language, got her to take the JLPT and later certified to teach Japanese (which is her current job at a local college). It seemed like for the first time in a long time my sister was able to breathe. We got an apartment, I got to continue my schooling, everything was great. \n\nCurrent issue: My sister and I still live together. My girlfriend, who I've been with for a little over a year now, was over at our apartment two months ago. We came from a party so we were both pretty drunk. When we got there, I noticed my sister wasn't home. My girlfriend asks if she can go into my sister's bathroom and use her makeup remover, and because I was wasted and not thinking (and because I trusted her) I let her go. She comes out after a few minutes with a photo she said she found in the drawer of my sister's vanity as she was looking for the makeup remover. It was an old photo of my sister and her sugar daddy hugging and looking pretty intimate. And this is where I fucked up, Reddit. At the time, I guess it wasn't just the alcohol that influenced me but the fact that I thought I knew and trusted this girl. I got giddy seeing the picture, told her this dude was the guy that helped my sister turn our lives around. I told her the whole fucking story. When I woke up in the morning, my girlfriend didn't say anything about it and I thought that was that. Fast forward to last Monday - I found out that while I had been running around getting a surprise ready for her birthday, she was fucking a friend of mine. I told her it was over, and she came over with all the excuses and begged me to take her back. Today, she messaged me with a picture she took of the photo my sister had on her vanity, and a screenshot of the guy's LinkedIn. She told me I either take her back or she'll tell my sister's bosses about how she used to be \"a filthy whore\".\n\nI'm scared Reddit and I don't know what to do. I know that sugaring isn't illegal, and that that photo can't really prove anything, but rumours like that could potentially kill my sister's career in the academia. I haven't told my sister yet and I haven't messaged her back yet. What do I do? I can't believe I've fucked this up for my sister. I'm in college because of her; I'm going to MED SCHOOL because of her. If she weren't here, if she didn't decide to do whatever she could for me, I'd probably be dead in a ditch somewhere.\n\nTL;DR In order to save us from homelessness my sister chose to be a sugar baby/escort for a time. My girlfriend found out, cheated on my months later and is now threatening me with the information unless I take her back.",

Let her know how much she means to you and everything you've said here. Your sister did nothing wrong - quite the opposite. It would have been way easier to leave you to your parents and only have one person to think about, but she didn't do that - she essentially sacrificed herself in order to protect you - which is what a (good) mom does. You're so lucky to have her, and it seems like you're taking the opportunities provided by her to build a great life.

I know you didn't want to break up and you're hurt and might regret being unfaithful, but that was between you and me. It was a little bit about my friend, but only partially. My sister is completely out of this equation. You shouldn't have to ruin her life to get back at me. She did nothing to you.\" \nI would think this would all be easiest to say in writing, personally. Probably in an email.\nIt's true. It's really unfair for her to get at your sister when she doesn't *want* to get at her, she wants to get at YOU. If she wanted to be more diabolical, she would be more direct. (Not that she should be diabolical). But yes, lawyer up if need be.\nAlso, I don't know if cases where college faculty getting fired for being an ex-sex worker is as common as ones with grade school teachers in the same situations. They've also mostly been porn stars in the situations I've heard, not escorts. Though seriously, don't quote me on that. Look up similar cases. Learn from them. If they ended well, use similar methods.\nBut I think it's different with teachers who work with children. When it's at an adult institution, everyone's innocence is already corrupted.",

I wanted to give you a heads up in case she follows through.\"\n\nIf she gets approached anyways regarding the picture (if they're not sent the picture, she can just disregard them as rumors), which I think is unlikely, she could just say it was a man she dated--a bit strange, but something I doubt she'd get in trouble for.  She could also say he was like a father figure through some tough times, and that he taught her Japanese; their relationship is similar to that of a dear friend (assuming the picture doesn't have a clearly romantic connotation).\n\nYou/your sister could also seek legal action against her.  I don't know too much about the details regarding that, but you could post on /r/legaladvice and/or contact a lawyer yourself to see what could be done.",

That way she has set the stage to make your ex appear crazy (although she would appear that way anyway). No serious employer would listen to anything like that, especially because she is not in a profession that is related to this topic in any way. Like, if she had stolen from a previous employer, that might be worth investigating, but this will be ignored. Depending on where you live, it might be illegal for them to look into it (researching the sex lives of employees is not acceptable!)\n\nNeedless to say, you sister should be dressing very conservatively at work for the next few months, just to make the story completely not believable if it does come out.\n\nAnd apologize to your sister. The reason you told your ex is because you trusted her, and you were wrong.

If she's yelling, do not yell back, do not say angry things or cut her down.  You already have everything you need to doubt continuing a relationship. she's just trying to make this situation go nuclear so that she can overcome the ethical barrier of blackmail and feel justified trying to fuck someone's life up.  \n\nIf you're calm and tell her that you cannot be with her anymore because of what she did and that you really hope she won't try to ruin your sister's life, then i highly doubt she would be able to do it.  After you say this to her, try to cut contact, even though she'll threaten to do it all the time.  If she gives an ultimatim, like she'll do it if you don't take her back that day, just don't respond.

Spiteful, angry, rude, just generally crappy. But that's if you're being vengeful, which isn't good for you as a person, but satisfying as a thought experiment. Perhaps it's better left as a thought experiment for how absolutely shit you could be as a boyfriend to someone blackmailing you without actually being able to do shit.\n\nIt could get to all levels of absolutely horrid behavior, and she likely doesn't understand that.

In my opinion, which should be taken with a grain of salt, if you sister has a good relationship with her employer, a 23 year old approaching them with unsubstantiated claims (a photo of a photo is flimsy and hearsay) and no paper trail, it would hopefully be also taken with a large grain of salt. I understand you position that scandal alone can ruin a career in academia, but it is also a field in which claims like that are not uncommon. I know you situation financially is probably limited but if you lawyer up, with a decent attorney, it will probably stop her 'suite' in its tracks. Only an ambulance chaser would take her case based on her evidence, and they will abandon a case if the chances of winning are not in their favor and you have decent representation. If your post is accurate she has no hard evidence to prove her allegations and don't delete that message she sent you, blackmail is blackmail. She also sounds like a shit person so you can probably come up with proof that her allegations are unfounded and vindictive You have gotten a lot of great advice already but I couldn't help but chime in with my 2 cents.

I however do not live there. I moved out a year or so ago and had a baby. I am currently living with my boyfriend in a different city. My mom is really mad at me shes saying that she doesnt understand why I dont just do it and that they could lose the house if I dont do it. She told a close relative that I have until Monday in a threatening way.My sister told me it'll be my fault if they end up homeless and she tried to throw in my nieces being homeless as well.\n\nThe thing is they use to do fraud all the time like it was no big deal and they want me to i guess follow blindly. They never learned their lesson from committing fraud because they havent been caught. They would take money out of my dad's account(somewhere around 15 thousand in total) and open credit card and phones under his name. My dad was from another country and sadly didnt know how any of those things worked or how to check on them. My mother is evil. I wont go into the things that she did to him or I or the rest of her children but shes bad enough to the point where I wont trust her alone with my daughter.\n\nmy father passed away last year. . I knew what they were doing was wrong and begged them not to do it and even got yelled at and scolded for trying to make them stop on several occasions. I never went to my dad though to let him know what was going on. I was scared he would leave us and now I know that was selfish and I should have just told him. Although I wasnt the one to take his money I have a lot of guilt for not speaking up I was around 17 at the time. I regret my silence to the fullest.\n\nAnyways here we are in the present and I'm made out to be the bad guy because I wont cooperate. For some reason they cant get it through their head that I dont want to chance getting fraud on my record. I can't do that to my daughter. I cant do that to my boyfriend. I cant do that that to myself. I feel like this is it. This is what's going to end our (mom and sister)relationship. I should also throw in that they both are pill poppers. It's a touchy subject with them. I get yelled at anytime I mention them and pills In the same sentence even when it's in a concerning heartfelt way. I'm hoping they dont try to forge the paper work or my signature. Part of me thinks they will if they somehow convince themselves that they can get away with it. I love my family I do...but I've realized they dont love me or at least not in a sincere way. Not if they treat me like shit for not wanting to commit fraud. They cant even try to look at it from my perspective.\n\nI tried to decline doing the refinance for the mortgage thing in a nice proper way but that didnt go over too well... Anyone have any suggestions on maybe how to end this on proper terms? Or is this good enough reason to go no contact with family?\n\nUpdate:  I just found out my work  didnt update my change my address when I put the forms in and now my w2's were sent to my old address (there's) I'm scared they can use these instead of my pay stubs and come my signature.  Everyone at work says they recieved theirs.  My mom said mine arent there yet idk if I believe her\n\n\nTl;dr sister and mom want me to say that I'm living with them and contributing to the household so she can refinance her mortgage. I'm not doing either of those things and dont feel comfortable with the idea of committing fraud. Mom keeps persisting and wont take no as an answer. Shes trying everything in her power to get me to go along with it. How do I make it clear that the answer is no???",

They probably DID receive your W-2 but, with their penchant for fraud, are probably going to use it to fraudulently receive your tax returns. First thing I would do is IMMEDIATELY call your employer and have them update your mailing address. Then go to your mother's house unannounced to get your W-2. \n\nAlso, call the police.

            "I am a lender at a mortgage company and I can tell you right now the chances of any underwriter using \u201cboarder income\u201d are very slim. Very very few lending programs allow this and as far as I have ever seen it\u2019s only allowable when the mortgage holder is disabled. Further, if she claims you are contributing to the cost of the mortgage, they are going to ask for 12 month payment history to prove such. And it would have to be paid directly to your sisters lender, not to her. AND it would be a huge red flag that she has no history of claiming rental income on her tax returns and again most lenders don\u2019t allow rental income if there\u2019s no history of such. In conclusion, from a mortgage professional, please let your sister and mother know this is a moot argument because the \u201crental income\u201d she would be claiming to receive from you would never be considered a qualified  source of income.",

Treat her like the criminal she is and take her threats seriously. If she goes through with taking your tax refund, report her ass and have her sent to jail, along with your sister.

            "Hi op, I am an underwriter for a mortgage company, and like one person said, the chances of them being able to use \"renter income\" from you is not high at all as this will be considered boarder income. If your sister's mortgage is fnma, she would need to prove you're disabled to use your income. She would also need to prove you have been living there, ie your paystubs, utility bills, driver's license, or in this case your w-2. But they also need to prove you've been paying them, ie they would need to see 12 months proof of money coming out of you and going to your sister's bank accounts. \n\nLike the other commenter said, unless they'd also forge disability documentation, and fake 12 months bank statements of her receiving rent from you, there's really nothing your sister can do. I think everyone else in the comments is making a much bigger deal out of this. What I mean is, no one from the mortgage company is going to be looking at your credit reports, or your finances or anything. They cannot fake your identity in this way - maybe in a different fraudulent event, but not just by claiming you've been living there. Believe me, underwriting goes into the actual borrower's life, but not really the boarder. But if you do feel like they will in the future use your identity to get a different kind of loan ( ie not a mortgage), you might feel safer freezing your credit report and putting a flag on your bank accounts. \n\nTrust me, underwriting will be able to tell you're not actually renting there and their plans will be foiled. Feel free to pm me if you have more questions. ",
            "Hi there. Sorry you're going through this. Seems like you are getting some good advice here but I wanted to offer my perspective as a former Mortgage Loan Officer for over 3 years. I have handled a lot of refinance and purchase applications. \n\nFirst of all, the amount of paperwork required to even qualify rental income is significant. Typically a lender would need 12 months of bank statements and cancelled checks showing the money coming into her account. Some would require the lease agreement. Additionally, rental income is only qualified at 75% of what is actually coming in. Lenders strip off 25% to account for potential vacancies, should the tenant decide to move out and it takes time to get someone else in. \n\nMy point: Not only is it fraudulent, it's also incredibly stupid. It's never going to work. Hit her in the face with the facts. Does this wizard of fraud expect to come up with 12 months of doctored bank statements showing money coming in that doesn't exist? It's laughable. She had better be damn good at Photoshop. \n\nIn the spirit of coming up with a solution for both parties, she needs to apply for something called a MODIFICATION or a hardship modification that allows her to lower her payments without refinancing. It sucks, it basically adds on years to the mortgage and ultimately you pay more interest but it does present the solution of lowering her payments which I assume is what she needs. \n\nDon't let her bully or threaten you, it's never going to work. I've had some people try to pull off fraud as I was just the first line of defense. SO many people look at the documents, I can't believe she even thinks it's possible, much less ask you to get involved. \n\nFeel free to message me. I think showing her she's stupid and telling her to apply for a modification should hopefully do the trick. ",

Report her to the authorities if necessary (absolutely don't do what your family is asking, but that's a whole other can of worms that's been pretty well covered by others). \u00a0\n\nI can tell you from experience that putting your foot down will feel\u00a0scary, and awkward, and weird. \u00a0 She may say that your sister's homelessness is your fault (spoilers, it's not), or badmouth you to friends or family. \u00a0Here\u2019s thing # 3: the fact that someone *calls* you a bad person does not mean that you *are* a bad person. \u00a0 She\u2019s not saying the homelessness will be your fault because it\u2019s true. \u00a0She\u2019s saying it will be your fault because she thinks that blaming you is a way to control you. \u00a0And if you do what she wants because she blames you, you are proving her right. \u00a0And, frankly, she\u2019s going to *keep* doing it, because now she\u2019s found the winning strategy.\u00a0\n\nTL;DR: Stop trying to convince your family to accept your no, because they're never going to.  They're trying to manipulate you into committing a crime, but the only way to win this game is not to play.\n\nEdit: Phrasing in last paragraph",

I decided to take a week to let things settle in even further. I made it explicitly clear that his behavior wasn't ok and we needed a change if this relationship was going to survive. Verbally he was on board, but after 24 hours it really fell apart.\n\nTonight, I pulled the plug. It was hard, and awful because I do love him and I will always love him but we are no longer in love. He asked me what I wanted, and I said I wanted him to be ok with less communication and be confident in our relationship, so that I could be at school guilt free. I asked him what he wanted, and he said he wanted more of my time, communication and energy.\n\nHis wants had nothing to do with what was best for me, or would make me happiest.\n\nThat was really hard to hear and we both cried for awhile when I pointed that out. He understood, he saw it coming and he didn't beg or fight it. We just cried.\n\nSo anyway, I wanted to say thank you to EVERYONE who reached out to me. Seriously, it made me feel like I was actually in control of the situation and not crazy for walking away. Thank you for being a community that validates others feelings and is honest and truthful.\n\nNow, I'm gonna go shower and watch stupid shows on netflix.\n\n**TL:DR Broke up with my boyfriend when he couldn't adjust to the lack of free time I now had in law school.**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9a0ylv/bf_21m_not_handling_me_22f_going_to_law_school/)\n\nEdit 1: Wow. I never thought this post was going to explode like this - in fact, it was locked originally by a mod.\n\nWith that being said, I\u2019m going to ask the mods to lock it again. For everyone, this has been an incredible discussion and I have read all of it. For those who are supportive, thank you!\n\nFor those who are on the team that I\u2019m a hypocrite - sure! Fine! I\u2019m completely ok with that. If I had the time and energy to argue how badly phrased I wrote last night, I probably wouldn\u2019t be single right now.\n\nAny way, thank you reddit! You guys are wonderful.\n\nEdit 2: Still waiting for the post to be locked, but trying to respond to as many comments as I can. \n\n&#x200B;",

            "Sounds like the right result, law school is no joke. Especially if you\u2019re interested in corporate/big law/ white shoe firms. The fact he didn\u2019t fight it actually shows that maybe he wasn\u2019t so immature, you guys just had different needs from a relationship, which is fair.\n\nI\u2019m not a text all day person when I\u2019m busy either, whereas some people do it to keep them sane. Incompatible, best to both move on and be happier ",
            "~~I feel like I should point out that your wants didn\u2019t have much to do with what was best for him or would make him happiest either.~~\n\n~~I\u2019m not saying this to be combative or to shift the blame over to you or make you feel guilty or anything like that. The point I\u2019m trying to illustrate is that this is neither of your faults, and neither of you did anything wrong. You both just want different things in life and have conflicting expectations for your relationship that can\u2019t be reconciled.~~\n\n~~The fact that you still care for each other and cried for each other is proof that this is the case. You\u2019re being pulled apart not because either of you are bad people to each other, but because your lives and your ambitions have different trajectories.~~\n\n~~So please don\u2019t hold his expectations for a relationship against him, in the same way that you wouldn\u2019t want him to hold your decision to leave for law school against you. That animosity doesn\u2019t have to exist. You can still be friends without blame.~~\n\n**Edit:** HaHAAA, BOY did I fuck up.\n\nSeveral commenters have pointed out to me that he was obnoxiously clingy and downright codependent, with some examples cited from OP\u2019s first post. Admittedly I neglected to read the original, and did not have a full context of the situation. That is my fault, and I apologize. Now that I have read it, I completely agree that he was exceptionally needy and has an *enormous* amount of growing up to do. He is immature, overly-dependent, and not really making much meaningful effort to be better.\n\nIn normal circumstances, my original comment would apply, and I wholeheartedly encourage people to examine their relationships to see if it may be the case. I've seen best friends tragically morph into bitter enemies because they were simply looking for different things in relationships and didn't realize it until after they had committed and let it create a rift between them and the one they once loved more than anyone else in the world.\n\nOP's situation is **not** one of those circumstances.\n\nAdmittedly, my experiences are what made me leap to the conclusion I did. It was presumptuous of me, and I'm starting to realize that my assumption has likely led to a lot of heartache, criticism, and accusations of hypocrisy on OP's part. \n\nThis is absolutely unacceptable. I made an awful mistake, and I take full responsibility for it. I would implore everyone reading this not to do what I did, but since it's becoming abundantly clear that I'm not the only fool who neglected to read her original post, I'm going to highlight a few things from it that further clarifies the situation:\n\n> He can't manage to show up in a timely fashion for anything, can't keep a part time job and whines the moment he isn't entertained\n\n> He is also whole heartedly way too reliant on me. Stupid shit like \"Should I go grocery shopping right now or go to the gym?\" And i'm like, \"Why does my opinion matter? This isn't something I should have an opinion in.\" Because it's really not. **What would happen whenever I refused to answer is he just wouldn't do either option and just lay around all day.**\n\n> **In a 36 hour period, he texted me \"What are you doing\" 17 times. 17 bloody times**. I ended up face timing him and was like this is unreasonable, unhealthy and needs to stop immediately. He seemed to hear it but a few days later, he's back at texting me several times a day to ask what i'm doing.\n\n> Every time i've talked to him in the last 10 days we've gotten into a fight. **Everything from a full blown fight to passive aggressive squabbles**. It's reached the point that the moment he starts being passive aggressive, I just say I have to go and hang up. I'm so brain dead that staring at a wall and doing nothing is actually relieving, I don't have the energy to constantly fight with him and deal with passive aggressive comments. He's like, \"Why don't you FaceTime me more often?\" Because **every time we talk, we fight or you harass me about when is the next time we are going to see each other**.\n\n> wanted to know if he could come up and stay in my new apartment for my first week of law school. I said heck no. I genuinely am gone all day, i'm exhausted and I need to be making friends with my colleagues and adjusting to my new city and life. ... This didn't settle well and he's asked probably every other time we've talked about when he can come visit. I genuinely can't even gather the free brain cells to think about what to have for dinner, let alone when I can squeeze in time for a visitor and the amount of pre-work I would have to do.\n\nWith all of that in mind, OP absolutely did the right thing, and it couldn't have been any more timely. \n\nThe way I see it, he wasn't getting something he wanted from her, so he was resorting to passive-aggressive behavior in an attempt to shame her into sacrificing all of her independence, her ambition, and her attempts to make a life for herself in order to lavish him with as much attention as he wanted. No matter how you look at it, this is emotional manipulation, plain and simple. Either he is hopelessly naive or consciously malicious, because no one in their right mind would think that forcing the one you love to return from 8 long hours of non-stop studying to over a dozen texts asking where they've been is in any way benign, especially after it's been warned against in the past. \n\nEven if you take the former optimistic answer that he's just an idiot, it is still completely and utterly unacceptable, and he has a lot of learning to do before he's ready for another relationship. But if you take the more cyncical latter answer, she didn't just escape an overly-attached boyfriend; she deftly evaded a malicious attempt to drag her into an endless cycle of abuse.\n\nEither way, OP saw it for exactly what it was and she would not have any of it. She asserted her agency, and it shouldn't just be accepted, but celebrated.\n\nLike, goddamn. If only more women (and men!) had her willpower and foresight. If more abusers were more conscious (or caring) of the pain they were inflicting upon the ones they supposedly loved. And if only we, us so-called \"relationship experts\", would do more to empower the victims of abuse, instead of criticizing them for not being \"more understanding\" or \"more patient\" for the benefit of their abusers.\n\nThank you to everyone who was willing to confront me with what I was doing. And to OP, I'm so sorry. You are not a hypocrite. You're an inspiration.",

But I put my feelings aside for a few hours at a time when I was studying and gave myself permission to grieve afterwards.  Honestly I didn\u2019t really truly process the breakup until after I took the LSATs bc I was just so busy w full time work and studying and dance classes to really grieve.\n\nLaw school contributes to a lot of breakups because it is such a jarring change.

            "It does take a big person to be so generous as to put up with the time and money involved with law school.   My wife and I moved to a new place for my job - she was good about it.  But there were few opportunities around there that interested her, so she asked me if it was \u201cok\u201d if she explored law school as a reputable one was nearby.   She ended up enrolling.  I happily supported her, and the dollar cost was manageable.  But over time her understandable focus on doing well in law school took a toll.  I got promoted to a VP position that took 10 hours a day 6 days a week to handle.   Coming home late afterwork to a dark house, no food, no companionship got old for me.   I grew impatient.   She graduated with honors and flew past the State bar on the first try.   I was happy for her, but by then the relationship had gone totally south.   She was a bit of an introvert, so I could not expect her to spot and rally to my needs.  But she was an attractive, intelligent, good person.  We had almost a decade of good times together.\n\nWe split up shortly after she graduated.  She went on to a good career as an asst AG, and I went on my way.  I took a new job in another state and never saw her again.   I really wanted to see her for a dinner to talk over what happened, and to let her know that I did not ever consider the problem her fault.  She was loyal and good to me.  A few months back I found out that she died last November.  So that conversation will have to wait.\n\n",

            "I think a lot of people are being harsh on you - saying you\u2019re selfish and should have broken up with him earlier, and I don\u2019t agree with them. \n\nYour situation sounds like a magnified situation I went through about 8 years ago. I was with my boyfriend at the time but was \u201cjust\u201d working. So I had a significant amount of free time. I was putting a ton of effort into our relationship. What we would do, where, financially, I would always go TO him. Ect. He supported me going back to school because he wanted me to better myself. So I started taking the prerequisites for the program I was going into. At that point I was going to school full time, as well as working full time - and just didn\u2019t have the energy to also plan what we would do, had quit my second job so I didn\u2019t have extra money and he \u201cdidn\u2019t\u201d either. I finally got sick of it and sat him down and told him I had put the effort into making the relationship work for over 2 years, and this past year he hadn\u2019t stepped up to the plate and that\u2019s what I needed. Because the next year I would be in the program I was going into (Dental hygiene - not law school but for an associates degree it\u2019s a demanding 2 years) and would need him to take over the x,y, z. Now mind you we lived together so we had a system as far as meals, cleaning, ect. But - it was the actual relationship part he put zero effort into. So his response when I essentially told him o needed to feel like he actually wanted me as a partner and to understand what I needed - he said \u201cI am putting so much effort into other areas of my life right now that I don\u2019t have any energy to put into a relationship\u201d, which crushed me because it made me realize that he had been coasting our entire relationship. Because I had always carried us. \n\nNow I understand that this is different than your situation because what you need is space and your ex-bf couldn\u2019t give you that. But I guess what I had read (of course by projecting my own experiences into it) was that you may not have realized the amount of effort you were putting into the relationship prior to law school. I will say I now have an extremely supportive husband, we both work on things and put effort in. We are a true team. I get so much more emotional support from him that o ever could have imagined - considering my ex was a narcissistic asshole (which I didn\u2019t see until I was out)  \n\nIt may not have been easy but it was the right choice for both of you. You couldn\u2019t give each other what you needed but I think at least giving it a shot was the smart thing to do. ",
            "This relationship is simply a mismatch. There\u2019s no right or wrong here: you want different things. Even though it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s better to figure this out now and end it than to move forward.  And there\u2019s no need to castigate either person. ",
            "Glad it worked out as well about as well as it could have. There are plenty of dudes out there who will support your career and respect your time :)",
            "My husband went through a period of wanting another baby when I was accepted to grad school. Took some conversations to work through it. It is too bad that you had to break up with your boyfriend but it sounds like it was a bad fit, and it does not sound like there was a conversation to be had, he was not going to work on changing or improving. ",
            "I am a bit late to this post, but maybe you'll read this OP. I am a medical student, so I can totally relate to the amount of the workload and the overall stress. I have a boyfriend who has been with me throughout the entire studies (5 years as of now) and I can say this is possible only with a person, that is 100% independent and not clingy. I think you did the right thing. Don't worry about dating now, just focus on the school as it is your top priority and sooner or later you'll come across a more mature person. Good luck with your studies! ",
            "Girl, don\u2019t worry. Everything will be fine.\n\nI dumped my high school boyfriend of 5.5 years my second semester of law school. He was verbally and emotionally abusive and had been insecure (proud of me in his own way, but insecure nonetheless) for our entire relationship that I was motivated and successful in school and that I graduated college and enrolled in law school. \n\nI took the rest of my second semester to not date (messaged guys on Tinder for funsies lol), went and studied abroad through my law school, casually dated someone when I came home for a few months.\n\nI said I\u2019d NEVER date someone from law school \u2014 well, here I am, 3 years later, living with the love of my life \u2014 who I met in law school! I know it\u2019s hard to think about someone new right now (or maybe you\u2019re like I was and you were so fed up you\u2019re totally thinking of finding someone new, lol) \u2014 but in law school, you will find a smart, motivated guy with similar values to you and who will be able to commiserate with the absolute hell you are currently enduring. I met my boyfriend during pre-session before 2L Fall. By end of the semester, we were dating. Our last semester of law school, we studied abroad together.\n\nYou are sad now of course but you have SO MUCH BETTER waiting for you. Your life is gonna be great, and you\u2019re gonna find someone who puts your needs first and who is gonna be perfect for you.\n\nBest of luck in law school \u2014 it sucks but you\u2019ll be fine. Try not to stress TOO much. Start outlining early and take practice tests with a dean who can review the format of your answers if you can. Much love!",
            "> His wants had nothing to do with what was best for me, or would make me happiest.\n\nWell, you asked him what **he** wanted.\n\nWhile I totally understand your point, and in practice you may have done the best thing, you still have kind of a self entitled attitude.",

            "I just read both posts.. I honestly think you\u2019re very selfish. Not because you want an education but from reading post one, you clearly don\u2019t /didn\u2019t love and want to be with him anymore. You were forcing him to leave you alone so you can do what you want, rather then just ending the relationship.  Maybe this is just my opinion, but I think you should have broken up with him before law school and had been more honest with yourself. ",
            "You made the right decision. He would have just dragged you down.",
            "I understand the struggle, I was working two jobs on top of going to school and my ex had the balls to say I wasn't spending time with him. I told him fine I'm moving out and he changed his tune but the marriage fell apart a year later  ",
            "Probably the right decision but what\u2019s up with everyone resorting to \u201cbreak up now\u201d for this? I mean come on. I posted on here a while back and every single response I got was just to end it. I ended up just talking it out with my so and things are fine. ",

            "You're making the right decision. There's no guarantee it would work out if you stayed and no guarantee it would fall apart if you left. \n\nI went away to school for 4 years and stayed with my girlfriend in a long distance relationship and a few months after I came back we broke up. \n\nLife happens and you gotta be sure that you have put yourself in the best position for when the worst happens. ",
            "Hey OP! :) I also just started my 1L year in law school, and strangely enough I just finished my second week also (wouldn't it be funny if we went to the same law school lol). I just want to let you know I completely feel for you. I'm single, haven't been going out, and I'm still honestly swamped with work and readings. I know it's really hard, but please keep your head up. \n\nI've heard that it's pretty hard for relationships to be maintained during law school, and honestly, it seems like your now ex would not have been able to handle the rest of 1L very well (especially during finals week, can you imagine?). Don't listen to these other obviously non-law school people (no offense, and I'm not trying to sound pretentious or humble-braggy, but I really just don't think they understand). You're NOT selfish for breaking up with him or for making law school your #1 priority. \n\nAnyways, just wishing you best of luck! I know you're gonna kill it during 1L! Please enjoy Labor Day, if you have that off! :)",

It makes me sad, because I really like him. I could see us being great partners. But he doesn't want to try. He's just not into me, I guess. ",
