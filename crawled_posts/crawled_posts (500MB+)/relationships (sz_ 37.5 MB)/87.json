        "selftext": "Link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3styvp/i_24m_addressed_my_ceo_60sm_informally_and_was/\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone who took the time to reply to my original post! The general consensus was that I had handled the situation well, or at least as best as I could have, given my situation and experience. Even those of you who thought I'd screwed up said so in a way that was sensitive and respectful. So thank yous all around!\n\nNow, on to the update!\n\nI mentioned in my original post that I had only sent one of these notifications to our CEO once before, and no one had said anything then. **When he replied to me that time, it was only one word: *\"Thanks.\"* No salutation, no signature. Just that one word.** Understandable, he's a busy man. But this is very important for understanding what happened this time.\n\nI got into work this morning and opening my email. Among my various other usual emails, I saw that the CEO had responded to my original notification email at about 7:30 pm last night (a Saturday!) He had kept intact the original list of people to be notified, so everyone who had seen my original message also saw his reply to me, including Janice. This time, it was three words, but I could feel the deliberateness of every one.\n\n*musicmage4114,*\n\n*Thanks.*\n\n*Stanley*\n\nSo yeah, I think it's pretty clear where he stands on this whole business. I feel a million times better, since the CEO is clearly a *very* classy guy. My boss also saw his response and also told me that I'd done everything right, and not to worry about it.\n\nSo everything worked out okay! Thanks again to everyone who helped me stop freaking out!\n\nTL;DR: CEO sent a three-word email that cleared up the whole situation and put the nosy executive in her place. :)",

            "I worked for a company where this dofus named Bill was always running around in brilliantly color Cosby sweaters and tripping over things and making dorky jokes. I liked him and would joke with him very often. There was a long hallway in our office with a door at the end. I am exiting said hallway one day with Bill close behind and hold the door for him while sorting mail, I look up and notice he's stopped to talk to someone. \"Bill! It's not my job to hold the door for you!\" He laughs and jokingly speeds through the door. \n\nI go to my quadrant of the office and my boss is on me lightening quick. \"Why were you yelling at Bill?!\" Uhhhhhhh... \"You can't talk to the CEO like that!!\" Whoops. So I chill out on Bill and politely wave at him but no more dirty jokes or high-gives or asking him for money for the soda machine.\n\nA week later he asks me why I've stopped joking with him and I'm like \"You're the CEO and Karen said I can't talk to you like that\" Bill says, \"Oh screw Karen, she's not funny at all\" and that was that.

You are putting up a charade with PC terms, and communication that is almost *saccharine*. Give it to me straight---we're here to do business, we're not here to coddle people and their delicate sensibilities.

I answered to no one but the CEO. Fact is, petty office squabbles pissed me off more than anything else (and my CEO told me the same thing).\n\nSo with Janice starting shit for something that clearly has zero bearing on the bigger picture (profitable operation), she just got on the CEO's not-bad-but-not-so-good side. You, on the other hand, just got on Janice's shitlist, and you'll more than likely encounter petty passive aggressive bullshit with her for the rest of your time there.\n\nFrankly, I wish people would just focus on what's actually important instead of office politics.

            "My first duty station was a headquarters unit in the Pacific, working directly for a Marine Colonel (O-6) who worked directly for the Lieutenant General (3 star, O-9) in charge of the Marine Corps operations in the theater. I was a Lance Corporal (E-3) at the time. In the office where my desk was, my boss (Staff Sergeant, E-6) sat about 2 feet behind me and was privy to every conversation I had.\n\nOne day, after being there for a few months, the Colonel came over to my desk and was asking me some questions about a work thing that I was doing for him. I remained seated while talking to him. For those of you not in the military, that's a massively disrespectful thing UNLESS the person you're speaking with has given you permission to stay seated.\n\nSo we finished our conversation and he left with a hearty \"Thanks, Lance Corporal!\" to which I replied with an equally hearty and warm \"No problem sir, anything I can do to help.\" My boss even commented on how well the conversation went down.\n\nWell not 20 seconds later a new guy (Gunnery Sergeant, E-7) came over and decided to school me on proper etiquette when talking with officers. So to avoid anymore perceived disrespect I stood (srsly, at my desk) and listened to him lecture for a minute or so until my boss finally turned around from her desk and said, rather curtly, \"The Colonel cleared him day 1, Gunny. Anything else we can do for you? LCpl Trees is pretty busy right now.\"\n\n**Moral of the story**: 9/10 people who correct you on stupid shit like titles and how to address a superior are either dicks, don't know what the hell they're talking about, or more likely a combination of both. Err on the side of caution, but let the person you're talking to decide how they should be addressed. Not a 3rd party.\n\nYou did the right thing initially based on how you were trained and given that previous interactions didn't cause any issues. Janice is just a nosy bitch.",

It was bad because in the process of apologising, you name-checked and therefore angered Janice, and it would be extremely clear to the CEO that Janice would feel this way and that you did it on purpose. This sort of in-fighting is bad in an organisation, and as a junior person, you're in no position to do it. You also skipped hierarchy in doing this and by not pursuing it via your line manager, and this sort of insubordination just isn't acceptable. This is bad office politics.

I highly suggest you remember this-- you were told when you meet him, but have never met him so Janice is correct in her saying he extends the invitation.

        "selftext": "ORIGINAL: [reddit!]https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4u46o4/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_26m_of_2_years_hes/\n\nMy first post didn't get a whole lot of attention, but I figured I'd update anyway, as it's a happy one.\n\nThe TL;DR of my last post was that, after recently moving cities and experiencing a lifestyle change (boyfriend started working 80-100 hours/week) I was feeling stressed out and drained from my job, which involves animal research, and thought that getting a pet would really help me (as it has in the past). Since we really don't have time for a dog, I wanted to get a cat, and while he initially agreed to it, my boyfriend sat me down 8 months ago and reiterated that he wasn't super into cats and that since I seemed to be adapting well if I would hold off on getting one. Since then, my mental health has gone down a little and I wanted advice on how to talk to him about it.\n\nFirstly, I got a couple of PMs and comments telling me that my boyfriend doesn't have to work that much and that I shouldn't be okay with it. This is a little naive, people. Everyone that has his position works as much as he does and he loves his job, so he needs to put up with the hours for about 5 years until he's moved up the chain of command. So that's not really up for discussion and never has been. He loves his job and feels fulfilled at work, which is something I want for him.\n\n\nONTO THE UPDATE...\n\n\nI got a lot (a looot) of comments that sort of told me off for wanting to make a plea for a pet that my boyfriend wasn't on board with so I initially decided not to broach the topic and keep it to myself. \n\nHowever, I guess I was closer to my breaking point than I realized because the next night when he got in at midnight, after having a long and stressful day that had put me in a bad headspace for the evening (even after going for a 5k run and lifting some weights) I just sort of had a breakdown in his arms. He was flabbergasted and worried and asked me what was wrong.\n\nI sort of... snotted, hiccoughed, and cried as I told him that I felt really lonely and was upset that he'd asked me to hold off on the cat, that I was very sad that I interacted only with animals that hate me and that I can't get attached to all day, and that my colleagues find that their pets ground them; that I couldn't continue coming home to an empty house and that pets were really important to me.\n\nHe was very shocked to hear all of this, stroked my hair for a while, made me tea, ran me a bath, and said we'd have a serious talk when I got back from my conference (monday & tuesday). I was a little put off by the fact that he wasn't talking about it right away (but understanding because by the time we got to bed it was probably 2am).\n\nI was at my conference until last night, but when I got in at around 8PM, I was surprised that our condo door was open--my boyfriend was home (never happens)! I was even more surprised when he came to the door, grinning, with a big Maine Coon cat in his arms that I'm very familiar with--my childhood kitty that lives with my parents. \n\nWell, I was pretty much a mess after that, happy and sobbing all over Snuffles (Snuffles rather frantically twisting his body in 1000 bizarre ways trying to get away and thereby avoid salty tears and snot), and my boyfriend explained: we were \"borrowing\" Snuffles for the next 7 weeks from my parents. He then said with an even bigger grin that he was serving as my cat \"in the interim of waiting for your new Abyssinian kitten to age to 10 weeks, at which point we'll give Snuffles back and bring in the kitten.\"\n\nMy heart was so full. I was surprised that he remembered my brief mention that I thought that an Abyssinian would be a good breed fit for us (not super vocal, very friendly, short hair, indoor cat). I definitely never expected him to pay for the cat or anything, but he has put a deposit down and I will go pick a kitten from the breeder's litter in the next couple of weeks!!\n\nI asked him what had made him change his mind the full 180 degrees and he just sort of explained that he was only ever \"sort of\" against the cat and thought I had been doing just fine mentally, so I didn't need one, and just figured we'd get a dog once we'd moved out of the city centre in 5 years or so, once both of us have reduced our hours.\n\nHe also is still a little bit concerned that a cat isn't going to be a fix-all, so I made an appointment with a psychologist I used to see and will be driving to my hometown next week for a \"check in\" with her. \n\nI thought he didn't want a cat because his dad thinks they're an \"unmanly\" pet, so I asked him as much, and he rolled his eyes and said \"Look, the CEO of Snapchat can't even find a hotter partner than I can and he definitely isn't dating someone that is getting a PhD. There's literally nothing in the world that is a threat to my manliness\" \n\nAlso, just like I thought (because I know my boyfriend well, not just a \"magical rationalization\" I \"made up just because [I] want a cat\"), this morning I woke up to my boyfriend spooning Snuffles instead of me; he'll be fine having a cat. \n\n\n\n**tl;dr**: we good, he wasn't actually really against getting a cat, so we're getting a kitten, and in the meantime I get to hang out with my old buddy.",

I worked in a lab animal program at a major university for a while, and never found myself feeling \"bad\" for the animals, disliked by them, etc. I ended up leaving, though, because I found the job too monotonous and not engaging enough. I went to grad school, and now I have my dream job working as an Aquarist (I've always liked fish/sea creatures more than other animals). I'm 29.\n\n\nIs there any chance you can find a more fulfilling and less draining career path? Or is animal research just part of grad school?

I'm just asking that you pleaseplease strongly consider getting two kittens instead of one. Why? You guys both have incredibly full schedules; sometimes you travel. The kitten will be bored and lonely while alone. Only cats tend to get obese and depressed. Two kittens are less work than one, as they play with each other and keep each other company, and as adults they are loving companions. Two cats will still love you as much or more, as they won't be depressed.  (I have done kitten rescue work for 11 years and we always try to get kittens placed in pairs).\n\nHappy for you, again!

I would not stress about this potential future decision and do not let the adamant views that it's the best decision to make stress you out anymore. Cats are very independent animals, and some cats prefer being alone and the only cat in the house. Cats can become very territorial and mark their territory, and trust me when I say the result of this is the worst smell imaginable. It can also be highly stressful to see them not get along.\n\nSo get your one kitty now and if you decide to get a 2nd cat in the future, get one after you consider all the pros and cons :) \n\nThat being said, adopting two kittens at the same time is generally a good way to avoid any problems. So if this is an option, feel free to go for it! \n\nBefore anyone downvotes me because they disagree with what I have to say, I have had eight cats in my lifetime. I have had cats that were the only cat in the household and I have had as much as three cats at a time and this is my experience with the matter. \n",

I have not been able to respond to everyone, but please be assured that I have read every one of your comments, and I appreciate them all. Everyone is doing well on our end, and while the pain is still immense, sharing memories ad photos with his friends has helped a lot. I'm so proud of him and everything he did in his short time with us.\n\nOriginal Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5cuvee/i_59_m_recently_lost_my_son_26_and_dont_know_how/\n\n \nI'd like to thank everyone who responded to my first thread. Your words were so kind and helped me out with a difficult situation. I'd also like to offer an apology, as I feel I misstated some things in my original post. My difficulty was not from finding out what kind of person my son was just before his death. Additionally, I got lots of posts giving advice to the likes of \"I would let them speak,\" which baffled me slightly, as I hadn't thought that that's what I was asking. I had never considered keeping them out of the funeral and letting them speak their words, however when I re-read my original post, I can see how I didn't make it clear that I was already working with them on delivering their speeches. For this lack of clarity, I sincerely apologize. However, I read all of the comments in full, and I greatly appreciate everyone's input.\n\nTo update, the funeral took place yesterday was was, perhaps fittingly, a weirdly wonderful affair. My wife his, younger sister and I spoke, as did 4 of his friends. We decided to hold the funeral in his adopted city rather than here for 2 reasons: First was because we all know he loved that city so much, and Second was to make it easier for his friends to attend. (I should state, pretty much everyone in our hometown was in a position to travel, but his friends aren't, as they are students and it's midterm season for them.) Although people had reached out to me, I was stunned by turnout. I didn't get a proper headcount, but the room that I though was relatively large was down to standing room only.\n\n\nThe family's speeches and 3 of his friends were relatively normal for a funeral, and recounted fond memories of his life and personality. The 4th friend to speak was not.\n\nQuite simply, he wanted to roast my son, namely in the style of a comedy central roast. When he pitched the idea to me, I was a little hesitant, but I decided to give him his moment. Part of it was one of the few aspects of my son that remained constant throughout his life: he hated tradition for tradition's sake. He was always someone who would question (sometimes at unfortunately inappropriate times) why everything is the way it is. Think along the lines of \"Why is the bride supposed to wear white?\" while acutaly at a wedding. A second part of my decision to allow it was because a common theme I found out through his friends was that he was quite a joker himself towards the end, and would do anything for a laugh, going as far as making himself the butt of the joke just to get a positive reaction from them. Finally, I agreed because he was completely upfront with me about what he wanted to say (he handed me his script) and said that if I was uncomfortable with it or the idea, that he would still be honoured if he could give a more traditional speech. \n\nThis led me to the one difficult in the funeral, namely, where do I put this joker? Do I do it at the beginning to set a tone, or at the end to leave on a high? I discussed with my wife and his friend, and we agreed on a compromise, where he would give a short talk at the beginning to set the mood that wouldn't be all sad, and then he delivered his main set at the end, so we could all leave without tears in our eyes.\n\nSo, as weird as it might sound, I think we all had fun at the funeral, and I was incredibly touched to have met so many of his friends. While I still sort of feel that I' mourning 2 people, I was so proud that my son broke out of his shell when he left. I know his friends are wonderful people, and I can only imagine how happy my son was up to the end. \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: The funeral went well, and I was touched by the support his friends showed.",

            "One great sign of a wonderful person is how many people are smiling while talking at the funeral and calling hours. My grandpa died when I was five and my memory of it is laughing while someone I don't think I ever saw again bounced me on their leg. \n\nIt's fucking awful that you have lost your son so early but he sounds like he made a lot of people smile during his short life. In your original post you sounded out of sorts about not knowing the man he grew into. This is a pretty common part of growing up and it sounds like he was in the weird transition stage between 'college kid' and 'grown man'. It's not out of the ordinary for you to lose touch in that period while he finds himself. I know I act very different with people I made friends with as adults versus the people I knew while I was young and awkward. It doesn't mean that he didn't feel comfortable being his 'new self' around you, it just means you were robbed of the opportunity to get to know each other on even footing as independent adults. I am so sorry that you didn't get to know him as the people his friends knew- I hope they shared as much as they could with you about the man they loved.\n\nIt was incredibly generous of you to hold a service in the city for their benefit.

I am so comforted by the idea of a room of people genuinely just appreciating and accepting a loved one who has passed, honoring them in such a sweet and funny way, while really celebrating the person for who they were. Kudos to you for working through your grief and getting the service together. Also, for doing it in his adopted city so that his friends could pay their respects. That was incredibly thoughtful and selfless of you and your wife, and while I am heartbroken for your loss I am so touched that you let your parental selflessness extend to the funeral arrangements. \n\nI'm sure the grieving process is only beginning, but please know there is a whole community here with open arms if you need a kind word.

            "My little brother died last year. He was killed by a bear at 27 years old. It was tragic and confusing and absolutely devastating. My mom is still not back to acting like herself. \n\nThe week following his death we heard stories from people who knew him later in his short life that sounded nothing like the kid we knew! We learned so much good and bad things about him. He had a whole other side that we never saw but man did we appreciate knowing that now. He was so complex and grew up to be an amazing man. \n\nA year and a half after his death, now that I've experienced the loss of a few friends and experienced their funerals etc. when I look back at the worst week of my life and at my brother's memorial I can honestly say... it was fun. \n\nI wrote and delivered his eulogy and then opened the floor to whoever wanted to speak. I made the entire room laugh throughout my speech. I made fun of my brother for allowing me & our other sister dress him up like a girl; gave him hell for \"choosing\" such a ridiculous way to die and poked fun at his mumbled speech and ridiculously smelly feet. \n\nThe crowd was shocked at first but completely loved it! My brother was a ridiculous person. He was goofy and inappropriate. He drank too much and made friends with anyone who would listen. He bucked tradition and loved making people laugh. The mood in the room changed drastically after that. People came up to tell stories about my brother and kept the room giggling. It was up beat and fun. It was an excellent representation of how my brother would have wanted people to say goodbye: with tears in their eyes but smiles on their faces. \n\nFunerals are not for the dead, they're for the living. If there is any way to make them less sad, less heart breaking then I say do it. \n\nYour son sounds like a very cool person. I'm sorry for your loss. ",

My wife and I were high school sweethearts and got married very young. We went to the same college and got married when we were both 19 year old sophomores. I love her and we definitely made the right decision, and I would do it all over again exactly the same way with no hesitation except for one thing-the ring that I picked.\n\nNow when I was a teen I was definitely a douche. I'm talking affliction tees, hair gel, recreational MMA, macho bs. We picked out our rings together, and of course I wanted my ring to look cool. My wife, who is brilliant and always has been, chose a classy and timeless style for hers, and I did not.\n\nFriends, my ring is large, clunky, mostly black, and has a cringy design on it in silver along with a band of lab created fire opal inlay. I thought it was so badass at the time, and could not understand what my dad was laughing about when he first saw it. Well I sure get it now. \n\nI've matured a TON in the last ten years and have slowly come to hate it. I am very self conscious of it at my professional office job, and sometimes even take it off if I have important meetings with clients. I feel horribly guilty every time. \n\nI've gently broached the topic of maybe getting a ring that looks more professional, but my wife has pushed back, saying that we picked our rings together and have had them for ten years and that's really special to her. I absolutely do not want to hurt her feelings. How can I approach this in a way that would make it easier for her to accept, short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)?\n\nTLDR: I was an idiot teenager when I got married, picked out an Ed Hardy level wedding ring, need to replace it without hurting my wife's feelings.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the great advice! I have a lot to consider, but I have a lot of new ideas now. I don't want to post a pic of my ring because I don't want to be able to be identified from this post, but you can find pics of similar rings by googling the descriptors I used, like some people in the comments have pointed out.

            "I'm married.... And I personally have 4 wedding rings. I still have the originals, but I also have a copper-colored silicone one for hiking and camping, tiny thin one(and two backups) for wearing to work at my very hands-centric job, and another, actual copper ring just because it appeals to me. My husband has multiple silicone ones and a copper to match mine, as well as his original which he now considers his \"fancy\" ring. I mean, yes, the ring is a symbol and whatnot, I get that, but in the end, it's just jewelry. My husband and I are so married it probably wafts off of us like a stench, lol. I'm sure you guys are the same way. Approach it with love and honesty and a little bit of bald-faced flattery. \"Honey, you were more mature than me when we picked out these rings and yours is classic and elegant. Now that I've grown up a bit myself I'd like to have a ring that reflects that. I'm so proud to be married to you, but I'd like to be proud of my ring, too.\"",
            "I was this wife. My husband wanted to get another ring (still likes his original one, just wanted options) and I was totally against it. I was very sentimental and didn\u2019t even like the idea of EVER taking my wedding band off my finger.\n\nHe bought himself a silicone ring and asked me to put it on him. When I did, he told me how much he loves me and that our marriage is about our love and not our rings. That got it through my head and then I was fine with it...and then I got a second ring too. :)",
            "Due to the nature of my job, I have a ring I wear to work and then I have a ring I wear off the clock.\n\nMaybe you could just get a simple ring for professional wear and use the other one when you're home. I know your goal is to get a replacement ring, but sometimes we take a hit to make our SOs happy...",
            "Can you frame it as wanting to buy both of you a new set of rings for your tenth anniversary? Not quite as costly as a vow renewal and I know couples who have done this.",
            "Talk it out with her, but make sure you don't use words like \"professional\" because that word just sounds cold and passionless. Explain to her that you've grown up a lot and you want a new ring to symbolize your growth and maturity as an individual and together as a couple. Maybe you could frame it as a 10th-anniversary thing (which is already one hell of an achievement, especially getting married so young) so she can have a genuine, sentimental attachment to it. It's cheaper than a vow renewal and just as sentimental/romantic.",

            "> short of doing a full-on vow renewal with new rings (suggested by my best friend; is the nuclear option due to cost)\n\nTBH I agree with your friend, a vow renewal would be ideal. It doesn't have to be expensive or the \"nuclear option\" by any means, it can be small and intimate, private and low-cost. There's so much more flexibility with a renewal, it doesn't have to be like a second wedding. \n\nI think it would be a good idea to add in a small ceremony of removing the old ring or having it made into a keepsake such as a necklace or placed in a display case to commemorate the past, present and future together. Don't deny your past, embrace the growth you have made both as individual and as a couple.",

Does your ring fit exactly the same as it did 10 years ago? Would a different size be more comfortable? Considering yours is not resizeable maybe she could compromise about this. \n\nAnother time he switched to the silicone rings because they were more comfortable and safer when he was active, like at work and the gym. He wears a solid black one and it looks classier than I expected, in a casual way. They protect from degloving injuries which are surprisingly common. He still wears his regular ring on dates and stuff. \n\nHe also lost one swimming and we had to replace it. Probably dont do that. ",

I'm super attached to my original rings.

I mean cmon you cannot leave us hanging after that description. \n\nOn a serious note, the only way to navigate this situation is to have an open and honest conversation with her before purchasing a new one. Tell her the real reason why you hate it so much. Professionalism is a part of it, sure, but it sounds like you\u2019ve grown way past the person you used to be and this piece of jewelry doesn\u2019t represent who you are currently. It doesn\u2019t represent who you are in life, not just the office. \n\nThen, ask her about her hesitations. If your current ring has sentimental value for her, then you can still keep it. Maybe you can put it in a box or turn it into a necklace or something else. Maybe it can make up a part of a new ring. \n\nIf you\u2019re religious and \u201cblessing of the rings\u201d and the specific ring used in your marriage ceremony is important to her, then perhaps you can have your religious leader perform another ceremony on whatever new ring you get. It doesn\u2019t have to be a whole entire affair. It could just be the two of you and a witness. \n\n\nYou need to explain to her that what you wear on your hand is important to you and it needs to be something that you don\u2019t despise. It isn\u2019t fair for you to be forced to wear something you hate. I have a feeling if you have a serious and open discussion, you will find common ground. Good luck! ",

            "When I went ring shopping, I learnt there's a whole industry for weddingring upgrades and add-ons. It's not so uncommon to change wedding rings. When getting our rings my husband and I discussed what we would do if one of us lost their ring (it happens).\n\nA wedding ring is an important symbolic item, but that means it should add to your life. (My husband and I didn't want to fret about potentially losing a ring, so we agreed on using the remaining ring to make new ones, meaning both get new ones. Now we happily wear our rings without worrying about losing our rings.)\n\nYour wife is invalidating your feelings about your ring. She has feelings about the ring being good enough then, so it's good enough now and a new ring won't be the same as that specific ring you used for your wedding vows. Her feelings are valid too, but they do conflict with yours. Can you have a conversation without the goal being making decisions? A talk where both can say how you feel without being agreed with (you can validate someone's feelings without agreeing with their suggestion) and without one of you being righter than the other. It's easier to listen when you don't feel like you have to \"win\" to be heard.\n\nGetting new or another ring to celebrate an anniversary is a thing too. Combine it with vow renewals and you create new symbolism with the new rings. It does cost some, but it doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Your marriage is not worth more the more expensive a new set of rings is. It's worth more when you can work out this issue. Your feelings of discomfort matter too and communication is important within a marriage.",

Since then you made so many memories together and you as a person has grown so much that you are not that person anymore who would choose again that ring. You\u2019ve become a better person that the person 10 years ago (I\u2019m sure also thanks to her) and you want to see this progress on your finger to remind you how far you\u2019ve come.",

So just know that this is not a crazy idea. \n\n\nSecondly, just because you get a different ring doesn\u2019t mean you are tossing out the old one. You still have it. \n\n\nFor example, I have two wedding rings. One is my proper diamond engagement ring and band. The band though is too small to wear alone and I don\u2019t like wearing a crazy bling ring everyday. So for daily wear I have a cheap, plain titanium band. Doesn\u2019t make my \u201creal\u201d set any less meaningful or special, doesn\u2019t mean I love my husband any less or value our marriage any less. It just means for me and my personal style, most days I dress down and occasionally like to pull out the stops. \n\n\nI tell you all this so you have some ideas how to frame it to your wife. Just as the two of you grow and change together, it\u2019s ok for your ring to grow and change. ",

Yall can get a keepsake box filled with pictures of you both from the past ten years, maybe movie tickets from a date you went on, and put your old rings in there on a chain. Then you can both go back to a jeweler and pick out another set of rings and recreate you guys getting married 10 years ago. \nI've known quite a few couples who have a couple sets of wedding rings that they've gotten throughout the years so retiring the old set for a new set isn't that weird. Then, say 10, 15 years down the line, yall can renew vows again and get another set of rings. ",

            "Can you have a metal smith reuse the material of the ring to make a new design?  Every couple decades of marriage, my grandmother would have her wedding ring modified.  I understand the sentimentality of keeping your original ring, but changing it shows that times change and you have matured and changed.  BTW, this is why I always recommend a simple band... We got ours made out of titanium by a dude in his garage.  It is the thinnest, lightest band I've seen and only cost us $70...we actually made a profit on our marriage.",

            "In addition to what everyone else was saying I have a silly (hopefully good) idea:\n\nWhat if you did a silly \"re-marrying\" of her? \n\nNot that you guys ever fell apart or anything ever went wrong. \n\nBut has there been something you two always wanted to do, and you could somehow cheesily communicate to her you want a new ring, but you understand that to get a new ring you have to re-marry her, so you can romantically ask her again to marry you and have a silly little adventure? \n\nThis way she can laugh and enjoy the whole process of it, you two bond a bit, and then finally you get a new ring without resistance. \n\nJust an idea :) ",

I'd also look at doing something special with the first rings. I'd assure her that you want them commerated, not just thrown away or shoved somewhere in a box.

Be sure and tell your wife what you said here, that she was brilliant, classy and always had great taste, and you wish you had also had those qualities back then. I'm sure she would rather you had a ring you could feel comfortable in, than to be taking it off at work, yikes! Be sure to bring this up to her when she is feeling particularly appreciative and happy with you.\n\nPersonally i think a new ring can symbolize your love as well as the original one, but i have an open-minded  creative way of doing things.

I'm a big fan of proposing with a placeholder, and shopping for the ring together - aside from taking the stress off the guy, it means you can establish a budget, find a shop, and work with a professional to figure out what will work within personal style and budget.  (Yes, I chose my ring with my husband.  I'll detail the story if you want it.)\n\nSo what you need to stress to your wife is that you still love her just as much - if not more - than the day you chose the rings.  But 19 year old you is different than 29 year old you.  So what you want is a ring you never want to take off to prove that to her - and right now, the ring your 19 year old self chose doesn't match that depth of emotion.  You are proud as hell that she's your wife, but you're not proud of the symbol that represents that.  You want something as timeless as your love for her.\n\nThen suggest she comes out with you as you shop again so you can share that experience, and ask if she would like a 10 year anniversary piece for herself - I'd suggest a fire-opal pendant to match the fire-opal in your original ring.

It also can\u2019t be resized, because it can\u2019t be cut. A 24 year old\u2019s hands get quite a bit larger over 15 years of construction work. We still have the original ring in our jewelry box.\n\n2. After about 2 years, because the black was wearing off, we got my husband a duplicate ring. Then he had a \u201cwork ring\u201d and a \u201cnice ring.\u201d We had to get a bigger size, and so he can still wear this one outside of work. \n\n3. We buy black silicone rings with a green line in the middle. These are his work rings. He\u2019s had a couple of close calls getting his real ring caught on things, so the silicone ring is a safety thing. He\u2019s ripped 3 of them off his hand already. They are cheap and prevent serious career ending injuries. \n\n\nSOLUTION: Tell your wife you need a \u201cwork ring\u201d and continue to wear your old ring as your \u201chome ring.\u201d \n\nLots of people do this.\n\nI\u2019m a nurse, and most women wear only a band at work because stones will tear gloves or scratch patients. Some of them don\u2019t want it to get lost while washing their hands. I knew one nurse whose diamond went down the sink drain on the 6th floor of the hospital, which went straight down to the sewer. My diamond was set by a jeweller whose mom was a nurse, so he rounded the prongs smooth so they wouldn\u2019t tear gloves :). Lots of construction guys won\u2019t wear rings because of the risk, and I know more than one who is missing his ring finger (look up ring degloving).\n\nAs long as you keep the original ring, I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable to have 2 rings for 2 settings. You wear different clothes at work and home, so this is the same thing.",
            "You\u2019re the one who has to wear it every day of your life... you should like your ring. If the budget were the issue then I\u2019d understand her resistance, but as long as your ring is a reasonable price and won\u2019t strain you financially than I don\u2019t see why it should be her decision at all. You can keep the old ring for sentimental purposes, but no need to wear it every day. Put it in a necklace and let her wear it if she\u2019d like (and it sounds like she wouldn\u2019t), while you get a more professional ring and wear that. It\u2019s just a symbol of love anyway\u2014as long as you both love each other then that\u2019s the only sentimentality that matters. ",

            "Why not modify it? It would still be the same ring, just looks different. Tell her it represents a phase in your life that you are not the person you were before, at least in outlook of life but essentially still the same person, just like the ring.",

            "Why not get a more timeless style for your fingers, but wear the old ring on a chain around your neck? That way you can tuck it in out of sight if you're in a professional setting, but you'll always have it with you?",
            "My suggestion would be to ask if she would mind if you could either have it recast to look more professional, but it'd still be the same ring. Or if you could get a new ring and add part of the old to it so that part of the ring is still there.\n\nAlso, rings wear down over the years. My grandparents had 3 sets of rings because of how long they were married (60 years). Their rings changed, but their love was always constant. ",

At the same time get a thin chain for your current ring and wear it inside your shirt.  I really think if you explain your reasoning thoughtfully she will agree.   I'm guessing she doesn't know you periodically take the ring off briefly at work.   I think sharing the reason you do this will help sway her.   I have been married a long time and I wouldn't be upset if my husband wanted a different style but it would bother me if he didn't want to wear a ring. \n\nThe description of your ring gave me a smile!

Since then, I can distinctly remember her wearing three different rings. She picked out two (the third was her engagement ring; it was not being worn at the time she lost the wedding band), but dad definitely had an opinion and was involved in the process. (Dad, on the other hand, has never replaced his, so far as I know, because he only wears it for special occasions. He's a mechanic and things on hands or around necks is not the best life choices). \n\nMy point is that replacing the band isn't uncommon and while the initial wedding band has deep sentimental value, there are absolutely reasons to replace. Be honest with your wife, but keep it positive and focus on wanting to reflect the new depth and intimacy if your relationship as it has matured. Offer her the option of including part of the original band in the new one: say a silver band with black inlay? ",

It's the love you share and the vows you made.   \n\n\nAlternatively reaffirm your vows and both of you get new rings to symbolize the 10 years you've spent together. Get family and friends together, have a nice party and at the hight of that party both of you either say new vows or repeat the vows you said at your wedding all those years ago.   \n\n\nThe first option in my opinion shows that you care enough to talk to her about your feelings and how you want to better represent something thats so important to you.

It may help if you found a ring that had similar elements (metals, appearance, etc) ready to go, to show her you had been doing serious thought.\n\nOtherwise, I would remind her it's not the ring that's important, it's what the ring symbolizes- That you love her and want to be with her forever. I think acknowledging her feelings will be key here - that you understand the sentimentality of having the same rings you picked when you got married. However, you also don't want to be embarrassed by your ring because you love her and are proud to be married to her. It's just that your sense of style was terrible as a teen, and as you've matured, you want your style to also be more mature. Perhaps you could even suggest the idea of having *her* pick out your ring for you, because she clearly has good taste and it would mean a lot to have something so personal picked for you by your wife. Good luck OP! ",
            "So this is what I did with mine. I started to get eczema bad on my hand, so I had to stop wearing it before hand anyway. Not even a month into marriage the diamond piece fell out. It was a $400 ring, I went to the jeweler whom I bought it from and they said I should have gotten a warranty and they couldn't do anything. Don't go to Kay.\n\nAnyway, I did get it fixed somewhere else for $20 but was weary of wearing it anywhere else. My solution, wear it on date nights but for casual use and to work wear a simple one, you can get really cheap tungsten carbide ones, which was mine, on Amazon for like $25. There are great looking ones on there, and my wife liked the idea. Another idea is putting it on a chain as a necklace and wearing it under your shirt, with a replacement on your finger.",

            "Explain it to her the same way you did her (or show her this post). Let her help you pick out your new ring and if the one you have now means so much to her, buy a chain and let her wear it around her neck.  I know the rings you get married it are important and meaningful, but that is not what makes a marriage. My husband lost his wedding band less then 2 years after we got married because is slipped off his finger in the cold. It was his grandfathers ring that he was married with and it was engraved with his name and the date they were married. We were heartbroken but we bought another one I said a few words to him and put it on his finger ( we never told his family what happened). We are coming up in our 21st anniversary.  ",

Exchange rings at your dinner party in front of your closest friends and family. ",

You acted in a wise way that will nurture and honor you in the future.\n\nAlso, I think you should really look into \"attachment theory,\" since it sounds like you have severe issues with attachment. You seem to have some combination of attachment anxiety (you feel you *must* be in a relationship, even with a terrible partner) and attachment avoidance (you're terrified of too much intimacy and run away from partners who would *actually* be loving and caring toward you). These issues often, though not always, go back to traumatic experiences with family and partners in childhood and early adulthood and can keep anyone from a satisfying and loving romantic relationship.\n\nBesides seeking therapy with a counselor who is trained to deal with attachment issues, I also suggest you pick up some books on attachment theory. Here's a good starting reading-list:\n\n1. Attached, by Amir Levine\n2. Wired for Love, by Stan Tatkin\n3, Insecure in Love, by Leslie Becker-Phelps\n\nGood luck and I hope this information helps!",
