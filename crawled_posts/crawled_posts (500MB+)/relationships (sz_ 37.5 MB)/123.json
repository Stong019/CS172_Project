        "selftext": "As the title states, I have this vegan coworker (we'll call her Vegan) who is very active on FB and in the office about being vegan and how cruel farming is and everything.\n\nEach to their own. I don't necessarily disagree with her views on animal cruelty but here's the thing, I'm a hunter. Not a trophy hunter but I do shoot feral pigs, rabbits, ducks (introduced, classified game ducks) and foxes and I fish too.\n\nAll except for the fish are classified as pests, foxes especially kill native wildlife and farm animals and farmers will often put you up on their property for free to hunt them.\n\nI have passed tests here, especially for identification of game ducks vs protected species and practice ethical hunting, i.e. allow the animal to have a fair chase, no dogs or tracking devices, practicing marksmanship and dispatching prey swiftly and humanely and not wasting the meat.\n\nNone of that is obviously good enough for Vegan. When she first came onto the team and told everyone she was vegan, I kept my mouth shut about my hunting. I also think she's really intolerant because she preaches to people about how going vegan will help with their various ailments and always turns up her nose at people heating up meat in microwave. As a result, we've kind of consciously started excluding her when we get up for lunch.\n\nHowever last year I started going hunting more regularly with a work friend from another department whose uncle owns a farm where feral pigs and like are an issue and he often swings by to have a chat about guns/bows and our next trip and she found out I was a hunter. This isn't even at our desks, it's in the kitchen area that has tables and stuff, we sometimes eat our lunches together.\n\nEver since then, every conversation I've had with her, she's referred to hunting and how cruel it is. \n\nOne time, I wore a leather pencil skirt to work and she had a go at me for wearing animal products. She seems to have singled me because of the fact that I go hunting.\n\nMy boss has no spine, I've tried talking to him about this, but she just intimidates him and makes it seem like she's been persecuted and he's back down from that.\n\nShe even tried to get a \"vegan\" shelf in the fridge and tried to rope in some Hindu vegetarian guys to do that but they pointed out that they use milk and cheese and honey in their cooking. They also think she's nuts. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where we go out for drinks on a Friday night at 5 and we never ask her. I don't organize these things, a coworker does but my boss told me, when I brought it up in one on one meeting, that she feels really left out and she seems to think it's my fault because I've been here for longer and I'm somehow poisoning them against her or something.\n\nI have since been conscious of this if anyone starts conversation about Vegan, I just say I don't talk to her unless it's work related and she's more than adequate at her job. It's actually become something of a joke or \"catchphrase\".\n\nI told my boss I don't organize anything except official events and she's always been invited. If she's not invited to informal stuff, that's not even organized by me, then that's not my problem. The coworker that doesn't invite her, she managed to piss him off because he's eaten guinea pig (he's from Peru) and she asked him if he'd eaten any of his other pets. For the record, he never ate a guinea pig that was a pet, it's something they eat in Peru.\n\nWhenever she brings up hunting or anything, I just point blank ask her there was anything work related that she wanted to talk about, and if there wasn't, I would start talking to someone else or just walk off. I have asked her multiple times to keep conversations work related. I never start a conversation with her at all.\n\nMost of the time, she pounces when I'm in the kitchen making tea, getting water or just stretching my legs.\n\nOne time last week, a group of us were talking and she got up join the discussion. A horrible silence fell over the group to the point where I just excused myself and went to me desk and so did a few others.\n\nIt all came to a head in our team meeting today when our boss, usually at the ends asks if there's any positive news or celebrations outside of work people want to share like engagements, marathons, charity appeals etc and Vegan sarcastically asked me how many \"lives I'd taken last weekend\".\n\nI got annoyed and said her constant badgering me about my hobbies and choice to eat meat was discriminatory and bothersome and that unless it was work related, she was not to engage me in conversation otherwise and told our \"scribe\" to put that in the meeting minutes.\n\nShe seemed a bit shocked by that and my boss looked uncomfortable but said fair enough. I thought that was the end of that but the right before our boss went to close the meeting, 2 other coworkers also put their hands up and asked Vegan to only engage them in work related discussions and that they were also uncomfortable being given non-medical health advice pertaining to their choice to consume meat and their diets. Again boss looked uncomfortable but asked Vegan to respect their wishes and closed the meeting.\n\nVegan didn't look anyone in the eye after that but headed straight to the bathroom. My boss was trying to get one of the coworkers to see if she was OK and I think one of them eventually checked up on her but she was in a cubicle and asked to be left alone. She eventually came out and asked my boss to leave early which she did. \n\nI feel awful now. She embarrassed me in front of my team with the \"lives taken\" comment so I pushed back but I am caught between not wanting her to miserable and not wanting anything to do with her at all.\n\nA few of my coworkers and I ended up in a proactive conference call after this with HR who basically said that always been subjected to unwanted advice and jabs about eating meat was not OK but some \"mediation\" was in order to ensure cut the tension in the workplace.\n\nThe HR rep then called my boss who explained what happened in the team meeting and complaints that we'd made one on one etc but then he went into a meeting room and didn't hear the rest of discussion.\n\nI don't know what to do, assuming she comes into work tomorrow or if I should even talk to her at all. \n\nTLDR: Vegan coworker keeps making jabs at me, I snapped and told her not to talk to me unless it was work related and 2 other coworkers followed suit. Vegan left work early upset. Not sure how to proceed from here.",

            "Chiming in as a vegan here. She is being completely ridiculous. She has now created a hostile work place for you and your coworkers. As a vegan in the world she cannot expect to never encounter meat eaters. Its one thing to state your opinions, but it is quite another to berate your coworkers. If she didn't want to work with meat eaters she should choose a vegan company to work for. Do not engage her further, she has been harassing you. This is her problem now.\n\nEdit: typo",
            "You're doing everything right, really. I wouldn't change a thing, you're by the book and if your boss is spineless in dealing with a bag of shithead crazy, that's for him to work out with HR when he gets his butt chewed. You have every right to push back on someone who harasses you at work, and you're not being cruel, you're being professional. Well done! ",
            "I know you are uncomfortable and feel guilty but this is essentially your boss's fault.  You made a boundary request, you didn't attack her as a person, you cited the behavior you wanted stopped and that was all.  He should have pulled her aside and said there had been complaints about her pushing her views unsolicited onto other co workers and that it was inappropriate; that she should consider this a verbal warning and the next time would be written and the third time would be termination.  That is the boss's job.  He didn't do it and now everyone else had to confront her and 'make' her feel bad.  She brought this on herself and your boss enabled it.  It isn't your responsibility to fix it.  (ETA and I hate hunting and was a vegetarian for a long time.  This situation isn't a belief problem it's is a behavior problem)  ",
            "I have nothing productive to add, but I love the image of the Hindu guys tapping out of her (vegan, cruelty-free) nuttiness.",
            "As other people have noted, she's a bully.  She's been working hard to establish dominance--I'm surprised she hasn't been peeing on people's desks.\n\nLeave her alone.  Don't extend your hand to her, just politely nod when you see her, have the professional conversations you need to have with her and get on with your life.\n\nSince she's a bully, any attempt to jolly her along may be seen as weakness.  Bullies gotta bully, so I would not trust any apparent change in behavior.  At all.  She'll probably just gun for revenge--you've got a wishy-washy boss, yes?  I wonder how hard she'd have to work to get him to take up her cause?\n\nBe rigorously professional with her--dot every i, cross every t, triple check that she is not even for a nanosecond outside of any loop in which she has a professional concern.  If you are talking with other people when she walks in a room, you all should probably make a point of acknowledging her presence with a wave and a smile before returning to conversation--you don't want accusations that you guys are \"plotting\" or otherwise freezing her out.\n\nEtc.\n\nMaybe consult HR on how best to move forward so that everyone's ass is covered?",
            "She dug her own hole, now she can lie in it. Hopefully by two other people speaking their mind your boss can start to see that it's obviously not just you that doesn't like her.\n\nHow insufferable",
            "Why did you come here for advice, you've done everything perfectly, imo.  Don't feel bad, don't engage her, just keep on keeping on!",
            "This is not on you. You've done everything right. She has the freedom to make her own choices, and the office respects her lifestyle choices - no one is going up to her and demanding she start eating meat. It's her problem that she can't extend the same courtesy to you and the rest of the office, so let her face the consequences. Maybe this jarring event will slap her awake to what a jerk she's being!\n\nEdit: I just wanted to also point out that it's incredibly insensitive of her to berate someone for partaking in their cultural dish, guinea pigs are staples in some parts of Peru. That's like shaming an Argentinian for eating beef. Very disrespectful.",
            "> I feel awful now. She embarrassed me in front of my team with the \"lives taken\" comment so I pushed back but I am caught between not wanting her to miserable and not wanting anything to do with her at all.\n\nOP, I just want you to be aware that your co-worker didn't care at all about making you uncomfortable or miserable. You've done more than enough to show her courtesy and fairness in this, and she has not relented. Her misery in this is her own fault by being unflinchingly insistent about pushing her personal values upon others.",
            "She can't take what she dishes out, dude!! Do not feel bad. What if you went and cried in the bathroom because of all her comments? You  had a reason to. But no, the second someone gives her the same shit (actually you did it much more maturely and in the right manner; defense) she can not take it. \n\n\nDoes she watch Freelee the banana girl or ever mentioned her? She's a popular youtuber who does this same thing and encourages her followers to do the same. ",
            "You did fine. Be honest and stick to the truth, which is that she's a fine coworker except she can't stop being insulting to you about a perfectly reasonable difference of opinion. If she can't stand being around people who disagree with her, that's not your fault.\n",
            "Dude, no.  No, do not talk to her when she comes back in.  If she's going to be a pushy, aggressive, offensive harridan at work and alienate literally every single one of her coworkers, then she deserves the treatment she's been given.  She's just awful.  I mean, awful. I'm trying to teach my kids that, if you act like an asshole, nobody's gonna want to play with you.  She obviously missed that lesson. Princess is in the real world now, where not everyone gets a trophy, and you don't have to share, and you get excluded from play dates if you're insufferable. ",
            "Bully's come in many forms, but she is a bully. The best way to deal with a bully is to confront them head on. You did this and in true bully fashion, she backed off. Don't feel bad about what you did. This will ultimately cause less trouble in the office than letting her continue.",
            "Sometimes, you just want to ask someone: \"What's your major malfunction jackass?\" I had a coworker who sold his car so he could ride his bike to work everyday. To hear him tell it, one would have thought that he was singlehandedly saving the earth. He spent the first few weeks of this telling people that they should too. Then one day he made an off handed joke about how fat people should be forced to sell their cars and ride a bike, while looking at me (yes, I'm overweight). I just looked at him and said, \"I would, but, I don't want to turn into an asshole.\" He shut up after that. \n\nOP, you did the right thing. Vegan was being an ass and you handled it perfectly. ",
            ">I am caught between not wanting her to be miserable and not wanting anything to do with her.\n\nUh-uh. You of all should know the risks of going soft on a wounded adversary, Ms. Hunter.",
            "[deleted]",
            ">I feel awful now.\n\nDon't. Everything that happened was a consequence of her own actions and words. The only person to blame here is herself.\n\nYou stuck up for yourself, and not only that, you gave courage to your co-workers who may have been too afraid to speak up before.\n\nYou did a good thing.",
            "You made the right call.  She needs to learn this lesson. Let HR take over.  Your request for her to not harass you for how you live your life is fair, and you won't harass her about hers. \n\nShe's on a fine line here.  HR will want to avoid you making a formal complaint at all costs.  See it through. Vegan needs to *learn* this lesson. ",
            "As a vegan, I don't think you did anything inappropriate with regards to her. Some vegans, especially younger ones, are just bitter and angry people. Although, not without good reason. Still not a very good excuse to bully people. ",
            "Your boss is in deep shit for letting this happen.  It's their job to manage these sorts of things before they get out of hand, that's why they are called managers.  You're supposed to focussed on your work not workplace interpersonal drama.",
            "Okay.\n\nI am a vegan.\n\nI have hunter relatives.  I do not judge them at all.  I am really close to them.\n\nI happen to be obsessed with bones.\n\nI collect scavenged bones.\n\nI do not want any piece of an animal to go to waste if it's going to be killed anyways.\n\nSo my uncle calls me every time he goes duck hunting etc and I pick up a bag of duck heads/legs.  Right now I have 12 duck heads buried in my yard so nature can eat away at the flesh so I'm left with those beautiful skulls.\n\nI'm aware that this isn't typical.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that your coworker is being unreasonable and \"holier than thou,\" but there are a variety of people out there that just simply choose to not eat animal products, and choose not to partake in the \"commercial harvesting of animals\" or whatever.  I don't kill, but I certainly do scavenge.  I feel like it's morally moot since it'll be going into a landfill if not in my artwork.\n\nYou did the right thing.  100% you did the right thing.  You were provoked into responding.  She made her bed.",
            "* she feels really left out and she seems to think it's my fault\n\nHas anyone directly told her, she's left out because of her behavior? Maybe it's difficult to tell her she's snobby and rude - she sounds like the kind of person who escalates to get things their way. So, nobody ends up wanting to tell her because of that? I wouldn't be surprised if people don't expect her to take it smoothly. But it's important for people to tell her that she's left out for her own behavior. She doesn't respect people - by extension, nobody wants to spend time with her.\n\n* Vegan sarcastically asked me how many \"lives I'd taken last weekend\"\n\nDoes she really expect people to want her informal company, when she's a toxic asshat? I mean, you sound like a reasonable, responsible, considerate hunter. And you're getting the opposite of that treatment because this jerk believes a generalization more than they do the golden rule. She's miserable because of how she treats people. I think it's great that you feel sorry, but this woman did bring this on herself. You've repeatedly expressed your disinterest in her advice and your displeasure of her mission to, seemingly berate anyone who doesn't have her diet. And all this tension exists because your boss won't do their job in the first place, which is to manage things. \n\nI'd be tempted to extend - well, not an apology. I wouldn't apologize for standing up to myself. But I would want to try touching base with her. Actually, I might seek someone to mediate the conversation, for posterity and for help in communicating with her. If she doesn't realize just how horrible she treats everyone, I'd feel compelled to talk to her about it. That's the thing though - can she be talked to about this? I feel like that's probably where you hesitate the most - even if you did reach out, she might still take it as offense or blow up on you. I would reach out and *end* the conversation if she does her usually toxic crap. You tell her that's the reason she's in the place she is now, and you tell her you won't continue the conversation until she can have one with respect. Otherwise she needs to keep it to herself and do her job.\n\n",
            "At my moms work they have a vegan coworker but he doesn't push it on anyone and they bring in Oreos for him on birthday because they're vegan. Theres nothing wrong with being a vegan and stating that but harassing others about heir choices? Not okay. She brought this on herself, she had many chances to cut it out. Just keep your head down and avoid her. ",
            "I do not know how things could have been handled better. This girl is a bully and like many bullies, they cannot handle it when their victims are fighting back. Normal people would have apologized and trying to clear the situation, explaining herself instead of going to the bathroom to cry and asking to go home early because of belly ache.\n\n\nWhat is she? Kinder-freakin-gardener?\n\n\nYou have done well friend, stand your ground and do not feel bad. You best a bully at her game, be proud.",
            "You did nothing wrong. In fact, you have exercised really good restraint. She is imposing her values and beliefs on you and your coworkers, and harassing you because you don't share her values. This is no different than if she was to impose her religious beliefs on you, completely inappropriate.\n\nFor some reason people don't understand that values are the same as religion and do not belong in the workplace.\n\n",
            "You have nothing to feel bad or guilty about. Your coworker is obnoxious and unprofessional. Do not apologize to her or extend any kind of olive branch first. ",
            "You handled it very well, you shouldn't stress too much about her emotions. She needs people to be straight forward with her like that if she didn't get the point before that. People like her are why i feel so awkward telling people I don't eat meat, i always think others will stereotype all non meat eaters to being like her.",
            "Fuck her.  I think when you get to the point where you have to say, \"Please only engage me in work-related discussion, \" is where you don't feel bad about hurting her feelings.\n\nSeriously, this is ridiculous and this lady clearly has some boundary issues.",
            "This woman is about to come into a crossroads in her life where she will either let herself realize that her actions towards others are to blame for her being disliked, or convince herself that everyone hates her because she is vegan.\n\nIt's a rare event to witness someone having such a moment. I wonder what she'll chose.",
            "I used to be vegan. She's the type that gives us a bad name. I would never engage people in vegan conversations except to turn down their animal products if they offered with an explanation. In fact people would be often initiate the conversations themselves, which eventually got annoying, basically they were trying to find some logical trap to \"prove\" I should give up and eat meat. \n\nSeriously, she needs to shut up about it, evangelical people are annoying and do nothing but make their cause seem ridiculous. ",
            "These are the posts that make me wish that the person in question goes on reddit and sees the thread and realizes what a complete shithead they are. A man can dream.",
            "Honestly it sounds like you handled it very well. You and others checked her inappropriate actions and now she feels bad about being a bitch to everybody, as she should. What to do now? Keep your chin up, be better than her, and let her know you don't hate her for being obnoxious even if she hates you for being a hunter.",
            "Just as one working woman to another: I want to commend you for standing up for yourself. *feminism fistbump*",
            "You did everything fine, seriously.\n\nI wouldn't engage her in conversation unless you have to at this point.",
            "Honestly, she keeps attacking you and your hobbies, but you never attacked her for her hobbies. Telling her to not talk to you unless it's work related is very professional. If she could not understand that and felt it was an attack, that is her problem to be upset about. And the fact she would attack the others who ate animal products and what-not too, she needs to learn boundaries.",
            "She's gone out of her way to be really nasty about this whole situation. I think having mediation could potentially help defuse this situation. Your boss really should have brought in HR when you made the initial complaint - it's only gotten more out of hand since that point. They were trying to play it cool but in the end it escalated and now the vegan's upset and angry, you and your coworkers are uncomfortable and have endured weeks or months of unwanted jabs. Very messy.\n\nHopefully HR will help her understand what appropriate boundaries are and that her behaviour thus far has been wholly unwelcome and just plain gross and pushy. There are certain things she's welcome to do: bring icky kale and quinoa salads to office potlucks. Use her own utensils/plates to avoid cross contamination, order vegan beer at the bar. There are things she's not welcome to do: comment on other people's fucking diet. Insist others stop using the communal microwave.\n\nIn the future if this kind of bullshit attitude behaviour continues you might want to bring it straight to the HR rep. You should ask them what you and your coworkers are intended to do if these behaviours 'resurface' post-mediation, especially given your boss's history of inaction.",
            "You demand respect, like any normal person would. You don't go up to a church, a vegan or someone gay and 'question their lifestyle' do you? No. It's extremely inappropriate and unnecessary. And if HR asks why you choose to stand up against VEGAN say it was affecting your work environment and you began feeling threatened at work and questioned about your choices. You shouldn't feel bad. Your boss was probably uncomfortable because they just didn't want to say anything mean to Vegan incase of them going to HR.",
            ">I feel awful now.\n\nLol why? She was bullying you and finally got put in her place. That's her problem, not yours. Keep enforcing boundaries and always keep in mind that she is a BULLY. She consistently tries to grill you over shit that's your personal life and not any of her business. She's a rude person and got called out on her rudeness. Good.",
            "Vegan here. It's because of people like her that I often get shit because of my eating habits. There are so many crazy vegans out there, and it makes us look like assholes. She needs to understand that because she's eating a certain way doesn't mean that everybody wants to do the same as her. Meat is fucking delicious, and I can't blame anybody for wanting to eat a good steak whenever they goddamn feel like it. She's absolutely ridiculous, and she deserved what she got in the end. Don't blame yourself.",
            "She seems a bit crazy with her vegan status. I'm of the opinion that regardless of your beliefs, you should never force them on others. I have a good friend who is vegan and we have a great time at restaurants. We went to a work function that had a buffet, and we wandered around finding food that was vegan friendly for her. I sat next to her and ate food I normally would (meat) and she was totally cool about it, because she knows I'm not vegan. I'm pretty sure that's how most vegans would react to food situations.",
            "Short and sweet, she brought this on herself. An overwhelming majority of people in the world aren't vegan, and I'm sure it's still a pretty large majority that are omnivorous/carnivorous (I tried to look up some stats, but best I found was a few countries having around a 5% vegan population). When she, as the single vegan of the workplace, began to pester people about their eating choices, I don't get how she didn't expect backlash, especially when she pushed boundaries. In my opinion, it's no better than trying to push your religion on people in the workplace. I'm guessing you don't have HR otherwise I would suggest escalating to them for her harassment if she doesn't stop now. ",
            "Fellow vegan here. I am so sorry that you have to endure this. I have no advise other than hold your ground, make your boundaries clear to her. \n\nI hate vegans like this. You can't be seirous to think that constant nagging would convert ANYONE to veganism.. -.-",
            ">I feel awful now.\n\nDon't.  Vegan deserved it a long, long time ago.  If she didn't want people shutting her out, she shouldn't have been an insufferable asshole to everyone.\n\n>Not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nShow up and do your job.  If you have to interact with her, be polite and only talk about work.  If she apologizes, graciously accept it and thank her for apologizing but you do NOT have to then try to be friends with her. It's OK (and for the best) to keep your relationship strictly professional.  \n",
            ">She embarrassed me in front of my team with the \"lives taken\" comment so I pushed back but I am caught between not wanting her to miserable and not wanting anything to do with her at all.\n\nYou did the right thing. She was harassing you! And others! You guys aren't leaving her out because she's vegan. Or even because she's awkward or different or whatever. You're leaving her out because *she's* being discriminating, harassing her co-workers, and acting like a first-rate asshole. I really feel like what you did was the absolute right thing and the fact that others chimed in with the same request kind of shows this. She needs to keep her head down, do her job, and wait for time to pass. \n\nYou should stay clear of her, hold her to this requirement at least for awhile (if she starts harassing you again, call her out immediately and call it what it is: Harassment and creating a hostile work environment), and let HR do its thing. Participate in any mediation they arrange but don't engage her yourself. ",
            "I don't see why you should even care what comes out of this psycho's mouth. \n\nJust say \"oooookay\" and change the subject or ignore her. ",
            "OP, you rock. You did everything you could to put up with her bullshit, and when the issue came to a head, you were respectful and told her not to engage you unless it was work related. I know it sucks to hurt someone's feelings, but lets face it, she didn't give a shit about your own.\n  \nHow much do I need to paypal you to get some tasty deer jerky? I am not fucking around here.",
            "Another vegan offering my 2p.\n\nFor those who are talking about previous experiences with 'rabid vegans,' I don't think the real issue here is the veganism. In the past I've been \"attacked\" by 'rabid atheists' and 'rabid christians' but like i said it's not about the belief system.\n\nThis has less to do with veganism and more to do with living and letting live. \n\nThe vegan person in the post is likely a new vegan like everyone else pointed out, and hopefully will learn through this experience about not shoving her beliefs down others throat. \n\n\nOP has handled situation correctly.",
            "In your shoes I would also feel very guilty, because someone is suffering.  But just because you feel empathy for another human being doesn't mean that it is your fault.\n\nYou did not create the situation and you did not escalate the situation.  \n\nResponsibility for de-escalating lies with your boss, HR, and the woman who created all of this.  I don't think you can or should do anything.",
            "Your HR department should be on board with this - you are under no obligation to discuss or do anything with this person that is not work related. I had a coworker who wasn't nearly as bad as yours, but she desperately wanted to be my \"friend\" and she was awkward as hell and quite rude at times. When she wasn't invited to a lunch, she would confront me. At Christmas, she gave me a small gift and used the opportunity to say \"I just feel at times like you hate me.\" She took my reserved parking spot once. She often would refer to another coworker as \"hating\" her. She used the Secret Santa gift exchange to give a coded message to someone saying \"you are mean to your Secret Santa.\" I could go on. I went to HR because I was afraid that I would lose my shit on this idiot and I wanted to know what my obligations were. HR told me that my only obligations were to not be hostile, and to not block anything work-related. So all you have to do is be civil to her *where work is concerned*. Be strong. Her behavior is more about her than about you. She is making herself look like the jerk, not you. Continue to firmly shoot her down.

            "Your post reads like a \"how to\" guide on the proper way to deal with obnoxious coworkers.  Seriously, I don't know what you could have done differently.  It sounds like your only issue is that while you're fed up with her, you're also a decent human being who doesn't want to make anyone feel bad.  That is totally understandable, but the thing is it's that common non-confrontational attitude that allows people like your coworker to exist in the first place.  If everyone called people like her out on their behavior, they would modify it.  I love the part where after you spoke up in the meeting, two of your coworkers did as well.  Everyone was thinking what you said, but they didn't want to be the first one to say it.  I get that you feel guilty, I probably would in your shoes as well, but you did not create this situation.  She did.  All you did is attempt to resolve it, and it seems like you've gone about it in the best possible way.",
            "It's funny that you've displayed more empathy than someone who dictates their whole diet on the idea of empathy..\n\nBut really it sounds like your boss is the most to blame here. He should have spoken with her about it not being professional and brought HR in much earlier. This is poor management that catered to a person who sounds like they don't understand how to behave in a workplace. Honestly, she doesn't seem cut out to work in an environment that doesn't cater to her delicate sensibilities. I would have fired her for her incredibly intimidating behavior.\n\nThat being said, I'd personally think you should tell her you are sorry for the situation and that you want to maintain a courteous workplace and extend a friendly hand to her, but do not take responsibility because it isn't yours.",

It's heartbreaking to see what happens to nonhuman animals and it is so incredibly frustrating that people just don't care or don't see the problem. \n\nBUT that does not explain or excuse her bullying and behaviour. Maybe she has good intentions, but being hurtful to people around her is not an acceptable way to act. And pragmatically, it will just lead to people dismissing all her views. Alienating and insulting people is about the most ineffective method of activism. \n\nI think that keeping conversations to work-related topics for now is a good idea. Let HR do mediation. Make sure that you aren't hassling her for being vegan (doesn't sound like that's the case here at all though!) and hopefully she will stop attacking everybody else.\n\nEdit: You did nothing wrong to her in this situation, by the way. I don't want to come off like I'm defending her or anything. Don't feel guilty about her reaction to what you said. It was bound to happen with the way she acts.

Bob is\" so they don't try to lay this out as a bullying claim against all of you.

They pay you strictly for the work you do and nothing else. So the only thing that matters is the work you get done and the money you take home. Anything beyond that is not your responsibility.

It's fine to live your life however you want and while it's obvious that it's important to her it's not ok to be rude and hostile to people for not living life according to her rules. She is being unprofessional, insulting, and inappropriate. Stick to the script. In mediation, tell her to stop making comments about your personal choices and you'll get along great. If you want to try to make inroads, you can apologize for snapping at her but you've tried to deal with this diplomatically for months and it's not working. Sorry it had to come to this point, but you really need her behavior to stop and it is just that simple. Rinse and repeat. \n\nMy husband was a vegan for several years and many of his coworkers would attack and bully him in the office because he was the guy who always had to order french fries and a salad when they went out to lunch. He never lectured them about their meal choices or talked about being vegan. Finally he told them to shut the fuck up about it. That was the last time he had to say anything.  ",

The only time I bring up my veganism at work is if someone offers me food that I can't have.\n\nI think of how I want to be treated.  I don't like it when people impose their moral, religious, political, or otherwise kinds of beliefs on me and I try to do the same favor.  Granted, if someone asks me about it, I would talk about it.  But not in the kind of context where I would be telling them how to live their lives.  \n\nRealistically, I think veganism is something that's right for some and not for others.  So if hunting is your thing, go for it! \n\nIn dealing with this workplace issue, you're doing everything right.  Perhaps talk about how excluding her seemed to be logical because she can't enjoy the activities that you engaged in outside of work.  She surely would have reacted poorly to being invited to a burger joint or a hunting trip and may even have seen that as an insult.  That's actually a reasonable way to put it for the HR people that makes you sound less snobby.\n\nSadly, not everybody will get along.  You're not obligated to like anyone.  And you're not obligated to be her friend.  And you're also not obligated to care about how she feels.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  You didn't go out of the way to hurt her really, you did what you needed to protect yourself from her militant comments.  And sometimes the truth hurts.  You shouldn't feel responsible for her feelings because you really weren't trying to cause her harm.  You can be civil but you're under no order to be friendly.  I would not go out of your way to talk to her, hold true to your request.  She may also feel like you're taunting her if you try to talk to her.  \n\nHope things improve!",

Keep doing what you're doing, and eventually - most likely sooner rather than later - she'll hoist herself by her own petard. If you wanted to escalate things, you could make a complaint to HR about her harassing you, there's certainly a case to be made for it.",

She actually APPLAUDS us for hunting because the animal is killed humanely, and the meat is 100% organic, and there are no added chemicals or growth hormones. It's something like 99% fat free and it's honestly delicious. She needs to get a grip.",
            "I'm the first person to handle a situation with compassion and apologies, but she was the instigator here. You didn't do anything wrong, you were being constantly harassed and then asked for it to stop. Just because she's playing victim doesn't mean you owe her anything. I'm a vegetarian myself and would never dream of treating people this way.",
            "I think you should proceed as it is right now. Seems like all the necessary steps were taken and the confrontation was very cordial. If it happens again tell her \"this is why you're single.\" And that should put a permanent stop to it. Unless she isn't single.",
            "I only understand the situation from your explanation but the entire time I was reading I was wondering why you didn't go to HR earlier, she was consistently berating you over your hobbies and eating habits- in my eyes it has been pretty close to harassment for a pretty long time. Should you feel bad? I do not think so, it was all fun and games for her until the seriousness of her actions finally set in, how she did not understand she was annoying people from the beginning is beyond my understanding. Your boss also should have spoken up earlier and it should not have taken a band of employees to get the point across. She's an adult she can now reap her actions. \n\nI would take no action, continue acting as you did before the incident, only engage her in work related conversation, if HR calls you in explain the situation and do not forget to mention that your spineless boss ignored the situation.

She created a very uncomfortable work environment for herself, she's embarrassed & probably feels foolish. But she's a grown up, she'll move past it. Eventually she'll probably try to reconnect with everyone (hopefully not about food) & at that point I'd suggest giving her a shot(reading back I think I should clarify, i mean a chance, Do Not hunt her with your shotgun!) . As long as she's not trying to convert you she might be a nice person.",
            "Don't you dare feel awful for calling her out on her bullying. And that's what it is, bullying. She needed to be formally put in her place because she is causing a hostile work environment. Just steer clear of her unless it's specifically work related.

            "You've done the right thing, she was the one who kept escalating and was going to push until someone stood up. She is using her vegan status to feel superior and harass people. Don't feel badly, its your work environment too, plus you helped make it better for others. ",

            "I don't have anything against vegans here but she's pushing her non-work related agenda at work.  It's inappropriate.  This would be analogous to her actively pushing her religion or her politics in the workplace.  I think you handled it correctly. She asked for this and now it came back to her, not the way she wanted but she got a response.  Perhaps she will be more metered in her response from now on.",
            "Perfect responses to escalating harassment.  You handled it perfectly, and have been amazingly accommodating with her incessant nagging. Well done. \n\nA1 score for proper hunting training and responsibility. It's the Same here in Sweden. ",
            "If you really want things to be normal at work you can try pulling her aside and saying something like- \"I don't think it is good for either of us to be talking about hunting or veganism. But perhaps both of us could have handled this better. We have to work together and I have no problem with you aside from this issue. I see no reason why wouldn't couldn't be perfectly fine work friends.\" That should diffuse any situation if that is what you really want.",
            "I have an annoying vegan co worker too but nowhere near as bad as yours. She also only eats organic (or stuff labeled organic anyway).\n\nShe thinks all meat is bad for you, GMOs etc. (Doesn't know what GMO stands for, at least when I asked) but yeah gives unwanted and often incorrect medical advice she gets from vegan publications.\n\nThings were kind of tense once because I called her organic only diet an expensive hobby after she said anyone regardless of income level could shop at Whole Foods if they \"budget correctly\". Tried to tell her about inner city food deserts and she just dismissed me.\n\nShe also told me drinking pineapple juice would cure the common cold. I did just to humor her and when it didn't work she said \"Oh, well you also have to eat vegan.\"",

But it seems, somehow, that she feels that her being vegan makes her a member of a protected class- almost as if you or your coworkers had said \"don't talk to me about anything but work because you're 'fill in race or sexual orientation here'\"... it seems like a few of the vegans I know see themselves in a similar way.  \n",
            "This is work, not social hour or high school. Part of her JOB includes getting along with others, her co-workers. Your boss should grow a pair and tell her to turn it down a bit. Other than that, all you can do is ask that the boss sit in on a group conversation with her and ask her (politely) to turn down the volume on some of her opinions.",
            "It seems like you got the point across to her. Just curious what do you do with these animals? Do you eat them? As someone who does eat meat and hunts occasionally for meat, I would never be able to kill something if I wasn't going to use it.",
            "You were not out of line for what you did at the meeting.  Your coworker created the situation and you reacted professionally IMO.  If you didn't react, it would encourage her to do it again and/or escalate.\n\nAs for the future do not engage with her unless it's a professional matter and when you do so act casual and polite.  If she tries to start up with you about something vegan related just cut her off immediately and say calmly but firmly: \"We already talked about this, we're not going over it again.\"  Repeat as necessary and if she escalates just walk away.",
            "How bizarre that she'd focus on you for being a hunter when hunted animals typically live and die under *way* more humane circumstances than factory farmed ones. I mean yeah, if you were a poacher hacking off rhinos' horns then sure, that'd be a problem, but it sounds like you're a responsible hunter.\n\nAnyway, you did the right thing. She's made her own life miserable by proselytizing endlessly at work and making a snide comment about you *during a team meeting*. Maybe your decision to address the problem in the most appropriate possible way (given the circumstances) will help her to change her wildly unprofessional behavior, which will benefit her in the long run.\n\nI'll echo the other advice here and say don't address this or anything that's not directly work-related with her tomorrow. If she apologizes (doubt it but who knows) then accept, but don't offer an automatic return apology because you did nothing wrong. My bet is she'll just be ultra subdued because she knows now that multiple team members feel the same way you do about her."

He invited me over, and we talked over coffee.\n\n\nWhen I told him what had happened with his son, he seemed shocked, but he took it well.  He said that he was surprised, as James had not been displaying anything in the way of sexually inappropriate behavior, though he did admit he had been told that James acting out sexually was a possibility, so it wasn't entirely unexpected.\n\n\nHe said that he wished I had come forward after the hallway incident, but that he understood why I had brushed it off, and didn't hold it against me.  He's just glad that I came forward and told him the truth.  I was visibly upset, so I'm sure he could tell how deeply this was affecting me.  I asked him if he wanted me to cut ties with them, temporarily or permanently, but he said absolutely not.  He believes that it's important for James to have a gay role model in his life, and felt that not having me around would come across as punitive and shaming to James, and would end up doing more harm than good.  He confirmed to me that James is seeing a therapist, but that they were down to monthly visits, as James had seemed to be adjusting well.  John said that he was going to go back to weekly visits in light of his behavior.  He asked me to stick around until James got home.\n\nWhen James arrived, John said that he wanted to talk to him about what had happened between James and I.  James looked extremely guilty, and started tearing up.  After John reiterated what had happened and asked if he had anything he'd like to say, James broke down crying and saying how sorry he was.  We both reassured him that we weren't angry with him, and that he wasn't in any trouble, but that he needed to understand that this behavior was inappropriate, and why.  As per the suggestion of several of the comments, I apologized for saying he should never touch anyone the way he did, and we discussed the issue of consent at length.  John then asked him why he did what he did.\n\n\nJames talked a lot about it, but was rambling nervously.  I get the feeling that he was sorting it out in his head as he was talking, so it was a little difficult to follow, but I'll paraphrase what he said, as I understand it.\n\n\nHe confirmed for us that he had not done this with anyone else.  He has had a brief crush or two on other boys at school, but was self-aware enough to know that they were straight, and not interested in him romantically.  He admitted that he did have a little bit of a crush on me as well, but assumed that I was straight.\n\n\nHowever, when he found out that I was gay, he mistook my affection for him as attraction, and came to the conclusion that I was only friendly with him because I wanted him sexually.  John asked him if he acted the way he had because he wanted to have sex with me.  James said no, but that he thought that if he didn't repay my affection with sexual acts that I wouldn't want to be his friend anymore.  He also expressed some concern that if he didn't initiate it I would, and that he'd rather do it on his terms.  I told him that sex was never any part of my intentions, and that I was friends with him because he was nice, that I enjoyed talking to him and hanging out with him, that I like him because of who he is as a person.  He asked if he was ugly.  I said no, and explained that most people are attracted to people close to their own age.  He admitted that if he were to have a boyfriend that he'd want a boyfriend his age.\n\n\nWe started wrapping things up, but I noticed James seemed dejected.  I asked him what was wrong.   He asked me if I hated him now.  I admit I got a little choked up when he said that.  I gave him a big hug and told him that I would never hate him, and that I would always be his friend.  He asked if we would still get to hang out, and I said yes, but only when his father was home, and that I wouldn't be able to babysit for him for awhile.  John made sure he understood that this was not a punishment, just a precaution.  James seemed agreeable to it.\n\nAt this point, John said he had some things he wanted to discuss with James privately, so we said our goodbyes, and I left.\n\nAll in all I feel pretty good about it.  I think we were able to explain things to James in a way that he understood.  I hope I handled this the right way.\n\n\nI'd like to wrap this up by thanking everyone for their comments, but especially /u/Doughchild for their heartbreaking, but very insightful comments in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3kcdcy/me_25m_and_my_friend_27m_of_fifteen_years_his_son/cuwe8kq)  I read it again just now, and started crying, because I was struck by how much of that I saw in James.  Thank you for helping me understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: The poor kid thought that if he didn't sleep with me, I wouldn't want to be his friend anymore.  I think I helped him understand that that's not the case.  Supervised visits, and no babysitting for the foreseeable future.",

            "I'm glad it helped. I was touched reading from others, but i didn't want to derail by commenting further. \n\nI'm sad that my explanation was one that indeed applied to James. People tend to think that once abuse is over, that the victim should visit a therapist a few times and then just stop talking about it and  move on. This is exactly the part that never goes away. James will be 60 and still struggle with this burden, that never was his to carry.\n\nYou did everything in the best possible way. John seems to be a very good dad, he's making sure James gets the help he needs. He will need to keep guiding James, but it's great that he could talk about his crushes. And you did well in affirming to James what your expectations exactly were, because he's going to run into this with everyone he meets; not understanding that he's nice enough as he is and that he can say no. You both have helped James so very much with the way you handled this. \n\nThanks for the update.\n\n",
            "This is the best possible outcome.  However inadvertently, James was able to draw attention to a wounded part of him that still needs attention.  Imagine if he'd broken his leg and it didn't set correctly.  His acting out was the limp that allows his father to know that the bone has to be reset.\n\nIf you address the subject again, you can tell him the truth:  You weren't upset because of harm done to you (although you don't like people touching you without permission).  You were upset because you wish he could feel that your love and regard for him is because of who is he is, not because of what he can do for you.",
            "You handled that in the best way possible!\n\nI'm proud of you.  You and his dad are being terrific stand up male role models for a young man who needs it.",
            "Thank you for writing this. I am sitting, typing this while sobbing. And I've got to express why I am so touched by this post and update, as sharing seems to be a healthy and helpful thing to do in these sort of threads. \n\nI was sexually abused for long term by a neighbor. \n\nMy family (mostly my mother) reacted horribly and handled it very wrongly. No excuses, middle class family, education regarding the damages of sexual abuse, it all came down to that she cared more about her image in regards to those outside of the family were more important to her than the happiness of those within. My siblings reflected her behavior. Alone, I had to confront my abuser and threaten to tell the police if he would not stop touching me. He was a neighbor and I still had to see him all the time, but the abuse stopped when I was 9 (the age that James was when the authorities stepped in). \n\nSo the abuse stopped. But the after affects didn't. \n\nI was very over sexualized with my affections, and had many of the same thought patterns that this poor kid has. I thought that I could only earn people's affections by giving sexual attention. It led to repeats of abuse by those who sensed I was vulnerable and easily coerced. And things that were inappropriate enough to draw attention from outsiders (e.g., showing my body to other children, inappropriate touching of non-family adults, etc.) were all addressed with harsh punishment and shaming. I remember begging my mother for therapy at 12 because I wanted to kill myself; I was so unhappy and so confused with all the blank stretches in my memories, and she would scream at me for making her feel like a bad mother. \n\nNow, reading this and hearing how you two are helping and guiding this poor confused kid, is making me sob. I would have given anything to have people like you in my life. To have this kind of love. The abuse was not that bad for me; what was horrible was having my parent punish me over and over for it. Being forbidden to tell my father. I still struggle to talk in therapy because I feel like I am going to be punished for it. Even having a neutral response would have been bearable. But James has people who love him. He has people who are willing to help him, and *that* is what is going to make it so he can grow into happy and well adjusted adult. He must feel so accepted and loved right now. It might have been hard to speak with him, but the fact that he told you these things is a miracle of love. It is proof that he feels he can talk to you and his father about how he feels. What an amazing gift.\n\nAs a survivor, I can say how people respond to abuse (even today) has a far greater affect on me than abuse does. People that show that they care enough to reach through the darkness and pull you out, they are what makes it all bearable and something to grow from, not something that will crush you into pieces. Thank you so much for sharing this update and reassuring the scared kid in me that there are good people out there that love others enough to understand and help. \n\nEdit: clarified/fixed sentences\n\nEdit again: thank you everyone for the kind comments, messages, and gold. What a wonderful response to find when I logged in :). I am really grateful for the loving community here, it is really hard for me to share this part of me, so thank you for making that easier. ",

James has been given the message that his only value is sexual value, he needs to offer sex for people to like him, that he has no right to decline sex, it will happen anyway (hence saying he'd rather have sex on his terms rather than you just taking it from him). My heart breaks for him that he feels the only poles in his relationships are \"Wants to have sex with me\" and \"Hates me\".\n\nJames is dealing with a lot, as a gay youth AND a sexual abuse survivor.

            "Very well done, and thanks for the update! This sounds like it couldn't have gone over any better!\n\nOut of curiosity - why is it that you guys decided, that you shouldn't babysit him anymore or be alone around him? Is it because you are feeling uncomfortable? Or are worried that your friend might doubt the nature of the interactions with the son?",
            "You both handled it beautifully. It's amazing that you both could talk to him that openly about the situation. I wish my mom could've done that for me too when I was sexually abused as a child, but I felt ashamed of my abuse and she only perpetuated that shame. Although his past was unfortunate and horrible, he's bound for a great future with the two of you as major influences in his life. ",
            "I am happy to hear how this turned out! It seems like you all handled it very well and covered everything that needed to be covered. I'm glad James, although maybe he seemed guilty or embarrassed, was able to understand it all and talk it out. I'm also glad to hear that John was understanding, you're both wonderful people and James is going to grow up great because of you guys!! Also, I'm glad that he has you as a role model who is not actually family, and also I think it is great that (from your original thread) you were able to answer any questions he had because you both have the same sexuality. I feel sad for James but it seems like it was all explained to him awesomely and I'm glad that it went well and you can still be a good friend and a positive role model to him.",

            "Woah! I'm speechless... Not just because of the boy's experience as a molested kid and his resulting assumptions about relationships/friendships, but also because of the absolute mature way his father, your friend, managed a situation that most of us would find hard to tackle -- especially because it takes a lot of emotional intelligence and open-mindedness (or just plain common sense) to do what you, guys, did. I think what you did was just perfect, especially because you never ever sought to make the boy feel bad about what he did, but, on the contrary, state that there was a behavior that wasn't precisely  appropriate, yet he is loved and cherished. I really look up to your friend, man.",
            "I think you handled this well. I was similarly sexually inappropriate at about the same age, also following abuse, and I'm sure I made many adults quite uncomfortable at the time. I look back on this with chagrin. You managed it well, I'm glad he's in therapy just generally, and I hope he can resist the temptation to act out unless in the appropriate context.",

I moved out and my home has become a mess. No one realized how much I cleaned up around the house until I was gone, and now my mom wants me to move back.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nI was kind of surprised by how much everyones response to my mother was a resounding no. It made me feel silly for even considering it; there was really no benefit to keep enabling my mom and move back home.\n\n\nWell, Reddit, I'm sad to say that turning my mom down was the first time I had ever really stood up to her, and it did not go well. She instantly starting gulit tripping me -- how she had raised me, how family was everything, how I was being selfish and abandoning her\n\n\nWhen that didn't work, her insults turned more aggressive. She said I owed her money -- the money it cost to raise me, put me through college (my parents paid partial tuition), the accumulation of \"rent\" for letting me live at home during college (at no point had we ever discussed this), etc. Again, she pressed that I was taking advantage of the family by not moving back home and helping out.\n\n\nI don't wanna get into much detail because I am still very, very sad about how this has turned out, but my mom hasn't responded to my calls in weeks. She's antagonized me against the whole family, telling my siblings that I did something ambiguously terrible and am abandoning the family. I had a phone conversation with my sister Rachel, who said something along the lines of \"mom said you did something really mean to her, she won't tell us what, but she said that's why she made you move out.\" I've never been really close to my siblings, but I'm kind of taken aback how little anyone seems to care that I'm gone.\n\n\nRecently my mom put up a picture on Facebook of the whole family, with me absent, captioned \"The only people in my life I'll ever need.\"\n\n\nI'm trying to focus on my work and my friends to get through this, but I am in a very sad place right now. \n\n\n**tl;dr** Mom didn't take it well that I'm not moving home. She's completely cut me out of her life and is trying to turn my family against me. ",

            "First of all, quit calling mom. All you're doing is making her feel better by allowing her to give you the silent treatment. Stop doing that, and go about living your life. Hell, unfollow her on Facebook so you don't have to see any of the shit she posts. If any of your siblings call again, ask if they notice how filthy the house has gotten since you left. Tell them you were the one keeping the house clean, and mom's pissed because you refused to come back home and play servant. If they get pissy too, block their numbers and carry on with your life. Things will cool down in a few months, and you can reestablish a relationship with your family on your terms.",
            ">my mom hasn't responded to my calls in weeks\n\nAlways keep this in mind:  You don't need her; she needs you.  I would immediately stop calling and stop trying to get back in her good graces.  You don't need to worry about what she thinks of you, it's the other way around.\n\nBe young, be independent, be happy and free, move on with your life.  Some day, I guarantee you this will happen, after you've lived without her and all your siblings leave the nest, she'll call you with the \"I don't know how we ever drifted apart, time to put the past behind us\" speech.",

If you behaved in that way, would you think you were a good parent? Your mother is having a tantrum, and all you can do is ignore her while she wails and kicks. \n\nSet your siblings straight and then hide your mother from your FB feed. It may take sometime, but she'll want to make amends eventually - hopefully she won't have destroyed your relationship by then. ",

            "Whoooooa.\n\nI know it's easy for us to say that you are better off without her, goood riddance, etc. I know she's your mom, and, at least in the experiences with my own mother, no matter how terribly they act, there is still some part of us that wants their love and approval. It might take a long time to extinguish that, if we ever can.\n\nI know it hurts terribly right now, *especially* with her attempts to isolate you. The longer you are away from her, the easier it's going to get. There is this poisonous, toxic cloud around you now that is her influence. The longer you are away, that cloud is going to dissipate. You are going to breath more clearly, see more clearly, and think more clearly than you ever have. The power she has over your thoughts and feelings will be cut off, and she will seem every bit as sad, petty, and tragic as she does to us now. But you *have* to stay away. Don't call her. Don't reach out. If she reaches out, do *not* pick up the phone until you are confident that cloud is gone, and you know she has no power to surround you in it again. \n\nIf there is any family that you are at all close with that is not like your mom, I would recommend possibly reaching out to them. Keep rules strict. If *anyone* tries to get you to make up with your mom, or takes her side, or apologize first, whatever, you don't talk to them either. If your mom is always like this, which no doubt she is, you probably have some relatives she has pissed off or at least know what she is like. Get closer to family who isn't in her cloud, and let them help defend you. It's easy to say screw 'em all and what they think of me... and I agree with that to an extent. But no one wants to be badmouthed without the chance to defend themselves. See if there is anyone in your life who will support you.\n\nIt's going to get better. You are strong, and you were a good daughter. Don't ever let her convince you that you weren't. Use that patience and kindness you showed toward your family on people that appreciate and love you.",
            "I want you to know, and remember something.\n\nFamily is *not* your blood relations.  Family is *not* who raised you.\n\nThe people who love you, care about you, and lift you up - these people are your family.  Your family, is who *you* choose to love and surround yourself with.  Surround yourself with love and cut out the hate with no regrets.",
            "I am sorry she's taking it this way.  She should not have taken advantage of you in your childhood and she should not be trying to put you back in that role.\n\nI AM proud of you for taking control of your life.  Well done!",
            "Please tell your siblings the truth about what happened. If your next oldest sibling is 15, that's absolutely old enough to know the truth. When they get older and move out, they may need you for moral support.  And tell any other family that asks the truth, too. Your mom is being extremely immature and manipulative. Can you look into seeing a therapist to help you deal with this?",
            "You're doing the right thing. This is the sort of growing pain that occurs when something is freed from a cage. I'm sorry that your mother is manipulative and beastly--but as your sibs get older, they're going to be more and more willing to see your side of this farce.",

Stop calling her.\n\n>Recently my mom put up a picture on Facebook of the whole family, with me absent, captioned \"The only people in my life I'll ever need.\"\n\nThat is just cartoonishly trashy behavior. \n\nSave that picture and the next time she starts guilt-tripping you, email that picture to her.",
            "See the person you could have been helping? Ungrateful, mean, and a bully. \n\nI know this is hurting, but you need to see you hold all the power in the situation. She is doing the grown narcissistic version of a temper tantrum. Do as anyone would do with a tantrum. Ignore it and show her that shit won't work. \n\nI would go no contact with her at least for a while. You shouldn't consider visiting until she apologizes and let her know that. If she is mean again? Back to no contact and start the process over again. Eventually you will see if she cares enough to act decent. If she never does then you're still making out on top.",
            "I'm so sorry that your mom chose to end her relationship with you for the time being instead of handling your choice like an adult. It's natural to feel a sense of loss, but that doesn't mean you didn't do what was right for you. You're deserving of respect and shouldn't be taken advantage of. ",

Mommy won't say why because she knows she's wrong and being hateful because she didn't get her slave back. Don't call her, text her, or anything with her. She's willing to screw her child over for the sake of laundry and dishes. You don't owe her any money or your time. Especially with that attitude of her's.",

            "Your mom is being very immature.\n\nFirst off, you don't owe her any money for raising you. She made the choice to have you, that's the cost of being a parent.\n\nSecond, I'm sorry that your mom is ruining your relationship. The goal of raising children is to give them skills to be independent, not keep them serving the parents till death do them part. She should be proud that you're managing on your own, not distancing you from all family.\n\nYour mom is a lost cause, at least for the time being.",
            "No fault of yours, but your mother's response just makes me so angry! It's bullshit! A child does not owe it's parent for the cost of upbringing. At all. Let your siblings know your side and that leaving does not mean you don't love them. You do you and hopefully your mother will get over it.\n\nWhere is your father in all this?",
            "I'm really sorry that she is treating you this way. It must be really rough and painful. Just know that you are doing the right thing, and that going back would not and will not solve anything. Your mom is not being loving or rational, so there's no real point in trying to get through to her. \n\nJust focus on yourself and keep busy, maybe talk to a therapist if you can afford it. *hug*",
            "Your mom is scum. Complete and absolute scum. If your family believes her, they're idiots. Are you sure you weren't adopted? \n\nDon't call her anymore. Every time she ignores your call, it gives her a little thrill about how her awful treatment of you is working. The way to go is to straight up ignore her until she apologizes, profusely, for all of her bad behavior and then tells everyone else it was her fault. Only then can you start to even think about possibly allowing her back into your life in any way shape or form. ",
            "When someone chooses to have a child and raise them, the cost of raising them is a gift. It does not need to be repaid. It's the \"cost of doing business,\" i.e. the cost of having a child. Now, if you win the lottery or something and want to \"reimburse\" her for that money she spent, that'd be a wonderfully touching gesture on your part, but certainly not a requirement.\n\nIf she continues to harp about the money you \"owe\" her, hand her an invoice for your services as maid and housecleaner for the last 18 years or whatever. What a surprise! The amount you \"owe\" her is exactly equal to the amount she \"owes\" you!",
            "Stop hiding what happened from your siblings. Call your sister and tell her the whole story,  currently she was told you did something bad and you said nothing to defend yourself? That makes it sound like you did. ",
            "Oldest of five here, 16 years older than the youngest. I babysat a Lot. Cleaned, I was mama zombieboobies. \n\nWhen I moved out my parents were shocked. It never occurred to them I might like my own bed and money one day. Basically, don't feel guilty.  Also, sorry your mom is immature and a little crazy, I know that feel too.  \n\nIf you occasionally feel like posting pics of your fabulous, clean life on Facebook, I don't think that would be such a bad thing.  Enjoy life. ",
            "I know this is recommended all the time here, but you really should check out /r/raisedbynarcissists, because her reaction sounds like a classic narcissistic response. I'm sure there were clues all along, but you might not have noticed because you always did what she wanted. If you check out the site and her behavior sounds familiar, keep in mind that the more you try to be nice to a narcissist, the meaner they are to you. If you're rude and dismissive, they tend to try to suck up to you. No idea why, but being nice doesn't pay in this case. ",
            "You 100% do not deserve any of her abuse. I am so sorry this is how she is acting. Please focus on the people who love you.",
            "Am so sorry to hear about your mother's reaction. It's hard when someone you love treats you so badly.\n\nRemember first, though, that you don't owe her anything. As people are fond of saying on r/relationships, you didn't ask to be born, your mother made that choice and at that point she had an obligation to take care of you. Again, you owe her nothing.\n\nYou have done much above and beyond the typical child as well. The amount of work you put into the house is admirable and something you should be proud of. Again, you owe her nothing.\n\nCheck-in with your siblings, explain to them what really happened. Ask them if your mom expected any of them to do what she's expecting you to do. \n\nTalk with your friends about this, lean on them. This is the time to get support from those around you. Again, sorry this had to happen, but your mom did this, not you. \n\nGood luck.",
            "Wow. That's a really strong and vicious response to not that big of a problem. That is some serious emotional manipulation and guilt-tripping. I bet if you sat down with a therapist or close friend as an outside observer and talked about your childhood you'll realize that this sort of thing was a lot more frequent than you thought. Emotional abuse can be very subtle; especially when it's all you know. People don't reach that level of emotional manipulation without practice.",
            "I'm very impressed OP. You're showing your younger siblings that it's ok to not cave in under pressure from mom (or anyone). You're doing the hard work now to ensure that you have the possibility of a healthy relationship with your mom down the road. You're staying strong in the face of bullying, manipulation and lies. You're my new hero. \n\nEveryone in this thread is right, stop calling her, and after that hateful post I'd block her (not your sibs) on Facebook too. Your brothers and sisters are going to go through the same thing the first time they cross her too, so leave the lines of communication open,  they'll see it eventually. Probably sooner now that you're not there. If anyone asks what's going on don't be shy, be honest and tell them. Being honest about boundaries is important and part of being an adult. \n\nKeep doing what you're doing, you are amazing.",
            "Im so sorry, OP. Thats awful and heart wrenching to go through. :(",
            "Sorry your mom is being so horrible.  \n\nEvery child at some point leaves the house and becomes independent, and she should be happy you've become an adult.  Instead, she's regretful that she lost her domestic staff.  She'd rather have you live as a live in maid and nanny instead of starting your own life.\n\nTry to maintain relationships with everyone in your family but your mom.  When they say your mom is telling them you did something bad, tell them that she's mad you wouldn't move back home to run the household for her.\n\nShe'll probably cool off in a few months once everyone adjusts to you living on your own and picking up the slack (or just accepting the mess), but if she doesn't reach out to you then don't include her in big life events (promotions at work, wedding, babies).  Invite everyone else, but not her.  If she asks, tell her you thought she wasn't interested because she hasn't been taking your calls and posting passive aggressive things on social media.  If she tries cutting you down again, tell her she's a disappointment as a mother because of her unrealistic expectations from her adult children and emotional manipulation.\n\nAlso, if things are still strained when she gets older, I'd push hard to put her in a home when you and your siblings are discussing what to do with her.  Don't take her in.",

See if you can reach out to them to meet for coffee once in awhile. They may just be used to not having you to talk to because you're busy cleaning.",
            "Maybe you need better defensive techniques against her spreading lies about that. When your sister says \"you did something bad against mom\" you ask \"do you really believe that?\" , or \"mom is mad at me for moving out, she is badmouthing me, hoping I will cave in and move back\". Straight up. Get it straight what has happened so there is that seed of doubt about the narrative your mother is telling. I'm sure they are more then aware of what your mom is like. \n\nAlso, I would forget about her. She is never going to change. She doesn't really care about you, she just wants you as her indentured servant she can fill with doubts about how you owe her. Saying you should pay her back for everything you cost growing up is her trying to set you back. Normal parents want their children to succeed but if you succeed she cannot get what she wants from you so she is trying make it impossible for you to be independent.  ",

It was awful.\n\nIt was house chores and also taking care of her brother, who was a drug addict. It's taken several years and the death of her brother to get her mom to come around and be mostly not abusive. \n\nMy missus went low contact with her mom for a long time... it was the best thing for her. Any time her mom would start a guilt trip, start yelling, or berating her, she would hang up the phone. She still called her mom just about every day unless she said something particularly nasty (which, I wouldn't. I'd probably call once a week, but her mom has severe depression... gf didn't want to just ignore her).\n\nReally sorry you're going through this, but it's not you... it's your mom. She's a narcissist and will do whatever it takes to get her way. She'll say \"it's all about you, it's all about what you want\" but in reality, it's all about her. It always has been, always will be.\n\nGo low contact, don't let her berate or insult you, better yourself. It's like drug addiction... you can't fix someone for them. All you can do is try to set a good example and hope they follow. Or you may even want to go no contact for a while... since she \"doesn't need\" you, which is right up there on the list of things you should never say to your children.\n\nAlso, I'd be sure to talk to the rest of the family... maybe not even about your mom, I'd be careful not to badmouth her too much, because then people might take sides... unless they know how your mom is. Just to check in with them and make sure they know you're not actually abandoning the family. \"Hey! How are you doing? I just got a new place here, you should stop by sometime. [optional] Mom's kind of upset, I think she's feeling the empty nest syndrome... I hope she comes around.. it was just time to start my adult life ;)\"\n\nI don't know how the rest of your relationship is with your mom... but if she's generally not abusive and shitty, I hope she really does come around.

            "What the hell! I'm sorry to say your mother sounds like a terrible person. How dare she guilt trip you into owing her for giving you a place to stay while growing up? That's a basic level of care you must give a child when you decide to have one, without any expectation of your child owing you something for that. Regarding college tuition and rent, if she really expected you to pay her back for this she should have explicitly outlined this at the time. She is obviously extremely selfish with no consideration for your aspirations. She would rather you flounder at home, dedicating your time to nannying a family of ostensible layabouts and couldn't give a hoot about squashing your endeavours to make a successful life for yourself.\n\nI *completely* understand why you would be upset about this. I cut both my parents out of my life over a year ago for their selfish behaviour and, while the reality that they only gave a crap about me to a certain extent that suited them was difficult at first, I'm now at a stage where I do not miss them *at all* and reflect on how much worse I actually used to feel whenever I was around them. If your mother doesn't apologise for her outrageously embarrassing and petulant behaviour of her own accord and drop this whole situation, I would honestly consider cutting her out. Perhaps you could write a letter to the rest of your family clarifying the situation as your mother is obviously lying about what happened (again, something I also experienced). Maybe a Facebook message to your siblings could work better as there's no chance that way of your mother intercepting a letter (though you mention you weren't all that close to your siblings so maybe you don't feel the need to).\n\nSorry you have to go through this, OP. I hope you have close friends around you who are supporting you through this and I promise the sad feeling you have will go away with time. Ultimately, there isn't much point keeping people like this who will drain you in your life.",

If it were me I would still try to have a relationship of some sorts with my mum and the rest of the family because the longer your time is spent without it the harder its going to be to get it back and reading what you have typed it seems like you do still want that. How you have that relationship I don't know. By the sounds of it your mum isn't normally like she has been of late and by the sounds of it a lot of that could be put down to stress.

A lot of parents would be proud that their daughter graduated and is able to support herself. You're an adult now. She can't control you any more, so it's not surprising that she's so frustrated. Hang in there. Like others said, she might stop trying to hurt you once she realizes this kind of behavior doesn't work. \n\nThere is one thing that people haven't mentioned.

The best way in my opinion to deal with this is to just keep trucking. Improve your life become better and better without them in it.

        "selftext": "Hi Reddit. I'm back with an update. Here's the original post. https://redd.it/4zn8ly\n\nThanks for all the responses you gave me on my first post. I think I needed a dose of reality, and that's what I got. \n\nAfter reading all the comments I realized I needed to talk to my mom. So when she came over, before she had a chance to say anything about Leah's eating habits, I took her aside and said \"enough. Leah is healthy and happy, and your weight comments are inappropriate. They stress me out and they're bad for Leah. If you keep making them, we're just not going to see you anymore.\" She sputtered a bit, but ultimately agreed to my terms. I was hopeful that maybe she would actually stop making the comments so we could have a somewhat normal relationship and she could continue to see Leah.\n\nHahaha.\n\nI work a part-time schedule of two days per week and every other weekend. This was my working weekend, so my husband was home with Leah. When I got home after work on Sunday, I could tell something was up. Leah was already in bed, and my husband looked really tense. He's usually a pretty laid back guy, so this was weird. \n\nWhen I asked what was up, he said we needed to talk about my mother. I had told him that I had spoken with her and that she had been warned not to make any more comments about Leah's weight. Well, apparently she just couldn't do it, because she called him (knowing I was at work) that day and told him that I was blind to Leah's problem and that he needed to get involved because I had confided in her that Leah's pediatrician told me she was at serious risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes and that we needed to change her diet so she would lose weight.\n\nWhat?!?\n\nFor the record, Leah's pediatrician has never said anything like that. In fact, as I mentioned in my last post, he has told me that she is underweight. Fortunately, my husband a) attends all Leah's doctor appointments and b) has the sense to realize that a rail-thin child isn't edging toward obesity, so he knew it was bunk. He told my mom that she wasn't to call again until she heard from me.\n\nWell, I was livid. It was like after years and years of weight-related crap from my mom something finally snapped. I called her and the minute she said \"hello\" I just lit into her. I told her that based on her behavior she was either delusional or a manipulative sociopath, and that either way she wasn't allowed around me or my kid again. I told her she was not welcome to call, e-mail, come over or send cards. Basically, we were going to pretend like she didn't exist. I hung up before she had a chance to get a word in edgewise.\n\nShe called fifteen times that night. I finally blocked her number on my cell and my husband's (we don't have a landline so this means she can't call us at all). I had three emails in my inbox the next morning, which I deleted without reading before blocking her email address as well. Finally, we had given her a key to our house for emergency purposes so first thing yesterday I had the locks changed then took Leah out for the day. Lo and behold, when we came home my neighbor said that my mom (she recognizes her because she used to come over a lot) had been banging on the door for almost half an hour earlier that day before storming off in a huff. I can only imagine how angry she was when she realized her key didn't work anymore.\n\nI feel better than I have in years, which makes me think I did the right thing. The only thing I'm still struggling with is how to break the news to Leah. She really does love grandma. My husband and I are going to sit down with her tonight, so I guess I have until then to figure out what to say.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Confronted mom, who was even crazier than I expected.",

Your mom is likely to escalate, so it's important that you talk to her school and any other caregivers, to make clear that she is not allowed to have contact with your daughter.\n\nYour daughter, at 5, is old enough to understand the concept of a time out. So you might tell her that grandma behaved badly and is in time out right now. You could also tell her that grandma is sick, the kind of sick that changes how people act, and so she cannot be around Leah until she gets well and acts nice again. But it might be a long time before Leah asks about your mom again; kids can be very \"out of sight, out of mind\" and they also pick up on tension and being picked on.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom constantly harassed me about my weight, much like your mom did. My mom didn't teach me healthy eating habits (she mostly fed me junk, and rewarded good behavior with sweets) but she constantly harassed me about being \"fat\" and \"out of shape\". As a result I spent my childhood and young adulthood convinced that I was fat, when I really wasn't fat at all. As a young woman I had a 24\" waist, weighed 115 pounds, but I thought I was fat and gross! My mom really warped my sense of what a normal body should look like, and of what *I* looked like, because of her constant harassment and weight-related abuse. \n\nLike your mom, my mom even lied to try to lend authority to her abuse. She told me that my dance teacher had taken her aside and said that I was getting \"too heavy\" and needed to lose some weight. I felt so, so awful about that, and it turned out that my dance teacher had said no such thing.\n\nMy mother kept harping on my weight and size until I was in my early 20s, at which point I told her \"I am not interested in your opinion on my weight or any aspect of my appearance. I did not ask for your input, so shut the fuck up.\" That felt really good :) \n\nMy endocrinologist told me that young people, especially women, who are abused this way are actually *more* likely to become obese as adults than are women who are allowed to just grow and be kids. He said that this kind of abuse makes women unable to make good food choices (because every choice involves anxiety) and it also makes them likely to eat too little, and then binge when their blood sugar gets low. This see-saw of blood sugar eventually causes insulin resistance, and *that* leads to obesity. Then obesity makes people *more* insulin-resistant- at that point it's a self-perpetuating cycle that becomes hard to break out of. So, your mom's abuse may have had long-term consequences for you, and you saved your daughter from that same fate.\n",

            "Good job! My grandmother has been obsessed with my sisters weight since she was a little chubby as a preteen. She harassed my sisters eating habits and made her feel worthless. She told her that any man she ever dated couldn't really love her because \"look at her\" (in my eyes my sister is beautiful big or skinny). My sister ended up becoming morbidly obese for several years due to stress eating and binging. When she was about 23, she decided to start a diet and exercise regimen. We all encouraged her, went on walks with her, ate her home cooked meals, cooked with her, but grandma still pointed out every flaw. My sister became anorexic and made herself throw up. To this day, my sister struggles with her eating disorder and body dysmorphia. She is now a healthy weight, sees a psychiatrist regularly, and exercises about three hours a week. My grandmother continues to make comments like \"wow your face has really filled out this month\" or \"it looks like you've gained some weight\" to this 5'4 130 lb former anorexic. It kills us. My mom tried so hard to focus on healthy eating and never mention weight when we were kids, but because my grandma was such a huge influence in my sister's life, it didn't matter.\n\nOne thing I am thankful for is that when my sister had her daughter (now 5) she vowed to never talk about losing weight and only speak of being healthy. It is really what pushed her to see a psychiatrist regularly because she never wants her little girl to go through what she goes through on a daily basis.",

Let this sink in over the next two weeks so that she calms down and realizes that her crazy actions have real, severe consequences.  Go to visit her and talk to her.  Don't give her your new number for you and your husband, don't give her a key.  I think occasional supervised visits with your Mom and Leah (with you present) are perfectly ok.  If she starts acting up, respond accordingly by taking Leah away.  You basically need to be the buffer between positive Grandma/Leah time and negative Grandma/Leah time.

        "selftext": "Original Post - https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/buei18/i_25m_asked_a_friend_29m_to_my_stag_do_wedding/\n\nMy original post got a handful of really helpful comments & wanted to start by thanking each of them for taking the time to help me realise the problem & how to make the best of the situation.\n\nSo I returned from my stag do yesterday. Absolutely quality weekend with great company, voice has gone a little & had the odd tipple. Wouldn't have changed anything about it, exactly what I was hoping for.\n\nSince the last post, I got a call from Fred last week while I was at work. At a time of day that is inconvenient for almost everyone with a 9-5 job, so I couldn't answer.\n\nI sent him a text message that evening, I decided to strip away anything that didn't get to the point: \"Hey dude, what's up?\", taking elements of the grey rock method which I've since learnt about. He replied two days later saying that he just wanted a catch up, I simply said I was looking forward to catching up on the stag do. I sent him a happy birthday message in the week, no response. That was it until the weekend.\n\nWhat I didn't know until we were on the stag do was he had been messaging my best man separately, and within the space of the week before had told him the following:\n\n- He wouldn't be able to arrive on the Friday, but would join on Saturday. (He ended up going out on Friday evening for birthday drinks with his partner & posted a picture onto Instagram)\n- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday morning activity, but would join in the afternoon.\n- He wouldn't be able to make the Saturday afternoon activity, but would be around in the evening.\n\nFred had only been messaging because some of the activities required deposits & my best man had been chasing him. I'm told he hadn't contributed any ideas or messages into the group while it was being planned.\n\nSaturday rolled around & I finally got a message from Fred saying he won't be coming. He said a family member had an operation in the week & had returned home yesterday.\n\nFirstly, I wish that family member a speedy recovery. To me, it doesn't matter the reasoning but more the fact that Fred waited until the last possible moment before once again letting me down. This has now happened dozens of times where Fred cancels, delays or says yes until the day & then ghosts us until we are all travelling home, this is far from the first time.\n\nCoupled with his Instagram picture the night before, which was presumably taken the day his family member got home, I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding, and will respond to his message today. \n\nIf Fred had messaged me last week saying he may not be able to come because reasons, I may have given him the benefit of the doubt. Waiting until the day to drop the news is normal for him.\n\nThe main reason alongside a poor communicator being I don't know this person anymore. He doesn't show any interest in keeping this friendship going and I am sure that if I dropped the rope we'd go to zero contact instantly. I've seen Fred once in 3 years & I was hoping inviting him to the stag do would kick him into gear, he's had 10 months to back out or tell me he may not have been able to. He was a big part of my enjoyment during university & I wanted to give him that chance.\n\nI already expected the stag do & wedding to be the last time I saw Fred as I was putting too much effort into the relationship for zero reward. It is such a shame that it happened how it did.\n\nI had the best group of guys with me all weekend & we had a blast the entire time, and am really looking forward to the wedding where I can get my family & friends together to celebrate with my  future wife & I. \n\nNo more negativity or stress over a friendship that finished a long time ago.\n\nTl;dr - Friend decided to let me know at the last moment he wouldn't be turning up, after dozens of similar instances I've decided to uninvite him from the wedding.",

            "This happened to my best friend by one of her bridesmaids (one of three very close friends acting as bridesmaids too so had a larger impact than one of like ten). She claimed she\u2019d love to be a bridesmaid but then took zero interest in helping the bride or even checking in to see how plans were going, didn\u2019t attend the hen do (cancelled literally a week before and asked for her money back after I\u2019d booked and paid for everything, also claimed it was too anxiety inducing but went to a different event with different friends the same day), then cancelled being a bridesmaid (4 weeks before the wedding after her dress had been bought etc). We\u2019d all been friends for over a decade but she had depression and anxiety for years that she\u2019d not done much to treat, and she kind of just expected us to accept when she bailed/couldn\u2019t keep commitments. Which is manageable if you didn\u2019t rely on her/didn\u2019t expect anything from her friendship but not acceptable when she\u2019d accepted being part of a wedding party. I think you\u2019re also more forgiving of things like that when you\u2019re 17 but by late 20s... not so much.\n\nAfter she cancelled on the hen do and asked me for the money back from the hen do, I said no as didn\u2019t want to be out of pocket and she text me asking if there was a problem because she was \u2018so fucking upset\u2019 about the situation. I was really honest and said the way she\u2019d treated the bride made me reassess the way she\u2019d treat me when I needed her, and that it was disappointing she was cancelling so late and had chosen to spend time with other friends over her oldest friend\u2019s hen do. She took that to mean I hated her and that I judged her for being mentally ill, swore at me and that was it - 4 text messages ended a 13-year friendship. She has now cut off the bride and groom too.\n\nShe needed a lot of emotional energy, patience and support but couldn\u2019t give it to others. What was really telling to me was that there was zero empathy for the bride or like \u2018I\u2019m so sorry I can\u2019t make it, I feel awful for bride but I just can\u2019t face it, I\u2019ll do something else nice for her that I can manage\u2019, it was just \u2018I\u2019M so upset about this situation\u2019. Also got her boyfriend to ring bride to cancel being a bridesmaid, she was \u2018too upset\u2019 to have that conversation herself.\n\nShe thinks I hate her but I don\u2019t - I\u2019m just honest with friends and she outright asked me if there was a \u2018problem\u2019 (and I\u2019d hope they are with me too) and she couldn\u2019t acknowledge her own behaviour, and instead jumped to me \u2018hating her\u2019 and \u2018thinking she\u2019s a bitch\u2019. And then cut everyone off.\n\nSo yeah idk, it sucks but honestly man it\u2019s not a loss to lose someone who doesn\u2019t want to/can\u2019t give you time or care about things important to you. They aren\u2019t really a friend to begin with.",
            "Been in this situation before. Honestly dude Fred doesn't give a shit about you, he has no sympathy or empathy for you and your other friends. You have been far beyond patient and reasonable with him. I cut my \"friend\" out of my life lonnnnnng before it got to this stage that you did with Fred. It sucks that someone you consider a friend is being so shitty towards you but you deserve better than this.",
            "TIL in the UK they call a bachelor party \"stag do\" and the bachelorette party the \"hen do\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP - Best of luck on the wedding mate! Don't sweat Fred. He's not a real friend and he will eb a long distant memory once you start making new great memories with your soon to be bride.",
            "I read your last post and think you're doing the right thing dropping this friendship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonest question, though: why bother uninviting him? He probably won't go to the wedding anyway. You've already spent so much energy on this guy. Is this for \"closure\"? Do you have a specific way you hope this will go? Because I don't think you will get anything out of a confrontation from him either. He won't see he was being a bad friend to you. He probably won't give you the reaction you are hoping for. If you think it will be cathartic to text him \"Don't come to my wedding\" and block him, so be it. But I wouldn't recommend pouring yourself onto a \"break up\" message to him because it does exactly what you said you don't want to do, which is to prolong stress and negativity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I wish you luck with whatever you decide to do. And congrats, I hope your day goes great!",
            "Fred clearly has something going on, and despite your efforts to be inclusive, he has opted to keep you out of the loop. Maybe he has crippling depression, maybe he is on drugs, maybe his wife is insanely jealous and has him just beaten down, maybe he has some kind of history with your fiancee and hates her,maybe he has social anxiety, maybe he found religion, who knows, at the end of the day, he hasnt included you, nor reached out to you, nor followed through on any commitments he has made. He hasnt even taken the time to go to a stag party, which is universally understood to be a big deal, the kind of thing that reminds you why old friends are old friends. It is disappointing, it leaves unanswered questions, but, people fade in and out of your life, and honestly, you never know who is going to stick around, and who wont. There are people I have known for 30+ years that were initially very periphery, but somehow ended up being where I was year after year, and others who were like brothers to me, real honest deep friends who went through a lot with me, that have faded out of view, occasionally due to bad blood, but usually just circumstance and time and luck.\n\nSorry Fred seems to have bailed, if it is important to you, you could send him an email saying that you are sorry he cant seem to make any of the commitments he makes, and that you dont know what is going on, but that you would prefer a no, to being blown off. If you are so inclined, offer to be there if he is in trouble and needs someone to talk to, or if you are just too emotionally caught up in getting married at the moment, dont. You arent going to believe me, but you are getting married and your whole life is about to change. Society treats a married man different than a 25 year old single guy, your friends will change, your lifestyle will change. I wouldnt spend too much more time on Fred. If you need to cut him loose do it, otherwise, you know he isnt coming, but he might send a gift.\n\nBest wishes to you and your Bride to be!",
            "I think Fred might be dealing with something like depression or anxiety. That\u2019s what it was for me when I was at my flakiest. It\u2019s not an excuse; he should decline your invitations and avoid making promises about social things. But it does mean it\u2019s not personal. Whatever he\u2019s going through isn\u2019t about you. His actions are disrespectful and hurtful, but it\u2019s likely he values your friendship as much as he can right now. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t drop the friendship. It just means you shouldn\u2019t feel bad about yourself because of his actions.",
            "Yeah Fred hasn't been your friend for years tbh. Anyone who would treat someone this badly is trash. And surely it would have been so much easier to just say he couldn't make the stag rather than all these stupid games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis behaviour makes no sense and I can only guess (i) you aren't the same importance to him as he is to you, which means you are the friend he cancels if something else comes up (including tying his shoes apparently) (ii) its something to do with his girlfriend, controlling etc perhaps or (iii) he's mentally unwell and doesn't see bailing last minute as anything other than a manifestation of that (which should be fine, right, he can't help it /s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure it really matters, even if both the last two were true, there's no need for you to keep putting your feelings last to accomodate him. Enjoy your wedding, bye Fred!\n\nps I'd also tell him why he's uninvited, I can't quite tell if you ever articulated how much all of this was upsetting/annoying you. Now's as good a time as any!",
            "I'm glad everything else went so well.\nUnfortunately there are people who choose to end their social lives as soon as they're partnered up. Having friends was just a means to distract thenselves from the loneliness of being single. Now he doesn't need that anymore.\nI hope you can appreciate the good times you guys had but you're very right to cut this guy off. He WANTS dumped, he just doesn't have the balls to be direct about it.",
            "Is he perhaps depressed? Some people go no show or make 100s of execuses when they fall into a rut of depression but they don't admit it even to themselves. They only do the necessary social events and even so don't use his social media photos as a yardstick for his happiness. \n\nThen again maybe he is just an ass. I just thought to put it out there because I went through a phase like that without realising it. I couldn't say no because I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings even though I really I didn't want to go. So you leave it for the last minute and come up with a lame excuse when it's too late for anyone to try convince you. \n\nAll the best to you and your wife to be OP.",
            "Sometimes friends out grow each other and they don't really need to meet that much anymore .  I have a ex coworker who always whenever we meet up randomly, says hey contact me again and let's do something.  I did tell him that's fine contact me, but then he throws it back on me and says, oh why don't you contact me about it? and of course I just ignore it because the last time we plan to do something he backed out on the day of, and seeing him make no effort to be the one to contact me after being the one who suggested to get together , shows me that he would just do the same thing again \n\nlike you said it's okay to interact and communicate as long as we don't have any expectations and as far as Mike ex-coworker and I,  I have no expectations for him.  Seems like your friend is this way too.",
            "I read both your posts, it doesn\u2019t seem clear whether you\u2019ve actually confronted him about being so flaky...? Have you ever don\u2019t that?",
            "Read the original and what Fred has done is not far off how I have behaved these last few years. I appreciate the experience from the other side. Thanks for sharing man. I really need to get my shit together.",
            "I had a friend like this. We worked together for years and always texted each other when we weren\u2019t at work. I\u2019d always invite her to things outside of work  and she just never showed. Didn\u2019t matter what it was, even low key stuff with only a couple people she would bail after saying she would be there. I wouldn\u2019t even have invited her to my wedding but she was so excited to come! So I did. She said she bought a dress and I even saw on my registry she bought a gift for us. To be honest, As soon as I saw that I added another one of those gifts to the registry hoping someone else would buy it for us. \n\nYea, she didn\u2019t show.... I never heard from her again. I sometimes wonder what she did with the gift she bought us... I guess just kept it for herself?\n\nLong story short... people are like this and no matter what you can\u2019t change them. You did the right thing.",
            "From reading your previous post I gather a couple things.\nEither he's really inconsiderate, and bad at communicating, or he has major depression and anxiety issues.\nIn the last couple years I developed major depression, but my life couldn't come to a hault. I still needed to work, make money and live, but it's exhausting and I didn't often have the energy to reach out or get back to people (which gave me even more anxiety and made me feel like a shitty person)\nOne thing to note is that even though you may see someone smiling or posting a picture doing something fun, doesn't mean they aren't depressed or don't go home and cry themselves to sleep. Just something to think about.\n\nThat being said, his mental health, or whatever the problem may be, isn't YOUR problem. You already tried your best, so time to let the friendship run its course and die out. I definitely think you should let him know how much you've disappointed him though, and bring up his pattern of procrastination and ghosting. Just because you have problems or are busy isn't a free get out of jail card for treating people poorly and not having to deal with your own flaws",
            "Your \"friend\" might might be having money problems which may be triggering anxiety. \n\nAll the meetups and events you posted in both your posts involve spending money. Sometimes even just going out for a drink can be costly to someone struggling with money. \n\nSometimes someone might look good on paper or social media but behind that is someone in a financial mess. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. But your friend isn't telling you the whole story. It could be shame, it could be a control thing from his partner, it could be he is really bad with money and makes plans but when it comes down to it he's broke and makes up an excuse to blow you off instead of telling the truth. \n\nIf he doesn't want to tell you what is going on then there is not much you can do. \n\nHave a great wedding with the people who love and support you!",
            "I recently had to say no to a bachelorette party for a wedding I was a bridesmaid in. I was about 9 weeks pregnant at the time and puking multiple times a day, not really able to eat much, and exhausted. I explained this to the bride and she was completely understanding. \n\nIf you need to not attend something, have a good reason and just say you can\u2019t come.

Boy, did he get a justified earful!!\n\nScrolling down the comments, I don't really understand the people defending Fred - yeah, there might be something going on like depression, but that's not an excuse to be an asshole... They might think you're petty for un-inviting your \"friend\", but my husband's \"buddy\" owns a coffee franchise, and I've been boycotting the entire chain for years, so yeah, you're not petty \ud83d\ude05\n\nGood on you for standing up for yourself - I hope you're wedding is beautiful and your marriage even more so!!",
            "Not to be rude, but maybe Fred doesn't like you anymore.  That would suck, but it could happen.  Maybe he's bummed you won't leave him alone and he's just trying to be nice.\n\nWhen y'all meet face to face he has to keep up appearances but he really wishes you would leave him alone.\n\nMaybe it's time to move on.\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as mean or rude. I just read everything and had to wonder if maybe that is the answer.",
            "I have a strong feeling that something is going on with Fred's mental health. I have lost interest in friendships, and slowly ghosted people I'm not interested in being friends with before, and the one thing I would never do is call them, or make any attempt at initiating a conversation with them. The fact that he does, even if he stops communicating very quickly, shows that he still cares about you. I'm not sure what advice to give you, as it is hard to get a friend you rarely have contact with to open up about what is going on in their lives, but I would suggest you not do anything as harsh as disinviting him from the wedding. If he doesn't show, so be it, it sounds like that's what is likely to happen anyways. And it doesn't risk further harm to whatever his mental state may be.",
            "it sounds like something is very wrong in his world and doesn't know how to talk about it. My brother in law is majorly depressed right now and skipped his best friend's wedding because of it. it was last minute and I was disappointed in him but it was 250 miles away and the day after my niece's graduation. so I kinda get it. \nhave you told him you are worried about him? have you asked why he's canceling so much? it doesn't sound like any of you are really communicating your frustrations and disappointments. \nI lost a dear friend after not communicating that her new bff (that hated me and wasn't shy about it) made me uncomfortable and anxious to be around. I should have just told her but didn't and I wasn't invited to the wedding and she doesn't speak to me anymore.",
            "Sounds like what happened to my husband's first choice of best man. Dude didn't even show up to our wedding even though he and his gf had rsvp'd. Neither did a mutual friend of theirs. Mutual friend is moving out of state. They sent my husband a Facebook invite to going out on the town to say goodbye. They didn't send me one. \n\nThey sent my husband a text asking if he was coming. My husband responded saying he doesn't go out barhopping anymore (cause we don't. It's expensive and neither of us enjoy drinking) but of they would like to come over to our place (a 5 minute walk from many bars) and smoke a bowl, they were welcome to. Obviously they didn't actually care about the friendship, unless it got them free drinks or someone else to enable their shitty behavior (the white guy of the group frequently used the n word and they are both generally mysoginistic). And since my husband does brother of things and hasn't for a while, they didn't care anymore. And that sucks. But now we know we don't have to waste any time, energy, or thought on them outside of a cautionary tale.",
            "I don't want to jump to conclusions but just from personal experience is it possible that your friend is using drugs? I ask because as someone who use to be very out going and would attend all parties/get-togethers but when I started to become addicted to my pain medication ( back issues) all those things about me changed. I became very introverted and didn't believe it when friends and family would mention it. Looking back now they were absolutely right the deeper my addiction became the more introverted in became. I had 3 wedding to attend in a months time and I was so late to all of them that I missed the ceremony to all of them and showed up after the reception had already started. Worst part was one of those was my older brother's wedding and our younger brother had just passed away just months before. I didn't see the big deal at the time but now I realize what me being there meant to him. You know your friend and maybe this is way off base( I was someone who didn't even drink and would have never become addicted to drugs) but I just wanted to bring to your attention that this can also the behavior of an addict. On another note..  Congratulations to the bride and groom to be.",
            "I dated a Fred. We got along famously when we actually hung out, but he was so flaky and when we weren't in the same room together I felt like he had absolutely no interest in me. It made me crazy. Some people are just like this, and whether he's dealing with debilitating anxiety or something, or is just an asshole who doesn't give a shit about your feelings, the outcome is the same-- an unfair amount of stress and disappointment on your part. It's hard to let go of someone like this when you have so much fun with them in person, but ultimately it's for the best.",
            "I had a similar friend. It's a weird sort of conflict avoidance. They simply don't have it in them to say \"no\", instead finding it easier to apologize and offer a weak excuse. I was actually with my friend a few times when she ghosted other people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLife is much less stressful when you don't have expectations of flaky people.",

            "Similar thing happened to me too. My best friend of 8 years, we've been through a lot over the years in school, and after that life had thrown us in different directions. Literally. I tried to keep up with her through social media, but no dice. Every single time I would text her, she would be either extremely busy, or about to hang out with friends, so our conversations stopped after 3 sentences. She would always reassure me that She is often online, yet she never, not even once reached out to me. It has been 9 years since we went separate years, we met up once about a month or so after that happened. Even then I was invited, and I still remember it clearly, because \"I'm meeting up with a friend, you might as well join us\". I religiously tried to keep up our friendship for years, but I only saw her again once, in passing 4 years after (we waved from different sides of the road, and that was that), and after that I noticed that she stopped doing the only thing She did, which was writing happy birthday on fb. I still did for a couple years, but her bd two days ago was the third one where i didn't, because why bother?\n\nShe obviously dropped me like hot coals the moment we didn't see each other out of necessity,  and I don't want to spend energy on useless things. She may have been going through something ( which I highly doubt), but even so, She could have at least said something. Same with your friend. If he doesn't want to keep up with you, then it's a good thing that you stopped carrying this burden on yourself.",
            "I had something. Opposite? Happen before. \n\nA friend was getting married and wanted me in her wedding party. She made zero effort telling me what was going on even when i asked. \n\nEventually she messaged me saying i was out of the wedding party for not partaking in any of the activities they were doing. Apparently she was annoucing said activities in a facebook group that she hadn't added me to. And never bothered answering my messages. (But for whatever reason had a fit and told all her wedding party that i simply saw and ignored posts in a group i wasnt part of)\n\nI mean she never made much effort before then to hang out on the rare occasions I'd be coming home either. So theres that. \n\nIt sucks to have to cut off a friendship. But if they were really your friend, it wouldnt be like pulling hens teeth to get an answer. Its awful to have to put all the effort into a friendship. What happened here was honestly just him not caring enough to make an effort. And its good that you decided to cut him off. He's never going to bother putting an effort in. So you shouldnt have to either.",
            "I know that it is a hard thing to process considering you lost a friendship that you cherish a lot. But, I am happy that you've realized the value that Fred brings to your friendship (or lack thereof) and that you're treating it in a mature manner. You don't want any negativity for your big day (for example if he bails on your wedding last minute). The fact that he valued his partner's birthday over an event that you had been planning for 10 months, shows that he's just an acquaintance and not a friend and he doesn't value your friendship nearly as much as you do.",

It's a real bummer and it hurts my heart, but I am also glad that I won't have people at my wedding that don't give a shit about me. And Fred's behavior says he doesn't give a shit about you.

She waited until three days before the wedding to say she wasn't coming, citing finances, which would have been fine if she wasn't a bridesmaid and had messaged her sooner. Thankfully my niece was still able to come even though my sister refused to take her shopping for a dress and her father (they're divorced) finally did about two weeks before the wedding.   \n\n\nThe kicker was when I messaged my sister the day after the wedding to let her know how gorgeous my niece was and she snapped and said, \"I wouldn't know, nobody sent me any pictures.\" Instead of saying what I wanted to say which was, \"You chose not to come, you were invited and included\", I said \"I hardly used my phone all night (which was true, I took one video of the first dance). Mom has some up on her FB page if you care to look.\" We haven't spoken since.  \n\n\nAnd she wonders why I don't talk to her anymore. It's just one of many, many, many, many, many reasons.

            "Kinda late to throw my two cents in, but I'll do it anyway.\n\nI definitely think you're doing the right thing by uninviting Fred, he's not putting the work into your relarionship that you've made it clear that you need, and is negatively impacting your life because of it. And, dude, you're getting married! That's awesome! Definitely not the time you need unneccessary drama.\n\nI actually disagree with the people jumping to the \"he lacks empathy, doesn't care about you\" conclusion, tho. It's definitely a possibility, but as someone who's done similar things as what Fred is doing (never when deposits were involved, tho, or I still paid what I agreed to before), I wanted to say that there's a really good chance he's struggling with something right now. This doesn't justify his actions - I still feel terrible for how I behaved and how it impacted my relationships - but I've found that looking through that kind of scope rather than \"he's such an asshole\" makes it easier not to take it personally.\n\nRegardless of the reason, you don't owe it to him to keep him around, and his behavior DEFINITELY doesn't reflect on you. So please, focus on you and your soon-to-be spouse, and live your life to the fullest!",

            "I can't help but feel you are taking this way too personally. This happens. People come and go. It seems you are very bitter about Fred having other priorities and you should have stopped nagging him a very long time ago. I don't know why you are bothering to un-invite someone you know isn't coming to the wedding. This just feels spiteful.\n\nI suggest you take a moment to consider if you are doing this because you feel you need to, or if you just feel slighted/rejected. Be grateful for your time with Fred, but understand that he just doesn't have the same commitment to the relationship as you do. He'll pass by the wayside. Other people will stick around. This will be a theme throughout your twenties and thirties as people settle into new lifestyles.",
            "Something is going on with Fred and his SO. I'm going to provide a different point of view to the rest Of thread here: I'm guessing she's not invited to this wedding? She was also not invited to any of the meet ups beforehand? And the stag do was on her birthday (the second birthday of hers that they've spent together)? It's not as though they've spent a dozen birthdays together. From that alone, I'd confidently guess that there is a lot of pressure from the SO to not go to your wedding or stag do. It's common to not see someone as often when they are in the honeymoon phase - was Fred supportive when you started your relationship with your SO? Did Fred include her or did he insist on lots of 'boys only' events?",

May or may not be an abusive situation. It's just interesting that this girl shows up and he poofs. \n\nI think uninviting him is a good move because it's less stress on you and your fiance. If he did come, with her, things may get hectic.\n\nI only say all that because I know someone who had me doing the same thing to MY friends. His friends, we were there.

You invited him and wanted to stay friends, he didn\u2019t. It sounds like you\u2019re in love with him or something. You have a great girl and many other friends. Who cares why he doesn\u2019t want to be friends. It\u2019s his loss. MOVE ON",
            "So what did Fred say when you uninvited him!",
            "I think you're being too sensitive honestly. If he doesn't show up, he doesn't show up. No need to start confrontation and break up with a friend because he cancelled plans a few times.",
            "You know no family member got an operation, right?\n\nStop spending one ounce of emotional energy on this guy. Tell him that he\u2019s off the invite list and have a nice life.",
            "I am Fred. (Not literally.)\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t think I ever have or would ever allow things to get to this point, I am ashamed to say that I have done miniature versions of this to people.\n\nIt usually happens when I still love the person and value them, but (for whatever reason: time, distance, unexpressed feelings that have been affecting the friendship) feel that I\u2019ve outgrown the degree of closeness we once shared. I don\u2019t want to have a conversation about how the friendship is effectively \u201cover,\u201d because ...it\u2019s not. I still feel affection and want to honor the bond. But, by \u201chonor the bond,\u201d I mean allow it to rest in peace and dignity where it currently sits.\n\nYou and Fred don\u2019t sound like you were *actually* a close part of one another\u2019s lives anymore, although you do sound very important to one another. This can be a very difficult thing for the person in Fred\u2019s position, too.  How do you say that to someone who keeps pushing to maintain a formal friendship? It makes it sound like the basis for a friendship is over, when it isn\u2019t. It has just shifted.\n\nIt sucks that he wasn\u2019t straightforward about it, and that he let it grow into \u201cI\u2019m showing up to your wedding\u201d only to ghost. But...he\u2019d been pretty clear in every other way that he wasn\u2019t prioritizing smaller hang outs or attempts at communication, so I am not that surprised that he would fail to prioritize a much larger one. He had been trying to downgrade into a much more casual friendship for a long time. This is not someone you pick for your wedding party. \n\nIf his friendship was once important in your life, the way to honor that with a person who is (albeit passively) begging you for a less formal friendship is A. allow for a less formal friendship and B. keep casually circulating in that person\u2019s life when it\u2019s convenient for both of you to do so. That\u2019s it. \u201cHey man, I\u2019m in town for a day. Wanna grab a beer?\u201d NOT \u201cWill you take on the responsibility of being in my wedding?\u201d Not to come down hard on you, but it is clear (because you guys weren\u2019t really talking or hanging out) that you have *no idea* the ins and outs of this person\u2019s life anymore. This fact alone makes it kind of treacherous to ask him to take on the stag-do. \n\nPeople grow apart and they get busy, distracted, and tired as they grow up. He has a different life now, one with a job, an apartment, a partner, and who knows what else. It\u2019s clear that those things are his priority now. \n\nI guess I\u2019m saying this in the hopes that you won\u2019t internalize this as something that\u2019s \u201cabout you,\u201d or write off the whole thing as \u201cnever really a friendship.\u201d The end result of this was very shitty and probably not forgivable, but you can learn from the experience rather than just writing it off as something that\u2019s completely \u201con him.\u201d It\u2019s not. It\u2019s on you, too.\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "You did the right thing. The ways he acts (minus making promises and appointments only to cancel), is similar how someone would act when they had no interest in staying in touch. You basically became acquaintances and then strangers.\n\nI never quite can understand how people can make promises and constantly renegade on it. Normally people would feel apologetic and bad / ashamed about it. And they would certainly not keep making promises and cancelling it at the last minute. \n\nPeople change. Fred clearly has. I would not make any attempt to stay in touch with him. Delete his contact info and if he sends a message, you can always reply out of politeness, but seen he had no problem constantly ghosting, I would not feel that sorry about doing the same. You're not friends anymore after all. And it is a pointless exercise to stay in touch with someone who could care less.",
            "Well done, I think you're making the right decision here. Can I ask how you phrased the uninvitation message?",
            "Weddings really stress me out. I'm super happy for the couple and support their marriage, I will send a gift but I do not want to go to the wedding let alone participate in a full weekend of events. I'm sorry I'm not going to be able to make it. Doesn't mean I don't want to end our friendship. I can communicate this now but it's taken me a long time. Fred is a busy guy and he failed you by not communicating. I'm sorry it stressed you out. Maybe one day you guys can be friends again but he may have burned the bridge.",
            "...sounds petty to me. a stag and doe is a just another cash grab from friends and family...then there is the wedding which is another big gift.",
            "Fred's SO is controlling as fuck and throws a fit whenever he wants to do something without her. He makes up excuses to not poison the well.  You will probably find out about all the details in about 5 years but by then the friendship is pretty much done.",
            "OK, what is a stag do and hen do? this the bachelor and bachelor party? Similar experience, if you need to put 100% of the effort then its probably a one way friendship street. Just uninvite and move on with your real friends.",
            "Are you a fucking woman?",
            "I've been in this situation before, but with a boyfriend - he was a decent guy, but simply did not prioritize me. I could write pages about how he treated me but in the end I'll just say that several years after I broke with him we ran into each other at an event and he wholeheartedly apologized for how much of a jerk he'd been.\n\nGood on you for respecting yourself - a friend who acts like that is no friend at all.",
            "What a shitty friend. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not inviting him to wedding anymore. This should be the last straw on this one sided relationship. Cheers to getting married and enjoy it with all of your true mates!",
            "People have their own shit going on dudes probably depressed, addicted to drugs? Busy with more important shit? Probably thinks your a wanker but dosnt want to hurt your feelings or just can't be fucked and that's ok. People change life goes on!",
            "You sound like a woman."
