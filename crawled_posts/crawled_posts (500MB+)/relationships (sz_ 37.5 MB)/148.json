        "selftext": "Dan and I have been married for 3 years and 8 months ago welcomed our amazing son into the world. He was very planned and wanted and motherhood had been transformative for me. I was able to take 4 1/2 months maternity leave before going back to work. Without going into too many details, we both work white collar jobs that require professional attire. A normal work day look for me is a skirt or pair of slacks, a silk blouse, pumps or boots depending on the weather (but always with a heel because I'm 5 foot nothing), maybe a blazer if I have a big meeting. Dan wears a suit almost everyday. I also style my hair and do some makeup for work everyday. This is what I wore before our son was born and what I continue to wear. \n\nDan and I are pretty even in sharing parenting duties. I tend to take mornings because I'm more of a morning person that Dan. A normal morning for me starts early, short workout, shower, get baby up, get ready, get baby ready and baby off to Dan because the daycare is on Dan's way to work. I'm normally dressed at the tail end of this process but I keep my robe on over my clothes in case my son wants to give my outfit something to remember him by on our way out the door. \n\nFor the last month or so, Dan has been more irritable than normal in the morning. There have been side comments if he gets up and I'm drying my hair or getting dressed- basically if I'm not 100% focused on my son in the am. Our son is happy playing and supervised so I just chalked it up to morning moodieness but it's been getting worse. \n\nLast night I brought it up in what I thought was a neutral, non confrontational way. Basically his answer was this:  his mom was 100% a mom after her kids were born. She gained a fair amount of weight after she had kids and never tried to lose it. She wore sweatpants everyday and works a job where she wears a uniform so if she wasn't in her work uniform she was in sweats and a tshirt. She never did her hair or make up. Her entire identity was being a mom and she's shared with me how hard it was to watch her kids start their own lives. Dan thinks I don't care about our son as much as he does since I worked on losing the baby weight and still put effort into my appearance. \n\nI feel like keeping this part of my identity actually helps me be a better mother. I love my son but I'm still me and I still have the things I like to do. Dressing wel my identity actually helps me be a better mother. I love my son but I'm still me and I still have the things I like to do. Dressing well, blowing out my hair and doing my make up are therapeutic to me. Now that being said, my son is my life  and if I knew that not doing those things but guarantee him a happy healthy life I would stop immediately.  I told Dan that my son and I have our morning routine and he gets lots of time and attention before I go to the office. Dan said he wasn't looking to fight but he just wanted me to think about my priorities and my time management. \n\n Is it normal for new moms to totally sacrifice all the things you like to do? Is this a sign of something deeper I need to address with my husband?\n\nTL;DR:  my husband thinks because I take my time to get ready every morning, I'm not as good of a mother as it could be. ",

            "Is he planning on going full dad? With growing beer belly, backwards hat, khaki shorts, and dad joke tshirt?? This is so strange. Maybe he just thought all women stopped caring about themselves after having a child? Either way you guys should definitely talk and you should tell him that taking care of yourself is healthy and important to you.",
            "He should stop projecting his views of motherhood and memories of his own mom onto you. It's inaccurate and just a little creepy. It sounds like you're spending time with your kid, so he has nothing to complain about. \n\nI can't even begin to attempt the amount of logical gymnastics that would get me to think that dressing like a slob means you somehow love your kid more.",
            "I would ask him if he can name one area or task that you need to improve on, related to actually mothering your baby and not what he thinks a good mom looks like physically. Are you not quick enough about changing his diaper, are you inattentive when he needs to be held? Husband's being totally unreasonable if he can't name a real result.",
            "Tell him you expect him to wear sweatpants, gain weight, only talk about his son, never go on nights out, or he's not a good enough dad. Sound insane and unreasonable? Exactly. \n\nAlso, frankly it's good that you're addressing it now. Don't let him bully you into isolation or more than your fair share of family duties. He is not a mum, he doesn't get to dictate how you are a mum. Retaining your independence and sense of self is immensely important at this point in your life. You are more than a childcare vessel, just as he is more than that. \n\nAlso point out that you aren't his mother. Frankly it's weird that he wants to remake you in her image.",
            "> he just wanted me to think about my priorities and my time management\n\nTell him you've thought about it, and you'd really like him to articulate what critical baby needs he feels you're neglecting in the time it takes you to get through your morning routine.  Does he really think you wouldn't drop everything and go attend to your son in case of an emergency?  And how exactly does he feel that he is a better person today for his mom not having taken the time to get dolled up every now and then?  Or if he does think your kids would benefit from having a parent who's less career-focused, why does that obligation fall to you and not him when he's the one who feels so strongly about it?\n\nHaving a baby changed your lives: it didn't change who *you* are, and you are a working woman who wants to present herself professionally while she's on the job.  If that's a problem for him, then the two of you do need to have a substantive discussion about where these expectations are coming from and exactly what he thinks your priorities should be.  Especially if you're planning on having more kids.  Because if this is what he expects of you, imagine what kind of example he's going to try and set for your daughters.",
            "This is how marriages crash and burn. Couples turn into only mom and dad with the kids being the entire focus and there being no individual or couple identity. Caring about how you look doesn't make you any less of a mom.  He sounds insecure.",

            "Wait, so...he's...upset that you're not gaining weight permanently, wearing sweatpants and a tshirt, letting your makeup/hair go, and giving up on your career and outside hobbies?\n\nI...I don't understand. Why??? Why wouldn't he be happy and proud to keep the woman he fell in love with the same way after introducing a child into the equation? Is he projecting onto you his own insecurities about his mom (the way some mothers get angry at \"fit moms\" for setting the bar too high or whatever)? Does he think that you working to stay fit and look nice means that you can't do your motherly duties? I wonder if his mother ever used to complain/trash talk in front of him when he was a child, like \"Oh I gained so much weight, but that's because I care about you guys so much. Julia's mom is well dressed but that's because she never sees her kids\" or \"Poor Bob, his mom is never home, look at her always running around. She spends more time fixing her hair than paying attention to him!\"\n\nI see in your comments that you do most of the morning work taking care of your son. Maybe try sitting him down and drawing up a list of how you guys spend your mornings. Gently ask him, \"Why is it that you can shower and leave while only doing X, whereas I do Y, Z, A, B, and C, but that's not enough because I also manage to be efficient enough to take care of myself?\"",
            "You need to tell him \"I am not your mom, and while I'm sure your mom was a great mother, her way is not the only way.  I am going to be a great mom in my own way.\"  \n\nYou shouldn't have to discard who you were to be a mom, and the good news is that you don't.  Tell him that if he has *specific* problems with the way you are parenting then you will consider them in a reasonable discussion, but that you won't tolerate any more implications that not acting like his mother means you aren't being a good mother.

If it doesn't make a difference to how your son is treated, why can't you treat yourself and do your makeup etc. It's not like you're spending all that time and ignoring your son.. I don't really get why he equates how someone looks with how good of a mother they are. Even if his mom was how you described, there are so many others who are good mothers but also take care of themselves.\n\nIf it's not affecting your son, I don't see why you would need to change what you're doing.

            "Huh, you would think he would be happy you are trying to look good.  I think he feels insecure, but whatever it is you are not getting the full story.  I suggest you go to couples counseling so you can get to the bottom of this.\n\nBy the way you are doing nothing wrong, everything you said makes sense you sound like a good mom.   ",
            "Please know that this is not a \"You aren't a good mother\" problem. This is a \"Your husband is sexist and unreasonable\" problem. You are not your husband's mother and frankly, it's creepy and a little Oedipal that he wants you to be. What was his relationship with his father like growing up? I obviously don't know your situation, but if his parents had traditional gender roles, I'm guessing he was expecting you to do 90% of the parenting.\n\nYou sound like a great mom.

            "...what the fuck??\n\nI see so many men come here complaining about their wives/girlfriends doing *exactly what your husband wants you to do*. The spark is gone from their relationships because the woman has gone completely from \"lover\" to \"mom\", with zero overlap. I was literally advising a man on this very issue earlier today. And your husband *wants* that?? \n\nHe can fuck right off. If you're happy and confident, and spending *quality* time with your child (as opposed to quantity for the sake of quantity), then your kid will be happy and confident. And your husband should be *thrilled* that you're able to balance momming, careering and looking damn good. \n\nThis one is a complete headscratcher.",
            "Does Dan feel like your son is being neglected in some way? If you are able to juggle watching your son, losing baby weight, and looking good, then more power to you! Being a mom doesn't have to mean you look tired and frumpy all the time. If he thinks your son isn't being cared for properly, that's a different discussion, but how you look and dress shouldn't have anything to do with it. ",
            ">  Dan thinks I don't care about our son as much as he does\n\nDoes he wear sweats every chance he gets and doesn't try to have a life outside his child? Doubtful. He's being a kind of sexist hypocrite, and yeah you should address that with him.",

            "I'm the daughter of a mother who devoted her entire lives to her children. It sounds awesome, but trust me, it was hell. I'm 29 now and still in therapy trying to deal with understanding my childhood. \n\nWhat happened was that my mom lost whatever identity she had once she had kids. And our happiness was her happiness, but not in a good way. I remember sneaking deodorant into my backpack because I was too scared to ask her for some. She found it, and I still remember the look on her face- pure disappointment and hurt. I was 13. \n\nI was never taught how to do my hair. Never taught how to do makeup (still learning) and I was never encouraged to be my own person because she was not HER own person. And every time I tried- listening to gangster rap (and the CATS soundtrack because yes) or or wanting to buy clothes from The Limited Too (instead of wearing what she bought me) I felt a *tremendous* amount of guilt. \n\nYOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. I wish, even to this day, my mom had some sort of identity. She still struggles, but I can't be part of it anymore. I want so badly for her to find herself and be happy and it hurts my heart so much when I think about it, but for my own health and sanity I just had to really go low contact and be very vigilant on the topics of conversation. \n\nThere's so much more I could say, but I want you to know that this could potentially be the alternative. Your son will grow up being able to discover himself, have confidence, stand up for himself and be a good person because he will be watching you and you will encourage it through your actions. \n\n",

            "I'm going out on a limb here but maybe it has very little to do with you and more with him. Maybe he's having trouble finding a balance between work and home. Then he remembers how much his mom sacrificed. He probably is also surrounded by men whose wives have also sacrificed their careers. He knows he signed up for this and instead of telling you how he's struggling he's lashing out at you. Either way what he was saying is not productive and just hurtful.

It helped her feel good to go and ready for the day.  It helped her feel like a woman and a wife, not just a mom.  And she is just the type to care about her health and general appearance.

I kind of got the feeling that maybe his whole \"priorities\" and being a Mom speech might be that he isn't as on board with the way parental duties are being split? For instance, does he wish you were working less and taking over more of the parenting while he worked more? I'm not saying that should happen, but his response seems to me like he's making this about your dress and all this to avoid talking about what's really bothering him. I kind of doubt this is really about your dress. It seems to be some kind of symbol for something else for him. \n\nI think this is a situation where you might want to have him read this thread.

She dressed and appeared professional- and for most women, that involves pretty much what you stated : slacks or a skirt, a blouse, heels, and the occasional blazer. \n\nYour husband's being unreasonable.

I always said to myself \"she could have done with some hobbies or a career to maintain her identity a bit better\".\n\nI think you're doing great, OP. Raising your son the way you are allows him to develop a healthy relationship with you (independent but still close), and him seeing his mother AND father being working parents will do wonders for his views about women and men and equality in relationships. Not saying that a more traditional setup would instill him with sexist beliefs, I just personally think you set a great example, it just happens to be that you are a career mother that is the framework for the example you set.\n\nYou and your husband need to sit down and talk this out. I think he's probably feeling resentful over the way he was raised, and he's taking that out on you. His mother was probably a bit overbearing and he's basically interpreting your parenting style as you showing his mother up. You work hard, you work out and wear makeup etc. whereas his mother didn't. I think he's comparing the two of you far too much and you need to have a discussion about parenting and how he views you.",

What about as parents?\n\nHis comments sound to me like he wants you to be a SAHM.  Or at least he's realizing that's how he believes it should work and anything less isn't 'the best' for the children.  Maybe this is taking him by surprise.  Sometimes these kinds of beliefs are subconscious until you stumble upon situations that trigger them.  Or maybe he assumed that you'd magically become a SAHM after your child was born.\n\nEither way, you two need to sit down and talk about this.  Ask him the pointed questions about what you're supposedly not doing that should be done better.  Ask him what about what he does/does not do.  Talk about expectations and roles again if you've already done this.  Reiterate that you think you've done a good job of balancing career and child.  Tell him straight out that this is how you want things (if this is so).\n\nThat this has become such a heated issue with so little to provoke it is worrisome.  It's also concerning that he's been stewing for so long without raising the issue and seems to be dancing around it even now.  Perhaps you need someone to referee.  Try is alone first and then see if he's willing to seek a therapist if you can't resolve issues alone.",

Maybe she felt insecure and commented about other moms when he was younger, or maybe he's trying to convince himself that she really was a good mom in spite of some doubt he has on the subject. Who knows. It seems like it should be obvious  that a corporate job is going to have different standards for dress and grooming than a job where a uniform is required. Maybe he is/was ashamed of his mom and her appearance or job?\n\nMy son is nearly 2 now, and his downtime in the morning while we get ready is a comforting part of his routine. We get him up and ready, get him breakfast, and then he has time to chill and look at books or play quietly by himself while we get ready, pack lunches, etc. He loves that time and gets mad if oversleeping means he doesn't get it. It's good for babies and kids to spend some time playing on their own. Constant stimulation is neither necessary nor beneficial.

Maybe she didnt wear makeup or dress up before her had her kids either. Everyone is different. ",

He is being ridiculous. This has nothing to do with his mother and everything to do with his own insecurities. He expects you to let go of part of who you are and that's not ok. I'm not sure what he's projecting onto you but it's something that might need sorting out by a professional. Many women continue to take care of themselves, especially if a career is involved. ",
            "I'm very curious to know the underlying reason for the fact that your husband would prefer it if you let yourself go, gained weight and stopped making an effort to look nice. I'm pretty sure it's not just the baby. Does he want you to quit your job? Is he insecure? ",
            "If his primary life experience for parenting is how his mother did things, and especially if he thinks his mom was the best thing since sliced bread; it is pretty natural for him to expect a good mother to behave that way. \n\n\nPeople do a LOT of modeling behaviour even when their parents were shit. \n\n\nIt's pretty natural for him to.feel this way.\n\n\nBuuuuut it's also pretty damn silly. He does also need to understand there are many different parenting styles; his mother was not in fact the Baby Jesus of parenting; his wife's parenting style being different is NOT bad.\n\n\nAs much as everyone is making fun of him for complaining about having a hot, fit, financially contributing partner- it's not insane for him to FEEL this way; he just needs to realize different is NOT bad. Take him to parenting classes or a family counselor if needed, he does need to pull his head out of his ass at some point, but ... he's just trying to make sure his family is as good as possible, by trying to stick to practices he knows best.\n\n\nHis complaint may be silly, but that doesn't mean he/his feelings should be dismissed, even if he is wrong. He is a new parent. It's pretty natural to wonder if you are doing ANY of this right, and stick to what you know.",
            "You know, before you have children you discuss so many things, however there are some things that you just don't think of. One of them is how your parents behaved. I remember when I had my first and I was really unsure about what and how to do everything. \n\nMost people look to their families which is what your husband is doing. He's doing this because it's the only example he has. You definitely need to address it before resentment builds.\n\n\nPerhaps try talking to him again, when you guys aren't in a rush for work and the baby is asleep. Point out to him why he's thinking this way and what you guys agreed. Some negotiations may be in order but first I'd just let him have a think about it. Hopefully he'll see where it's coming from and change his stance.\n\n\nParenting a young child is one of the most stressful things you'll ever do together as a couple. Sleeplessness and worry can make people grumpy. It's better to address things sooner rather than later.\n\n\nGood luck. Let us know how you go",

You do very well in explaining about needing your identity as a person.\n\nAnd ask him why he married a carrier woman, expecting a full personality change. That's not logical or rational.\n\nThis is your life too. You, the person. You're not just an extra playing a part in his perfect domestic scene.",

It doesn't seem like he's saying much more than \"you are getting ready for work...stop doing that and play with the child\". Like I could imagine if he said \"I caught the baby getting into something he shouldn't because you weren't paying attention. You were doing your hair and makeup instead\" but that doesn't seem to be the case... Could he ultimately just be looking for you to be a SAHM or something but passive aggressively conveying that as he knows asking you to give up a career is completely unfair? I think you two really need to have a deeper discussion about his expectations vs yours and the way you are both feelings ad why [I.E. what he feels the child is missing out on/how does he think your behavior is hurting the child's upbringing and maybe you need to explain *why* keeping your identity is so important to you and what it would mean if you lost it].\n\n>Dan and I are pretty even in sharing parenting duties. I tend to take mornings because I'm more of a morning person that Dan.\n\nDoes this mean he does evenings? If so, is he 100% focused on the baby and only the baby when it's his turn to care for the child? Because chances are he's not. He might even have it easier depending on what chunk of the night he gets [I.E. is it the same amount of time at night as you or does he just deal with bedtime/nighttime feeding which might be more relaxed depending on your baby and bedtime schedule]. Does he get to keep parts of his identity? if he does, maybe you can try to make parallels to help him understand your point of view. He obviously can't relate to what comes with carrying a child for 9 months [weight gain, etc.] so he doesn't get it I don't think - which is understandable to a degree. It just means you need to really be blunt with explaining it. If he still doesn't get it, that's a different problem.",

            "I think your husband might have been hoping you'll turn into a frumpy mom-ish character after birth but when you didn't he got upset. I think he might have been really jealous of the attention you get from other men so he was hoping this would come to an end after you gave birth. When it didn't, he lashed out.

            "Hey, I know  I'm late, but it's possible your husband's mental gymnastics are along the line of you one-upping his mom. In his mind, it's like \"she is doing what my mom did AND looking good,\" which is a slight to her somehow. So in his head, he justifies you being able to look good as putting in less effort than his mother did.\n\nRegardless, the answer is to tell him to stop comparing you to his own mom. You are your own person and a mother in your own way. He needs to ask himself the big questions-- 'is my baby healthy, happy, loved?' If the answer is yes, then you are doing it right. ",
            "It might also be helpful to have a conversation with Dan about how each of you envision the type of parents you want to be individually and as a unit. It might be good to clarify that the role his mom chose is one way of being a mother and that the way you choose to be a mother will differ from that in a aridity of ways and that that's okay. You can each share what parts of being a mother/father are important to you and make sure that your expectations of yourselves and of each other are realistic and reasonable. What being a parent looks like will change over the years, so it could also be helpful to commit to having these conversations regularly as your child develops. Good luck! ",

I took her on a nice dinner and we had a good time but you dont want to hear that romantic shit on with the update.\n\n\n**Update**\n\nSo, where to begin after my post I decided to tell my wife after the kids were settled. I sat her down and I told her this woman had flirted with me in the past and has generally made me uncomfortable.\n\nI told her I didn't reciprocate any attention or flirting but there was something i needs to tell her.\n\nI told her she came into my office and was talking to me and then took off her clothes. (She asked if we did anything) and I said absolutely not and I would never cheat on her.\n\nShe then started laughing and said she must of wanted to make a porno with me. (She knows about the camera because she's brought me lunch before and saw it) we both laughed and she just told me she trusts me and is glad that she has a faithful husband.\n\nShe took it better than i thought but I was glad I got that off my chest but I still had stuff to do. I reported her the video was reviewed and long story short she was fired. (She gave me the evilest looking eye anybody has ever given me in my entire life)\n\nI would like to say I talked out of there like a badass but I still had paper work so I had to work. But after I was done I felt better actually, this felt like a weight on my shoulder.\n\nSide note for people who want to hear our romantic 12 year anniversary:\n\nSo, I knew our 12th anniversary was coming up so this is what I did for her. I tried hard to remember where our first date was and after looking at an old picture I saw the name.\n\nI asked my sister if she could watch them and I took her out for a special night. We had fun and she was really happy and honestly I'm very happy with my life.\n\nWe tried uh.....getting busy but my daughter was being a turd and pushing into my wife's rib cage. She felt uncomfortable so we stopped and I'm kinda laughing thinking about. Cockblocked by my own daughter.\n\nWell there's the update bye.\n   \n**tl;dr**: everything worked out in the end except I was cockblocked by my daughter.",

I can't imagine the pain that you're feeling and that you've been carrying with you all this time.\n\nAs someone who has experienced a fair bit of loss, I can't tell you that it gets better. It just gets... different. After some time, little reminders of her won't break your heart. They'll hurt, but they'll make you smile too. After some time, you'll think of the best times you have together and your hearts won't shatter. After some time, you'll dream about her and wake up without crying. Time is the only thing that can heal a wound like loss.\n\nTime, and counseling, are the only things that can help you right now. I'm so, so sorry that I can't offer better comfort.\n\nYou may never love anyone like you loved her. *But you loved her.* So many people go through their lives without experiencing a great love like yours. Fifteen years of your lives together were well spent in good company.",

            "I'm terribly sorry for your loss, OP.  \n\nWhen we are married for a long time, the other person becomes part of us.  To lose that part of us, especially suddenly as you did is not unlike suffering a sudden and catastrophic injury, such as losing a limb.\n\nLike losing a limb, losing a partner affects *everything* we do.  Just as a limb doesn't grow back, the part of ourselves that we lose when a partner dies doesn't grow back.  There is no \"right\" amount of time to grieve, because each person is different, and each relationship is different.  You will probably be grieving to some extent for the rest of your life, and anyone who tells you that you should be \"over it\" in a year, or five, or ten, is a fool. You are already feeling the same sort of phantom pain that an amputee feels, but in an emotional sense rather than a physical sense.  A future relationship (if or when you feel ready for one) may (probably will) feel strange, not because it's not good, but because it's not *her*.\n\nJust as with the loss of a limb, you have to re-learn how to do things; the old ways of living life, which you had gotten used to for the past 15 years, are not going to work any more.  Things may get \"easier\" in the sense that you will find new ways of doing things, as a person coping with an injury finds new ways of doing them, but that's adaptation, not recuperation.  You can't use both hands to open a jar if you don't have two hands any more, and even if you find a new way to open that jar, it's still not the way you'd done it all your life until you lost the hand.\n\nPart of my role within my spiritual community is as an end-of-life counselor, both for those who are facing their own deaths and those who are coping with the death of a loved one.  If I can be a resource for you I would be happy to; please feel free to PM me. ",
            "My mother had been with her boyfriend since they were both 22, 14 years together. She killed herself and my stepfather suddenly lost his wife and became a single father.\n\nFrom what I've seen/been told by him, it doesn't get easier, it gets normal. It's been 5 years and I've walked in on him crying alone in his room. He's actually just ended a relationship recently but he was very open that he still loved my mother and missed her everyday. Over time it just became normal to not have her around, you stop expecting to see them around the house. We moved after her death but still it felt like she moved with us. \n\nYou don't need to be okay. Holidays will suck, they will suck a royal fuck ton! But that's okay.

Also, feeling better isn't as consistent a process as people would like it to be.  You'll have good days that will suddenly come crashing to a halt when you realize you're enjoying them without her, and bad days that will be lightened by a good memory or feeling like you've gotten some kind of \"sign\" from her.  If you're really not feeling any kind of progress and it's getting in the way of you living your life, then don't be afraid to call in a counselor, and do try to cultivate some hobbies and friendships that will keep you distracted and provide you with a clean slate.

            "It sounds like you two had something very special. ",
            "First off, OP I am so sorry for your loss and I wish you all the love and light in your future. \n\nThe mods deleted my last post because it was an external link but OP please consider reading this. It is long but very worth it. The COO of FB Sheryl Sandburg lost her husband earlier this year and wrote this very poignant and beautiful post about her grieving process:\n\nToday is the end of sheloshim for my beloved husband\u2014the first thirty days. Judaism calls for a period of intense mourning known as shiva that lasts seven days after a loved one is buried. After shiva, most normal activities can be resumed, but it is the end of sheloshim that marks the completion of religious mourning for a spouse.\nA childhood friend of mine who is now a rabbi recently told me that the most powerful one-line prayer he has ever read is: \u201cLet me not die while I am still alive.\u201d I would have never understood that prayer before losing Dave. Now I do.\n\nI think when tragedy occurs, it presents a choice. You can give in to the void, the emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even breathe. Or you can try to find meaning. These past thirty days, I have spent many of my moments lost in that void. And I know that many future moments will be consumed by the vast emptiness as well.\n\nBut when I can, I want to choose life and meaning.\nAnd this is why I am writing: to mark the end of sheloshim and to give back some of what others have given to me. While the experience of grief is profoundly personal, the bravery of those who have shared their own experiences has helped pull me through. Some who opened their hearts were my closest friends. Others were total strangers who have shared wisdom and advice publicly. So I am sharing what I have learned in the hope that it helps someone else. In the hope that there can be some meaning from this tragedy.\nI have lived thirty years in these thirty days. I am thirty years sadder. I feel like I am thirty years wiser.\n\nI have gained a more profound understanding of what it is to be a mother, both through the depth of the agony I feel when my children scream and cry and from the connection my mother has to my pain. She has tried to fill the empty space in my bed, holding me each night until I cry myself to sleep. She has fought to hold back her own tears to make room for mine. She has explained to me that the anguish I am feeling is both my own and my children\u2019s, and I understood that she was right as I saw the pain in her own eyes.\n\nI have learned that I never really knew what to say to others in need. I think I got this all wrong before; I tried to assure people that it would be okay, thinking that hope was the most comforting thing I could offer. A friend of mine with late-stage cancer told me that the worst thing people could say to him was \u201cIt is going to be okay.\u201d That voice in his head would scream, How do you know it is going to be okay? Do you not understand that I might die? I learned this past month what he was trying to teach me. Real empathy is sometimes not insisting that it will be okay but acknowledging that it is not. When people say to me, \u201cYou and your children will find happiness again,\u201d my heart tells me, Yes, I believe that, but I know I will never feel pure joy again. Those who have said, \u201cYou will find a new normal, but it will never be as good\u201d comfort me more because they know and speak the truth. Even a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d\u2014almost always asked with the best of intentions\u2014is better replaced with \u201cHow are you today?\u201d When I am asked \u201cHow are you?\u201d I stop myself from shouting, My husband died a month ago, how do you think I am? When I hear \u201cHow are you today?\u201d I realize the person knows that the best I can do right now is to get through each day.\nI have learned some practical stuff that matters. Although we now know that Dave died immediately, I didn\u2019t know that in the ambulance. The trip to the hospital was unbearably slow. I still hate every car that did not move to the side, every person who cared more about arriving at their destination a few minutes earlier than making room for us to pass. I have noticed this while driving in many countries and cities. Let\u2019s all move out of the way. Someone\u2019s parent or partner or child might depend on it.\n\nI have learned how ephemeral everything can feel\u2014and maybe everything is. That whatever rug you are standing on can be pulled right out from under you with absolutely no warning. In the last thirty days, I have heard from too many women who lost a spouse and then had multiple rugs pulled out from under them. Some lack support networks and struggle alone as they face emotional distress and financial insecurity. It seems so wrong to me that we abandon these women and their families when they are in greatest need.\nI have learned to ask for help\u2014and I have learned how much help I need. Until now, I have been the older sister, the COO, the doer and the planner. I did not plan this, and when it happened, I was not capable of doing much of anything. Those closest to me took over. They planned. They arranged. They told me where to sit and reminded me to eat. They are still doing so much to support me and my children.\n\nI have learned that resilience can be learned. Adam M. Grant taught me that three things are critical to resilience and that I can work on all three. Personalization\u2014realizing it is not my fault. He told me to ban the word \u201csorry.\u201d To tell myself over and over, This is not my fault. Permanence\u2014remembering that I won\u2019t feel like this forever. This will get better. Pervasiveness\u2014this does not have to affect every area of my life; the ability to compartmentalize is healthy.\nFor me, starting the transition back to work has been a savior, a chance to feel useful and connected. But I quickly discovered that even those connections had changed. Many of my co-workers had a look of fear in their eyes as I approached. I knew why\u2014they wanted to help but weren\u2019t sure how. Should I mention it? Should I not mention it? If I mention it, what the hell do I say? I realized that to restore that closeness with my colleagues that has always been so important to me, I needed to let them in. And that meant being more open and vulnerable than I ever wanted to be. I told those I work with most closely that they could ask me their honest questions and I would answer. I also said it was okay for them to talk about how they felt. One colleague admitted she\u2019d been driving by my house frequently, not sure if she should come in. Another said he was paralyzed when I was around, worried he might say the wrong thing. Speaking openly replaced the fear of doing and saying the wrong thing. One of my favorite cartoons of all time has an elephant in a room answering the phone, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the elephant.\u201d Once I addressed the elephant, we were able to kick him out of the room.\n\nAt the same time, there are moments when I can\u2019t let people in. I went to Portfolio Night at school where kids show their parents around the classroom to look at their work hung on the walls. So many of the parents\u2014all of whom have been so kind\u2014tried to make eye contact or say something they thought would be comforting. I looked down the entire time so no one could catch my eye for fear of breaking down. I hope they understood.\n\nI have learned gratitude. Real gratitude for the things I took for granted before\u2014like life. As heartbroken as I am, I look at my children each day and rejoice that they are alive. I appreciate every smile, every hug. I no longer take each day for granted. When a friend told me that he hates birthdays and so he was not celebrating his, I looked at him and said through tears, \u201cCelebrate your birthday, goddammit. You are lucky to have each one.\u201d My next birthday will be depressing as hell, but I am determined to celebrate it in my heart more than I have ever celebrated a birthday before.\nI am truly grateful to the many who have offered their sympathy. A colleague told me that his wife, whom I have never met, decided to show her support by going back to school to get her degree\u2014something she had been putting off for years. Yes! When the circumstances allow, I believe as much as ever in leaning in. And so many men\u2014from those I know well to those I will likely never know\u2014are honoring Dave\u2019s life by spending more time with their families.\nI can\u2019t even express the gratitude I feel to my family and friends who have done so much and reassured me that they will continue to be there. In the brutal moments when I am overtaken by the void, when the months and years stretch out in front of me endless and empty, only their faces pull me out of the isolation and fear. My appreciation for them knows no bounds.\n\nI was talking to one of these friends about a father-child activity that Dave is not here to do. We came up with a plan to fill in for Dave. I cried to him, \u201cBut I want Dave. I want option A.\u201d He put his arm around me and said, \u201cOption A is not available. So let\u2019s just kick the shit out of option B.\u201d\n\nDave, to honor your memory and raise your children as they deserve to be raised, I promise to do all I can to kick the shit out of option B. And even though sheloshim has ended, I still mourn for option A. I will always mourn for option A. As Bono sang, \u201cThere is no end to grief . . . and there is no end to love.\u201d I love you, Dave.\n\n",

            "I am sorry for your loss, OP. My husband died in a car accident several years ago. Yes, it does get better, but you never stop ( at least I haven't ) missing the person. \n\nI am now in a relationship and very happy, but I still think of my late husband everyday. Let yourself grieve, but do not let it consume you. Let yourself be happy.\n It hasn't even been a year yet; of course it still hurts something terrible. I thought my life was over. How could a young, healthy, strong man be gone in an instant? I thought I would never love anyone else. . .\n\nIt gets better. Therapy and time will help. But \"better\" doesn't mean you will forget or cease to miss her. It simply means you will have found a way to live again. It means your memories of her will make you smile, not breakdown. \"Better\" is a bit bittersweet, but it does happen.",
            "\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI've never lost a partner, but I did lose my mother at 25, to a suicide.\n\nI'm 35 now, and I still tear up at least a few times a week; I get mad at her; I have conversations with her in my head; (she's still quite naggy, but she's always right... Still!), I am joyful when I witness something she would have loved to see or an event she should be attending... Etc..\n\n...It's still a very active relationship, in a sense.\n\nShe's the one person on the planet that knew me better than I do. That's what I miss most, that connection, and I don't know if it will ever go away, but, the overbearing grief has lifted. \n\nI now do things to educate people about suicide prevention and try to help others if I can. \n\nTaking up a cause on her behalf makes it seem like at least some good has come from this. I'd suggest maybe finding something similar. A charity she loved, maybe, or accident prevention awareness?\n\nAlso:\n\nA month after my mama died, a friend was flying to Louisiana to volunteer at a huge tent city in St Bernard's Parish, for Katrina victims. She forced me to go with her - and it probably saved me. \n\nWe were there for a week, and on the flight in I was praying to all the gods and goddesses that I knew of to just bring the plane down in a huge fireball crash so I would stop hurting so much.\n\nAfter acclimating, (I'm from Cali and it was abnormally hot and humid due to the hurricane, even 9 months later, so I was nauseous from the heat) I got to work just sorting and processing clothes that were donated (some were so gross,... btw people, don't donate yucky clothes to things like that...), talking to the displaced people.. They were so amazing - kind, and soft spoken.\n\nI realized: these people were so gracious and amazing after LITERALLY losing everything, and I only *felt* like I had lost everything - not to diminish what I was feeling.. But.. I noticed a change and I reflected quite a bit on this.\n\nI flew back more complete than the broken state I arrived in.\n\nSo basically... Volunteering anywhere is so healing. Look into it, when you're ready. A lot of the time, both sides end up \"saving\" the other. \n\nYou'll always miss her, period; but you CAN do something in defiance of her passing - take up a cause and fight for it in her name.",
            "Yes it gets better, but it takes a long, long time. I would say that since you feel you're getting worse you're falling into depression and it might be time to see a doctor. When my parents died I was of course very sad but about 8 months later I started getting depressed. Fortunately meds helped with the depression. It took about 5 years to get over the worst of the sadness. \n\nIn addition to seeing a doc think about some sort of therapy. Grief counseling, a support group, individual counseling. Also try to stay busy with things. Go to the gym, take up a sport, get some hobbies, go out more, join some clubs, volunteer. Exercise does counter the grief on a physical level. Staying busy helps to keep your mind distracted. Get a dog. \n\nAnd some of it is just waiting to heal and that takes time. You'll find love again when you're ready and the time is right. ",
            "I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my wife a year ago today. She was only 30 and although we had been together nearly 5 years we had only been married 7 months. She died suddenly in her sleep of an undiagnosed heart condition. No warning. We went to bed like any other night and when I woke up the next day everything that was my life changed. It doesn't necessarily get \"better\" but after time everything that changed becomes the new normal. I found a great grief counselor in my area and made sure to let my friends and family help. I don't know where I'd be today if I didn't do that.

            "I'm sorry for your loss OP.  In a way, things do get better, but I guess it's more like life goes on and the pain becomes generally dull enough to live with.  Not everyday though.  The grieving process is not linear nor does it happen exclusively in the order its presented.  You'll move forward and backward through it for however long it's going to take you.  There's no set time frame in which a person fully moves past a great loss.  It's completely individual.\n\nHowever, it seems to me like you are totally stuck.  You've drawn on all your own resources to get through this; your own gumption, friends and family.  It's probably time to outsource the job to a therapist of some kind.  You can find someone who specializes in grief counseling.  As someone who lost both parents in equally ugly and difficult to accept circumstances, I'm not sure I could have come to terms with it without the help of a professional.  \n\nI wish you strength and courage.  Good luck, OP.",

            "I am so sorry for your loss and can't imagine how hard it is, even having experienced loss myself.\n\nIn my experience, it does get easier in a way... /u/bonnieirisheyes explained it well. The pain becomes less sharp, less constant, and you eventually adjust to not having that person there anymore. \n\nIt does sound like maybe you should consider seeing a grief counselor. Everything you're experiencing is normal and okay, but a counselor might be able to help you feel less guilt, which will help make your grief less crushing. It will help you make sense of things, as much as you can when someone dies so young and unexpectedly.\n\nWhen you do feel guilty, I think it's important to think about how your wife would want you to live. Obviously, she would expect you to be sad and miss her, but would she want you to not be able to enjoy simple experiences because she isn't there? If she loved you, she would want you to find happiness again, somewhere or somehow. The happiness you will have without her won't replace the happiness you had with her, but it's what she would have wanted for you. ",

Take up a new hobby way different than anything you've done before. If you can, rescue a shelter dog so you might know a new, different kind of love, and have someone that gives you a reason to walk around the block every day. In rescuing someone else, they just may rescue you. It'll help turn the page, and not have every single detail of your day remind you of her.

Sadly it isn't nonsense in the long run but when people pounded me with those types of phrases it sounded like it.

I guess you could say I avoid pictures of her as they spark memories which brings the tears. I still have ups and downs almost a weekly basis even up to this point. I have thought about suicide on multiple occasions because it seems like being in my late/mid 30's, my dreams of having children of my own seems to be distant at best if I do it the proper way with a future wife, among other things.

            "As one who lost her husband of 21 years, I know most of what you are going through.\n\nChiteng (not his real name of course) was my rock--but I never fully realized it until he was gone. I loved him, still love him, and I miss him every time a new game comes out or a new Marvel movie gets released (we were both uber-nerds), and whenever I watch NHL Live and Deb Placey is on, I comment on \"her latest fashion outrage\", because that's what he'd do.\n\nDoes it get easier? Yes and no. There are STILL nights when I wake up thinking that Chiteng is there, and then realize that it's just our cats, and I start crying (only to wind up cuddling with our big orange cat, who also took his death hard). Sometimes I see something awesome in an MMO or a PC game, and get wistful because I know that Chiteng would love it. \n\nWhat's helped me is 1) continuing to tell all my silly stories about him (and Frigga knows I have a million of them--remind me sometime to tell you the \"Shit-take Mushrooms\" story), 2) talking about it (usually with lots of gallows humour, because that's how I deal with shitty things that happen to me--that, and if the situations were reversed I just know that Chiteng would be making a fuckton of jokes about me terrorizing Valhalla with my little cat Maximilian), and 3) doing things that we'd always done together before. On our anniversary, I go to a new restaurant and try something different, because that was something that we always did when he was alive. He'd never had Chinese food until he met me--he grew to love it, and took a shine to Japanese and Thai fare a few years into our marriage. For our 18th anniversary, he had lobster for the first time. On our 21st and last anniversary together, he tried creme brulee, venison, and beef carpaccio--three things that he'd always cracked wise about whenever he saw them on one of my cooking shows. This year, the first since I was widowed, I went to a Russian/Kazakh place. Next year, I may go to this cool Middle Eastern place downtown. Either that or a curry house near Mile High (I live in Denver). I haven't decided yet.\n\nHell, two months after Chiteng died, I went to PAX East for the Mass Effect Cast Cosplay panel, because we loved Mass Effect and I wanted to do it for him as much as I wanted to do it for me. I had a great time, and greatly amused Keythe Farley (the voice actor for one of the characters in the Mass Effect trilogy) when I told him that he reminded me of my late father-in-law (who I got along awesomely with). Chiteng would have laughed his ass off at that.\n\nSo what's my point in this semi-rambly whatever? Go to the Caribbean for Christmas. Take lots of photos, see lots of sights, eat new and different foods, meet interesting people, experience everything you can, and take in a fantastic sunset while you think of the wonderful years that you and your wife had together--do it for her, **and** do it for you.\n\np.s. Grieving is a process that everyone goes through at different rates and in different ways.

            "I lost my brother when he was 29. He was my best friend. My grief has changed over the years. The first year was the worst. The second year wasn't much better. Then slowly, the pain began to feel less acute, less mind numbing. I began to realize that life really was going on. It has been over five years now and I still dream about him several times a week. i still sometimes lay in bed in a haze thinking he might still be alive. The mind plays tricks on you that way.\n\nI can't tell you that you'll stop missing her as much. You probably won't. Things just get different and you find ways to talk about your loved one in a way that keeps their memory alive. I still have crying fits every now and then. I still get teary eyed or feel a soul crushing sense of loss, but it's not nearly as often as it used to be. \n\nIt gets easier to handle, but it takes much more time than you've given yourself. ",

It nearly killed her to lose him, and it nearly killed me to be unable to help her. We try not to dwell on the negatives too much, but we often find ourselves unable to stop crying.\n\nLet yourself get sad; it's perfectly acceptable. What helps me cope is thinking of a good memory. Everyday I remember something wonderful about my dad, and everyday I do something that would make him proud.\n\nIt still hurts like hell, especially at this time of the year, but i know dad wouldn't want me to be unable to be happy, so I try for him.",
            "I met my husband when I was 19 and he was 21. We married the following year, and have our thirteenth anniversary soon. Losing him would mean losing part of my own identity. My whole life is planned with and around him, so all my plans, dreams and fucking hopes of becoming old farts together would die with him. That would never get better. People tell you it will, because they want it to be true for you, but more than anything it is a hopeful condecension. You are not just grieving a person, you are grieving the past memories and future you planned together. All the in-jokes, the nicknames, the dumb fights that were resolved. This is a huge damn loss, and it always will be. That is how it should be though. You get to be fucked up over this. \n\nYou also get to pick a new future. If you think it could work you might want to consider changing jobs, or even cities. Find new people who will look at you not as the widower, but as the new guy. Try new things out of your comfort zone, check if something stirs. In time the life you create may help you live with the loss of the one you planned. Work on a different future. As this you. And I hope you don't let the utter unfairness of what happened take even more than it has. I don't want my husband to give up on his life if I lose mine. I'd want him to do anything he had to to be happy again. Your wife sounds lovely. She seems like the kind who would have wanted the same.",
            "I shared [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2dsh38/mym19_girlfriendf18_of_25_years_just_died_im_a/cjsp08l) a while ago with a friend who needed it. Even if it doesn't help you feel better right away, it may help you better understand your grief. Hope you find some relief soon, OP.",
            "Hey OP,\n\nFirst let me say thank you for being vulnerable and opening up to this community. I personally feel hope when I see people offering to share themselves--all of themselves--the good and the bad--to other people. Your questioning not only helps yourself but all those around you as well. Also, the first step towards growth is offering, like a plant needing fertilizer, and you have begun this growth by your offering of vulnerability. Now, onto your question.\n\nTo answer succinctly, yes, it does get better. Let me caution you by saying the manner (what \"better\" feels like) and means (how you will get \"better\") by which your life gets better are often mysterious and unknowable until they have become realized. Essentially, the process of grieving you are undertaking will not wrap up in the way in which you most likely want it--that is to say, quickly. But--and this is very important--there is hope.\n\nI will not tell you that I have experienced what you have experienced. In truth, no one in existence has because you are unique in your suffering; however, you are not terminally unique as a person. What I'm getting at here is the need for support in times of unavoidable suffering. There are those out there who will not treat you as a \"fragile toy\" but instead will support you in the ways in which you need. Honestly, right now your co-workers may believe that what you need is to be treated as a fragile toy because that is how they would like to be treated--they won't know any better unless you let them know what you need. More so, although you and your suffering are unique, others have experiences similar to yours (not better, not worse) and can offer guidance, patience, and support to you during these hours of need. \n\nRemember that humans are socially-cognitive animals. We need to be surrounded by others to be happy and healthy. Also, remember that humans have needs; therefore, you have needs. So, if no one has asked you this yet, allow me to be the first: *what do you need?* Again, I cannot answer this question for you. But I can give you the same advice my mother always told me while I was trying to ascertain what I needed during hard times: \"Be gentle\". It's okay not to know. It's okay to know. It's okay to know and later realize you don't know. Essentially, everything is okay. You, with all of your hurt, pain, fear, shame, guilt, anger, sadness, (and maybe even joy) are okay. You are not *supposed* to be this. You are not *supposed* to be that. You are okay being exactly how you are at this moment, whether that be any of the five previously mentioned emotions. \n\nNow, about your grief and *how* you will come to terms with it. I'm sure you can guess my answer: nobody but you knows how you will get over this grief. You're capable of doing it; you know how (even if you don't realize it yet) you will do it; and if you stick to it you will overcome it--that is to say, grow from it. Maybe you don't believe that and I can understand why. Optimism in the face of unavoidable suffering is one of the most difficult (if not *the* most difficult) tasks humans can accomplish. But there is a way and that is through meaning. \n\nTo find meaning in suffering is difficult. Many people (myself included), especially in the beginning of grief, will subscribe to the notion that life is meaningless. The existential vacuum is strongest during these befuddling hours and often times it makes us think erroneously. For example, when I am not in a place of self-love, when I do not accept myself for all that I am, I am unable to see the love in and from others; my lack of ability to *see* the love other people are offering me comes from my lack of ability to create it for myself; I cannot feel what I cannot see. Similarly, the lack of ability to find meaning during crisis comes from the lack of ability to create it. The choice is, again, up to you. \n\nWhether or not you want your wife's death to have a purpose is a very difficult decision that is up to you. If you do not want your loss to have a purpose, then this message is a little handicapped at helping you and your grief because finding meaning and purpose within a difficult situation is how I personally survive. If you do want to find purpose, allow me to ask you these questions, which I must warn may be difficult for you, meant for your own meditation. These questions are not going to be immediately answered, but they can serve as guides for you during the times you feel most hopeless. \n\nDo you know why your wife died? Do you know the reason behind it? Do you know you if were meant to grow as a person--spiritually, mentally, emotionally--because of your wife's death? Do you know how your wife's death was meant to create a better life for others--including those you have not met yet (future friends, family, and children)? Do you know how your wife was a blessing to you? And similarly, do you know how her death is a blessing to you? Do you know why you were meant to become something different than what you expected--not *that* husband--not *that* father--but *this* person? Do you know why this new person you are becoming will be better (more universal) than the person you were?\n\nAgain, all of these questions are not going to be answered immediately. Some of them may not be answerable for quite some time. But again, be gentle with yourself. You will know the answers when you are ready to know and until then allow yourself to be. If this message spoke to you in any way, please feel free to reach out to me via PM. \n\nIf you would like to understand more of this *will to meaning* I recommend reading Victor Frankl's \"Man's Search for Meaning.\" Victor Frankl was a contemporary of Freud who survived multiple extermination camps during the Holocaust and wrote a book about it. \"Man's Search for Meaning\" is a psychological, autobiographical non-fiction Frankl wrote about his belief that human's main purpose in life is create meaning. It is a short read and, you could complete it in under a day or two, should you choose to read it. Frankl and I believe that meaning can be created under any circumstance no matter how terrible. \n\nAs Nietzsche says, **\"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\"** \n\nTLDR: Yes, it gets easier. No, it won't be in the way you want right now (immediately). Yes, it will be in the way you need. No, no one else is going to tell you how it is going to get easier for you. Yes, you will need support (when you are ready) from others. Yes, you will be responsible for your own way of becoming better. Yes, your wife's death happened for a reason. No, I don't know what that reason is. Yes, you do know (maybe not right now). Yes, this is the most difficult challenge life has thrown at you. No, it is not too much for you. Yes, you can do this. Yes, you are okay to feel any emotion--happy, sad, angry, guilty, shameful, and hurt--that you feel. Yes, you are loved. \n\nBe gentle--I am sending peace and blessings from me to you.",
            "Awww amigo :(\n\nYes, it will get easier. The kicker is no one can tell you when. Hang in there, and I recommend talking to people - even if it's the same thing you want to talk about. \n\nInternet hugs",
            "It's probably going to take several years, but yes, it will get better.  Eventually.  One day at a frigging time, you'll get there.  Good luck.",
            "I think you should try to think about what your wife would want for you now.  You've got the rest of your life to live, and you've got to live those years without her.  \n\nYou're allowed to love her and miss her for the rest of your life.  You're allowed to be sad about what happened to her for the rest of your life.  It's just, she would want you to have some happiness too, you know?  I think progress is measured not by it hurting less but by you thinking about it less often.  Distract yourself.  Things that remind you of her should be changed.  Maybe you should find a new job, where people don't treat you like you're going to break, because that reminds you of what happened, constantly.  You should move, maybe.  Change your furniture, or at least rearrange it.  Pick up a new hobby.  Even if none of that helps, it's something to be busy with, right?  ",
            "\"It\" doesn't get better, but you will. The situation will never change, but the hit you've taken has changed you who are. Call upon your strength of character to control the trajectory of that change towards a positive axis and you will grow stronger and be more available for the future that awaits you.  ",
            "I am so, so sorry for your loss. It hasn't passed so much time since she passed away, therefore it is absolutely normal that you're still hurting. The pain will eventually fade, but when you lose someone you love your heart will always be wounded. But I assure it does get easier with time. The only piece of advice I feel like giving to you is try to distract yourself. Find hobbies you love, read, play sports, go out with friends... Try not to isolate yourself and engage in harmful behaviours as it would only make things worse. You have to find a reason to enjoy life again. Just give it time. Don't try to hurry things up.",
            "No words can express how sorry I am for your loss. Time, unfortunately, doesn't necessarily heal everything. However, one thing I might suggest is to think about what your wife would want for you. Would she want you to feel sorrow for the rest of your life? Probably not. You are being far from melodramatic and there is no shame in feeling extreme sadness over these horrible turn of events. What you have to do, though, is somehow get on with your life. Cherish the memories you have of your wife and be happy that you were the one she loved unconditionally. \n\nI just lost my cousin last week, and although it was a different relationship than you and your wife it was a huge blow to my life (she and I were very close). I will never feel the same without her, but I know that I can't spend the rest of my days mourning her loss, or I'll never escape from the sadness. ",
            "I'm sorry that you lost the love of your life. I can't speak from experience but I think you should try to spend more time with your friends and family (since you said they are very supportive). I think spending more time with people that love you and support you would really help. You need some positivity! The pain will eventually fade, you just have to stay strong. I really hope you feel better or get the help you need soon.",
            "I'm sorry for your loss, and have never been in your position.  What I have experienced, close loss of a loved family member, effected me deeply.  The only thing that eased that pain in the slightest was having my time occupied by physically exhausting things.  To put it bluntly, I was less sad when I was exhausted physically.  After the death of my sibling, I picked up a fairly heavy exercise regimen.  IT didn't fill the hole I felt, but it did make me think about it slightly less. \n\nI'm sorry that's all I have to offer you. ",
            "I lost my dad 3 years ago. It's very different from losing your spouse though. But from my experience it's not any easier but it just get different and the loss is more tolerable. At some point things that make you think of them will make you smile and it'll still hurt but just not as much. You'll stop crying as much. It helps to get into therapy and talk your feelings out. That's the only way I got through my dad's death. I was so angry for such a long time that I wasn't the one to die and he was. \n I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't tell you when it'll feel ok. No one really can. Every person is different. But it's ok to smile and laugh. Don't feel guilty because something makes you happy.  Just know that one day you will wake up and it won't hurt so much. You'll always miss and love her but one day whenever that day may be you'll be able to function throughout the day and you'll smile when something reminds you of her.",
            "The pain never really gets less, from what I've learned talking to people experiencing grief. But you do learn to handle it better, and it gets easier to manage over time.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. *hug*",
            "With loss of this magnitude it won't get better unless you actively get help. You should be talking to someone, a counselor or a therapist. Time doesn't heal all wounds unfortunately. You also have to realize that your sadness makes sense in this situation. You lost the love of your life and it hasn't even been a year. Eventually when you're ready you should consider getting rid of the reminders of her in your home. Maybe just keep one framed photograph but don't torture yourself with her possessions. ",
            "Several months isn't enough time to stop mourning. People mean well and have no idea how to help people through things like this. Tragedy breeds indifference and people desire normalcy and for life to not change.  What you need to do is be okay with mourning. It is unbearable but death is a part of life and it hurts. It doesn't necessarily get easier but it will hurt less. Over time you won't think about her everyday and you will feel guilty because you think you aren't honoring her memory but it means you are healing and your mind has accepted the loss. We are physically and chemically attached to the people in our life. Our bodies know when they are gone and it takes a long time to normalize. The hurt represents your need for her to be there and the sadness of her passing. It is still very new to you. You can't undo 15 years of being connecting in just a few months. Your wife would not want you to be alone though so maybe get a companion like a cat or a dog or if you have one, pour your energy into them.   Loneliness will prolonge the healing process. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. It's okay to mourn. Ignore the indifference, its just human nature. Don't be lonely and give this time. ",
            "From watching a few grandparents it takes x*time.\n\nI've never lost a spouse but please if you will let me compare it to a breakup/divorce. You hurt for a long time, and you know what? That's completely ok. Everything now reminds you of her. But little by little things around in your life will change. Cups and dishes will break, you'll get a new car, you'll get new furniture,  you'll get a new routine or changes jobs or new hobbies. Then things won't hurt as bad\n\nFor now all your old friends and coworkers see you as damaged /hurting, and that's ok they don't want to see you like this, it pains them as well. They don't want to hurt you and they are not going through it themselves so they don't know how to act. \n\nYour allowed to hurt as long as you need to but it will fade with time. You need to start doing a routine or hobby that's new and won't remind you of her. These people you meet (will know if you tell them) won't have known you from before and it will be easier for you to be around them and relax.\n\nThe most important thing is don't date until your ready and the majority of the hurt is gone, or you meet some that makes it hurt less.",
            "It may not get easier for a while OP, but if you remember the love that the two of you shared and all of the good times, your wife will never really be gone. Love like that doesn't just dissappear. She will always be in your heart and the love that you have for her will always keep her with you. I sincerely hope that things get better for you as time passes. Sending good vibes your way friend. ",
            "I hope that what others say here is true; it eventually gets... different. My condolences OP, I've had my own share of loss and struggling with the same questions as you.",
            ">All I have these days is my job and every single person there treats me like a fragile toy or something. \n\nI've been there, it may be different for you but what helped me was a return to normalcy..where people aren't dancing around certain words and situations for fear of upsetting me.  Granted you might not be ready for this yet, but when you are..tell your friends to take off the kid gloves.",
            "Yes, it does not get easier but there becomes a new normal.  My parents died when I was 32 and it took several years for me to adjust to life without them.\n\nA therapist helped a lot.\n\nAlso, I saw a psychic.  She told me they were still living their lives, just somewhere else.  It could be 100% BS but that thought gave me comfort.  And I am not religious but the thought they are looking over me makes me feel good.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.",
            "My father passed away in March 2007 when I was 21, it does get better. Does it get easier? Not really. It's been a one day at the time type of situation since that day. Keep your chin up and her memory alive by doing things that brought both of you happiness.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. I have one suggestion for work. I'm in HR, and when we had employees with a major tragedy, someone would reach out to them to find out how they wanted the office staff to react. For instance, a woman who lost her son in a terrible accident didn't want any mention of it made at work, at all. To hold herself together, she needed us to be as normal as possible, to joke, to laugh. \n\nIf you have an HR person that you trust, or someone who is sort of the \"emotional center\" of your office (sometimes this is an office manager, sometimes it's a boss, sometimes HR), please consider talking to them. They can communicate what you need to the rest of your coworkers. Do you need them ",
            "Hey OP. I second the thought that it doesn't get easier it just gets different. For me, the difference is in me and how I handle my feelings. That takes time and practice and deep reflection. For instance, I feel sad for all the things my wife is now missing and I feel a little guilty about having experiences she can't. Over time, I cope a bit better. \n\nHowever, I passed through the 4th anniversary of my wife's death earlier this year. It was much harder than any before and the most I hurt since she died. We were about a month shy of 19 years married, with about 7 years before we got married.  I'm coming out the other side now (again) and the familiarity of the feeling has made the transition down and back up slightly more tolerable.\n\nI don't ever expect to never cycle though the pain of loss. I'll do hope to get better at it though. \n\nAs others have offered, feel free to PM if you want to chat. ",
            "Hi, OP. I'm so sorry for your loss. Your love for your wife is palpable. I've been totally destroyed by loss at a couple of times, so I have a lot of empathy for what you're going through. \n\nI suspect that talking about your wife, either in therapy or in a support group could be a help to you, to relieve some of the emotions you're dealing with alone. \n\n>It feels like everyday is worse than the last when I've heard it's supposed to be better with each passing day.\n\nThis really stood out to me. I was so angry at myself for not being \"better\" when I thought society expected me to be. I learned that grief is different for everyone and there is no exact timeline that says when you need to \"bounce back\". I found it really frustrating in my case, because one week I would feel like I had really improved but then I would have a huge set back. My grief came in waves, it was not/is not linear. Realizing that helped me be kind to myself, which was so so so important. \n\nAlso - I was in therapy but just could. not. function. I took 2 leaves from work. Finally I admitted to my therapist that I was ready for medical help. I got on an anti-depressant that gave me the boost I needed to feel anything other than numb. I stopped grinding my jaw off every night. I stopped the crying that felt so normal that sometimes I didn't even realize I was doing it. Meds can be okay, and I'm just saying there's no shame in using the tools you need for help.  My doc explained it as I had been down and sad for so long that my brain wasn't making seratonin like it was supposed to anymore. It wasn't a miracle, but I am great for the slight help it gave me. \n\nAnd of course, as others have said, time is really the only thing that helps. Grief doesn't go away, but time dulls the pain. It doesn't even sound like it's been a year since you lost this special woman. You are not being melodramatic, you've suffered a tragic loss, and you don't need to diminish that. \n\nAnway, I just... really feel for you and I wish you strength and hope. There is hope. PM me anytime. \n\n",
            "It does get a little easier after some time.  It's 2 years in January for me.  The first year was horrible.  This year, I've learned a couple of things.  One, I went to something called Camp Widow, and I learned that I'm never going to move on--but I am going to move forward.  Two, I've learned to start dating again, even if the dates are not leading to a relationship.  It's good to just have basic human company, to have someone to take to dinner or to a concert, and well, you know.  \n\nCan I suggest /r/widowers?  As well as Widowed Village, which is an independent website (and the organization that sponsors Camp Widow)?  Also, if there are any support groups in your area *specific to this type of loss*, you may find that helpful.  My local Hospice ran an eight week program that was good for me.\n\nFinally, I still see a grief counselor about every three weeks.  I think  I probably always will.\n\nEDIT:  Also, I started working out both with and without a trainer, started cooking for myself again, and I'm starting to lose the weight that I gained on my eighteen month long diet of bourbon and takeout that I embarked upon after her death.  That has helped a lot, too.",

            "So, the corny phrase that applies here i think is:\n\nDoes it ever get better?\n\nNo, but you do.\n\nIt will never leave you, but you'll learn to live with it. My advice would be to never think you have to learn how to make it disappear, cause it never actually will, and that will only add to the sense of failure. Let yourself crumble, because you have to. But learn what you need to pick those pieces of yourself back up, not cause you want to, but because you have to. They will crumble again, then they won't for a while and you'll think \"So this is moving on\", and then you will fall harder. But you will get back up. It'll be muscle-y, it will hurt less; you'll get, for the lack of a better word, \"used\" to it. But it will never stop hurting, and years from now, it could still sneak up on you and destroy you when you least expect it, when you thought you had it all behind you, when you thought coping was a skill that, like any other, just took 1,000 hours of practice to get right.\n\nBut you'll remember you made it that far. And you'll remember you once thought you couldn't go on years ago but did somehow. And by then it won't really matter if something you had no control over ever gets better.",

Just don't make the point of her in your life about your deceased wife - make it about your new life. Good luck mate! You will eventually heal. It will happen.

We were very close, and she died with me holding her head in my hands.  So I can tell you it does get easier.  It's just that first year that's the utter pits.  So many benchmarks to pass and you're still adjusting to the loss.\n\nMy parents were best friends, and were together ~50 years.  They were just getting ready to ease into a well-earned retirement when Mom was diagnosed.  My father was absolutely devastated after she died.

It doesn't get easier. \n\nHowever I wish to take this time to offer some practical advice which could help you move on if that is what you wish to do. Please bear in mind this is not meant to sound harsh, but if you really want to move on and get over the terrible part, aside from time there is a few things you can do.\n\nFirstly you need to change up how you are living your life. The reason it feels like you are stuck in a rut is that you are. You say you both bought a house in Jan, sell it move, move somewhere completely different. If you bought a house, move to an apartment, if you were living in the country, move into the city. Mix it up! That's the TL;DR of this entire comment. If you guys had pasta for dinner 3 nights a week, don't eat it again. If you guys slept in and made a large brunch Saturday, get up early. This is meant to be partly satirical, but you should be getting my general message. Change your life, change what you are doing, change your place of employment if you need to, or if this isn't too large of a committment. I'm not telling you to get into the dating scene right now, because it's clear that isn't where you are at. But I feel in order to move on, you need to change your life from how the last 19 years were. \n\nGrief is normal, natural and healthy - within reason. You will never feel the same as you did before, but is also healthy to move on after a sensible period. If you guys played volleyball together, go take up soccer. Stop doing things that you used to do, and start creating new things, and I hate to say it, but start creating a new life. The old friends you guys had are just going to perpetuate the feeling of being stuck in a rut. Because you will be until you truly move on.\n\nMake her proud, you may or may not believe in the afterlife (I do) but if you do, she's watching. Reverse the roles, what would you wish to see her do if you had died. Go and life a full life, not just for yourself, but for her, because she never had the chance to. I really really hope this gets through to yo. \n\nI am totally open to a PM from anyone who has lost loved ones and friends; I've done a lot of grief counseling, mostly amongst younger people actually, but I hope I was helpful! \n\nPeace",
            "OP, I'm so sorry for your loss. It never completely gets better. I actually lost my dad to suicide my senior year of high school and my counsellor told me something that really helped me. Some people say grief is like a mountain that you climb everyday and eventually you reach the top. But really it's like an ocean. And in the beginning you're on a raft in a hurricane. But as time passes you still have waves crashing against you but they come farther apart. They aren't as big. You're in a bigger boat and you can see the waves coming in from a distance. There's never going to be a completely calm ocean. And some times ( like birthdays and holidays) you're going to run into bigger waves than you expect. But as time goes on you get better and better at navigating the ocean. But even the best sailor is going to run into rough waters. I hope this helps you and my thoughts are with you. ",
            "I haven't lost a spouse and can't imagine what that would be like. My condolences. I have lost many people I loved dearly, both parents and grandparents. The pain doesn't stop but it does, eventually, get easier to deal with. Your wife wouldn't want you to be sad about her being gone but would want you to be happy about the time you had with her. Honor her by doing things you enjoy and trying to find happiness in the new life you have now. My thoughts are with you. ",
            "I'm so sorry, OP. Truly. No words I have could make you feel better but I do hope you feel a tight hug from across the world.\n\nI suppose time does heal all wounds, but maybe this wound is just too deep to heal in a year or two... She was the love of your life, you don't get over these things easily, if at all. All I can wish you is continued support from your loved ones so that you may someday feel fetter.\n\nPlease feel free to PM me. Also eat well and sleep well, it matters more than you know.",
            "It does get easier. I lost my husband from cancer (36 yrs old) almost 2 years ago.  Give your heart time to heal.  Simply ask God for healing.  It's a process, but you will be okay.",
            "I just want to say how sorry I am. I'm going through the loss of my father, who was my best friend and someone no one else will ever compare to. It's been 2 months today and I still can't sleep even, let alone pretend to be normal. I am effectively the head of the family now and it's near impossible to be what I need to be right now. I lost my grandmother and my mother years ago as well and sometimes the loss overwhelms me to the point of tears but more often than not now with them I am ok and smile when I remember them. I look forward a great deal to the day when my father's death is thought of similarly to my mother and grandmother. I know it will because that's what I want, that's what they all would want for me, and because I'll never forget them and will keep trying to have a happy life and make them all proud. \n\n\nThis will be depressing to read but I have a really important point at the end so if you can, do bear with me. \n\n\nNow I watched my father fall apart after my mom, his wife of 23 years and love of his life, died. He never got over it in almost 5 years. Even with two small children and a teenager to look after (my brothers were 8 and 9 and my sister was 17 at the time, me 22 but out on my own already) he didn't handle it well ever. He kept himself busy but it destroyed him. He tried to be a good single parent but he was too overwhelmed by the grief to really keep it going how he should have. He had no interest in dating, wasn't able to learn to be a very successful single parent, and generally was just too depressed to do anything. We became very, very close during that period because I tried to be there for him. I would check on him every day with at least a phone call or see him once or twice a week all the way until he died nearly 5 years after her. There was nothing I could do other than support and love him. It was never a burden for me, I'd give up my whole life to have him back right now. I can't recall a time we talked he didn't bring up my mother. Every day for years it was how he missed her and couldn't go on and didn't want to live. Well he became very ill in September and we didn't realize because he was always so depressed and nonresponsive to things and he died suddenly. I don't think even he realized how sick he was and right before he fell into a coma he never woke from he kept apologizing for not wanting to live and very adamantly wanted to. It kills me to remember those moments when he knew he was dying and to see the regret in his eyes. It breaks my heart to think of his last days and years, how he was never able to move past my moms death and spent that time miserable. I've found his writings now and he blamed himself for my mother's demise (she had cancer, zero % his fault) and couldn't let go of the guilt of trying to live a happy life without her.  He never really put himself out there though. He limited his options because no one would ever live up to my mom so why should he bother. Of course no one could live up to her but he should have accepted that and tried anyway. \n\n\nMy point is in all this to NOT let it destroy you. My dad did and it doesn't have to be that way. It's not your fault she died, there is no shame, nothing to feel guilty about in living a normal, happy life, even with someone else one day. Take the time you need to grieve, don't rush yourself but you are young and you need to live the rest of your life. Your wife wouldn't want you to do what my dad did. She would want you to be happy and enjoy the years she didn't get. Some days you'll have to push through it for the sake of keeping your job and sanity. It's so so so hard. I don't have the words to describe that kind of hardship, the pleading with whatever God you believe in, the wanting to die to escape the pain, the horror of it all. \n\nIf you ask me, yes it does get \"better\" but only if you take steps to make it that way. One option is to allow yourself to wallow in the pain and longing for her and choose that over making a new life for yourself. To decide that since she can never be replaced (and she cant) that you won't even try to find happiness other places, that she was it.  That is an option that means life doesn't get better. But if, after the time you need to grieve, decide you want to honor your wife by being happy again and you take steps to make that happen then yes, it does get better with time. If you accept she was an irreplaceable person that you will always miss but that you also have room for new people and experiences and laughter in your heart along with keeping her memory then you will find yourself happy in time. \n\nDon't think that it won't be hard though. You'll make mistakes and end up taking a fat stupid leap backwards. You'll want to curl up and die and never try again, heck you will curl up most likely and cry your eyes out. But you keep going, you get up and dust off after a good cry and learn from whatever didn't work out the way you'd hope and try again and again and again. And eventually you'll have a happy, normal life again. You'll never stop missing her or wanting to talk to her or do something with her but you can and should be happy too. Life is never more simple as you get older. Our amazing human brains are capable of so much and the more we go through, we realize just how much we are capable of. Love doesn't stop when someone else dies, it just gets more complicated and you have to learn to manage the loss along with normal stuff again. And you will! \n\n\nTldr: Death sucks. It's hard. You can let it destroy you or you can choose to be happy. Grieving is necessary but eventually if you keep trying things you will be ok and you will make a life for yourself despite the loss of her that will never fully fade. Don't give up, just keep trying and enjoy the years you have left because that's what your wife would want. ",
            "Don't have any expectations on what your grieving process will be like. Everybody is different. Don't pressure yourself to conform to someone else's idea of normal.\n\nIf you're not in therapy, you should be. Easy for me to say. When my wife was sick with cancer I was seeing a therapist who was basically a dickface. I should have found someone else. So learn from my fail. If you find a therapist who you don't click with, find another one. \n\n> I don't know if I will ever love anyone the way I loved her\n\nYou probably won't. And that's OK. You'll still be able to establish a deep connection and love with someone else when you're ready, but it will probably feel different. \n\nBe patient with yourself. \n\nI'm very sorry to hear of your loss. ",
            "First off, my condolences. I have suffered the loss of family members, but nothing as close as a wife, so I won't try to be able to fully empathize. \n\nHave you considered a change of scenery? You mention the home you bought together, and how everyone at work treats you as \"damaged\" for lack of a better term. If it's financially/practically possible, can you pack up and move? Start fresh somewhere without the wrong types of reminders surrounding you? \n\nThere was a post recently of a woman who lost her husband, toddler, and unborn child in an accident, and took a similar approach. Her post was about letting her new friends in her new city in and not shielding that core of pain/hurt from them, but it seemed that approach really worked for her. \n\nJust a thought. ",
            "Hi OP. Give yourself some time to heal. It's okay to cry. It's okay to laugh about the memories you had. I think you need to find someone you can talk to. It's not the same at all, but when I had a miscarriage I felt more alone when I kept my feelings bottled up. It would be very beneficial for you to talk to someone (a friend, family member, therapist). It won't make you forget her, because she was and is an incredibly special part of your life, but it will help you cope.",
            "I'm really sorry for your loss. I went through something like that and i remember going through the day feeling like an empty robot, people asking you if you're OK and then you have to lie to them or have a really awkward moment. Then going home and feeling that empty void in your heart and playing the what if game, maybe it could have been different if only.... Or the I remember when game where every little thing you see reminds you of her and its like a little dagger over and over. \n\n\n\nIt does get better right now it's too fresh but eventually you'll be able to fill the hole in your heart. It will probably take years and even then you'll find yourself occasionally happy or sad at thoughts of her or thoughts of things you had done together. Just remember that though things didn't end up how you planned they were not a waste. You spent many excellent years with a person you truly loved and that's a lot more then many people get in their lives. It's an obvious cliche but work on yourself. I found that time was my biggest enemy. Pick up a hobby go to the gym they are no substitute but at least they will fill some hours and they will help you focus on things that aren't this massive loss. Also if it needs to be said avoid alcohol completely. It will make you feel so much worse just don't go there.",

            "I'm so sorry. I lost my mom a few months ago, but I understand how different it would be with a spouse. I would suggest you take some of the commenters here up on their offers and message them. It can be helpful to be surrounded by supportive people, but what's most helpful is finding people who have gone through/are going through the exact same thing. Somehow you feel less alone in the world when you find others who are sharing your burden. ",
            "Try joining a support group for grieving lost loved ones. It would really help to surround yourself with others who are experiencing the same thing you are- that way you don't feel like everyone is just \"treating you like a fragile toy.\" I think it's definitely worth a shot. Do a quick google search for your area and something should come up. Also, I am sorry for your loss! I can't imagine the daily pain you feel. I would imagine it's gonna take longer than it has been for you to start to feel any better at all. Time does heal wounds, but some wounds take longer to heal than others. Just know that your pain is valid and you can't push it away, so you are doing right by letting it run its course and recognizing it for what it is. You lost the most important person in your life. It would take a while to adjust for anyone. ",

After some time, slowly, you may recognize those smiles become real, and it's not as much of a struggle as it once seemed. Take care of yourself. You'll be okay.",
            "I'm sorry for you loss.\n\nAs a former widower, I can say, it does get easier.  My situation was different, so my grieving process started earlier (when we found out her cancer metastasized).  With an accident, it takes longer.  There was no preparation, no warning.  You should be feeling some sort of progress right by now, but just know the holidays are rough, for everyone.  I would highly recommend getting into grief counseling and get into a grief support group.  Journaling is also a good way to get your emotions out on paper.  Write a grief letter to friends and family telling them your feeling and how to treat you is also cathartic.  I hope and pray you find some some peace.  ",

Like you described, her co-workers treated her like she was fragile, constantly offering encouragement and praise for even the smallest thing. She realized that she would never feel normal again in this environment so she moved to a new town, got a new job, and made new friends. It sounded like it really helped her to build a new life.\n\nPeople mean well but their actions don't always have the effect they intend. Something to consider.",

They can help you and you in turn can help others. You have suffered a tragic loss, but your life isn't over and I dont think your wife would want you to not live to your full potential.",
            "It gets *easier* but that's relative to what it's like now. You won't make a full recovery and heal and everything is fine, but it'll get better than it is right now. It probably won't happen in the first year or two though. Just lean on your friends, your work, and talk to professionals if you need to. You just have to accept that life is different now and you'll always have a scar. That's just how life is. Acceptance instead of dwelling is the key to getting through it better.\n\nBuddhism: plain and simple is a pretty great book when it comes to this. It's not religious or preachy or anything like that and I'm not even buddhist, but it's a really great book for acceptance of bad things. Good luck.",

            "I am so sorry for your loss. My heart breaks for you.\n\nYour world has been rocked to its core.

Eventually, although it may not seem this way now, you will stop hurting so much every day.\n\nHow long that process takes is different for everybody. Your entire future was just stolen from you. You don't get over that in a matter of months. Volunteering may help to keep you busy and give you something else to focus on.\n\nIf you don't like your friends treating you like you're delicate and fragile, say something. I'm not much younger than you and nobody  in our age group has experience dealing with this sort of thing. They don't know what to do or what you need.

This is your grief and your relationship.\n\nIn the meantime, while you wait for these feelings to pass, you could try and do the things that are soothing to you. Not to chase the feelings away, but maybe to accompany you in this really hard time. Puzzles, crafts, massage therapy, sports, yoga, meditation, reading, collecting stamps. Creative outlets can sometimes help express what you have no words for.\n\nLastly, you may not want to hear this, but therapists can be total life savers.

My thoughts are with you!\n\nI lost my love earlier this year, February, but you had many more years with your wife so I can only imagine that pain.\n\nI lost him under complicated circumstances so I do not have much support from friends and family, in fact hardly any.\n\nIf you DO have that support from family and friends please take advantage even if you think it doesn't help much. Nothing can take the pain away. I agree, time seems to hurt, not help. But if you have people who are supporting you then you are not grieving in isolation and be grateful for that. Even if you do not feel like it, please gather the strength to spend time with other people. Too much time alone at a time like this, with holidays approaching, is not good.\n\nYou will not love someone the way you loved and the way you love her. That is a fact. You will never be the same. Not to say there isn't love in your future. There will be. Now is the time to heal and heal well.\n\nTry writing. If you felt the inclination to post to this forum then obviously writing brought you a temporary release. Jot down those memories about her in a safe place like a journal or a email to yourself. What made her unique? How did she change you for the better? What joys did she bring to your life? I know this will be hard and trigger much hurt but will also show you the blessings she brought you, no matter how bittersweet. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Losing a love is extremely isolating and lonely. No one can bring them back and many people back away from the bereaved for fear of saying the wrong thing. It's a vicious cycle. \n\nWhat did you two like to do together? Keep doing those things even if you have to start slow. Ask friends or family members to take a trip to the Carribean with you, in her honor. \n\nPM me if you'd like to vent further. It really is living hell on some days, total numbness on others.\n\nAll the best and warm wishes.",

The \"good\" news was I had almost two years to see it coming and I was left with 3 kids to keep me occupied afterward. \n\nIt will get better...but there are going to be some tough times....the first anniversary without her, the first birthday (hers and yours), the first Christmas/Halloween/Easter/Thanksgiving.  It took me YEARS to stop speaking like I was couple and saying \"we\" for everything.  It took a long time to remove her clothes from my closet and dressers (I didn't need the room).  Maybe I should have moved instead of staying in the same house that we bought together with so many things that were associated with her.\n\nSo be patient.  Try to stay engaged with the world and your family and friends.  Maybe take a class.  Meet and interact with people.  I liked the comment someone had of getting your friends or family to take a trip with you to the Caribbean.\n\nDon't give up on finding love again, when you're ready.  Maybe it won't be the same as it was with your wife, but that's fine.\n\nGood luck and if you ever want to ask a question or share an experience feel free to send me a message.",

            "My loss is different to yours because we'd only been together a couple of years, it was sometimes a fraught relationship, and in retrospect we wouldn't have lasted. However, my experience is that yes, it does get easier. My loss is now nearly twenty years behind me and I'm an entirely different person to the one he knew. Developmentally I'm not even the person who lost him anymore. I think that's the actual mechanism by which \"time heals\" (as much as people hate that phrase). You are quite literally carried away from that moment. You keep growing and they don't. That's the real separation of death. And in some ways you don't want to, but it is also a good thing. It's how we heal.",
            "I saw this on another post a few months ago and think it could be helpful. I am so so so sorry for your loss of your wife. i wish nobody had to experience things like these. \n\n\"As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. \n\nYou find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive. \n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. \n\nAfter a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\"\n\nGood luck OP. keep on floating\n\n(can anybody help me out with a link to the post if you know where this came from?)\n",

He writes very honestly about the raw emotions that make up grief and it just really was so nice to know I wasn't crazy or alone in experiencing those feelings. ",
            "So sorry for your loss OP, I can't imagine your pain.\n\nI think with a lot of time, it becomes easier in the sense that it becomes less consuming.

            "\"Better\" is a relative term.  You'll make the grief your own - you'll incorporate it into your day to day life, so that it becomes something you can comfortably live with.  Right now, you're fighting for space with this new thing that's trying to overwhelm you.  Eventually, the simple strength of *being* will keep the grief from taking over, and you'll find a way to coexist with it.  I say coexist, because it will never go away.  It will diminish, it will even hide for a while, but it will always be a part of your space... a small part, that will make you tear up when you speak of that person, and will occasionally make you double over in grief out of the blue twenty years down the road, when you thought you were way past that...but the simple strength of being, which allowed you to coexist with grief in the first place, will also help you to handle it throughout the years.  You don't have to do anything other than just be.  Nothing else is asked of you, nothing required.  Just be, and I promise you that it will become tolerable.  I promise you.",
            "I'm so sorry to hear about the passing of your wife.  Absolutely devastating.  \n\nThis last year has been tragic for me as well.  My grandfather was killed in an accident back in March and we were close. Everyday I think about him and what he liked.  When I make certain foods or talk about certain foods, when I see my cat the one he gave me, when I see the suit jacket he gave me, all of it just reminds me of him and I miss him, as well as the other family who have passed on.  \n\nI don't know that it gets easier, maybe as time goes on.  I guess all you can do is just gradually just \"accept\" what happened, that she is gone and we will all be there someday too.  Accept, also, your relationship that you had with your wife, talk to people and tell them about how you felt about her.  You should try and keep all the best memories you can of her and share this with your friends and family.  If you're spiritual it might help to feel that a part of her still persists.  I'm certain that your wife would want you to be happy, focus on that too, pursue the things you love because you can still live your life. ",

Sometimes realizing the length of time since their passing adds a new kind of pain. But in the end the task becomes about reframing your concept of life, death, beauty, to come to terms with all of this. You too, will die someday. There's a lot you can do in the time between now and then to honor her memory, and let you live happily again. She would have wanted you to rise above this after all.  \nJust another thought, I believe that eternity exists in every moment. Those memories are not gone. They haven't faded from time. Everything that you experienced together still exists in perfect vibrance and will remain untarnished through time. That's all safe and will be there for you again. You don't have to worry about forgetting, you just need to focus on what's next.",

            "I'm so sorry to hear of your loss. There's no denying that it's extremely difficult especially when it comes completely blindsided. But don't look at recovery from an angle of needing to feel better every day and assessing the situation constantly. Look at the long term and know that while time continues to pass, the pain will ease and you'll feel a noticeable difference maybe months or a couple of years from now. \n\nAnd will you ever love someone the same as you did with her? Absolutely not but that's because each person is different and each kind of love or relationship is different. Just be patient and it's okay to give yourself time to grieve. But also recognize that your late wife would've wanted you to move on and be happy at some point. It's okay to keep the happy memories and years intact, no one is asking you to replace them. But when you start seeing memories as something that should bring you happiness rather than sadness, maybe you'll be able to ease the pain a little. \n\nIt's been a little while so if you find yourself mopping after work, try to get out there and do some activities. A little bit of exercise each day helps boost endorphins in our bodies. Even if you don't want to, force yourself to spend time with friends and family. They're there to help you. And as much as you may want to, try not to bring up the past so that maybe it'll help you be a little less sad and just have even a few hours of stress free happiness. Get yourself involved and consumed with other things because ultimately, that's the best way for you to recover and feel better. I wish you the best of luck and just know, there's a whole community out there to support you. :]",

            "My wife was in the process of getting a divorce from her first husband when he passed away. Even though she wanted to be divorced from him it still hurt and would come up at random times. \n\nOne thing that really helped her was joining a widow board. She even went to a camp widow convention. One thing that struck me about all the widow/ers was how everybody had two life stories. They had their own life stories, and then their spouses life stories. And almost nobody had the same combination of circumstances. People could be happily married, unhappily married, or in the process of divorce. Young, old, healthy, unhealthy, accident, drugs, cancer/illness, suicide, murder, and war; there was at least one person who lost their spouse in one of those ways. And of course everybody had different amounts of time that they had been widowed. \n\nBut another part that struck me was the unique sense of humor that cropped up. I found out that the phrase \"at least\" is one of the most annoying terms. She brought back a coffee mug that said \"Maybe you'll be in a better place soon too,\" because widows were sick of hearing \"At least he is in a better place.\"\n\nI'm not surprised that the first year is hard and doesn't seem to be getting better.

            "So sorry - the burden of grief is awful and exhausting, and you have to carry it around with you every single day. I wish we could help. My friends didn't treat me with kid gloves (but then they didn't expect me to suddenly burst into tears, either, when they showed me, for example, a kitschy grave site in Greece) and it was better that way for all of us.

I am now 25, my dad remarried and eventually had a forth child, who is now 18 and going to University. \n\nMy dad is autistic, not in a way that hinders him to a great extent but in a way that makes him a very talented programmer for a huge gaming company but gives him very limited social skills. The death of his wife irrevocably changed him, I can't really remember how he was before but after and since he is extemely hard to talk to emotionally, he is in a marriage of convience (left with three very young children and a low paying tech job led him to remarry quickly and irresponisbly) I'm sure they are affectionate but I wouldn't say they are 'in love'. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is be open, try, don't cut people out, tell them how you feel. My childhood wasn't a bad one it just wasn't a very happy one. My dad to this day cannot speak about his dead wife, my dead mother. It is almost taboo, he clams up and gets angry. As children me and my two sisters had to find a way to deal with our pain and our new reality without his help, we are now no doubt stronger because of this. Don't let grief consume you, your wife would want you to be happy. Celebrate what was and do her proud. Invest your time in what you enjoy, make a difference.

Personally I felt it starting to get easier when I could no longer remember the exact amount of weeks that had passed and switched to counting the months. I think it was around week 19? Anyway, it doesn't really matter when it'll get easier, the most important thing is it *will* get easier, because you will learn how to live with this pain. \n\nEdit: you should really find yourself a grief counsellor.

She said over time he would move to the side and I would begin to see the world through my own eyes again.",

I know how your are being torn apart buddy, I suffer on a daily basis and it sucks, like you said everything I see, look at reminds me of our time I was gifted to share with her.  I have a almost 15 year old daughter that I could not imagine what she is going thru as I am there for her every second I can help her but as this recently happened i am sure it has not fully set in for her. :'(  I have heard her cries of \" I just want MOMMA back\" This along breaks my heart as she my babyand couldn't even begin to know her pain. Ugh this is making me so so sad at the moment.. It for me sucks as I am sure you know but I am trying to look at the fact she chose me to share her time while she was here... I hope you can cope or have some help on a daily basis to at least be happy that your wife chose you to be with while she was here.. Keep your head up buddy, I was advised from a friend that lost his wife 10 years ago that he now can smile reflecting on his time with his late wife.. He said it gets tough but in time the wound will scab over and stop the bleeding, it will hurt but you will be able to reflect in a somewhat happy manner..

            "I'm going to provide some advice which I expect to get downvoted into oblivion, and I mean this with the utmost respect towards your wife:\n\nThe only way to get over someone is to get under someone else. Go meet a new girl.\n\nIf you're like me, you may have fallen in and out of love with people throughout your lifetime (that first one is always the hardest). But once you love someone I don't think you can ever stop. You love them forever. That's kind of what love is. So I don't think you'll ever get past how much you love (present, not past tense) her.\n\nHowever you, as a dude, have certain needs; I'm not just talking about sex, but empathy and comfort contact and emotional intimacy. That's what \"moving on\" will buy you, and that should fix 80% of the obsessions and fixation on misery.\n\nDo it at your own pace, and again, I'm deeply sorry for your loss. But I suspect think that's when things start to truly feel \"different\" and maybe even a little \"better\".\n\nMy guess is that she'd want you to be happy. I'd also guess that you deserve it.\n\nSo good luck, Godspeed, and many upvotes to you sir.",

        "selftext": "Our first year anniversary is in two weeks. We went out last night to a birthday party of our mutual friend's. He got pretty tipsy but not wasted; I didn't drink since I was driving us home. At some point in the night I went to go get water and when I came back, there was a crush of people in the room so I was standing directly behind him, trying to get through. \n\nHe was talking to some girl and I heard her ask, \"So is that girl you came in with your girlfriend?\" And he distinctly said after some hesitation, \"No, she's just my roommate haha.\" I got really pissed off but didn't say anything, just came up to stand next to him. I didn't want to make a scene at my friend's birthday party, but he was going to get an earful when we left. He didn't even notice me for a few seconds and said something like, \"You're so pretty,\" to the other girl. She noticed me \nglaring at him and left. \n\nI was so pissed off at him that I just decided to walk away and talk to my friends the rest of the night. Probably a mistake of not addressing it right there at the time but I wanted to avoid a big scene if I could. I tried to enjoy myself. My friend, the host of the party, came up to me and asked me if my boyfriend and I had broken up and she didn't know, because she had heard him telling somebody that he was single.\n\nAfter that, I just decided to go home. I was really mad. He could find a ride or crash at our friend's place (she said it would be okay because tons of people were crashing in the living room already). I went home without saying a word to him. This morning I woke up to all of these texts and calls from him *really* pissed that I ditched him at the party without a ride or without warning. He demanded to know in an accusing voice \"where I had disappeared off to,\" as if *I* was the one up to some shady shit. \n\nI'm just angry and confused because this is coming out of nowhere for me. We have a great relationship and have never had a fight. He tells me all the time that he's so happy we're together and that I'm the best thing that ever happened to him and that he wants to be with me forever. And now pretending I'm not his girlfriend? Claiming he's single? Flirting with other girls right in front of me? He has never done anything like that before and hasn't even looked at other girls... \n\nI don't drink, so is this just dumb \"drunken behavior\" that I should excuse? Should I give him a chance to explain himself or just end things now? I'm so pissed off and feel so disrespected. I can't even think of what reason he could give that would somehow make what he did okay in my eyes. But I'm willing to listen to anyone's perspective or other angles on the situation. \n\n**tl;dr: Went to a party with my boyfriend last night. He got tipsy and was overheard telling multiple people that he didn't have a girlfriend or that he was single, when I was right there at the same party. I left without saying a word to him. This morning he's demanding to know why. Do I confront him or just leave him?**\n\nUPDATE: I texted him, \"You made it clear last night that you are single. I don't wait around for ex-boyfriends to give them rides home. Don't bother coming back here\" as /u/boyd1211 suggested. He immediately tried to call me and I didn't pick up. Then he texted, \"Wtf are you talking about???\" \n\nHow could he not know? My friend (the host) even just texted me and told him she'd given him an earful all morning when he woke up for being such a dickbag to me. He denied everything and said he has no idea what she's talking about. They got into a fight about it because he stuck to his guns and claims he never said any of that stuff. I have a feeling he's going to pretend he doesn't remember or blacked out as a way to get out of this. He said he's getting a ride back to my place now. I'm considering not answering the door, but what if he really doesn't remember...? I kind of don't care, though. :/ He's coming here now, what do I do?!\n\nUPDATE 2: He's almost here. My friend told me to talk to him \"just to hear the complete load of shit he's going to unleash on you. Dump him girl, I would\"--and she's known him for longer than she's known me! I'm not going to answer the door. Thanks, all. \n\n**UPDATE 3**: I know most of you will be disappointed to hear this, but I decided to give him another chance.\n\n...Just kidding. I only kid because I'm still bawling my eyes out. I did decide to answer the door and hear what he had to say, if only to try to understand his reasons behind it (not as a way to forgive him, but to fully understand why).\n\nAt first he denied it and said that none of it ever happened, and that my friend was lying to me because she was jealous of us and had always \"wanted him\" (she has a boyfriend of three years). He said he had no idea what she was talking about or why I was so mad at him. I just said, \"I heard you say it, too.\" He said, \"Say what???\" But then he just saw the look on my face and crumbled.\nHe said that prior to us dating, he had never gotten attention from girls before and it went to his head when it happened last night. He said that he'd always felt \"in disbelief\" because he believed I was out of his league and it was pure fluke that I'd ever been interested in him. Apparently girls never approached him before we were dating, ever, so when it happened at the party he \"didn't know how to react.\" (!)\n\nHe said he \"enjoyed the attention for once in his life and just went with it.\" According to him he wasn't planning on doing anything but just impulsively said whatever to keep the attention coming. He swears up and down that he just enjoyed the ego boost that came from girls being interested in him, but he would never ever cheat on me. In his mind he thought it was \"harmless\" because he knew he would never let it go further than feeding his ego, and that if he'd known that I would hear, he never would have done it and risked hurting me.\n\nAt this point I started to cry, because to me it was such a STUPID reason to throw away what we had. I know some of you will say that I should forgive him (got a lot of PM's and comments saying \"it was just a dumb mistake\" and \"I say dumb shit I don't mean when I'm drunk too\") but I just can't. He broke my trust in him and, honestly, he hurt my pride. I want a guy who can handle when some other girl shows interest in him with maturity and respect... a guy who loves me so much that he would never dream of leading a girl on for attention because I feel like my attention should be enough... Someone who's proud to point at me and say \"Sorry, I'm taken and she's a great girl\" with no regrets.\n\nI told him that I thought it was a really stupid reason to damage our relationship (being insecure and an attention-whore) and I guess it must have sunk in that I was planning to leave him. He broke down crying too and begged me to please try to forgive him because it was a stupid drunken mistake. It was so hard to stay strong, but I was very angry with him. I cried so hard because he started telling me he loved me more than anyone and he was just stupid, drunk, and inexperienced and he wished he could take it all back because it wasn't worth losing me.\n\nI said I was glad he realized his mistake, but if he really \"loved me more than anyone\" than he really needed a better way to show it than pretending I don't exist to other pretty girls. He got hysterical and just started saying, \"I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I can't lose you! Please forgive me!\"\n\nI told him that I thought his actions last night were honestly pathetic and disgusting and they changed my view of him. I told him it was sad that he would throw himself after a girl and lie just to get a few minutes of attention and that I didn't think it was a good excuse to say \"that never happened to me before so I didn't know how to handle\" or \"I was just innocently enjoying the attention.\" What would happen next time? How could I trust him to act appropriately and control himself? He said that \"he'd learned from this\" and he'd do better next time but honestly I just couldn't get over it. He made me feel worthless as his girlfriend and something he had to hide to get the attention of other women because my attention wasn't adequate. I know that isn't necessarily true but that's just how he made me feel. I also told him he'd lowered himself in my eyes and I didn't respect him anymore.\n\nSo I told him to get out and not talk to me anymore. I'm leaving a box of his stuff on the porch so he can get it without talking to me. Then I laid my couch and cried with my dog until I felt sick. It shouldn't feel this shitty because I'm still really mad at him. But we had an amazing year together and it sucks that something so small and stupid could cause him to jeopardize that. I don't want to be with a guy who values our relationship so little.\n\nI feel better today. It sucks not being in a relationship anymore but I feel like I deserve better. He's been blowing up my phone saying he's been at home crying and he loves me so much. I'm just waiting for him to pick up his stuff so I can block his number.\n\nMy best friend also just broke up with his girlfriend of 2 years, so we're planning a road trip together to take our mind off things. I wasn't able to go before because I didn't want to make my boyfriend uncomfortable (go figure). But this weekend I'm going to go hang out with my bestie and swim at the beach and forget things. Thanks for the support, Reddit. You helped me stay clear-headed. I have a lot of hate and bitterness in my heart right now but I'm hoping that will pass.\n\ntl;dr: It's over, I broke up with him. He denied everything at first but then later confessed that he did it because he enjoyed the ego boost he got and that other women had never approached him before, so he \"didn't know what to do.\" I told him I don't respect him anymore even if he's sorry so things won't work. I'm going to the beach with my friend this weekend and trying to put it all behind me.",

Hell, tons of people are like that in their early 20's. It is a normal feeling to have, HOWEVER it is NOT okay to coax anyone into a relationship where that behavior is okay.  Yet alone guilt them on it. \n\nAt 23, he should in theory still know better, but if he hasn't had the attention before maybe not. Simply put, may be a great guy, good friend, but he is really in between trying to have a relationship, and trying to party. \n\nReally, he's young and still figuring his shit out, just like you are.

If he owns up to it and just got carried away and he is very sorry and it's not going to happen again and he is going to lay off the booze, then maybe, *maybe*, you should consider forgiving him. Sometimes we do stupid things when we're drinking and we need to accept the consequences of that behavior. We also need to understand that when our drunk behavior becomes destructive, then we need to drink less or not at all. There is a point of drunk where I will make out with anyone, no matter what. I stopped getting that drunk when I started dating my husband because I didn't want to deal with the consequences of that and I know I can't control my behavior at that point. \n\nIf he has any reaction other than extreme remorse and promises to change the drinking, then you need to let him go.

We didn't break up immediately unfortunately, and the anger I had over that little act just gradually simmered away in my chest until I completely blew up at him one day. \n\nIt was the most convoluted, painful breakup of my life, and it was so hard for me not to just run back to him. I wouldn't necessarily say that this makes him a terrible person. I would just say that this means he's just not quite ready for a relationship of this caliber, and needs some time on his own to figure out his shit. Getting back together still isn't guaranteed in the event he does that. \n\nMy boyfriend did eventually deal with his insecurities, and I was happy for him that he had found himself but things seemed to go downhill from that.

If the relationship is worth working things out the. You should have talked to him instead of making it a more dramatic issue.

But recently I found out he has been cheating. I reported the teacher and separated from my husband. I served him divorce papers because cheating has always been a deal breaker for me. My husband has begged a lot but I still didn\u2019t budge. It's been 1.5 months since I served him divorce. I have had people try to convince me to stay. I've heard numerous advices. But most common were:\n1. All men cheat. If I leave my husband and find a new man. The chances that he will cheat on me is still high. Better to stay with him.\n2. I will be a single mom. A single mom with 3 kids have a difficult time finding a new partner. We have baggage. Besides I am 37. \n3. I should just let him cheat because at the end of the day he still provides and pays the bills.\n4. Think about your kids and how it will affect them. Divorce is always harsh on kids.\n5. I am taking their father away from them. \n\nAll these I avoided. But what struck me was what my mother said. My mom also divorced my dad when he cheated. Our dad abandoned us after the divorce was final. I barely talk to him. My mother said sometimes she wishes she didn\u2019t divorce my dad. He left us because he was angry that my mom didn\u2019t want to work things out. If she had just worked things out I would still have a dad. Part of the reason she was single till I was 18 because she didn\u2019t want strange men to groom me and take advantage of me. She said to think about it.\n\nI have thought about this for a long time. I cannot even look at him. His facr disgusts me. The last time he touched my armed I jerked it off. I am fine if I never date again. But I've always had abandonment issues. I think about my children and it makes me want to change my mind. But how can I stay with a man who disgust me. We will be living like roommates. I need some insights on what is the right thing to do for me and ny kids?\n\nTldr: my husband cheated. I want divorce.

Worse, they think your broken relationship is what happy/good looks like.\n\nBe free of this person who brings you pain and disgust.

That it's OK to cheat on your partner, or if your partner cheats, you should stay miserable and stay with them. \nYou shouldn't compare your experience with there's.  You feel abandonment because your dad left and never came back. There might not he might stay in the picture and still see them .",

By divorcing you can show your children they do not need to put up with this kind of behavior, that you deserve respect and you are not a door mat.

The first year was the hardest, but I am so glad I left. \nI met a wonderful man, who loves my children like his own, although we never had children together. We've been together for 12 years. My ex husband has moved on and remarried and is a good father to his children. And we get on very well now. It's about being the better person because you need to remember you have children, together.\nI had abandonment issues because not only did my biological father abandon me, but then my first stepfather, who became my dad, did too. But I didn't want my mom to live in those marriages. Living in an unhealthy and toxic home does more damage than living with a single mother who loves you unconditionally.

Better yet, chances are he will take the children off your hands for some time, giving you some free time to just be yourself on top of that.\n\n4. Living with parents whose relationship is bad is even worse for children. Plus, they will all learn that it's okay for men to cheat. Your son is likely to follow in his father's steps and cheat on his future spouse, too. And your daughters will accept a cheating husband because they learned - just like you - that \"all men cheat\", and \"it's okay for men to cheat\". After all, \"at the end of the day, he still provides\" - STIs included.\n\n5. You are not taking their father away from him unless he decides to become a deadbeat. But that's not on you, it's on him. Because it's his decision. Not yours. Divorced dads can be awesome, they can be awful, or they can be deadbeats. And anything in between. But it's their choice. Also, just how much time does his cheating (and other activities) leave him to spend with his children? Is he even important to them?\n\n6. Do you really think your children will be happier if you are miserable every single day of their childhood - and probably not as emotionally available and more likely to snap at them because of everything? Or do you think they'll be happier with a mom who is happy and totally fine not dating, whether they still are in contact with their father or not?

Don't do that. If you want to stay, do it because you love your husband and want to make it work.\n\nLastly, this bs about all men cheat is a lie.

It\u2019s such a disservice to the majority of the men out there who are 100% not cheating on partners.\n\nInstead of working with you to keep your marriage happy and successful, your husband chose to have an affair. The marriage effectively ended there.\n\nMy advice is to continue with the divorce and work at co-parenting your children successfully with your husband.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that, when you\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll meet a loving and devoted man who will be committed to you only.",

Even if other people say you should, they don\u2019t have to live the life as a single mom to three kids. But you are not in the wrong, no matter what you decide to do.",
            ">1. All men cheat. If I leave my husband and find a new man. The chances that he will cheat on me is still high. Better to stay with him.\n\nA lot of them do, but by no means all. \n\n> I will be a single mom. A single mom with 3 kids have a difficult time finding a new partner. We have baggage. Besides I am 37.\n\nI am also a single mom of 3, and I am 40. I found my current partner 5 years ago at age 35 when I had all 3 kids. I didn't have a hard time finding someone to date, but I did have a hard time finding time to date. I was also happy and capable by myself. \n\nAll people in their 30s have baggage, anyone who claims not to is lying. \n\n>I should just let him cheat because at the end of the day he still provides and pays the bills.\n\nThis is gross. He doesn't get to treat you however he wants just because he pays the bills. Also, I would see that as using him for money and you probably don't want to be that person. \n\n>Think about your kids and how it will affect them. Divorce is always harsh on kids.\n\nYeah, divorce is hard on kids. Having unhappy parents 24/7 without an escape is also hard on kids. Seeing their dad behave in a way that's contrary to the morals they're being taught is hard on kids. Getting teased at school because their dad banged the teacher is hard on kids. Creating a new situation where their parents are happier is better, in the long term. \n\n>5. I am taking their father away from them. \n\nNo, you aren't. You will go to court for custody and the court will decide what is in the kids best interest. 99% of the time if a father is decent in the least and puts even bare minimum effort into a custody hearing, he will get 50/50 custody. They will still have a relationship with their dad, as long as he wants that to happen. It is completely up to him to want that, ask for it, and continue to put the effort in afterwards.\n\nHis relationship with them is not your responsibility. You can't make him have a relationship with them. You can't make him act right. It's his choice, and his choice alone. \n\nIf the court finds that he's not a good parent, that's also not your fault. He could have and should have done better. It's the court's decision, you do not have the legal right to make that decision. \n\nIf he chooses not to have a relationship with them through inaction, bad action, or riding off into the sunset, it's his fault. All you can do is be there for your kids. In the long run, kids will know if their parent chose not to have a relationship with them or chose to have a bad one. Kids aren't dumb.\n\nEdit: autocorrect",

Buy a good vehicle if you dont have one already. If you do ,make sure its your name ONLY. If you owe money on it  use HIS money to pay it off. Get a storage unit and safe deposit box. Start hoarding cash  and remove sentimental belongings and put in storage unit. Take care of any medical or dental procedures that you have been putting off.  Give this fucker enough rope to hang himself. He will cheat again. Start doing things solo with your kids. This will give you an idea of what it will be like to be  alone and also help ease the transition for them when dad is not around, It wont seem as weird.

Yes it is hard but it is so worth it especially dating a bastard like that.  And whoever is telling you \"no one dates single mom\" is so full of shit.  By the time you get to our age most of us in the dating pool have kids and no one cares.  Honestly the nice part is we already all been thru that babies stage and arnt trying to do it again.  But even past that who cares about dating.  Focus on you and your children and what makes you happy.  I have gone on 1 or 2 dates in 4.5 since my fiance passed.  I was more wanting to focus on me but focus on doing the best I can as a Father and a fill in Mother for my Daughters.  It is a bummer sometime but if/when the right person comes along I will know.  But until that point I am happy being with my kids and doing my own thing.  No one deserves to be cheated on or married to an AH like your husband.  You and your kids deserve better. I know divorce can seem scary but trust me down the road you will look back and smile.  Take that AH to court and bleed him dry.  Good luck OP.

She is absolutely not to blame for HIS decision to cheat and then step out. \n\nI hope you go back and tell her - no, if she had 'worked things out', it wouldn't have meant that you 'had a dad'. It would have meant you had a shell of a mother \ud83d\ude1e and I'd venture to bet he would have continued to treat everyone like shit.\n\n This is an incredibly shitty and terrible position YOU'RE HUSBAND has put you in. There is not any angle here where you are making an independent decision to end the marriage. WTF else can you do??? Smh. Do not let anyone make you feel guilty - YOU DIDN'T CHEAT, HE DID!!!\n\nmy best friend (35f) just finalized her divorce. They have 4 kids, were together for 15 years. He was shitty for 15 years, emotional affairs and gaslighting - he finally went ahead and cheated on her. And then he put her through absolute hell, trying to make it in her that she was leaving. And I'll tell you, that woman is a saint and she TRIED. She went to counseling, she tried to forgive him, she didn't want to get a divorce.\n\nBut there's some decisions in life that change things forever. And cheating on your spouse is one of them. Of course you'll never look at him the same. Of course you recoil when he touches you. Of course you had to serve him papers.  HE has destroyed your family for no fucking reason other than sexual satisfaction. Fuck him for having the audacity to beg to you stay.

It's a real doozy of a grieving process as well, because your intact family has now been stolen from you.\n\nDon't think about your future dating life right now. That's not what any of this is about. Maybe you'll decide to stay single until your kids are 18, maybe you'll find an amazing new partner down the road you can actually trust. But none of that matters right now. You need to do what's right for your family, and staying with a man who cheats is going to kill you. You will feel worthless and paranoid for the rest of your life.

            "You are actually seeing a good example for your kids but divorcing your cheating husband. You are teaching them to stand up for themselves, have self-respect, and the importance of setting boundaries. No one ever should have to put up with harmful behaviors. \n\nGetting a divorce is not taking away their father. If you have joint custody, they will still see him. Even visitations if you get full custody they will still see him. If he never sees them, that's on him. It has nothing to do with whether you tried to work it out with him. Your father left on his own. He could have tried to stay in your life. He chose not to. He abandoned you. Your mother stood up for herself like she should. Her divorcing him was not what caused the abandonment. That was your father's behavior. If your husband pulls the same stunt on his kids, the abandonment is fully on him. That only makes him a crap human. Your mother regrets divorcing your father because she blamed herself for his abandoning her kids. But she actually did the right thing. She cannot control your father's behaviors. Had he stayed, your life might have been worse. Living in a home with parents who resent each other can be more harmful than living in two homes or even one home with one parent who is happier. Divorce is hard on everyone, but if you're not happy, neither will your kids.\n\nIt's also BS that all men cheat. No they don't. The idea that all men cheat is just lazy and full of projection and insecurities. Good men don't cheat. There are good men out there that will be a good match for you.

Kids aren't stupid, they'll figure out (if they haven't already) that you can't stand to look at him and they'll feel the tension and they will think that's what normal relationships are and they'll learn all of these horrible relationship habits. Although my parents getting divorced was very hard on me when I was nine and I didn't understand at the time, now I am so happy that they got divorced instead of staying together and fighting and being miserable together, that will rub off on your kids!\n\n\nWhat my parents divorce taught me is that I should be careful about choosing my partner and not\u00a0settle for someone just because that's what society says that we should do. I didn't find an amazing partner for me until I was 38, I was tempted to settle as I got older but held firm and I'm so glad I did because having an amazing and caring partner is worth waiting as long as it takes! I might not have learned that valuable lesson if my parents had stayed together.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I'm sure you know this already from all of these comments but your father not being in your life is not your mother's fault, her divorcing him is his fault and him not being in your life is\u00a0his fault, he could have tried to make an effort to be your dad after they got divorced, but he dropped the kids to \"punish\" her,, that's on him not her or on the kids!!!

            "\"dying alone\" is just a phrasing trick to make \"living to a ripe old age having responsibly prioritized your own happiness\" sound bad. being in a bad relationship is the loneliest feeling in the world, I promise\n\nand your mom does not have a more accurate perspective on her divorce because she's decades removed from it. that's not how memory works. the past can look really rosy when you forget what it was like to live in it",
            "As a kid of divorced parents, I never felt like my mom took my dad away from me. Just don't use your kids as ammo to hurt him, they have nothing to do with your issues with him and he is still their dad. No matter what he is to you right now. Wash your hands from him by all means, but try to do so in a way where open communication about the kids is civil and possible. Make a fair schedule so they see him often enough. This is not for his sake, but for theirs. Divorce does not have to be a disaster for them!\n\nAlso, by all means divorce them. You know what messed me up as a kid? The time before the divorce where my parents openly resented each other.",
            "I\u2019m 36 and separated from my husband and I feel the same way. Everyone says \u201cno man will want you after 35\u201d and for me and my husband, we didn\u2019t have kids and so this divorce means I won\u2019t likely have biologic children and that has opened a whole new can of worms for me regarding whether I really want to ever get married again or if I got married because we wanted to have children. Our situations are different, but in some ways the same. I won\u2019t advise you regarding the children but I will say:\n1. Your feelings matter. If you feel (rightfully so!) that a divorce is warranted, then that is your choice and right as a human being whether you are an \u201cold woman\u201d (we are not old. And even if we weee, bring old is not a crime) doesn\u2019t make you less of a human being and you should do what will most enrich your life. \n2. If we die \u201calone\u201d, so what? Almost everyone \u201cdies alone\u201d. Unless you are the spouse who dies first, often people are widowed when they pass. (Side note: women tend to live longer) Waiting 30-40 years with someone who mistreats you just for a 50/50 chance they\u2019ll be by your deathbed is bonkers. And that doesn\u2019t even account for risks of them being alive and either physically or mentally incapacitated\u2026\n3. People project their own fears (especially regarding societal norms) onto others. I know single women who are extremely happy. There is nothing wrong with being single, despite the stigma. Many of us want partners and that\u2019s okay but there is no shame in being single, especially if you\u2019re happier that way than in available partnerships\u2026\nI also know two women who married in their 40s right off the top of my head so if that\u2019s what you want then it\u2019s not an impossibility, despite what people say to us.\n4. Just think about how many 35+ year old men are single. Should be a similar number to us but many of them date 20 something\u2019s. They say it\u2019s because of physical attraction or nature but also 20 year olds are less likely to get mad at them and leave\u2026.so they can get away with not calling, being emotionally distant, lying, cheating, talking to other women, what have you..\n5. All men do not cheat. People may say that but I know tons of people who don\u2019t.",

The other has pushed me away for no reason other than that I stopped allowing her to talk back  to me like she has done all of her life. Both kids learned this from their cheating father who did not respect me. I also didn\u2019t respect myself, so I let both go on for way too long. \n\nIf I were to give myself any advice, it would be to leave when I should have, so my kids would learn what a healthy relationship looks like. I would have taught them that I deserve to be respected. My son might actually respect his wife, and not follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. My daughter would have learned that I will not tolerate that attitude long before now. \n\nI have found a new husband, and he didn\u2019t care that I had kids. He wanted to be with me, and I wanted to be with him. We have overcome some gigantic hurdles together. Neither of us have ever cheated, and I absolutely trust that neither of us ever will. \n\nYou need to find better people to be around.

            "You need to go through with it. Take this advice from a man who cheated and ended up divorced. \n\nA lot of men are emotionally stunted, we never learn to express ourselves and communicate our needs. We are taught, whether explicitly or otherwise, to suck it up and be a man. So these men let feelings of frustration, disappointment, and fear build inside of them. They refuse to deal with it because they think it makes them lesser. \n\nI didn\u2019t know when I left on that business trip that I was going to cheat on my wife. I knew I was not happy in our marriage. I knew that I felt guilty for wanting to end it. I was scared that my kids would be damaged from it, that my family would judge me, that I would lose my job as a religious leader in my church. So instead of doing the right thing and leaving my wife, I chose to be a coward and avoid the confrontation. I would feed my discontent with porn, cam girls, whatever I could get my hands on. When the opportunity to cheat came up, I knew I was opening a door that could not be closed again, that I was hurting myself and my family. \n\nAfterward, I covered it up. I reasoned that it happened a thousand miles away from home and it would never happen again. I made it another 18months before I began seeking it out again, just any way to feel something good. \n\nWhen I did finally tell her, I was sure I wanted to try and fix things. I wanted to be the man she needed me to be, all that bullshit men tell themselves that they can fix it. She went through with the divorce, and I went to therapy. \n\nWhat I have come to realize is that I was the one who had the issues. I had unresolved issues surrounding sexual shame from growing up in purity culture. I was so desperate to get married so I could have sex, and I thought so little of myself, that I married the first woman who would have me. \n\nIf my wife had taken me back, we would both still be miserable. Cheating is a horrible betrayal, but it is a symptom of something else just as harmful, and that\u2019s not going to go away.",

I feel sick just thinking about that.\n\nFast forward 10 years - it turned out to be the best decision for our family. I no longer had to concern myself with where he was and who he was with. That, alone, changed me for the better. Our son wasn't living in an angry, passive-aggressive, tense household.

I remember one day thinking, \"So this is what it's like to be in a relationship with someone who has healthy boundaries!\" We've been together 7 years. \n\nYou have to make the decision for you. Not for your friends or family. It's scary to end the relationship. There's so much unknown, but the relief I felt when I signed those final papers was immediate and amazing. It felt like a physical weight was lifted from my shoulders. Being alone was weird, but it's what made me learn about myself and get stronger.

It is true you may have a hard time finding a partner, but not impossible. Also it's better to sleep alone than to sleep with someone else and be lonely.

            "Get the divorce. Your husband cheated and that should always be a dealbreaker. That 'all men cheat' line is total bs by the way, most men don't cheat. You also shouldn't just 'put up' with cheating. Dating is more difficult as a parent, but not impossible, and you admit yourself that dating isn't even close to a priority for you, so is a non-issue anyway.\n\nThe last two points are what you're stuck on. Divorce is harsh on kids, and 'you're taking their dad away from them'. Divorce is harsh on kids, I agree, but you know what's worse? Parents who can't stand the sight of each other. Better to divorce than raise kids in a toxic environment, and you admit your husband disgusts you so much you can barely look at him and won't let him touch you. The kids *will* pick up on that. Plus, if you stay married, your husband will expect you to just forget he cheated on you and go back to how things used to be, including sex. *You* may believe you'll just be roommates with a marriage certificate, but your husband will expect you to be a wife, including having a sex life with him. \n\nAs for 'taking their dad from them', that's not your doing if it happens. Getting divorced ends the marriage, it has zero affect on the parental relationship. Sure, you can't both have 100% custody after a divorce unless you continue living together, not a good idea, and it'll be 50/50 or with one of you having primary custody and the other visitation. But getting divorced isn't the reason your dad disappeared from your life, and wasn't something your mum forced on him. Your dad chose to leave you behind completely just to spite your mum. He didn't have to, and a real dad would never even consider such a thing.\n\nIf your husband is a good dad who loves his kids, getting divorced won't change that at all. He'll still be their dad no matter what. If he's a good dad who loves his kids, he'll still be an active dad who has a relationship with them. Only bad dads who don't love their kids choose to dump their kids when they leave their ex. And those dads would cause issues for their kids whether they're in their lives or not. The only other reason for a dad to abandon their kids is if the mum makes it impossible for the dad to do anything else.\n\nI don't know if your dad chose to abandon you or if your mum gave him no choice. But I know what it's like to have your dad prevented from seeing you. My dad was also a cheater, but he was a good dad who adored me and my sister, plus his elder daughter from a previous relationship. My dad's relationship with his eldest never suffered due to him not being with her mum, he retained a great relationship with her. But my mum moved us clear across the country after the divorce, no way to do weekend visits because it was a two day trip by car one way to his place, so we only had summers. She wouldn't let him phone us, this being before mobile phones were common, she'd intercept any mail from him, hide it if it didn't contain a check for us, she'd only give us the stuff that contained money, and then made it impossible for us to visit for summers by signing my sister up for summer long courses and activities, and saying it was unfair if I went and my sister didn't. My dad tried, for years, to maintain a relationship with us, but my mum fully prevented anything that didn't include giving her or us money. \n\nI always hated my mum for that, because I was always closest to my dad. She did try to hide what she was doing from us, tried to make it seem like it was my dad's choice to stop contact and visits, but honestly? We both always knew. My sister didn't care, she bought my mum's stories of my dad being a bad man who abused her (not true), and didn't hold my mum to the same standard about cheating. Yes, I do mean my mum cheated on my dad, too, she also went on to have a relationship with a married man. \n\nGetting divorced was a good thing for us kids, because my parents honestly hated each other that last year. I picked up on that hatred that last year easily, and I was 5 when the divorce was finalised. Our homelife was miserable during that time, and get exceptionally better after the divorce. Mine ended up getting way worse than that as I got older, but that had nothing to do with the divorce, and everything to do with my mum being emotionally abusive. Plus, homophobes are never good parents to gay kids. \n\nHere's your actual choice. Stay married to your cheating husband, be completely miserable and hate your husband more with each passing day, and make your kids miserable until they can move out and go L/NC. Or get divorced, find happiness, make the kids a bit sad for a while but ultimately happier, and encourage a continued relationship with their dad.\n\nYour husband, if you choose divorce, has the choice of being a good dad who remains in his kids lives, or ditching them for no reason because he never cared about them in the first place. \n\nThings won't get better if you stay married, they'll only get worse. He'll know he can get away with cheating and will do it again. You won't suddenly fall back in love with the man that now disgusts you. You'll resent and hate him more and more as he demands everything go back to 'normal' as if his cheating never happened. The kids will pick up on all of it and it will make them miserable.\n\nThis isn't just about the cheating anymore, though that's more than enough reason to divorce. You'll be miserable with him, and you know that. The kids will be better off with a divorce than a toxic marriage. You no longer love your husband, you are, in fact, completely disgusted by him. There is no marriage to save, it's broken beyond repair already, simply because you're disgusted by him. The marriage was broken by your husband, not you, you'll just be making it official. Your husband ended the marriage the second he chose to have sex with a woman who wasn't you, your daughter's teacher at that. It's already over, you just need to finalise it and make it official. But this was his choice, not yours.\n\nFinalise the divorce, that's what's best for both you and your kids.",

There's so much drama, slippery slopes and negativity for both men and women dating people with kids it's not funny. You'll always be in a position to choose whether intentionally or not there's a lot of hard choices on both side if you decide to date someone.  From all the single moms i know and work with the best advice anyone can give you is what are you willing and able to deal with? That's the overall choice you have. Basically be alone for a while and dealing with all that comes with that or staying and living with that hurt and if you can get over that.  \n\nEither way it's a hard choice i wouldn't leave up to strangers for advice. I'd start off making a list pros and cons! I'd weigh everything you can think of on it. Ask your mom for input and  maybe show that dumbass of a husband what he caused see if he feels any kind of regret. He's the reason for all this.  That might help you work out things clearly. Right now you're emotions are all over the place and you're probably not thinking straight. \n\n\nI'm really sorry you and your family is going though this and i wish you the best and how you'll find some happiness after all this!",

In fact speaking as a man I just dumped my 9 month ex a week ago as it is also a dealbreaker for me. She cheated on me with a best friend last august and i found the messages on her computer the night before easter where they were both laughing at me being so \"clueless\" too. Both of them are out of my life and I will hate them forever. I would give anything to meet a loyal woman because every woman ive met has cheated. I have turned down many opportunities where I could have because I could never hurt the person I love like that. I know how it feels.  \n\n2. Even single moms can snap up a good man. Even the worst of the worst. Just flaunt it a little and show him why you are good for him. Stand out from the mooches who just want a free ride. Be independent first.\n3. That's like saying you should let someone keep stabbing you because they think it feels good. Complete bullshit. You can make a change of scene, do a degree and pay the bills yourself\n4. Just about every kid I've met have BEGGED their parents to get divorced after infidelity. The cheater usually ends up being hated by the kids.\n5. You are getting away from a toxic selfish person who would have destroyed all your futures. Getting away from him protects them and the environment they grow up in. When they get older they will understand.  \n\n\nEveryone has regrets when they cant find any stable alternatives. Doesn't mean what your mom said was right. He left. Why should the blame for him being a scumbag cheater fall on you? Anyone who would go as far as to cheat on you is just as likely to leave you abandoned at your worst anyway.\n\nYou are on the right track. Live your life don't live for others selfish interests. Get all the toxic people out of your life INCLUDING the friends and family who encourage this. Start fresh.  \nHold onto that self respect and change up the vibe and scenery.

He chose to leave because he was a horrible dad. Divorce didn't make him leave. Your husband had an affair because he is a horrible husband and soap father.

Unfortunately some people are just morally corrupt. You will find a good person because you will not accept any less after this. I\n\nI think a lot of people say oh he will cheat because that's what they tell themselves when they don't leave their own cheating partner. They can't bear the thought that someone like you had taken control of her life and will not allow anyone to treat them like trash. You keep going and do what is right for you. The children will be ok with your support because kids are resilient. You do your best and everything will fall into place.\n\nYou're incredibly brave and a wonderful role model.

And some\u2026.gravitate harder towards the significant other. Seek help, from a relationship therapist, to find a healthy path towards your departure of the relationship. But I would avoid any idea of no contact, because you need to be an untied front for your kids. They don\u2019t deserve to feel anymore instability. Find a path to explain to them how things will work. Never ever use them as a tool to gain favor or popularity over the other parent. They will one day resent that behavior. Regardless of cheating.

            "EDIT: Still a long post, sorry about that but I hope you manage to read to the end. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nDearest OP, I wrote you my entire story earlier and then deleted it bc I didn\u2019t plan on writing a complete novel, it was long and drawn out! LoL In a nutshell, I can relate bc our stories are similar. I was with my husband for 23 yrs, married for 20 and 2 kids.. at the time they were 12 and 15. And no, divorce is never easy on kids but don\u2019t let ppl con you into thinking that you\u2019re taking their father away, you did nothing wrong and it\u2019s called victim blaming. Your ex will have a schedule to spend time with the kids, if he\u2019s a good dad he\u2019ll show up. My hubs cheated with his boss\u2019s daughter, the owner of the company he worked for. It was a tough decision for me to say anything bc that was part of our income if he got fired.. but I was hurt and angry! He started acting strange about 3 wks before our 20th wedding anniversary, even said the most ridiculous thing but I\u2019m glad he did in hindsight bc it\u2019s what tipped me off. He\u2019s always been somewhat of a jokester and one morning he nonchalantly said that I probably fool around with the mailman every time he\u2019s away. I laughed it off as a joke but the expression on his face was odd, like he expected a different reaction or he was testing me. First off, our mail carrier for the previous 15 yrs was a sweet older lady and she was about to retire, not a man and he knew this so what a weird thing to say. Never in our marriage had we discussed infidelity, I never felt we needed to, I trusted him.. What he said and the way he said it with such a straight face was so odd to me that it weighed on my mind and it became a red flag so I started digging. I knew that I had never cheated so perhaps he spoke out of guilt? It took me a solid week to uncover everything and I couldn\u2019t erase all the inappropriate messages and even photos from my mind. When I confronted him he began to cry and begged me not to leave, I told him that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere and he needed to pack his shit and get out! He pleaded and pleaded but I didn\u2019t budge, I told him that since he was such a good liar that he could make up an excuse to tell the kids as to why he\u2019d be gone for the next couple of weeks. I told him that I was calling the shots and I didn\u2019t want to hear from him, I needed to think about how I was going to cope with the trauma he caused our family. I heard the same BS from well meaning friends and fam.. he\u2019s the main bread winner (not for long he wasn\u2019t!) and think about the kids, men will be men.. etc. Of course the hubs didn\u2019t listen and he phoned me a couple days later profusely apologizing, telling me that the affair ended weeks ago.. he even threw out the mid-life crisis card and begged for us to go to counseling. I hung up on him when he asked why \u201cI\u2019d\u201d throw away a 23 yr relationship, I wasn\u2019t about to let him blame or gaslight me! In the end I think I caved over the pressure from family saying what could it hurt to see a counseling?? So I agreed, told my husband to pick one and I\u2019d show up. I went to 3 sessions and the 4th I didn\u2019t bother to show up. I turned my phone off and drove to the courthouse instead. I inquired about filing divorce papers and who a possible good attorney might be.. which was a smart move bc who would know better than the gals who worked at the courthouse. LoL I joke about that now but if you\u2019ve never been in that position, it\u2019s a lost feeling and very sad feeling and you\u2019re not sure how to go about any of it.. until you just do it. \n\nDearest OP, the reason I couldn\u2019t show up for another pointless counseling session (pointless for me!) is bc I knew I\u2019d never be able to look at my husband in the same way again. I would look over at him in those counseling sessions and I just knew that I would never have that same \u201cin love\u201d feeling that made me choose him as my partner in life. I married him bc we had much in common. He was kind, witty and fit in with my family, he made me feel safe, he felt like home.. etc. We only have one life to live dear OP and I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of mine stressed out or worried about when or if he\u2019d hurt me like that again. Cheating was always a deal breaker for me too and I knew I couldn\u2019t force myself to see past it. I chose happiness for myself, not what other\u2019s were trying to decide for me although I know they meant well.. and the kids spend more time with their dad now than ever before. \nDivorce can be scary but you\u2019ll be okay. I don\u2019t know how to explain it but I woke one day and realized that I had crossed a line where I felt stronger than I thought I was capable of.. and that will happen to you as well. Best of luck to you, don\u2019t settle for less than you and your kids deserve. \n\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf3b",

You are also setting the example for what they think and know about love. Staying in that situation teaches your son that it is okay to cheat and your partner should stick around and support you and it\u2019s teaching your daughters that they shouldnt expect a decent man. None of these are good things. \nYour mom is also looking through faulty lenses. She feels guilt for what could have been. However your dad was cheating on her. There is absolutely nothing that says that he wouldn\u2019t eventually leave her for that woman or another women. And him abandoning you is not on her either. It just proves what a shitty man he was. I don\u2019t know ONE decent father that has abandoned their kids after the divorce. I know plenty of moms that try to keep them away out of anger but any man that wants to stick around in their kids life is going to.

            "My mom was 38 when she divorced my dad. I was 3 and my brother was an infant. She moved in with her parents for a few months and then found us an apartment. When she was moving into the apartment her friend brought over herself, husband, and her brother to help move stuff. My mom's friend's brother was kind, understanding, and immediately enamoured with her. He said to her that day \"I know this is a hard time, but when you are ready to get back out there, please give me a call\". He was a single dad with sole custody of his two kids, a boy and a girl, who were 5-7 years older than us. He would call her just to chat in the meantime. Eventually she asked him to dinner. This man was patient, loving, and completely understood how hard it was to raise two kids on your own. We had a blended family for 7 or 8 years. He would have kept it up with her, but my mom is a self sabotager, so don't mind that. \n\nMy point is, you can find love. There are good men. Sorry your ex ended up being trash.",
            "I grew up with a mom who was abused by my dad and a dad who was constantly cheating on mom. It was horrible. We could always tell there was tension in the room.\n\nLeaving him and finding happiness by yourself or with a new partner would be the decision that would benefit the kids the most. He's still obligated to financially support the kids. It's up to him if he stays in their life. If he chooses not to, that is not your fault.",
            "Ok. \n\nCouple thoughts. First off--only YOU can decide if you want to divorce, and if it's the right thing for your life and family. So forget what \"others think\"\n\nSecond, Im a strong believer in therapy and counseling. I think it's always best to work you way OUT OF A Marriage. No, you weren't the one unfaithful and it IS NOT YOUR FAULT. But IMO It IS your responsibility to see if this is something you can work at, or towards staying married or not. your initial response of repulsion is TOTALLY Understandable. Does he want to make it work? is he remorseful? Has he been completely forthcoming? \n\nIn a marriage it takes TWO to make it work, and ONE to ruin it. If youre willing to at least see if there's anything worth fighting for (I mean, 20 years and 3 kids is nothing to \"throw away\").  But if you know you can and will never forgive him, then it is the right thing to divorce and move on. \n\nThe whole \"baggage\" comment always makes me CRAZY. They are human beings, not baggage. And anyone lucky enough to have them AND you in their lives will know that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck with whatever you choose. I think therapy and doing some work is always worth it.

It certainly isn't true that \"all men cheat\" (I'm a man and I've never cheated) but your husband is one who does.  You can continue to co-parent the kids while being apart.

            "Man o man, do you and I have a similar story. I wrote to you earlier but it wouldn\u2019t post due to some error so I\u2019m going to try and shorten it up this time bc I think I wrote you a novel before. LoL I was with my now ex for 23 yrs, married for 20 and 2 kids ages 12 and 15 at the time. You have well meaning ppl in your life giving you the same BS advice I was given.. especially the part about me/you taking the kids from their father. It\u2019s called victim blaming and you are doing no such thing! Your soon to be ex will have a schedule to see his kids and if he\u2019s a good dad, then he\u2019ll show up. When I confronted my ex about what I had discovered, text messages and risqu\u00e9 photos that I couldn\u2019t erase from my mind, he began to cry and begged me not to leave. I told him I wasn\u2019t going anywhere and to pack his shit and get out! I also said bc he was such a good liar that he\u2019d have no problem coming up with an excuse for the kids an as to why he\u2019d be gone for at least a couple of weeks. I told him I needed to think and I didn\u2019t want to hear from him while he was away,  I was trying to figure out how I was going to cope with the trauma he brought to our family. Of course he didn\u2019t listen and kept phoning me and profusely apologizing. He said the affair had been over weeks ago (how nice!) and pleaded for us to seek counseling. I hung up on him when he asked why I would throw our 23 yr relationship away without trying.. he even threw the mid-life crisis card into the conversation. I wasn\u2019t about to allow him to blame or gaslight me, he\u2019s the one who threw everything away! So to keep this shorter bc there\u2019s sooo much to the story.. I think I caved under the pressure of my family saying \u201cwell what harm can counseling do, just try it for the kids\u201d. I told my ex to find someone and I\u2019d show up. Here\u2019s what happened\u2026 I went to 3 sessions and on the 4th I turned my phone off and didn\u2019t show up. I drove to the courthouse instead to inquire about filing for divorce and possibly gaining knowledge of a good lawyer. I hadn\u2019t really thought about it but what better place to ask about good attorneys than from the gals who work in the courthouse! LoL\nHere\u2019s the reason why counseling was nonsense for me, I\u2019m not telling anyone else not to do it as a last ditch effort to save their marriage if they think it will help.. and if it\u2019s what they want. Cheating was a deal breaker for me too, I never thought in a million that my husband would hurt me in that way. I was sitting next to him during those sessions and I\u2019d look over at him occasionally and what really hit me hard is that I knew I\u2019d never be able to look at him in the same way again. The reasons I married him were gone. He didn\u2019t feel like home anymore, he felt like a stranger to me and a untrustworthy one at that. He tried putting his hand on mine during the last session and it made my skin crawl. We only have one life, I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of mine stressed out or worried about when or if my ex was going to hurt me, I wasn\u2019t going to stick it out for the next shoe to drop. I chose to be happy for myself rather than going along with what others thought was best. Divorce is scary but OP, you\u2019re going to be okay. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it but I woke one morning and I felt as if I had crossed a line where I felt stronger than I ever thought possible and I know you will too.

My dad is on divorce two and my mom came out as gay and has been seeing women. They\u2019re doing just fine and are both with people. You can leave and date at any age. Everyone has baggage. I have baggage and my bf has baggage and we met in our 20s. Emotionally it sounds like you are already a single mom as your partner was showing up for someone else. Screw the person trying to scare you into staying with your partner. Was it his parents? \n\n3. Absolutely dumber than a brick advice. The person who said this does not care a lot about you. I hope it\u2019s not someone you care a lot for. Why do they want you to have such low standards? Are their standards that low? I would ask them that lol. You are also capable of paying for bills and providing for yourself and your family. Taking care of your family does not give anyone the right to cheat. In fact that\u2019s the opposite of taking care of your family. He spent time, money, and energy on someone outside of his family instead of taking care of his wife and kids. \n\n4. The first sentence was great advice. Think about how staying with a cheating husband will affect your kids. You will be unhappy and accepting a HUGE disrespect. They will internalize it and either treat people similarly or allow the same treatment your husband is extending to you. Not to mention the marriage is already broken. He broke it. And coming from an adult child of divorce I knew as a kid for years that something was wrong with our family but didn\u2019t know what. Sometimes I thought it was me. Sometimes I blamed our family dynamic. But it was ALWAYS toxic being together. I did not have a normal childhood. Your kids will grow up in the same dysfunctional atmosphere and possibly internalize it in other ways. It\u2019s very toxic no matter how hard you try to hide it. Divorce is harsh on kids. But staying together when it\u2019s wrong to do so is even harsher and does long term damage. Divorce is rough for the short term but kids need happy and stable parents. Can you be that with a cheating husband who does not respect you or your relationship. Can you live in a loveless marriage. \n\n5. He isn\u2019t signing his rights away he\u2019s free to be a dad. Hopefully you let him, and support that as a coparent. It isn\u2019t right to punish the kids by using them to punish the other partner. You still have to be a partner in parenthood with him. Unfortunately. I\u2019m choose to believe that you are aware and accepting of this and so the person who said this to you is again a piece of garbage. Actual human garbage. How cruel and manipulative. Is this one of his parents speaking? It probably would embarrass them for it to get out why you are divorcing their son or he\u2019d have to move in with them and they don\u2019t want that. \n\nPlease PLEASE tell the person or people who are saying these things to you that they need to keep their dumb mouths shut because they have nothing kind or smart to say on this subject. And if they try to add anything else you are blocking them etc. \n\nAnd I\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re going through this. It sounds like hell on earth. There is a person out there for you who would never treat you so disrespectfully. I hope too you have some good friends and family who are supportive and truly want the best for you and love you in your corner.

            "First off, EVERYBODY, including your mother, is giving you bad advice. Saying something like that just excuses the man's betrayal of his marriage and expects women to lower their self-respect and stay with someone who doesn't respect  their marriage vows or his wife's health. You have heard 1 side of your parents' marriage, and that's your mothers. Maybe your father did move and decided never to see you again. Maybe there is more to the story you don't know. Regardless, your mother and father are not you and your husband. You are 2 different people. If he is a good father who loves his children, he will stay in their life. If you are a good mother, you will set aside the anger you feel for him and co-parent in a healthy way that leaves your children out of the drama. All they should know is that they have 2 parents who love them and will support them even if they aren't together. But what you should not do is stay with someone who had an entire other relationship for a year. It's an even bigger slap in the face that it was your childs teacher. As far as men not wanting to date women with children. I had 2 boys when my husband of 18 years and I got together. We both had children and then had 1 together. There are plenty of men out there who will date women with children, and at your age, most of those men have children themselves. Children are not pieces of luggage. They are a part of you. My advice to you would be, take your time. Do not rush into a relationship with anybody. If you meet someone, take your time and get to know them well before even letting them meet your children. I understand how you feel about flinching when your husband touched you. I wouldn't want that either. I would be thinking about him touching her and kissing her and having sex with her. I couldn't let him touch me again. Just because people have conservative values doesn't mean all of them will accept being betrayed in their marriages. I would stop speaking to all of the people who gave you all of that advice. One last thing is that you are giving an example to your children how relationships should work. Do you want to teach your son's its ok to cheat on their wives and for your daughters to accept their husbands cheating on them? You are doing the right thing for yourself and your children because if you were to try and work on a marriage you no longer wish to be in, your children will feel that misery. I would tell your husband he should've known his marriage was over the minute he started sleeping with someone else. He clearly doesn't want to be with you because if he did, he would've never cheated to begin with. The begging is pointless. I would tell him you want to be civil for custody purposes and you will not accept anything less because THE MOST IMPORTANT THING is making this transition period as easy on your children as possible, but outside of that, its over. Good luck, OP. You deserve better.",
