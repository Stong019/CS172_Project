        "selftext": "About a month ago I posted about my worries on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5uq0sv/me_20s_f_with_my_fellow_student_20s_m_fellow/). \n\n**tl:dr** of original: fellow student often harasses young female students and was applying for a job that would put him in a position of authority over exactly those students he targets. I felt I needed to do something to prevent this from happening. \n\nMy special thanks go out to /u/time_keepsonslipping and /u/Pillbot10011 who had a very, *very* good discussion on sexual harassment in academia and how this was quite a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. However, they did help me see that I actually had a solution that was staring me right in the face. \n\nI went to my mentor, a male professor who's high up the management ladder and actually even responsible for HR for the part of the organization that concerns this story. (Like I said, the solution was *really* staring me right in the face.) I trust this man and I knew he would believe me and follow up on my worries without a second thought. \n\nI wasn't wrong. I went to see him and simply told him something was worrying me deeply and I needed some advice, after which I told him the story. Now, you should know, this man is a very calm and funny guy. This was the first time since I've known him to find him go quiet and to see anger build up in his eyes. \n\nHe asked me for the name of this person and I told him who it was. Then he told me he will go to HR straight away to ask about the status of his application, and if needed would use his executive position to veto the application. \n\nHe came to see me the next day to tell me the department had already turned down the guy based on his qualifications, so in the end, I was worried for nothing. **However**, we started talking about the subject of (sexual) harassment students may face and how they feel rather helpless because they don't really have anyone to turn to and the system actually discourages students from speak up about it.\n\nTurns out this professor has been very, *very* active in trying to implement integrity and equal opportunity policy on a university wide level, but this was only focused on staff, not students. He took it upon him personally to see policy will be revisited on a university level to also include protection for students, not just staff and that he would use my example as the reason why we need to do this as a university. He also told me that in terms of short term action he would personally go to each department head that falls under his jurisdiction to discuss this matter.\n\nWhen I spoke to him again some time later, he told me the department heads weren't really open to even acknowledge the problem (surprise, surprise) let alone do something about it. But he's not the kind of man to take no for an answer, so he's planning to go over their heads and develop some management tools for the whole organizational unit that he hopes will also affect the individual departments. \n\nIn the end, I am really glad I took action. Even though in the end, action wasn't needed to prevent the thing I was worried about, I think me speaking up to my mentor has triggered some processes on different levels in the organization that will hopefully lead to some change. I know from experience that this is a very slow process, and I won't notice much change before I'll leave my university, but still, a start was made. If anything, it will lead to more awareness of this issue on different managerial levels. I'm quite happy with how everything turned out. \n\n**tl:dr** - Had a chat with a professor I know high up the ladder in management. Turned out, fellow student wouldn't have gotten the job anyways. However, my chat with that professor triggered - I hope - positive action on a broader, university wide level that will hopefully lead to some positive change in the years to come.  ",

I am psyched that your mentor immediately recognized that harassment isn't only manifested in asymmetrical relationships but also horizontal ones. The only thing I would say to keep in mind is that ensuring that the management tools are in place doesn't ensure they'll be used. And that selling yourself as a department that takes these issues seriously can be a bit dangerous, because it makes people feel like they can come forward without repercussion and then they get smacked in the face with unexpected repercussions, which was my experience. HOWEVER. All in all, this is a very heartening update.",

I was over the moon with how many people replied. The advice I received was very insightful and useful. I used bits of everyone's answers to compose a letter to my sister before speaking to her on the phone. The letter consisted of sentiments of love and understanding, but also emphasised how her behavior has to stop, and that she needs to seek DBT therapy. I also set very specific boundaries in place and asked her to agree to them. I gave her a heads up via Whatsapp that the email had been sent to to ask her to read it and think on it before we spoke.\n\nHer reaction was very positive -\n\n\"I just want to say thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart, for writing this letter. I am so incredibly grateful and so moved, that you would do this for me after all I have said to you and on top of that having to deal with being sleep deprived and having baby issues. I honestly I am in tears right now because I truly thought that I would have to try and rebuild our relationship on my own and honestly I haven't got the tools or knowledge to know how to do that and I've been so stressed not really knowing what to do or say but knowing that I need to resolve things. I also knew that we needed to set some rules and understandings to help you cope with the situation should it happen again and so I know the consequences if things get too bad and this will hopefully help me to get myself out of it. We'll talk more about this on the phone but this is so good for me. Sorry I haven't covered everything in your email but I don't have much time, just on my lunch break. But I wanted to thank you for taking the time to research and then write down your thoughts, it does mean a lot because you mean so much to me and I don't know what I would do if we didn't keep in contact, not saying that to hold you emotionally hostage or anything, I would be ok, just know that you mean alot and it's incredibly important to me that I stay on good terms with the family. We can discuss the therapy thing when we talk. Hope you have a good day xxxx\"\n\nI'm so happy that she didn't misinterpret anything from my letter and that it went down so well. Good people of Reddit, you may very well have saved my friendship with my sister! I'm very grateful! Let's hope what she says is more than just words and are turned into actions. Have a lovely day, everyone!\n\nTLDR - After receiving Reddit advice, I wrote a letter to my sister. She was very happy and has agreed to improve.",

            "Wow what a mature response from your sister.\n\nI grew out of my BPD diagnosis and what helped was being told by my psychologist that my anger outbursts were in fact fear and that my breakdowns were actually panic attacks. I still struggle with fear to this day, a decade later, but not the destructive anger outbursts.\n\nSometimes just understanding why you react the way you do is enough to work on it, I wish the best for you and your sister ",

            "That is a lovely response and shows the love you share as sisters. It\u2019s a great start to what will hopefully be a good journey together and for her separately. Keep strong with your boundaries and \u2018punishments\u2019 and make sure you look after yourself first. \n\nAfter reading the first post I agree that you have done the right thing and have had some great advice. My extra little bit would be that maybe you might find it cleansing or relaxing to share some former problem areas in a supportive environment like r/BPD or r/justnofamily. Not to bring up bad memories but to release them in a freeing way. Even just writing them down in a book and maybe burning it afterwards could help. To \u2018get them off your shoulders\u2019 kind of thing. The action being symbolic of a fresh start for you and your sister. \n\nI wish you both happiness and love in your future relationship \ud83d\udc9c",
            "I am so happy to hear that.  \n\nI(30F) am pretty sure my sister (27F) has undiagnosed BPD (doesn't do the self harm that I know of, but does a LOT of self-sabotage, lashing out in anger, deep insecurities about being abandoned, uncontrolled emotions, etc.)... she won't go to therapy, is resistant to getting a job (was fired from her last one and now lives off her boyfriend)...\n\nI've decided that instead of trying to \"fix\" her, which is what my mom and dad do a lot of (because that is their job I suppose), I've decided to just be a good example and encourage her.  I know she's resistant to help but there is nothing I can do except be there for her if she asks, hang out with her (but don't rely on her), and just keep it light and in small doses. \n\nI hope one day she can help herself, but I now know there's nothing else I can really do.",
            "Damn. We see a lot of 'faux-pologies' round here, so it's genuinely lovely to read a REAL one. You both did wonderfully here, and I wish you both luck going forward. Your letter will likely really help her future work on herself, as it is a tangible reminder that she is loved and will not be abandoned.",
            "I'm sorry I missed your original post, but just wanted to chime in as someone who is happily married to someone living with BPD. Counseling has taught us both a lot and our communication styles have changed a lot and improved our marriage. My biggest takeaways:\n\n1. It's important I validate his feelings instead of try to disprove something just to make him feel better. (i.e. \"I'm sorry you're feeling that way, what can I do to help?\" vs. \"Don't be silly, you shouldn't have to worry about that\")\n2. I am not responsible for his feelings! I encourage him to work it out on his own, but I no longer get sucked into it or try to fix it.\n3. I haven't even had to do this in a long time but, stick to your boundaries! We have outlined what is and what isn't acceptable in our marriage and I don't cave.\n4. If he says he's feeling overwhelmed or needs space, I give it, no questions asked. I don't push arguments and allow him the time he needs to process.\n\nIt's worked out great for us and we have so much fun together! Sending good thoughts to you and your sister!",

            "Unfortunately,  people with BPD have a tendancy to destroy close relationships. I know this, as I have been the destroyer and have BPD. She has to want to change and get help. It's not your responsibility and by no means are you required to endure it because you're family.",
            "Wow that is amazing news! My sister does the same and refuses to see it as anything other than my fault, so we don't have a relationship anymore. I wish you two the best on improving your relationship! ",
            "So glad your sister took your thoughts positively!\n\nReading your first post is actually super relevant to me right now, because my mother has BPD, and I am bipolar, so our dynamic has been very similar to how you describe yours with your sister. I've recently been just fed up with being the more mature one in my relationship with her and struggling with how to approach her with basically saying, \"enough is enough.\" \n\nI'm going to read through some of the suggestions on your first post and try compiling a letter to her. I hope it will be as well received as your sister's was.",
            "The only thing I would like to add is, as hopeful as it sounds, it will still be a long journey ahead. Not to be cynical but BPD is still at times very challenging, so expect that there will be setbacks. I wouldn't want you to feel so hopeful and immediately return to square one once your sister is unable to regulate her emotions again. But good on you for continuing to try and hope things will progress in the right direction.",

It's extremely likely she'll go back to her old ways within a 2 or 3 weeks once she no longer fears you leaving her life. It's literally how BPD works and anyone who has lived through the horror of loving someone with BPD knows this stage all too well as it sucks you right back into their toxic behavior. There'll be excuses to not get therapy and rationalizations of why you deserve her abusive behavior once again. \n\nNot saying it's impossible to improve your relationship with your sister, just be prepared for it to get real hard again in a couple of weeks. As others recommended, get some books on how to deal with BPD people and set and keep very firm boundaries to protect yourself. BPD is never ever an excuse for putting up with shitty abusive behavior. You gotta have empathy for yourself. Good luck.",
            "Don't take this the wrong way but something about the wording of response puts me a little on edge. She says that you need to have boundaries set 'to help YOU cope with the situation.' This makes me feel that in therapy she may push all the fault on you, but I'm not a therapist and I have no training in this so my opinion isn't worth much and I'll probably get downvoted for this but I feel you need to be careful moving forward.

            "Apologizing means nothing if actions don\u2019t change is what I\u2019m saying. Someone actually doesn\u2019t want you too keep apologizing if your actions do not change. I meant what I said that if someone generally loves you they will ultimately work with you because it took me a long to realize that I was actually the problem. And all of those apologies leading up to that meant nothing before I was just doing it to do so as it seems. There are no red flags, it\u2019s just real life my guy.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway because the wife knows my main. Sorry in advance for this rambling mess.\n\nSince my wife and I got married three years ago, things have been\u2026off. I know that people grow and change with time, but around our wedding, my wife changed drastically. She bleached her dark brown hair blonde right before the ceremony, and I honestly thought I was in the wrong church for a split second when she came down the aisle. We moved into our house right after the honeymoon, and she went into full domestic mode. We\u2019d shared cleaning duties before, but once we moved into the house, she became INSISTENT on doing everything before I could even get to it. Since this is our first house, I thought it was some kind of homeowner nesting thing, but it never stopped.\nHer hair color is none of my business and I think most people would be happy not to have to clean, so I honestly didn\u2019t really think much of either of those things at the time. The big thing has always been how closed off she got after the wedding. When we were dating, she\u2019d tell me long rambling stories about her feelings and rant to me when she was upset and all that, and I liked hearing about what was going on inside her head. After the wedding, that stopped pretty abruptly. If I ask her how her day is, she will only ever tell me that it was \u201cfine!\u201d or \u201csuper!\u201d She doesn\u2019t talk to me about her feelings anymore, ever, even when I explicitly ask \u201chow do you feel about x?\u201d She also stopped telling me about anything important that happened to her. About a year after we got married, her grandfather died. Did she tell me she\u2019d lost her grandfather? No. She told me that she had to go to a conference for work on the other side of the country, which I thought nothing of. On the second day she was gone, her older brother texted me to tell me that my in-laws had really missed seeing me at the funeral. When I called her to ask why in the ever loving hell she didn\u2019t tell me, and then LIED about it, all she would say was \u201cI didn\u2019t want to trouble you. You have a lot on your plate\u201d. After that, she went on a couple of \u201cspontaneous family trips\u201d. She\u2019s really, REALLY close to her family, so the first time she said she was going camping with her brother at their alma mater, I didn\u2019t think a lot of it other than to be slightly disappointed and confused that I wasn\u2019t invited, because her brother\u2019s cool and the three of us go camping together a lot. But the second time, I started hearing alarm bells. \n\nI\u2019d like to say I\u2019m a more secure man, reddit, but after the second \u201cspontaneous family trip\u201d, my wheels started spinning and I started to think that maybe she was cheating. This was a weird insecurity in the back of my mind for a while, since she wasn\u2019t showing any other big signs of cheating (she wasn\u2019t guarded about her phone and hadn\u2019t changed her routine/appearance). A few weeks ago, she told me she was pregnant. I was over the moon about it until I asked her how many weeks along she was, and she nonchalantly said \u201cabout 12 or 13\u201d. She\u2019d been pregnant for like three months before she even bothered to tell me! She\u2019s not really showing at all, and she doesn\u2019t usually drink, so I had been completely in the fucking dark. I honestly hadn\u2019t even suspected. \n\nThat was kind of it for me. I was sure she was cheating, and that it wasn\u2019t my kid. I thought there was no possible way that a woman would keep her pregnancy a secret from HER HUSBAND for three months. So I snooped. Yes, I know I was wrong, but I wanted proof that she\u2019d been having an affair before I moved out. One of my best buddies from college is a divorce attorney, and when I asked him what I should do, he sent me the info for a key logger. I installed it on my wife\u2019s laptop and was prepared for the worst. Now, I feel like what I found is somehow worse than her cheating. I didn\u2019t find any steamy messages, but I found out that she keeps a diary in a word document that she writes in every day. I know I should have just stopped once I knew she wasn\u2019t cheating, but once I saw my name in her diary, I couldn\u2019t stop. I read all of it. All seven separate documents, going back to way before we\u2019d even met.  \n\nTurns out she\u2019s not cheating. She\u2019s depressed as fuck, hates herself, and has absolutely no trust in me. All of the stuff I\u2019d been confused and bothered by has some kind of sad, self-loathing explanation. She hates having blond hair, but she writes \u201cI know he\u2019d divorce me if I went back to being a brunette, because wives are supposed to be blond\u201d almost every week. The \u201cwives are supposed to be\u201d thing is tangled up in everything. She thinks wives are supposed to be quiet, which is why she doesn\u2019t talk to me anymore. She thinks wives are supposed to \u201cmake things easier for their husbands, not harder\u201d, which is why she didn\u2019t tell me when her grandfather died. It just goes on and on and on. She didn\u2019t tell me when she got a huge promotion and a raise because \u201che\u2019d leave me in a heartbeat if he knew I made more money than he does. Men can\u2019t handle that\u201d. It hurt to know that she thinks of me as some kind of one-dimensional 1950\u2019s husband, and I\u2019ve been wracking my brain to think of anything I could have done to make her think this way. \n\nWhat I can\u2019t handle is that she\u2019d lied about the big stuff. I honestly don\u2019t know if I can forgive her for not telling me about the miscarriages. The \u201cspontaneous family trips\u201d were actually her miscarrying two of our children, one at five weeks, the other at about 10. She went and stayed with her parents while she was recuperating, and her brother and sister came to support her. But not me. I didn\u2019t get to be there for her, because she thinks I would leave her immediately if I knew that she\u2019d \u201ckilled\u201d our children. She\u2019s convinced that she caused both miscarriages because she smoked pot for a long time before we got married. For what it\u2019s worth, it sounds like her family tried both times to get her to tell me, but she wouldn\u2019t. She finally told me about this pregnancy because her parents threatened to tell me she didn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m just absolutely fucking dumbfounded. I don\u2019t even know what to think right now. I\u2019m just so baffled because everything she says about me in her diary is insanely nice. She goes on for pages and pages about how much she loves me and how she thinks I\u2019m her soul mate and how she would do anything for me. I just can\u2019t understand why she thinks that I would leave her. Knowing that she\u2019s spent the last three years walking on eggshells around me, convinced that I would leave her at the drop of a hat is just so\u2026confusing and awful. I feel like our marriage is some kind of lie. The woman I thought was self-confident and ready to take on the world is actually full of self-loathing and really, really, REALLY depressed. I don\u2019t know her at all. She\u2019s been suffering silently with depression long before we met. She has no faith in me, no trust. She thinks that every hug and kiss I give her and every \u201cI love you\u201d I say is a lie. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. She obviously needs serious help, but I don\u2019t know how to get it for her. I can\u2019t tell her that I read her diary. If she has zero trust in me now, I can\u2019t even imagine what she\u2019d think if she knew if I read six years worth of her private thoughts. I feel like I need to get my in-laws on board somehow, but I don\u2019t know what to say to them. I know I can\u2019t ignore this, but I feel like any move is the wrong move. What do I do??\n\nTl;dr: thought wife was cheating so I snooped and read her diary. She's actually insanely depressed, has secretly miscarried two of our children, and doesn't trust me one iota. How do I get her help without making things worse?\n\nEdit: after I posted this I realized I'd kind of omitted the deal with the key logger. It's worse than it sounds, honestly. After it showed me what she'd written that day I went onto her computer while she was sleeping and opened up Word. I saw that she had several documents called \"diary year x\" so I downloaded them all onto a flash drive and read them at work. I went too far, I know.",

            "I think I'd consider discussing everything you know with a professional, and see what they suggest the next step is. ",
            "Counseling. Right now. She needs way more help than you or her family can give her. ",
            "Woahhh, that is some really bad depression. She needs major, major therapy, and you both need couples counseling. She's lying to you about very important things in your life and is internalizing a stereotype that wives should be like a 1950s housewife (why is she thinking this in the first place if that's now how she was before marriage?). You need to tell her about what you've read and that she needs separate therapy and you both need counseling together.",
            "She needs therapy. She needs serious, intensive therapy. And you both need counseling together. \n\nHer views on marriage and how to treat herself and you are incredibly unsettling and unhealthy. She needs professional help. \n\nBlaming herself for miscarrying, suppressing her emotions and self hatred are all heart-breaking. Please get her help. And yourself help. And your marriage help. ",
            "Wow. This is way above reddit's pay-grade. I agree with the other posters. She needs counseling ASAP, and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to get into couples counseling. \n\nGood luck OP, hopefully she gets the help she needs. ",
            "Normally I'd say reading a diary is a bit of a violation, but in this case, I think it may have been necessary.  Your wife is obviously very unhappy and skilled at hiding it, and there was no other way you were going to know.\n\nI'm not sure how you go forward on this, though, because you're right: if she doesn't trust you now, finding out you read her diaries for the past several years is hardly going to help that.  I'd say you should talk to your in-laws first, but let them know that you are primarily concerned about your wife's/their daughter's health and happiness.  \n\nI'm so sorry both you and your wife are going through this.  I will say that sometimes, there is a huge cultural pressure to be a certain way once you become a wife.  Whether it's a general cultural perception, social media influence, or family expectations.  It doesn't have to come from your husband, so don't beat yourself up over that if you really can't see that you may have influenced those thoughts. ",
            "Don't beat yourself up over the snooping too much.\n\n1. You knew something was badly off, and it *was*.  You weren't being paranoid.\n2. Also, she's the woman you love, whom you married, and who needs your help very very very badly right now.  If you use the information you gained to control her, or to be abusive, or to exploit her fears, then sure, you're the world's biggest dick.  But if you use the information to help her...then...good?  Your marriage vows probably said in sickness and in health, and she's sure as fuck sick right now.\n\nBeing married does mean that your spouse gets to make some decisions on your behalf in some cases.  And this is a crisis; sometimes you have to cut a corner or two.\n\nGoing forward:\n\n1. You're right, you can't just tell her\n2. She needs serious professional help, very badly\n3. I think you need to get her family on board.\n\nBasically, I think you should reach out to them behind her back, tell them the gist (they already know a lot of it), and then between you all you can collaborate to find a way to get her the professional help she needs.\n\nImportant stuff to keep in mind:\n\n1. This isn't really her \"fault\", any more than having asthma is her fault.  You probably feel a little hurt and betrayed that she didn't turn to you for help with this problem, but in a very real sense, the core problem is that she *couldn't* turn to you for help.\n2. This is probably pretty urgent to fix.  Especially if she's pregnant.  If she miscarries again it could do a lot of damage to her; if she carries to term she's at serious risk of post-natal depression.  Either way, lives are possibly at stake; she needs help.\n3. This is fixable.  May not be fast, probably won't be easy, but modern medicine can do a lot.\n4. Once the serious \"holy shit\" stuff is sorted, couples counselling is probably called for.  There's a lot of rebuilding that needs to be done, once the two of you are capable of being on the same page.",
            "Christ on a crutch!  Get her into therapy ASAP.  Someone long ago fucked up her idea of marriage and is causing her to miss out on so much in life.\n\nDon't even mention the diary.  Put it to her as you feel like you are not doing something right as a husband and you want her to be happy.  Tell her that the couples therapy is the only option since she will not open up to you.  Once in therapy, paraphrase things from the diary just to lead the conversation.  Leading with the diary will only cause her to retreat further.",
            " \u201cI know he\u2019d divorce me if I went back to being a brunette, because wives are supposed to be blond\u201d \n\n\nThere is a lot of good advice here about therapy and talking to her and such, but I would also encourage you to suggest she become a brunette again somewhere along the line. If she obsesses over it that much, maybe you telling her you want her to be that brunette she thinks she can't be will be a small token of you loving and accepting her.",
            "Aside from the counseling, which is a fantastic recommendation, how are you with her parents?  If you get along with them, I think you should call them and share with them what you found, and see if they have any insight.  She's obviously been telling them much more than she's been telling you.  \n\n",
            "I don't think you have the room to lie to her here.  She needs serious help, and I think she's only going to get it if you're very very honest with her.\n\nTell her everything.  From the beginning, just like you did here.  Reinforce over and over how much you love her, then make an appointment with a therapist for her.  I'd start with couples counseling, just so you can go with her and express your concerns - make sure she doesn't gloss over things.\n\nI'm also concerned that you don't have *time* to be super gentle about it.  If something happens - I hesitate to say \"goes wrong\" - during or after the pregnancy, something like post-partum depression, on top of her already crippling issues.... she may not be able to handle it at all.  Pregnancy is so hard on a woman anyway, all her anxiety and depression may be magnified just by being pregnant.  I assume she's been going to her doctors regularly?\n\nI wouldn't get the inlaws involved... yet.  If she starts going to treatment and improves, she'll be happy you didn't embarrass her to them.  If she refuses treatment, you can get them involved as reinforcement.",
            "I used to be similar to your wife. It's strange, kind of like a perfect storm that creates someone like this. My mom was feminist/homemaker, too. My parents are outwardly \"happy,\" but there's a lot of negativity and tension inside the marriage, and she may have had a similar experience growing up. It sucks when your parents are basically living a lie, and that's the impression of marriage you grow up with. \n\nIn my teens, I gravitated toward bad relationships, some abusive. They just further pushed me into depression, and I naturally fell into the \"everything is great\" homemaker role where I would give more and more and they would take advantage. I was trapped so far into my mind it was hard to get out. \n\nFast forward to now, I've been in therapy for two years, and a healthy relationship for one. I would not be where I am now without my amazing therapist, who has taught me boundaries and self-worth and communication. I would not be where I am without my amazing boyfriend, who helps me practice what I learn in therapy. I still have issues relating to my past, even after all these years, but I'm finally learning to untangle myself and get out of my damn head. I can speak my mind now. I am happy. I am authentic. \n\nPlease get her into therapy so she can see what kind of life is possible. Help her find happiness. ",
            "You are trying to apply a logical solution to a very volatile situation and person.  She clearly doesn't think healthily, so while you approach the issue logically and healthily, DO NOT be shocked if it does not go well.  The trap is, you now know these things and feel an obligation to fix it.  And while that is admirable and awesome of you as a person, you can't let it destroy you while you try and save someone else who may not be ready for saving.\n\nThis situation screams Talk To A Professional(s) before making any moves.  \n\nAlso, I realize you feel like you have something to lose by telling her about your researching what she was up to, but truly, you aren't going to risk anything that wouldn't have happened no matter what you do, how you frame it, or how you approach it.  You don't have that power, especially in dealing with someone with this skewed of a thought pattern.  \n\nThe important thing is that you eventually tell her.  Both for your own well being and conscious, and because hiding things from her is just as bad as her hiding things from you.  \n\nA slight chance here that if she knows you \"goofed\" up in life in your relationship with her, she may feel a lot better about her goof up.  Then again, that's somewhat applying logic to a situation that is so clearly not lending itself to linear problem solving.\n\nGood luck to you.  Please don't strangle yourself in trying to help someone else.  Professional help seems like a must in this situation.",
            "That kind of ingrained belief system is coming from somewhere - likely childhood.\n\n\nShe doesn't trust or love herself, so it doesn't make sense that anyone else would. The only way the logic makes sense is if she believes you don't really know her.\n\n\n\nShe has GOT to get into therapy, like yesterday. Take her to a couples session. Tell her \"A husband is supposed to take care of his wife\" if that will help. Tell her you read her diary when you're with the couples therapist. Tell her you thought she wasn't interested in you anymore and that's why. \n\n\nOr, print selections of her diary and go to therapy yourself and ask the therapist what to do next.\n\nTherapy is the ONLY answer.",
            "Goddamn. I wish I knew what to tell you, but I am stumped. \n\nShe's not well mentally. That much is clear. But it's tough to know how you can broach the subject without revealing that you read her diary, which may not be the best thing for her to learn right now. \n\nWhatever her diagnosis is, she's suffering from some pretty insane delusions. I understand you feel betrayed by her lies, but there could be something much more serious going on. \n\ntalk to a professional before you do anything else. ",
            "As others have said, your wife needs councelling. It might be hard, but try not to be angry at your wife for withholding the latest pregnancy. I've been through miscarriages with my wife and it's difficult to know when to announce a successful pregnancy (I was nervous the entire pregnancy with my son, right up until he took his first breath). There's not a good way to announce a miscarriage and even though she should have told you, she was obviously in a bad place (not telling you stuff like that is a symptom of depression). \n\nYour wife needs help and she needs it now. This needs to be dealt with before delivery. You do not want to wait until post partum. She may need antidepressants -- you both should do research on what the risks/benefits are (and unfortunately, it can be difficult to tease out because of how medications are rated for pregnant women). ",
            "I kind of wondered if that might be it (suddenly insisting that she does 100% of the cleaning, weirdly chipper attitude all the time, blonde hair). \"Wife\" status can put a lot of pressure on already insecure women who feel like if they don't do this and do do that their husband will leave them immediately. \n\nYour wife CLEARLY needs counseling, which you already know. What if you suggested \"couple's counseling\" and then kind of segued to individual counseling after that?",
            "I've been dealing with depression and it's just so hard to understand how much it completely screws with your head, your perception, and your decision making until you're in the midst of it yourself.  \n\nYour wife isn't lying to deceive you.  She loves you and doesn't want to burden you with what she's going through.  Talking about depression with someone who's on the outside is just... well, it's about the hardest thing I can imagine.  \n\nAs someone who has been down that rabbit-hole, please try not to be angry with your wife about the deception.  She's hurting, badly, and she needs all the love and support you can give.  \n\nSerious therapy for her and for the both of you is the best step you can take right now.  I really do wish you all the best.\n",
            "I'm so sorry for her. She must feel so trapped. And I'm very sorry that you had to learn about her this way. It must have been such a shock.\n\nIt is true that you violated her privacy and she may be very very angry about that. It takes a lot to rebuild trust. I do agree that you should consider speaking to a professional first, without her, so you bring this up with her in a constructive way. For the time being, would you please buy her some flowers and give her a hug for me?",
            "Therapy, therapy, therapy.  And be prepared for a long recovery time.  She's buried herself pretty deep in her facade and it's hard to undo that considering she more or less got what she wanted from her efforts.  She didn't cause you any trouble whatsoever.\n\nI'm just trying to figure out which Stepford wife in her world kidnapped and brainwashed her hours before the ceremony.",
            "The first thing you can do is suggest casually that you miss her old hair colour. If she thinks she has your permission, and even encouragement, to go back then she might do it. Seeing her old self in the mirror every day could have a big positive impact on her without you having to give away that you read her diary.",
            "As pretty much everyone else is saying, therapy/counselling is a must, right away. \n\nI don't think anything else will help and even therapy will take work and time. \n\nI guess the good you can take from this is at least you know she loves you. She's just got some issues she is dealing with. And it sounds to me like you're at least willing to go through it with her, since she's not cheating on you. \n\nGood luck man, hopefully your next update is a good one. ",
            "I totally understand the feeling, especially with how much and how serious the lies are, that she is doing this to you. But as someone who has experienced serve depression and anxiety I wanted to try to provide you with another viewpoint, so you can see that most likely isn't the case.\n\nWhen I am in the midst of my depression I am literally a different person. Even though I go through periods of normalcy, when I am depressed I have always felt like this and it will never end. It taints all my memories and makes me absolutely sure that I will always be like this, things will never change and I am a terrible person who deserves to feel like this. You are tired and angry and so sad you just want to scream and scream because there aren't any words that can express how badly you feel. You feel like your heart is being crushed in your chest and there is nothing that makes that feeling go away. Everyone knows how awful you are and you are a burden on everyone around you. The people in your life are so close to leaving, because really you are so awful, they should leave you. At my worst, I would beg my boyfriend to leave me.\n\nIn this state for me, it is difficult to get out of bed or to eat. Brushing my teeth or showering is an accomplishment. Going to work and being polite to everyone and not letting anyone see you cry is a marathon. \n\nI felt like this even though I was in treatment with a psychologist/therapist and a psychiatrist. I would see my therapist weekly and was on some pretty heavy medication. \n\nMy depression came out of genetics and some difficult things in my childhood. I have worked for years to get myself into a better place, and I can say that I'm not perfect (and I never will be) but there is a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nSo although it is totally natural to see this as her doing this to you, you have to trust me when I say that it isn't really about you. In her reality, she is doing this to protect you from the evil inside her head. It doesn't make any sense and it isn't rational but she is so far inside her own head she can't see that right now. \n\nShe obviously needs serious help. I'm not sure what the best course of action would be, but a great place to start would be NAMI- the National Alliance on Mental Illness at 800-950-6264, Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., ET. They also have a lot more information on their website (which I can't link) at nami.org They have a specific section for family member and they can refer you to more resources specifically in your state. If you need help finding resources- PM me your state and I can find some more specific stuff. ",
            "If you want her to be completely open and honest with you, then you should be completely open and honest with her. All I see here is a man who truly loves and wants to help his wife, and I think telling her all of this is the only way to do that. You can't go on like this, and she definitely shouldn't without getting serious help. Were you aware of any psychological problems that she may have had before you got married? \n\nI don't think it's a bad idea to talk with her family and get them involved, especially since she really seems to trust them. But I think you should talk to her first. Explain that you invaded her privacy because of how secretive she's become, and that you were concerned. It may not justify it, but I also think it's pretty reasonable based on what you've said here. \n\nAlso, I know its hard, but try not to take her trust issues with you too personally. When you're severely depressed and filled with self-loathing it is impossible to understand how anyone else could love you. ",

Counseling is absolutely necessary, both individual and couples.",
            "I'm echoing what everyone says on counseling, but please give her a chance to work through all this with you. It sounds like she does love you so much and is terrified about losing you. I don't think she's been lying to you to be malicious or because she doesn't trust you. She just has no self-esteem for whatever reason. Stick by her, do nice things for her when you can, reassure her about the things it sounds like she was concerned about, such as her hair. I think you all can make this work. Best of luck!",
            "Well, I think she needs therapy - like, yesterday - but I see what you mean about not wanting to break her trust. Consider telling her, gently, that you've been worried about her and so went looking for clues to her emotional state. Definitely ask and see if her family has noticed any changes in her behaviour. Maybe if they're worried too they can suggest she sees somebody.\n\nWhile you think about ways to get your wife the help she desperately needs, how about looking for opportunities to reinforce more positive behaviour? Work at drawing her into a conversation about her day, get as much out of her as you can, and then tell her (cheerfully, casually, *not* like you're trying to make a point) that you love hearing about what she's been up to.\n\nCook together when you can, find an opportunity to take on some of the cleaning yourself, and if/when she objects tell her you want to take some of it off her plate - \"We both work, seems fair that we share the cleaning too!\"\n\nI'm guessing she has to maintain her blonde hair, have you asked her whether she's considered going back to brunette?\n\nAll of these are potential ways to treat some of the symptoms, but the underlying cause is probably beyond your ability to deal with. She needs professional input on this, I think. What's her parents relationship like? Is it very traditional?\n\nI haven't touched the pregnancy thing, but with the cocktail of hormones that will be going on in her body right now this could be a particularly difficult time for her.

My instinct is to go find her and tell her the things you've said here, then hold her, and reaffirm that you love her independent of these ideas.\n\nAnd maybe couples' counseling can give you guys the tools for becoming emotionally intimate again. \n\nI'm sorry, my heart is so sad for you guys.",

            "Nobody on this thread is going to be able to diagnose what is wrong. It sounds like either she is suffering from psychotic depression or was raised with an incredibly disturbing view of what it means to be a wife. I don't think you went too far considering her odd behavior. I think you need to get her to see a therapist and probably a psychiatrist. If you frame it as a problem in your relationship rather than a problem with her it may feel less threatening and if you also attend counseling it may make her more likely to agree.",

'im here and im not going anywhere, come back to me'.\n\nsecond, professional help. this is a seriously deep rooted self hatred that *will not be solved by the first conversation*. this is something that is going to take years of therapy, both couples counseling and individual.\n\nsupport from her friends and family will help too, you aren't in this alone. \n\nalso, be prepared to deal with her turning this on herself, possibly every step of the way. your resolve will likely be the first step to her *seeing the truth* of your relationship, and ultimately her decision to live with a better, mentally positive, self image.\n\nbest of luck to you both.",

Your wife changed immensely after marriage and you have never brought yourself to even ask her about just her hair color, much less her complete taking over of the chores, and also her complete lack of communication with you. You sat back and let her take over all the household chores, even though she works as long hours as you, if not more, and her job is as hard as yours or harder. She stopped telling you ANYTHING about her feelings. And you never even asked her WHY she became completely different. You NEVER asked her why she wasn't confiding in you anymore. At ALL.\n\nYou write: \"She has no faith in me, no trust. She thinks that every hug and kiss I give her and every \u201cI love you\u201d I say is a lie.\" YOU changed COMPLETELY! NO normal conversations, NO chore sharing, NO information about her job or her health. You say she has \"spent the last three years walking on eggshells around\" you: that is because you stopped caring about her, or at least, completely stopped communicating and observing her--and started letting her take complete care of you as though you were her child. NO WONDER she is so worried and thinks her marriage is destroyed! \n\nDo NOT EVER print out her diary and show it to ANYONE. It is NOT yours and you have NO RIGHT to show it to her parents or anyone else in her life or even her therapist. Please destroy your copy immediately. She is no danger to herself or others. Do NOT betray her further.\n\nPlease stop talking about \"treating\" HER and about \"committing\" HER.

When you sit down you begin with how much you have seen her attitude change since getting married.  Say that you love her no matter what but you felt like the girl you wanted to marry was not the same person as the one who showed up on your wedding day. \n\nTell her how humiliated you felt to find out that her grandfather had passed from her family.  Married people are supposed to be a team and her lying to you about that is 100% unacceptable.  Then mention the family camping trip and how you were hurt that she had not invited you along.  Say how you were feeling about 2 those trips, the truth. \n\nThen mention the second trip.  and say that by that point you were 60% sure that she was cheating on you.  Then the pregnancy happened.  She was so far along and you did not know at all, you thought that given all the lies to date this baby might not be yours and so you did something bad.\n\nNow is where you confess.  You say that you are incredibly sorry for what you have done, and you hope that she can forgive you.  But your state of mind was that you knew she was lying to you and so you started doing some snooping to find out for sure.  Tell her you found her diary and have read it.\n\nNow you understand that she has not been cheating on you, but you are confused.  In your mind the most important duty that a husband and wife have to one another is to tell the truth.\n\nYou understand that she is depressed.  You understand that she is afraid you will leave her.  However the actions she has taken in an attempt to preserve her marriage have put the marriage in danger.  You are not interested in being married to whatever she thinks a \"wife should be\".  You wanted to marry the girl she was before the wedding, that's why you asked that girl to marry you.  Whoever it was who showed up to the ceremony and every day since, is someone else. ",

The blonde hair thing in particular jumped out. Whatever your wife's issue is, she needs a lot of therapy. You might need to get her family on side with you as well in order to get her to accept help. ",
            "I think you should be honest about getting the diaries, but not about the key logger. \n\nI think you should tell her that everything she's doing that she says she hates are things you don't want or need. You can say you like her as a brunette and that her obsession with being a perfect housewife and not telling you anything that might worry you has actually caused you to have concerns that she may be cheating instead of making you think the marriage is perfect.",

You don't want some 1950s Stepford wife, you want *her*, flaws and all.  Then ask if you two can start from square one, starting with therapy for her and counseling for both of you.

        "selftext": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4dh3b3/my_best_friend_22f_of_16_years_who_has_never/\n\n\nThe previous from my first post **TL;DR:** my best friend of 16 years who has never shown interest in me shows up at my college apartment one day and randomly has sex with me. She's been coming over pretty much every other day since the semester started. I've liked her for years but she won't give a definitive reason as to what this means or where it's going and it's scares me.\n\nDespite most people including many of my closest friends telling me to just end things with her or force her into a decision, I decided to just ride it out accepting that I'd probably get tossed to the side when someone better came around for her. \n\nWe went on to be FWB for about 4 months and those were honestly the most nerve-racking months of my life never knowing when or if it was going to end or what she was really thinking. I tried my best to play it off as if it didn't bother me but really it was a bitter-sweet time for me.\n\nAfter our school semester ended we drifted a part a little bit, we both were spending time with family and friends. We both had extremely busy semesters and spent most of the time studying or with one another so it was expected. \n\nShe ended up going on vacation with her parents to visit her grandparents in England. She did invite me to come along months ago but I already had other obligations so I couldn't go with her despite wanting to.\n\n\nWe did talk on the phone a few times while she was away, I actually had annual soccer tournament with my traveling team and we met this all girl's team at the tournament that I was telling her about it since she plays soccer as well. \n\nShe seemed happy for me that I was having fun but I could tell that it was bothering her I just chalked it up to maybe I sounded like I was bragging or something.\n\nTwo weeks later she asks me if I can pick her up from the airport because she flew back early and she nearly knocks me over she hugs me so tightly. She never shown so much intimacy in public before she even tells me that she really missed me. \n\nIt's like 8pm and we go to Starbucks she's being like really different, a lot quieter than normal and she seems a little nervous around me like she wants to say something.\n\nEventually she confesses that she realizes that she does like me as more than just a friend and she apologizes for her unfairness making me wait so long before giving me an answer. \n\nShe tells me that before she left she didn't really know what she wanted, she didn't know if she wanted a relationship or if she was ready to be in one. She said that she was afraid to get into a relationship with me only to realize that she didn't want it and feared that our friendship would be never bounce back.\n\nShe told me that she experienced a lot of things in England and was sad that she wasn't able to experience them together. She talked to her older sister who lives in England who really put in some good words for me. \n\nSo we're officially dating and everything has been awesome, couldn't be happier. Sorry if this update is bit lacking, I tried to summarize three weeks worth into this post without making it a novel. But if you have any questions about anything just let me know.\n\nThanks for the advice on the original post really gave me some solid perspective.\n\n**TL;DR:** We're finally dating and everything is great. I guess it pays to be patient sometimes. We'll be celebrating our first month on the 1st of July.\n",

My husband and I are similar; we were close, best friends for about 3 years, then we started to mess around a little and gave eachother our first kiss, then a little bit later we became official and yesterday we celebrated being together for 5 years and we just got married in February! I think it's the same for you where, when you're with someone who's always been your best friend...its an amazing feeling...you already know everything about each other so there's no awkward 'dating' or gradually finding out they do things that drive you crazy; you will still learn so much together, you'll have conflicts and disagreements, but it's easier I think and goes better when you're core is being great friends.\nI hope you two have a happy, long relationship!!",

Women want to have sex, like, y'know, fifteen minutes after us, so alright, if you hold out for twenty she'll be chasing you for five.\"\n\nSeems like this is more or less what happened to you.

It's obvious in your statement that you place her on a pedestal and that's fine, but I really hope you start to recognize your own worth and stop putting her out of your league. You did it! You and you alone and, best of all, you did it by being yourself. Don't second guess and let insecurities get the best of you. She chose you, out of every guy she knows, she chose you.

            "I don't want to be the Debbie Downer here. But don't celebrate this as some amazing success. \n\nListen OP. The best way to keep yourself from growing old, bitter and cynical is to use some rational thinking to go along with letting the magic of love and relationships happen.\n\nRemember, she had all those years to express she liked you. She didn't. She \"came to the realization\" that she did. Which means she had to warm up to you. I'm going to tell you as a 34 year old who has had 4 serious relationships in my lifetime and is now married and stupid happy with my marriage the reason why my marriage is almost ten years old and I'm stupid happy is because from the outset me and my wife were crazy about one another. We were very attracted to one another. We liked spending time with each other. Sure there were some doubts initially but they didn't linger long.\n\nIt took her years dude. Remember that before you plow into this head first without a helmet without thinking. Remember that before you give yourself over to her and start getting all these amazingly intense feelings of love and devotion for her. Remember she was lukewarm to downright cold to you and had the opportunity to not be. \n\nLet me give you a lesson that you're going to learn soon now that you're done with school. Real life is real life. It's not a movie, book or television series. There's a strong chance that your crush didn't \"come around\" to liking you for some cute, beautiful reason that you've only seen or heard about in fiction. Chances are \"coming around\" to liking you is a real negative. And here's why.\n\nWhen you meet someone you're into you should be attracted to them from the outset. That attraction is the foundation of a relationship. The relationship then forms around that initial attraction. Her having to \"come around\" to being interested in you after all these years really doesn't bode well. \n\nSo before you celebrate that this is some sort of victory remember that she had to \"come around\" and let that temper how you proceed in these beginning days. If eventually she can prove to you that \"the right person was in front of my face all this time and I just didn't see it\" then fine, plunge head long into that beautiful abyss of love. But for these first few months to a year? Stay guarded, or you're going to have your heart shattered.",

We're lucky that in our country, COVID has been kept at bay, so travelling within the country is pretty easy.\n\nMy dad lives in our apartment.  He doesn't pay rent. While we were away, he continued living there. Upon our return, the place had pretty much been trashed.\n\nThere were fast food wrappers all over the floor, in the living room and bedrooms. Dirty shirts (several of them mine) being washed in the kitchen sink. Toilets in the bathrooms clogged up. One of the windows was left open during a rainstorm, letting rainwater in. Open condiment jars and cold cuts left out. Moldy food on the stove. A dozen half-finished coffees everywhere. Laundry just thrown on the floor in the living room. Appliances that were working perfectly fine before we left broken.\n\nHe is actually in good shape mentally, but he's just always been a slob.\n\nThis isn't the first time he's abused our space. He refuses to live by my rules, even though the house is in my name. A while back, he allowed his friends to use our home as a meeting place. When one of them started trying to recruit people for a MLM, I said that the party was over and that I wanted everyone off my property.  I called the cops and unfortunately in the heat of the moment, I lost my temper in front of them by saying if f the cops didn't remove them from my property, I would do so with force.  My dad then got upset with me because I had \"disrespected\" his friends and made him look bad.\n\nI talked to my wife about it, and while she acknowledges that my dad is a slob and a hoarder, she doesn't want to kick him out because he gave us money towards the home for our wedding.  She said that if something happened to him it would weigh on her conscience if she sided with me in asking him to leave.\n\nTL;DR - Dad trashed my apartment and I want him to leave.  Wife said she feels bad about asking him to leave because dad gave us some money to buy the house and because of the risk of something happening to him.",

In the early stages, it can be very hard to tell someone has any cognitive issues. They can be quite good about hiding it, especially since personality isn't typically affected until the more later stages (depending on the type of dementia). I'm overseeing patients right now with slower progression that have had dementia for a few years and the first time I met them, I honestly questioned if they did. There needs to be a more in depth analysis - just having an everyday conversation isn't enough.\n\nAlso, at his age, other mental illnesses and medical diagnoses can mimick dementia. Time for a follow up with his PCP.\n\nAlso also, hoarding is a sign of mental illness. So no, he's not mentally sound, and maybe hasn't been for a long time.",

In your home, life, relationship with your father. Mine could do better, but chooses not to, so therefore he\u2019s welcome at my house to visit, but I\u2019ll never go to his.

            "Hoarding is a mental health condition.  As other posters have said, he needs to be evaluated for dementia.  In the US, when relatives leave their elderly parents to their own devices, there is the chance of an elder neglect or abuse law suit.  Happened to a friend of mine whose mom was found wandering in a park.  Her dementia manifested years earlier.  I mentioned it to my friend, like \"Hey, M. your mom didn't remember that your brother was present at her grand daughter's party yesterday.\" My friend ignored me. A couple of years later, elder neglect law suit.",
            "For what it's worth, my mom - who had been a successful physician most of her life, was very together, and smart, experienced something similar.  I started to notice that every time I went to visit her, her apartment was increasingly in bad shape. It happened more gradually but she eventually went into full on hoarding and her apartment was a hazard.  We finally convinced her to see some doctors, and she had early onset dementia.\n\nIt was particularly hard with her because she was so damn smart that she could mostly cover the deficiencies at least for short periods of time, so you could talk to her and she seemed pretty \"normal\" if a little batty but she was always \"eccentric.\"  \n\nOnce she got diagnosed we were able to get her into assisted living where they helped her keep her apartment clean, kept her safe, and while she wasn't happy at first she really did come to love it there and feel comfortable.  Sadly she passed three years ago.\n\nI share this because I deeply wish I'd intervened sooner.  I'm an only child so it was on me to notice something was wrong, and I just kept thinking well she seems fine when I talk to her so I guess she's just become a messy person.  The regret I feel is real, I know I left her living in gross conditions because I wasn't ready to admit she was ill.  \n\nPlease encourage your dad to get checked out.  Get him whatever services are available to support him in your country - maybe someone who comes to the home and helps him with things like self care, or possibly a safe place to live where he can be somewhat independent but also supported.  Don't live with regret like I do.",

He has several signs of dementia, and is certainly of appropriate age to assume it\u2019s possible. If this is the case he isn\u2019t safe to leave home alone nor is your home necessarily the best place for him, anyway. \n\nI wish you luck in figuring that out. It\u2019s a very sensitive issue to deal with, and it\u2019s very difficult to watch a loved one go through it. However, it\u2019s also very important that you understand that most people aren\u2019t capable of handling that type of thing on their own and you are in no way responsible for taking it all on.",
            "You need to get your dad checked for dementia then make a plan for his care. What you describe are behaviors that go well beyond just being a slob. And it starts years before the person is so cognitively misfunctioning that it can't be hidden anymore.\n\nMy mother had dementia and Alzheimer's and she hid it for a very long time, at least a five years that I've been able to piece together, probably longer. She was charming, outgoing, and volunteered for everything. But things just got more and more \"off.\" And it was so easy to shrug it off or get mad about what seemed like just eccentric or weird behaviors. Because in the beginning these were just amplified behaviors of what she already was. My mom was a child of the Great Depression, so yeah she was always of the \"waste nothing\" mentality. But then that turned from things like, \"Let's repurpose these glass jars into cute gifts and save wrapping paper\" to stuffing bags with junk mail and keeping it under her bed. To not being able to explain why she didn't put that bag of groceries away and there was rotten food on her counter. To repeating the same story over and over but insisting it had just happened yesterday each time she retold it.\n\nIt is easy to miss these things as normal or to excuse them away, because this usually takes place over a long period of time and dementia patients can put a great deal of effort into seeming normal on the surface. Only once in the year before my mother completely slid into full-blown no coming back from it dementia did she say anything about her mental state. In a moment of clarity she told me she was worried, because sometimes she felt \"fuzzy\" like she could not remember things. And I shrugged it off and told \"We all get that sometimes Mom. You're tired, go take a nap.\"\n\nAnd it kills me that I didn't see it then or hear her. She knew something was wrong, but didn't know how to articulate it. And I didn't recognize what was right there in front of me until it was essentially past the point of no denying it.\n\nYour dad needs help. Don't turn him away, get him to a neurologist ASAP and start laying the groundwork now to have a care plan in place. And if you can, get yourself on his bank accounts as a signatory (don't put yourself on there as a joint account though for liability issues) and help him set up online banking that you can then monitor. He's ripe for MLMs and scam artists and that can all devolve really quickly. As can being able to pay bills or even basic care. And you don't want to be figuring those things out after he's to the point of no return.\n\nYour wife recognizes this goes beyond someone being messy. Listen to her. Get him help. And stop for a really long moment and recall how he was in earlier times then contrast that to the way he's acting now. Like did he always leave windows open to let rain in when you were a kid? Or take so many shits the toilets overflowed? I doubt those behaviors were there when you were a kid.\n\nAnd no, what you describe is not someone in good shape mentally. He's just not to the point yet where he can no longer hide what his real mental state is, but his actions now do. Get him help. I'm sorry you're all going through this. It's a seriously terrible thing and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",

            "He is your father, it doesn\u2019t matter what he did I agree with your wife . You can\u2019t kick him out.   I found this somewhere maybe you should read and everyone going though similar situations should read it too. \n' \nAS IS'\n\nHave you ever been in a discount store where merchandise is labelled 'slightly irregular', or 'purchase as is'? They don't tell you where the flaw is. And once you buy it you can't return it. Well, in case you haven't noticed, we all live in the 'as is' department. Stop and think about the people in your life. They're a mixed bag of strengths and weaknesses, virtues and vices, right? If you're looking for perfection, you're in the wrong store. What's the point? It's this: The only way to have a successful relationship with someone is to love and accept them 'as is'. Don't buy into the myth that most folks are 'normal' except the ones in your life. Based on that idea, relationships are an endless quest to fix others, control them, or pretend they are something they're not. Thomas Merton said, 'Love is letting those we love be perfectly themselves, and not twisting them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we see in them.' A hallmark of spiritual maturity is acknowledging that nobody is perfect, and committing to love them in spite of it. Paul writes: 'Be gentle and forbearing with one another and, if one has a difference (a grievance or complaint) against another, readily pardoning each other; even as the Lord has [freely] forgiven you, so you must also [forgive]' (Colossians 3:13 AMP). To love someone 'as is' means to focus on their areas of strength and support them in their areas of struggle. 'What about their flaws?' you say. '...Love covers a multitude of sins' (1Peter 4:8 NLT).",

            "A lot of people are suggesting dementia but no advice. As someone who grew up with hoarder parents who are total slobs, this resonates with me. I grew up with five siblings in a house that was utter chaos. Our house was disgusting at all times. I was never allowed to have friends over because of this and more often than not, my siblings and I were the kind of kids that would show up to school two hours late and covered in dirt. We had an entire bathroom that we just didn\u2019t use anymore because the toilet got clogged one day and my parents didn\u2019t do anything about it. They left it clogged and smelly for YEARS. I remember playing hide and seek in that bathroom and needing help getting out of the shower because I physically couldn\u2019t pull my feet from some unknown sticky substance. I could go on, but you get the point.\n\nDo my parents have mental health issues? Yes. Depression, ADHD, Bi Polar, ect. But they are well aware of their situation and still do not seek treatment for these things. My parents are in their late 50\u2019s now and their houses are trashed. Cars are always disgusting. Some people really are just careless and disgusting. You know your parents best. If this is not new behavior, then I don\u2019t think you have to worry about him.\n\nYou haven\u2019t mentioned if he has any income coming in. Does he?\nI personally would give him a time frame to move out. I think two months would be reasonable. Tell him he needs to be out by March first. If he has a job or some form of retirement/social security, this should be fine. If he does not, can he file for assistance? Food stamps? Help with utilities? We need a little more info on this.\n\nIf he does not have access to income or assistance, then a conversation needs to happen. Do you have any other siblings or family members?",
            "I actually disagree with most commenters, I don't think what your dad did is that big of a deal and I think the word trashed is overplaying it. Um so it takes 5 seconds to throw away the wrappers and old food, maybe 10 seconds to put away or pitch the condiments, unclogging the toilet may take 5 minutes and the shirt thing just isn't weird to me, so what he was washing a shirt in a sink oh no you better call the cops!! Trashed to me is paint and wine stained floors, broken sofas and tables and chairs, etc. And seriously half a dozen coffee cups of no how can you live in such filth! Seriously, your dad needs to tidy up and quit being so messy but I'm gonna venture a guess that you don't have kids because everything you listed is a day in the life of most parents \ud83d\ude02",
            "Everyone here is going to tell you to kick out your dad, and I'm guessing that's what you want to hear. That's how /r/relationships works. However, I wouldn't if I were in your shoes. He is your dad. There are ways of establishing boundaries that don't involve abandoning a dependent, elderly parent. I am not sure whether he is financially dependent on you or not. I am also not sure whether by \"kick him out\" means leave him to fend for himself or finding someplace else for him to live. And I don't know the full extent of his behavior and how many times you've tried to establish the rules for him. Or the overall context of your relationship, for that matter -- how he raised you, how much he helped you growing up or didn't.\n\nAll I can say is that I don't think being a slob and having friends over is sufficient reason to abandon an elderly parent financially. Absent any context. I myself am sometimes a slob. People are different and sometimes you just need to understand your family members for their faults and learn to live with them. That should involve compromise on their end, don't get me wrong. But if you're asking about abandoning your elderly father to the wolves because he didn't clean up after himself, I don't think the punishment fits the crime.",

Also, are you actually in that same apartment or is this an extra home to be rented out for income? \n\nIf he's living in a separate room, like a renter would, he's allowed to be a slob and invite weirdos.

            "Where do people find such wives! Those are rare who actually care about your fam as well. Normally a lot of partner's just get agitated in the first instance",
            "Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.\n\nTwo things I\u2019d say. \n\n1) He is who he is, and you had warning signs. You dropped the ball , just as parents of teenagers have to take blame if there youngsters\u2019s party gets out of hand, and trash their house while the parents are away on holiday.\n\n2) My response would be huge compassion. Guy gave you money, and life.\n\nThat compassion might include cognitive testing by a medical professional, to see if some simple fixes were possible. (Ie certain nutritional deficiencies or like.) \n\nRegardless a personal organizer, who specialized in elderly, and/or weekly housekeeper, might be able to immeasurably improve his quality of life. Maybe he needs someone to distill his self care down into a barracks like arrangement, by putting his memorabilia in display cases out of reach, creating labels, checklists, and posted instructions cards for complicated tasks.",
            "Your dad sounds like my granddad, who has alzheimers and lives in a retierment home where nurces look after him 24/7.",
            "This does sound like dementia or depression, but it also sounds like he's intentionally getting back at you for his perceived disrespect of him and his friends.\n\nI'd challenge him on it. It's your home, he can respect it and you, and that may include getting appropriate support, or he'll have to move on.\n\nYour wife being a bleeding heart about it is probably what he's relying on, if this isn't a medical issue.",
            "kick him out like yesterday. your wife should mind her own business, it's your dad.",
            "I'll chime in and agree with a lot of the others in this thread are saying-you should get him evaluated for dementia. Many others have made good points as to why. If he does get diagnosed, you could look into a carer for him or some sort of home that is specialized in memory care.",
            "Tell your dad he needs to consent to getting a mental evaluation (for Alzheimer's or related issues) or he's got to move out. If your wife doesn't agree to that, then your marriage is as good as kaput because no reasonable, decent person on earth would EVER ask you to tolerate this in your own home. \n\nRegardless of what you wind up doing, he can never be left alone in your apartment again for longer than a few hours.",
            "Your dad is not in good shape mentally, get him some mental health. If you\u2019re in a country where \u201cCovid has been kept at bay\u201d, I assume you are not in the states and access to mental health services should be affordable to come by.\n\nDoing this for your father isn\u2019t just about getting your home back in order, it\u2019s also for his own benefit. He\u2019s likely suffering and needs help. Old men can be stubborn to admit that they need the help.",
            "He does this because you have allowed it. Stop allowing it and tell him to move out if he can't respect your space.",
            "Your dad has dementia. YWBTA if you don\u2019t get him the medical help he needs.",
            "The guy called the police on his dad  and wants to leave his father homeless. He's isolating his father by keeping him away from friends and treats his dad like a guest. He exaggerated his dad's \"trashing\". None of what his dad did is trashing because there wasn't any damage, only a mess. He made the mess when no one was home which is fairly normal. Calling the police is abusive. Leaving someone homeless in a pandemic is abusive. Isolating an old sick man from his friends is abusive. Not providing medical care is abusive. Taking the old man's money is exploitation. The dad is experiencing elder abuse and needs help. I'm the only one to mention this and was told to go fuck myself. This man is a narcissist. A lot of abused people will react in ways that appear to be distress but its not necessarily a mental illness, just a natural response to being mistreated. The guy is a narcissist plain and simple. He's the one that needs to leave the house that his dad paid for.",
