        "selftext": "**UPDATE:** \n\nThank you so much for all of the advice, and kind words.  You guys are great!  I've been very hesitant to use reddit up until now but you guys have proven my skepticism wrong!  I've decided I most definitely should write a letter for sure explaining how much he has helped me, and how grateful I am.  I think it's probably best to avoid any strange verbiage like \"father figure\" or \"guardian angel\" just because I don't want to make myself uncomfortable more than anything.\n\nAlso!  I think based on a lot of your suggestions it might make me feel good if I got him a gift. Early on in our friendship he and I connected on our mutual love for fishing.  He is an avid spin fisherman, and I love fly-fishing, and actually am very good at it.  He mentioned to me that he'd love to learn to fly fish one day but never has.  Would it be cool if I bought him a nice fly rod and reel, and just added a P.S. to the note that I'll gladly teach him how to fly fish some day?  Or would that be weird?  Let me know! \n\nAlso also!  Anyone know any good psychiatrists?  \n\nThanks for all your feedback, observations, kind words, and advice everyone!!!\n\n**ORIGINAL POST:**\n\nMost of my life after high school has been me skipping from job to job, either because of my inability to perform the job, laziness, or just plain rudeness on my part.  This probably all has a lot to do with a lack of a good relationship with my father.  I have struggled, even in childhood, to find anything I'm passionate about.  Often when I try something new I will get really excited about it and then be done with it after a week or two.  This pattern has lead to severe depression, and terrible relationships in most parts of my life.  I have a few friends who are close and supportive, but they are so keenly aware of how untrustworthy I am, just because I change my mind about who I am, and what I believe so often.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I went to get my haircut at a barbershop near my house.  I had recently become miserable in my latest endeavor: teaching music.  I had never met the barber, and he had never met me, but he asked me a few questions, and I grudgingly answered.  He stopped cutting my hair, looked me in the eye and said.  \"You just need to be a barber.\"  I laughed, and he reiterated, \"No, I'm serious, there's a school right down the street.  You need to be a barber.\"\n\nFlash foward a year and a half.  I've graduated barber school, and I have a job cutting hair.  I've never been more excited or passionate about anything in my life (aside from getting married).  The process of getting to this point has been insanely difficult, but also extraordinarily fulfilling.  I've never felt this way.  It's like no matter how much life sucks, I always have comfort in knowing that I am on a road to becoming a better barber.  To put it simply: this is the first time I've stuck with ANYTHING for more than 8 months, and I feel like I'm just scratching the surface!\n\nDuring every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.  He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge.  He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school.  Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years.  My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school.  As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.\n\nThis is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me.  Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud.  It's like he's the father I never had.  But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him?  I'm not sure what it is.  I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about.  If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal.  (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me).  I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted.  I want to make him proud.  I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.\n\nHe has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like \\*I\\* look at him like a father figure?  I don't know if that's wrong or not.   Any advice is welcome.... please!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMy guardian angel helped (and is still helping me) get my shit together, and I'm an awkward man baby that feels like I have a new father and want to tell him I immensely appreciate him but don't know how to not seem weird about it?",

            "You could write a letter to him expressing everything you\u2019ve just described in this post. That\u2019s usually what I do when I want to express my feelings to the people I love the most. I think letters are sincere and expressive because they usually contain a lot of thought.\n\nWriting a letter sounds clich\u00e9 or effortless, but I assure you, someone like your guardian angel, someone whose helped you for years and encouraged you while expecting nothing in return, would be deeply moved by how grateful you are, even if you express it through something as simple as a letter.\n\n(I saw writing a letter as a suggestion in the comments, but I wanted to express to you how much a letter could mean, especially if you pour your heart and soul out in it.)",
            "To be honest I think you should show him or tell him everything that you just wrote here. This man obviously saw some really great potential in you, and you've been proven him right every single day since. this was what he was hoping to see: you becoming the best version of you, so I think you should give him a heartfelt thank you, maybe a gift if that's the type of relationship you guys have, and just continue killing it at life. I believe if he gets to watch you thrive and become better every day that's the best gift you can give him",
            "Expressing gratitude is a skill like any other. You have had a pretty rough go of it until recently, so you probably haven't had much practice telling people in your life how much they mean to you. Don't feel self-conscious. Just show your mentor this post or write him a heart-to-heart letter. He will treasure your words, no matter how awkward you may think they are.",
            "This is such a wonderful post.  Thank you for sharing.  I was a high school teacher for many years.  The \"gifts\" from my former students that mean the most to me, that I still have and look at, are the letters in which they tell me I made a positive impact in their lives.  I cherish those letters.  So, as many others suggested here, I also suggest you write this man a heartfelt letter.  Be vulnerable and tell him exactly what's in your heart.  It will mean so much to him.  This man sounds like someone who was put on earth to do exactly what he did for you.  And he probably doesn't even need any thanks, it sounds like it is just who is...gracious and kind and loving...but telling him what you feel will be a wonderful gift to him and will help you on this journey you've undertaken to improve yourself.  Also, you might want to think about paying it forward...be open to another young man who needs a guardian angel.  Be that angel for someone else like this man was/is for you.  That would make him incredibly proud of you.",
            "This story is lovely. I can guarantee he is already incredibly proud of you. You seem like a naturally humble and grateful person. \n\nAnd 'Today you, tomorrow me'- there will probably be a time when the opportunity naturally comes when he himself will need your help. Better yet, pay it forward! Look out for someone to mentor/ a charity or scholarship fund to donate to?",
            "You've explained it really well here. Have you thought about writing him a note just like this and giving it to him with a bottle of wine/booze, if he drinks. You might feel more comfortable with that extra step of separation instead of telling him verbally.\n\nI doubt that someone that has gone above and beyond like he has will interpret this as weird on your part.",
            "I thought this story was going to be a lot more sinister. You are showing your gratitude by thriving under his guidance- he can tell you are thankful but you can show it in small ways- food for his family, bringing him a coffee, a thoughtful birthday gift, helping if he moves house etc.",
            "So nice to see a heartwarming story on Reddit. I think it makes sense to avoid the fatherhood language but I think everyone appreciates a thank you. A nice dinner for four where you can tell him how grateful you are, a nice picture of the two of you working that you put at your barber chair so when people ask you say \u201cthat\u2019s my mentor\u201d. Thanks for sharing this sweet story\u2014 it\u2019s so nice to be reminded that barbers, and all workers, can change a life.",
            "Giving a compliment or gratitude can be awkward when you're not used to giving it. I was like you 5 years ago where I went from job to job and my attitude was the cause of it all. Then I changed the energy i was putting out into the world. Stopped hating everyone and started looking for positives. Then I started telling people about those positives and let me tell you the response I have received is amazing. I used to look forward to confrontation because my ego used to be huge and I would love the chance to put someone else down. Now whenever I see someone do something that deserves praise its like I wanna burst until I give them the compliment. My suggestion to you is be real. Tell him where you would be without him, soecifically highlight the things he has done for you and the effect they have had and then just literally day \"thank you\" this dude will have so much pride in not only you but himself that there will be absolutely 0 awkwardness. Just love.",
            "Just a thought: have you seen a psychiatrist about ADHD? Your difficulty in getting and staying motivated, getting hyperfocused for a short time on a new subject and then losing interest, are all common presentations of ADHD.",
            "Not problem with expressing gratitude! Also, you *might* want to look into whether you have undiagnosed ADHD that was manifesting as getting bored after a couple weeks at a job after the novelty wore off or feeling lazy due to executive dysfunction issues. Being a barber is a great job for someone with that neurotype because it's social, on your feet, and you approach ever head anew.",

            "Have you ever been tested for ADD/ADHD? A lot of what you described falls in line with it. Losing interest in hobbies, feeling weird around people, lazy (most lazy people don't admit they are but people with adhd are often told they are and begin to identify that way). It might be worth a shot to get tested. Treatment might change your life.",

            "He is like a mentor to you. I have been a mentor myself and every time that my mentee goes back to me and says \"hey, look at me now i have improved a lot\" makes my heart swell with pride. Or a simple thank you would do. Anything that will show how much you appreciate the person is a good gesture.\nIf you really want to do something for him, find out what he really likes and if that is within your means- do it. It may not be a gift but a gesture too. Pay it forward is also a good way of repaying his influence on you.\nHappy to see that you are appreciating the person who suggested your profession today.",

            "My son is 21. He got a job just over a year ago that although qualified for a higher position, he took the manual labor job. He excelled because he ended up with a really good manager who not only taught him how to do things the correct way, he really made sure he was exposed to many different aspects of the job and then propelled him into a much higher job in an office, in his own office. When he moved inside he wanted to let the manager know how much he appreciated his direction, attention to detail, and the thoughtful way he taught him to do the job right. He didnt have much money and knew the manager wouldnt want him to over spend (he was like a Uncle to my kid) so he got him a Thank you card, put a $50 gift card to his favorite grocery store (he would talk about the sales) and got him a fruit basket ( he ate a lot of fruit, lol) to thank him. When he gave it to his manager the old, blue collar, tough Grandpa cried. It seems the fact that my kid listened to him and wanted to learn and was moving on made him very happy. It wasnt much, but letting him know how he felt was really touching to his manager. So I dont know if that helps, but I thought I would share it. My youngest is a good kid. I remember getting him prepped and explaining that if he was going to be on a construction site he needed to take hand sanitizer and a roll of toilet paper with him. He was confused. Then came home after the first day and thanked me. LOL. Hes a 6 ft tall burly beared dude who is good with sharing feelings.",
            "Does this guy like any sports or bands or something you could buy him tickets to? Like if he really likes your local basketball team, could you budget for and plan courtside seats for him and his wife/kid and corona allowing gift him the tickets as a 'graduation gift' from you to say thank you and that you would like give him a token of the appreciation and fulfilment he has given you.\n\nIt doesn't have to be super emosh or potentially too much like you crossing a boundary but a well chosen gift with a short concisely phrased card picking out the key points of his influence on you are great. People often get a bit wary if you go overboard and feel a bit shortchanged if you do nothing but in my experience this always fits a good ground.\n\nAnd then you thank him every single damn day by your actions. You work hard, you turn up on time, you listen, you grow, you step up to help with extra tasks, you apologise and change if you fuck up, you respect him and his family and you re-pay his faith by being the person he saw you could be.\n\nIn the same way that the best apology is changed behaviour, the greatest thanks is being your best self to those who cared enough.\n\nKeep doing what you are doing and you'll repay him daily a thousand times over. Just don't panic that you have to show everything immediately. In healthy relationships there isn't a deadline you have to complete a big act by, there's an ongoing way to show it repeatedly. Slow and steady wins the race but you are still used to the boom and bust model.\n\nIf that lingers and is potentially self sabotaging, don't be afraid to seek out therapy or find other ways to re-programme long term thinking such as joining a team or committing back to study to remind you that it's ok to take baby steps all your life.",

            "This man dramatically changed (if not saved) your live for the better and he did a lot for you. There is absolutely nothing wrong in expressing your gratitude and acknowledging how much he has done for you. That said ... if you are socially awkward and if you are lacking the social skills to express your feelings clearly, it may perhaps be better to not say all this out loud.\n\nThink of a great (but not over the top) gift that you could give him (and his wife) and simply say that you wanted to express your gratitude because he has done so much for you. This will do the trick. Also make sure you more than earn your keep at the job he arranged for you.\n\nLeave out stories about the father you never had, etc. It is unnecessary and it may make it awkward.

            "> This pattern has lead to severe depression.\n\nHey friend. I think you should rethink this sentence. It sounds more likely to me that \"severe depression has lead to this pattern.\" Give yourself some grace. It sounds like you had some real difficulties, and it  took a lot of work to get on solid foundation. It sounds like you've had depression for a while, and that's something that's always quaking underneath until you're able to steady yourself. It sounds like this person helped you find our footing, and that's a beautiful thing. But, you also put in the work. That's something depression will make you try to forget, even as things get better over time. So, I want to say congrats to you for making it this far. Also, there's nothing wrong with wanting to take a moment to thank this man sincerely. It might be something that he thinks back on when he goes through his own difficulties.

He not only directed me to the school, but somehow got my tuition rate lowered by speaking with the school owner without my knowledge. He encouraged me every time I felt unsure or afraid, and let me stand next to him for hours on in at his shop and taught me everything I didn't get to learn at school. Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years. \n\n>He has a son of his own, and I don't want to make him uncomfortable by making him feel like *I* look at him like a father figure? I don't know if that's wrong or not\n\nThe professional word you're looking for is mentor. He is your mentor. \n\nYah, you may weird him out a bit if you said you looked at him like a father (I think most would think it's wholesome and not weird per se), but mentor is definitely the appropriate word / relationship you're looking for.",
            "Get him a gift and a card thanking him for setting you on the right path and being your mentor. He sounds like the kind of person who would appreciate that and not be weirded out by it. And one day when you're an expert old barber, be a mentor for somebody else.",
            "Some people seek this for years without finding it. Others are fortunate to find this without looking for a long time. What you all but had dropped in your lap is the truest definition of *mentorship*, and that relationship has blossomed because both of you have put in the time and effort required to truly make that relationship work.\n\nMentors take satisfaction in seeing the results of their guidance; the success of their proteges/mentees; the work that those proteges put into the process.\n\nFor a mentor, it is the opposite of \"uncomfortable\" to receive genuine thanks and appreciation from a mentee. That's part of the growth process you're experiencing -- being able to thank those who have helped you on your path to success.\n\nIt might seem awkward to approach this with him by using the phraseology/ies \"guardian angel\" or \"father figure.\" It isn't how I'd approach it, but I recognize I'm far more inclined to use the framework of a mentor-protege relationship. You might feel more comfortable with this mindset as well, but I'm spitballing there.\n\nIf you *do* show your appreciation for his efforts, and for his contribution to your life, do not hesitate for a moment to revisit this:\n\n>During every step of the process of becoming a barber, this man has been like a guardian angel.

Tricks of the trade, and his special secrets that he's learned over the years. My wife (I know unbelievable that I'm married given my background right?) was ready to divorce me, and break up with me, but this man AND HIS WIFE counseled us, and helped us make it through the year of barber school. As the icing on the cake, he secured a job for me, cutting right next to him, at his brothers barbershop.\n\n>This is just a sampling of the pure graciousness this person has shown me. Every time I'm around him, I want to express to him how thankful I am, and how I want to make him proud. It's like he's the father I never had. But for some reason, I'm afraid that he will be put off if I thank him? I'm not sure what it is. I feel like I owe this man everything that I care about. If it weren't for him I'd be working in Macdonalds, single, and probably suicidal. (no hate for McDonalds workers, it's just not for me). I just want to show him that his grace has NOT been taken for granted. I want to make him proud. I know this is probably really lame for this sub, but... it's so hard for me to wrap my head around how to repay him, or thank him without coming off as weird.\n\nHowever you tell him, make sure to include this. That kind of all-encompassing guidance is priceless, and recognizing its value to you is high praise. Telling him you appreciate his presence in your life is a fantastic way to show appreciation; do not let it be the *only* way you show that appreciation. Make him proud, and show him his work hasn't been for granted, by continuing to learn and work at your craft. (And don't be afraid to tell him that, either.)",

Saying thank you is good enough but never enough.",

Just say you're earning in your new profession and you wanted to take a moment to share that success with him and thank him for helping you at a really challenging and directionless time in your life.

You've come far to define yourself.....that's a difficult task when the same sex parent isn't there to help you do it.....I had similar \"wandering\" until I was 25 and found my way into research, which is my home. \n\nI also want to point out that expressing gratitude is a tremendous thing for both the giver and receiver. If you're worried about it being too over the top, then scale it back with \"man, I am so grateful for all of your guidance! I wouldn't be near where I am with what I have today if you hadn't have taken me under your wing.\" Add more or take some away if it feels uncomfortable, but saying thanks sure makes everyone feel good, rather than uncomfortable!!\n\nIt's not an easy journey, but you are walking it.

He met his now wife shortly afterwards and they now have a baby. I can tell you him coming back to me later to thank me for changing his life made me cry. It meant a lot to me. I did a lot less for that guy than your mentor has. I'm sure it would mean the world to him to get a \"thank you for changing my life\".",

Buy him a drink or whatever he prefers and have a heart to heart. If you have a picture of both of you together from when you graduated barber shop or from when you started school or work or if there is a picture of him teaching you the ropes, frame it and see if you can get a small plaque to say \"Thank you \"his name\" for showing me the light when all I saw was darkness\" or something like that. \n\nI think doing something as simple as a picture would really make him appreciate it.

I would do it at a time that's appropriate, like Christmas or his birthday, so that it will have special meaning and also won't come right out of the blue.  I think that would make it easier for you to express and easier for him to accept.  Just don't do it for Father's day; that would be weird.",

Dinner out, long note, sentimental gift...\n\nBut what I think would really show him what you've learned from him is serving others as well.  He's been a monumental mentor to you, and you've learned so much from him.  Visibly pay it forward.  Someday there's going to be a kid who needs an ear and a hand up, and you'll be there.",

            "So, I'm 40, and I have a guy who's about 30 in my life.   He was 'couchsurfer' homeless when we met through a friend and I had him do work on my rental property.   Fast forward a few years, and he's living in and managing a house (finding roommates, dealing with issues) and then I loaned him money to get his license issues cleared up and drove him for his driving test to get a brand new license so he could legally drive  a work truck.  Fast forward a year and he's paid me back the few thousand I loaned him and now I'm loaning him more to be able to register a business and become his own contractor.   A few months later, he's made $30K as a contractor, has bought a used truck and paid it off and is getting non-stop service calls which he goes to with his truck, nice tools, and business signage all over his truck.\n\nHe told me no one had ever given him a chance, he grew up without much in the way of parents amidst a chaotic extended family and sometimes \"I get to where I cry\" when he thinks about how my assistance was able to give him the ability to make it to where he is.  Given our age difference I suppose it's more like a brother relationship than a father relationship, but, same difference.\n\nI don't find it to be awkward at all.   He has good respectful boundaries and we talk on messenger most days (mostly about business stuff), but I shared a hug with him recently when he paid me back the last of the money I had loaned him and he was clear of all his monetary debts to anyone.",
            "Listen I\u2019m an oldie like this man and I can tell you it gives him great pleasure to see you progress and he probably sees you like a son and a student. There is nothing weird about that in either direction, it\u2019s very sweet, even adults need someone to look up to. As I get older I genuinely delight in watching people your age blossom and love offering a little helping nudge whenever I can, I\u2019m certain he loves helping you.\n\nYou should tell him you are grateful, but you should SHOW him by doing all of the things you\u2019re doing now and when it\u2019s time honour his gift by paying it forward.",

I spent the first hour of my day getting mad about idiots on twitter. Then I saw this, and my chest is swelling. This is so heartwarming and pure. You have really been blessed by this man. I think it\u2019s okay if you think of him as a father figure\u2014 it\u2019s not overstepping if you\u2019re not actually expecting him to behave as if he\u2019s your father. However, OP, I don\u2019t want you to discount your part in this. I know how hard it can be to try something new when everything you\u2019ve done prior has turned out to be a waste of your time and energy because it wasn\u2019t right for you. The fact that you put yourself out there and did the work, even if you couldn\u2019t have done it without him, is worth celebrating. You two make a great team, I think. I\u2019m sure he expects nothing in return, but you really can\u2019t go wrong with just being honest about your gratitude. You might catch him off guard a little, but you\u2019d be surprised how much of a softy even the most stoic older man can be (my stepdad is this way\u2014 70 y/o lifelong engineer, cold as stone most of the time but when the cracks show....it\u2019s hard not to cry lol).\n\nI wish you so much success and love and happiness and LIFE.

I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be happy to hear how appreciated he is\u2013 people love that. \n\nAnd if you ever see a kid down on his luck and not sure where to go in his life\u2014 take on an apprentice of your own (I mean, if they want to, that is!).",
            "Best way to show him you care is to keep doing what he helped you learn to do, and do it well. I was taken under someone's wing when it came to powerlifting. People pay tons of money to coaches, but my coach has never asked for a dime. I get him a gift card or something after every meet as a thank you, but I think the true thank you comes in the fact that I respect his time, his effort to help me, and I put into action what he's attempting to teach me. I think that's how you repay your person. You show him, through actions, that what he teaches you isn't for nothing. \n\nAnd if you ever get a chance to sprinkle in to a customer that he's great, do it...whether he can hear you or not.",
            "It\u2019s not weird to let someone know how much you appreciate them. With all of the effort he put in helping, I\u2019d guess he cares quite a bit about you as well. Sometimes it can feel awkward thanking someone for something they didn\u2019t have to do, but ya just need to push through that feeling. Sometimes it helps to write about it first, maybe even a letter to him. That way you can organize your thoughts a bit, it makes it easier to talk about. You can use the writing in person, but you probably won\u2019t need it. \n\nI\u2019ve found the majority of the time, when expressing a vulnerable feeling to the right people, I am met with a beautiful response. \n\nBest of luck to you!",

In fact, he probably sees a lot of himself at the age you are now in you. \n\nWrite him a letter expressing your gratitude. It will forever be something that he will cherish.",
            "I agree with the letter writers here. Take some time and write him a letter, or a note in a card. Thing is, though he did give you some motivation and help, YOU DID THE WORK. Give yourself credit for that, and don't put in your letter about how you would be suicidal, McDonald's etc. That is  too much to lay at another persons feet. Please please give yourself some credit for all the hard work you put in to this new venture. Nobody handed it to you. Best of luck.",

            "Wow, this is not what I expected to see here based on the title; what an amazing story! Many here have given solid advice-DO take the time to thank him with perhaps a unique gift that you think he\u2019d like, but a written expression of gratitude is definitely appropriate. Take the time (like you did here) to put into words the specific things he\u2019s done and how they\u2019ve impacted you. \n\nYou used the term \u201crepay\u201d and you probably know this can\u2019t actually be paid for in money. A strong mentor/mentee relationship is priceless and is likely exactly what he hoped for when he extended his help to you. It feels good to use what you know and can do well to help people. \n\nSo here\u2019s how you can repay him: 1. Continue to kick ass. Your success is a reward to both of you. 2. Keep your relationship going strong. You are still developing in your trade and his experience will be invaluable. I doubt you\u2019d do this, but imagine if you cut him off once you reached \u201csuccess.\u201d That would be painful and cheapen what you\u2019ve had. 3. Keep an eye out for the next \u201cyou.\u201d Maybe you aren\u2019t at the point where you can help someone to the extent that this man helped you, but once your eyes have been opened to the power of connection and support between people, you can bring that into your own life. I don\u2019t mean go spouting advice everywhere (I recognize the irony of this statement as I\u2019m posting this right now), but when you feel moved by another person, like a word or gesture from you can genuinely help them, reach out. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll repay this man...by being more like him and spreading that generous spirit.",
            "My sister saved my life in much the same way your friend saved yours. Thanks are definitely in order, but you don't have to get mushy or detailed with your appreciation if you feel it might make him uncomfortable. My sister is the same so I know how you feel.\n\nThat said, a thanks is definitely needed here. I suggest you buy a nice gift (judging by how much he has impacted you, get something a bit more personal or bigger than a simple bottle of wine) and write a short note detailing your thanks, and give those to your friend on an appropriate day (eg: getting your first job as a barber, finishing barber school, etc...). If you have already hit those milestones, you could just pop over one day to drop it off.\n\nRemember, he did a lot to encourage you, but these achievements are YOURS. You overcame a huge hurdle in your life and you are doing a fantastic job. I'm mad proud of you, man.\n\nIf you haven't already, it may be a good idea to speak to a counsellor just to get to the root of your aversion to commitment. It could be really beneficial.",
            "You don\u2019t know how to express your feelings?  But you do!  You did it beautifully in this post!  \n\nMy suggestion would be for you to write it in your neatest handwriting, in a simple card that says nothing more than \u201cthank you\u201d on it. You don\u2019t need to search for a card that expresses your feelings, you just need to share them with him, just as you did here. And include *all of this!*  Yes, even the part he already knows. \n\n(If your handwriting sucks, like mine does, type it up and select a nice font that looks like nice handwriting, and enclose it in the card.)\n\nI have received a few heartfelt thank you cards in my life, and I treasure them. I pull them out and reread them, and they give me enormous pleasure. \n\nYou are correct that overly thanking him all the time would get awkward. So you just keep being nice. If you notice a favorite something (his brand of chewing gum, or his favorite coffee or soft drink), pick it up for him now and then. Little things that remind him that\u2019s you like him are silent, unobtrusive ways to say thank you.",

Perhaps write it in a card along with a small gift of appreciation (new shears, a personalized mug, or something special to you two).\n\nIt\u2019s always great to show gratitude.

He left me and our toddler and moved back to his hometown. There was never a solid reason given, just that he felt we should have never gotten married. In July, he changed his tune and wanted to be a family again. He was still at his job in his hometown, so I decided I would ride it out at my job in a different city for a couple of months to build my resume and then start looking for other jobs in his hometown. After 6 months of a brutal commute, taking care of our child during the week by myself and driving to his hometown EVERY weekend, interviewing, basically bending over backwards, I finally landed a great job in December. A week before I was to move into the new house we were buying together and start my new job, I found out he had been having an affair. He begged and pleaded for me to stay with him, said he\u2019d break off all contact, and I foolishly agreed to give him another chance. Two days later while I was back in the different city and completing my last week of work at my old job, he unblocked her on everything and liked her pictures on Instagram. I was devastated. On top of that shit show, he kicked me out of the house we were supposed to move in together and I had to find a new place to live TWO days before starting my new position. We have lived seperately ever since. He has said and done so many hateful things in this time period, and said so many times that he wants a divorce that I\u2019ve lost count. Up until a month ago he was still maintaining contact with her. I saw her car at his house, took pictures for the lawyers, etc. and he admitted he had been talking with her still. I stopped doing the \u201cpick me dance\u201d about a month ago and stopped reaching out to him besides contact about our child. Now he has suddenly changed his tune and is \u201cdesperate\u201d to get me back and will do anything. He has unfollowed her on everything. Unliked all her pictures. Tells me not to give up on our family. I\u2019ve moved on... I am not interested in pursuing another relationship with him. He\u2019s hurt me deeply and I feel like I\u2019ve been fucked over by him so many times that I\u2019ve lost count. How can I tell him there isn\u2019t a chance without sounding like a completely heartless person? I still want to be able to maintain a strong coparenting relationship with him, so I am friendly to him, but he seems to take that as I want him back. I have relayed to him my feelings, but they fall on deaf ears. He says he will never stop trying to get our family back together and does not want a divorce. I do. Does anyone have advice? \n\n\nTL;DR: husband cheated and left me, was adamant he wanted a divorce, now when I want one too he changes his tune.\n\n\nEdited to add, just to show the kind of person he is: When I asked him about the reason for his sudden change of heart, he said it was because I \u201cseemed stronger\u201d. Ahhh, the irony. Honestly, a big thank you to the prick for yanking the rug under my feet not once, but twice, because I truly have realized how much better I can do and how I don\u2019t need anyone but myself to have a happy life.\n\n2nd Edit: Seriously, thank you to everyone who has read my story and commented. You have no idea how much it\u2019s helping me to focus on myself and realize I need stop considering the feelings of someone who had no consideration of mine. I only hope that anyone who is in a similar situation realizes that you CAN and you DO move on. And I promise that you will feel like a 10,000 pound weight has been lifted off your back.\n\n3rd Edit: He is being served papers in the next 1-2 weeks. Guarantee the \u201cI\u2019ve Changed\u201d mask slips off. I hope I\u2019m wrong...but I\u2019ve learned all too well that my gut feelings are usually spot on. Hopefully I\u2019ll be back with an update in a few months with the good news that the split is official!",

You absolutely deserve better - my persepective is that you're not heartless, but that won't change how YOU feel about it, so remember that he didn't think about his actions being heartless, because it was more than once. The fact that you're even concerned about it shows that you're a better person in my mind.\n\nWould choosing to stay in this relationship be heartless to you?",

Anything he sends you, ignore it but save it. I'm so sorry you've been put through all of this. I can't even begin to imagine.\n\nYou need to take care of yourself and your kid from now.

I hope for you that by posting here, you are final done with him. Get a divorce, get child support from him, and get on with your life. Time for you to meet someone new if that's what you want.\n\nThe fact you don't want to be heartless says a lot about you, but believe everyone posting here who says he doesn't deserve it.",

Make yourself monotone and boring.  Do not offer any conversation.  Basically, play emotional \u201cpossum\u201d around him.  Show indifference like it is your job around him.  He will lose interest.  This will help in ways words cannot.\n\nThis will be difficult and it is hard to not display any emotions\u2014happy, sad, angry\u2014towards someone that has hurt you deeply.  Please do this for your child.\n\nI also recommend getting a therapist.  Very helpful during the worst times in life.  They help establish good, healthy boundaries to keep the toxic people (that you still have to co-parent with) in check.  \n\nI wish you well... the road is not easy.  There will be better times with better people in the future if you work on you today.",

He didn't need to lift a finger and had an incredible woman, the mother of his kid, on his feet. And now you got yourself together, and it hits him where it hurts, on the ego. He doesn't really care for you, specifically, but the lack of attention is making hom feel the withdraw of that high and he wants to feel powerful again. Don't give that to him, nor any other man.

If so, he either sells the house and you split the proceeds, or he buys you out.  Do not just give up the money if you paid into it.  \nWhile you're at it, did he support you during his time away?

I couch surfed until I could move back in with my parents and had a safe, healthy homebirth to a really awesome kid.\n\nMy ex would come down every other weekend to spend some time with his kid, and i swear he got amnesia on the drive down EVERY TIME. I had to constantly remind him we weren't together, including asking him to respect my personal space because he would either be face first in my cleavage while I was breastfeeding or put his hand on my inner thigh while I driving. I would tell him to his face, send emails, text messages, everything reminding him that we weren't together and to please respect my personal space. EVERY TIME.\n\nA couple petty things I did: had a specific playlist of breakup songs I would play on repeat everytime I drove, spray cologne in my car, never gave in, would not entertain his questions about my personal life, kept my passenger seat loaded with crap and made him sit in the back so he couldn't touch me.\n\nEventually I started seeing someone seriously and talked to him about it. That night, after a 2 hour in the driveway fight, he broke into my car and stole all my hiking gear. He also took our (at the time) 5 year old son and told him \"goodbye forever, have fun with your new family.\"\n\nHe still throws tantrums here and there, but he seriously calmed down after I got married.

You can't help that it's gonna be upsetting for him when he realizes you're saying \"enough\" and you really truly mean it, no take-backs. It isn't an answer he intends to accept, like he's told you straight out, and he probably fully believes he will eventually get his way. (I predict tantrums when that doesn't go as planned.)\n \nSee, up to this point it's been much like a game to him (from what I'm reading at least), one where he believes he can continue to have and do what(and who) he wants, according to his whims, without any real consequences. He's gotten very lucky so far about avoiding accountability because you've been kind and forgiving, which he seems to have interpreted as you being a doormat who will tolerate being screwed around endlessly. He won't like that you stopped participating in his game, because he didn't ever register that as an option for you so it can only seem unfair to him. It will feel like you've changed the rules of his entire world without warning. \n \nWatch out for increasingly intense incoming lovebombing and very earnest promises to do better, possibly peppered with bouts of self-righteous anger and/or passive-aggression, because it's likely he's gonna start emotionally spinning. He needs you back in the role he's assigned you, perpetually waiting in his back pocket, so his world will make sense again. Unfortunately, he's already shown you that he'll just yank the rug out from under your feet again and again if you give in and let him.  \n \nAll you can do is look after your own priorities and try to maintain civility for the kids sake, but do be blunt about his chances of winning you back. It would be heartless to let him believe he has a chance, like he did to you. Being honest is being kind in this case. You already gave him more chances than he deserved.

Im glad he tried to shit-talk my mum when i saw him and that mum never said a bad word against him in comparison. Im glad he drank a lot in my presence and that i caught him having several drunken arguments with his wife. Im glad i got to visit him and have silly stupid fun with him as if we were both teenagers. Im glad he let me do stuff he probably shouldnt have. Lastly, im glad that my mum + schooling brought me up right, so that i could recognise that this man was not a good role model for me, and realise that on my own. The adults in my life didnt talk shit about my dad, but they didn't hide his escapades and bad decisions from me either. \n\nMy dad wasn't abusive or a criminal, actually, he is a kind hearted and empathic guy. He just had no idea how to take care of himself, let alone a child. Sure, he had mild alcoholism, but the real problem was that he didn't see the need to change. Nowadays, i barely speak to him. Not really because I don't want to, but because honestly i dont know the guy. And that's OK with me. Because thats the sacrifice i accidentally made to not follow in his footsteps.",

Love on your child and be happy for yourself and your child.\n\nGood luck, but without trust, you can never have a solid relationship with your ex.  There is no trust.  He will try to emotionally manipulate you. Be able to recognize it and walk away.  It will always be some excuse and never his fault.  It is his fault.  He chose to abandon you both instead of talking about whatever was going through his head and working the issue together.  If you look back on your relationship, you will probably recognize the signs that in his mind, it was always about him.",

Leaving your wife for another women is awful, but understandable. Some men like to sleep around and after giving birth a women is very vulnerable and so these types of men can stray. Disgusting behavior? Yea, but I can at least wrap my head around why they do it.\n\nBut abandoning your own child as well? Unforgivable, unconscionable, and I am absolutely amazed you even wanted to reconcile. And then you found out about the affair, which by the way was the only thing that made sense as to why he took off, and still have him a chance.\n\nIf you even for a second consider taking him back, you are basically ripping off a barely formed scan and exposing a raw wound to more pain.\n\nYou did an amazing job securing a job and caring for your baby.

She's from the other side of the world and missed her home to much so eventually she went back and that's why they broke up.\n\nOver the 9 months that I've been with my boyfriend he's told me a few things about her, all postive. From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt.\n\nWell today it got weird. Apparently when they broke up she gave him a letter. Amongst other things it says that she wishes him happiness blah blah. But then it says that he should give another letter to the girl he finds love with again. Apparently she enclosed that letter. \n\nHe gave it to me unopened. I didn't know what to expect. But she was so nice in her letter. Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy.\n\nI just feel weird. This woman seems to be a saint. I don't know how to feel about this letter and the whole thing. Should I contact her? But what would I even say? Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her?

It's really callous to me.\n\nI don't think you should contact her, it's your boyfriend's fault that she's even a factor in your relationship at all. He shouldn't be holding her on this pedestal because it's going to ruin any relationship he has with anyone else that's not her. I would tell him that her letter makes it feel like you will never be as close to him as she is/was and it doesn't make you feel good about the relationship because it seems like you're his second pick.",
            "To me its weird to have the tips in there. Like I get it, they had a great relationship that ended, but this is your relationship. Those tips might not be you and now they might rattle around in your brain.\n\nI would personally hand the letter back to your bf, tell him that she seems like a nice person, but you want to make a boundary that you are not interested in her being a part of your relationship with him. That you need to make sure he is on board with you 100% and not just because you are a second choice.\n\nAnd he should hear you out and support you. This is an important moment where he needs to make sure that his past relationship isn't overshadowing the current one, and sadly just from comments its starting to here and there. He should never have given you the letter. It was a selfishness of her part to do that honestly. She's not dead, she's far away, but if she ever wants to come back now you have to worry and consider if he wouldn't up and leave you for her.\n\n9 months is long enough to know how things are going, and where things are at. You can't compete with a \"saint\", so you shouldn't bother. Be you, be the best you you can be, because that is what you should do. Don't try to be her, or be the relationship he had. You and your bf have your own relationship that needs to grow and become stronger.",
            "The only world in which a letter like this is acceptable is if that girl is dead. This is straight up bizarre",
            "You can feel however you want. Personally I would throw the letter away. It's a little creepy and sanctimonious. Like giving you tips on dating him. Really? As long as he's not in contact with her I would not put anymore thought into it. If he's still hung up on his past then you need to talk to him about how that makes you feel. I mean how would he like it if he were in your shoes? No one wants to be compared to someone else",
            ">> Should I contact her? \n\n>> But what would I even say? \n\nNo. She is his ex and their relationship is done. I find it weird that he'd give you the letter. Are they still in contact?\n\n>>  Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her? \n\nNot necessarily. If she was a good girlfriend, that's not a bad thing. What would be strange is if he keeps talking about her. \n\n>> Somehow this letter made me jealous because I could feel a level of closeness that I don't have with my boyfriend. \n\n>> Basically said I'm very lucky to have his love that I should cherish it and that I must be a great person if he's chosen me. Then she included some anecdotal tips on how to make him happy.\n\nProvoking jealousy could be one of the underlying reasons why she wrote the letter. She wants you to know that she was in his life, that she *knows* how to make him happy (as if you couldn't figure that out for yourself?), that she loves him so much she wants another woman to care for him to the degree she did, etc.   \n\n>> What should I make of this? \ufffc\n\nThe last thing you want to do is give her any reaction at all.  Get rid of the letter. No reaction is the best reaction. What I would make clear to your boyfriend is you don't want to bring his past into the present. He doesn't need to know the contents of the letter (how much feeling she had for him) and the two of you have your own relationship.",
            "Honestly, what weirds me out the most about this isn't the letter... it's the fact that all his friends are saying they were the perfect couple. That's a really rude thing to say to you. My husband has a really tight-knit group of friends and if any of them ever said that they weren't sure he would love again, especially before we got married, I would have been SUPER concerned. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, the letter itself is also weird. This has been said by others, but writing a letter to a future girlfriend is something that would only be appropriate if the girl was dying, not just moving far away. And even if she were dying and wanted to write the letter, I still think that would be something that he would be wary or cautious around showing to anyone. Like, before showing you he would open and read the letter himself and ask you if you wanted to read it--keeping in mind that it could be a difficult/painful moment for you. \n\nThere's very little awareness and concern around your feelings about this whole thing. There's a strong possibility that he's not over her, and she could show up again and cause problems for you in the future. I can speak from experience, because I've actually gone through something similar to this. If you move forward with the relationship be aware that he--AND his friends--are throwing out signs that it's not over with his ex. If she ever decides to come back into his life it could be very disruptive and destabilizing for you if you guys do move forward with any type of commitment. Do not recommend.",
            "I get why you feel uncomfortable. \n\nI don't know her, so I don't know what her true intentions were. Perhaps she really thought she was being nice, maybe it's a cultural thing given that she is from another country. To me however, it seems that this letter was a bit manipulative, as if she was determined to push herself in to his new relationship and the 'tips' on how to make him happy seems quite possessive and very 'I know him better then you'. I think whatever her intentions were, it was ill-judged.  \n\nIf I were you I'd stick the letter she sent to you in a drawer, or in the bin, and just forget about it. Your relationship is none of her business and her past with your boyfriend is none of yours, we are in the now and you are building a future with him. The letters do not matter. \n\n>From his friends I heard that they were THE dream couple and that she was a very kind and lovely person. Some said that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her which obviously hurt. \n\nIf his friends are really saying things like this to you, I would be cautious of those particular friends. I cannot imagine why anyone who considers themselves a friend to your boyfriend would ever say something like 'he's never going to love like that again' to his new girlfriend. Sometimes people say stupid things without thinking so it could just be down to that. Or they are trying to interfere in your relationship in a negative way for some reason. \n\nI've seen this sort of situation come up a lot on Reddit where friendship groups are irritated by the presence of a new partner and keep referring back to how great the old love was. I'm not sure what is behind it, it almost seems as if they resent their friend for moving on and it makes them uncomfortable for some reason. I wonder if that is maybe going on a little bit in your boyfriends friendship group.",
            "My problem is that your BF gave you the letter. I can see her being young and loving him very much but still ending the relationship. The letter was inappropriate. I'm sure she did it with good intentions and sappiness, but she was wrong to do it. It was written from the perspective of his being hers. He shouldn't be at this point. It's like he and she think of you as subletting him as your boyfriend, but really he's hers. Ick. That his friends reinforce that is not great either. \n\nYou should rethink this relationship. You deserve to be the shining bright star for someone, not what they are settling for because they can't get that.",

Don't contact her. There is not reason for doing it, neither of you needs the other in life. \n\nShe decided to broke up with him. So much for magical love. It does not make her bad, but it makes story about the dream couple nonsense. My dream partner stays with me.\n\nAlso, people who say \"that they think he's never going to love again like he loved her\" are full of crap. Why would they even say something like that to new girlfriend? That is in sabotaging relationship category.",

            "i think it's weird that he gave it to you. he's bringing her and her wishes into his relationship with you. best case, maybe he was just curious what it said! \n\ni would assume she wrote it in good faith, but i think it was poor judgement on both their parts and if i were you, i would try to let it go and not do anything further about it. they had a deeper closeness because they were together for 3 years. you can't compare at 9 months. and also because they were caught up in telling a fairytale about it. but he DIDN'T want to move for her and she DIDN'T want to stay for him. those cultural differences were incompatible. i dunno why his friends would say something so thoughtless to you, grr! \n\ni've had the THOUGHT that i'd love to compare notes with some future and past partners of my partners, just out of curiosity and i do still care about most of my exes and wish them love and happiness. but i would never DO it. each relationship is different and people are changing all the time. what he treasures and makes him happy with you may be different things than with her, and that's a good thing. make it your own story.",
            "It is not cute, it is overstepping a line. She has no business in his future relationships and I  am also weirded out by the fact, that he actually gave you this letter. You don't need tips from his ex how to handle him, that is incredibly presumptuous. The only excuse I have for this is, that she still might have been a bit childish as they were still very young. So, don't worry, she is not a Saint. Don't contact her, you two and your relationship are not her business anymore.",
            "Um, enclosing a letter to the girl he chooses is not \u201csaint-like\u201d or kind\u2014it\u2019s creepy. Not only creepy, but veeery manipulative. It\u2019s something a well-calculated psychopath would do to appear kind, but with ulterior motives in mind.\n\nLet me explain the psychology of doing something this absurd. She is basically inserting herself in the future love life of this man she loved. This is a power thing, where she will feel that she\u2019s in charge. She has the upper hand, and she \u201callowed\u201d this man she loved to move on, with her blessing, like some weird puppet master. Writing a letter acknowledging a future where he is fully moved on is a way to give yourself the illusion that you are allowing these events to unfold exactly as you wanted them, rather than genuinely letting your loved to move on by themselves on their own accord with no input from you. You feel weird about it because it is fucking weird.\n\nNow it may have been very cathartic for her in the moment to write it, and maybe made the breaking up/moving on process smoother for her. Cool. But in no way are you obliged to feel thankful for this weird gesture or entertain it in the slightest. It has nothing to do with how wonderful she thinks you are, but how much she wants her presence to be recognised, and her legacy to live on in your relationship with him. \n\nI\u2019d rip it up and set it on fire and forget the whole thing. She does not get to be a shadow in your relationship with him. This is entirely between him and you. Entirely. No one else. And her being a creepy ghost in it is unnecessary. Her role in his life is finished (albeit I\u2019m sure she influenced him positively in many ways), she has no more relevance there, so mentally wish her all the best and forget her weirdass ghost.\n\nEdit for clarity.",
            "Uh, what kind of friends does he have? Who would tell someone's new GF that the old relationship was like a dream couple and that he'll never love like that again?! That's just straight up malicious. I'd avoid those people because they're either trying to hurt you, or make you jealous, or make you want to leave. \n\nYou should ignore the letter. The ex might have thought that it made for a cute movie plot line but it's been 3 years. They started dating when he was 20. That was 6 years ago. He's probably quite different now than when they were together. \n\nThe real question is why would he give you the letter? That's pretty inappropriate. No idea what he was thinking. Keeping the letter for 3 years then deciding you should read it. Weird. I think you need to decide whether he's over her. You seem pretty jealous already and this kind of threw it in your face.",
            "Oh boy.  The first few comments are rough.  I know I'm just one voice in the sea of comments, but let me give my 2 cents anyway.\n\nHonestly, I think you should just take it at face value and move on.  Obviously they broke up amicably, so if she was still here, they'd probably still be friends.  As far as the jealousy over their closeness, remember that they had 3 years.  You've yet to break the 1 year mark.  There is plenty of time for you to reach that level with him.  Just remind yourself he's with you because he's ready to be.  I don't think there is anything wrong with this.  Odd?  A bit.  But just don't dwell on it and move along.  If it bothers you to the point you can't move on, have a calm conversation with your boyfriend about it.  Maybe find a counselor to help sort through the feelings.  \n\nBest wishes to you and your BF.",
            "My ex wouldn't say anything bad about his ex becuase most likely he still had feelings for her but then one day he started talking bad about her. So dont think she's a perfect person or that she's competition. That weird letter she left definitely proves that, but the fact your bf gave that said letter to you is absurd. Also if they were such a dream couple and so in love whyd she leave him...",
            "Everyone is really quick to ascribe this ex all kinds of negative attributes, and maybe that's true, but maybe not. Maybe she's just a nice person who really loved your boyfriend, was sorry that external reasons doomed their relationship, and genuinely wants him to be happy with someone who cares about him. And wanted to pass along that love to you. Is it weird? Is her giving you tips maybe a little self-centered? Was it probably written more for herself than for you? Sure, yeah, kinda. But weird isn't necessarily bad or manipulative or threatening. Don't get in touch with her if you don't want to. Do reach out if you do. \n\nThe bigger point is, there's nothing wrong with the person you're dating having a past before you. There's nothing wrong with them having been in love before. And there's nothing wrong or abnormal about still carrying around a part of that love. It's not threatening - it's a good thing, it shows they're a decent person, and suggests that they're going to continue to care about and respect you after your relationship ends (if it ends). The fact he's shared this letter could very reasonably be read as him closing another door on that relationship. The fact that he's able to bring these different times, different loves together looks to me like a sign that he's *not* holding part of himself back from you - him turning up fully in your relationship means turning up with that past, since it's part of him. \n\nAll that said though, sounds like his friends have been kinda insensitive to you and that sucks, and you might want to talk to him about it.",
            "If she\u2019d passed away from a terminal illness this would be so beautiful and sweet, but I kinda think it\u2019s obnoxious to write a letter for a future girlfriend. (If You don\u2019t die) It\u2019s imposing and comes across kind of rude. But it\u2019s not quite her fault that your boyfriend actually decided to give you the letter. He clearly doesn\u2019t have the emotional intelligence to think this through. I completely understand why this makes you jealous. You should be very upfront and open with your boyfriend about how it made you feel or you\u2019ll build up resentment and become more jealous.",
            "I think that your bf's friends are out of line, or at best, incredibly insensitive. The letter is weird and perhaps I'm too generous but I do think it came from a good place and wasn't intentionally manipulative; especially given the context that it was a healthy relationship from what your bf has told you about it. \n\nI think it's okay to feel jealous, but I don't think the letter is the issue. I would toss the letter away or put it somewhere that you can easily forget about it and focus on building a stronger relationship with your bf. She's in the past and there's no reason to dwell on it; with that being said I think it's important to establish boundaries with you bf and his friends. Their comments are understandably hurtful and you should talk to your bf about how it impacts you. If they react poorly, I would see that as a definite red flag.",
            "I had the opposite: my boyfriends\u2019 friends were talking a lot about how terrible the previous girlfriend was. In the beginning I was flattered, but at a certain point I just found it awkward: why were they so stuck on the past, when my boyfriend wasn\u2019t? I\u2019m not into being constantly compared by somebody else. I asked him why they kept bringing it up and turns out he was getting quite annoyed by it because for him it was history. He asked them to stop and they mostly did. \n\nHis ex does not have a place in our relationship, at least no more than other people that have shaped him in the past. Question is whether your boyfriend is willing to stop talking about her or telling his friends and family to do so. The letters are not just awkward and sound like she watched too many Nicolas Spark movies, but they are also a sign that she is taking up too much space in the relationship for you to feel comfortable with. Why did he wait 9 months to give the letter? What was his goal in handing you the letter in any case? These are conversations I would have with him. Depending on whether you can comfortably talk to him about this, hear his side and whether he understands your side and is willing to take steps to change the situation I would personally be okay. If he thinks it is perfectly normal as it is now and making you uncomfortable is just how it is going to be I would have serious reservations about your future potential.",
            "The only time I've heard about someone's leaving a letter behind for their ex's future SO with \"tips\" is when they were dying or something. With the same line of thought, I agree with others who have commented that it was for her own closure and probably didn't mean bad. Are they still in touch? Everyone talking how they were the dream couple and how she had to leave him kinda make it seem like she's dead or something.",
            "I bet she wrote those letters as a form of closure for herself, and theres nothing wrong with that, at least she's not a crazy ex. You don't need to get in contact with her and you dont need to do anything about it. And you certainly don't need to feel as if you have to live up to her standards, once you even try youre headed down a dark path of not being true to yourself. You can both be amazing girlfriends in your own merit",
            "Don't contact her.  Just throw it away and work to build your closeness with him.  They were together for three years, but they're _done_ - you and he still have a potential future together.\n\n>Isn't it strange that my bf or anyone else hasn't mentioned a single negative thing about her?\n\nNo, it's strange that people badmouth their exes for no reason.  They cared about each other, but weren't compatible long-term, because they want to live in different places.  It doesn't make them bad people.",
            "They didn\u2019t have a bad break up right. There was no ill will between them. So that he speaks well of her is not surprising. But I wouldn\u2019t think to much of that.\n\nNow the letter, he gave it to you didn\u2019t he? He sees you as worthy of his love and thus gave you the letter she left for the next women he truly fell in love with. \n\nThat said, you are allowed to feel however you feel. But You should probably discuss these feelings with your bf. Especially the closeness thing, maybe it is something you two can work on together?",
            "I would use this as a springboard for conversation. What does it mean that he gave this to you? Does it signify that he's moving on? Talk about the things in the letter and how it makes you feel on the outside of what is being described as the happiest time of his life. Explain that everyone makes her out to be this shining beacon of perfection and that it makes you feel like you could never measure up. He should respond by reassuring you. There's a reason he gave \\*you\\* the letter. You're his future. She's his past. The past needs to be squared away before the future can start, and he needs to be clear that he's let that go.",
            "Paraphrasing here, \u201cno one has said a single negative thing about her.\u201d\n\nThis whole situation *inherently* makes her look bad imo. Not bad as in \u201cshe\u2019s a bad person\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t go that far. But it seems kind of inconsiderate and arrogant to me. Your feelings are valid and she should have seen this coming as a possibility; what an uncomfortable position this letter puts you in. On top of that your bf\u2019s friends make it worse. The ex couldn\u2019t have known that would happen on top of it but why orchestrate such a gimmick at all? I would be jealous too in your place. \nWhat matters here is not you and the ex or you and your bfs friends but you and your boyfriend. If you feel open to do so talk about how this letter makes you feel. Even talk about how his friends make you feel. It\u2019s not fair to compare you to a past relationship, let alone someone who LEFT your boyfriend for a different life. She left him. Idk if they broke up immediately or not but the point stands, she chose a life that led to him not being in her life anymore at all. Therefore she\u2019s not the perfect ex girlfriend, regardless of what anyone else says.",
            "I have known my gf for six years. She had a bad year last year, mental issues, drug issues, health issues, and more, but I stuck with her. \n\nIf she went to Hell I would go down there after her, and that is no joke. \n\nSo, if this girl left to go back to her country, she abandoned your bf and that's the end of the story. The letter you got reminds me of something from Japanese anime. They frequently have \"sappy\" emotional stuff that seems forced and overly sweet and romantic that no one actually does. It's \"corny\" and not real.\n\nOther than \"sappy\" and \"corny\" I couldn't think of better words, maybe pretentious is a good word. \n\nAnyway, it sounds like this woman is \"in love\" with the idea of \"love\" but may not actually feel or practice love. \n\nYou should discuss this with your boyfriend so that he doesn't have it stuck in his mind that this girl loves him. She is in a sense \"gaslighting\" him and you. That's where you say something is or isn't real, but it really is, in order to drive people crazy. \n\nIn this case it's \"I'm such a loving person\" when they abandoned you and try to keep you in mind via some fake loving letter.",
            "Lol this is the weirdest thing I've ever heard. No one is that perfect and the people who mange to convince others that they are usually have some sort of personality disorder.\n\nYou've only described a few things about her but that sounds manipulative af to me. She sounds like a control freak who wanted to leave a relationship but maybe couldn't stand the thought of being the bad guy? Or she's read one too many romance novels and really wants to see herself as \"the one who got away.\"\n\nLike damn, she isn't his dead wife, she's his ex gf of 3 years.",
            "This would trigger me way past the point of being able to salvage the relationship personally. I\u2019m just trying to imagine myself in this situation and it\u2019s making my skin crawl. -_____-;;;; it seems like he\u2019s not over his past relationship to me. Maybe he should spend some time working through that. Did he not think about how giving you a letter from his \u201cperfect\u201d ex would make you feel? Uhggg. I\u2019m cringing too hard from this... maybe I\u2019m just not emotionally mature enough to handle something like that. I hope you guys can figure it out together. I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you OP but definitely have a conversation with him about how this made you feel and hopefully he gets why this is a messed up thing to do.",
            "Your boyfriend should have thrown that letter away years ago, or at least read it and then thrown it away. Why would he think it\u2019s a good idea to allow her to insert herself in your relationship like that? I\u2019m sorry, but it sounds like he\u2019s not totally over her. He definitely did not think through how this would hurt you.\n\nTalk with him about how it made you feel.",
            "You're living in a Disney movie.  Ugh.\n\nHonestly, I think she did it purely to make HERSELF look selfless.\n\nSeriously.  This was purely an **asshole** move on her part, not a selfless one.\n\nYou're a big girl.  You don't *need* his ex to tell you all the trade secrets for feeding and watering your boyfriend.  You didn't just fall off the turnip truck yesterday.  And the fact that he pandered to her and gave you the note is just as much of an **asshole** move as hers was for writing it.\n\nAnd then, of course, you have all his asshole friends telling you how Saint Ex-Girlfriend was the best thing on earth since sliced bread, which means you're basically a mediocre replacement at best.\n\nYup...you're basically surrounded by assholes everywhere you look.\n\nIs he really THAT much of a prize that you still want to hold onto him?  I would refuse to live in anyone's shadow.",
            "Her behaviour is weird and kinda honestly a little delusional. She may be 'nice' but who in their right mind thinks \"I loved this man perfectly therefore I have to teach others how to do it because they're not as capable of learning or as good at it as me\". It's arrogant and creepy to be honest. I don't think you should contact her, and to be honest your boyfriend shouldn't have given you that letter no matter how he felt about her. He should have protected you from it because it could've said any number of things and he was working off an assumption that it wouldn't.\n\nI think how you feel is justified, because honestly, if I put myself in her shoes, I know a letter like that might cause an issue even if it's well intentioned. She's either incredibly na\u00efve or low-key manipulative.",
            "I would never have given a woman that letter.\n\nIt's very disrespectful and not at all thoughtful to do.\n\nYour relationship should be your own. For him to include her in it is wrong.\n\nNo one should even be talking about her.",
            "Am i the only one who thinks its weird he kept this letter at all? I understand thinking about your ex but she\u2019s literally inserting herself into your relationship.  And he is...ok with this for some reason? Whole thing is awkward and he\u2019s been sitting on that letter the entire relationship wondering if you measure up. Just weird.",
            "This is extremely off-putting and I would definitely feel weird about it too. It\u2019s a relationship - not a relay race where she hands your boyfriend off to you. I\u2019d honestly question why my boyfriend felt the need to give it to me in the first place and why he\u2019s holding on to memorabilia from his past relationship.",
            "[deleted]",
            "As others have said, this letter is doing more harm than good. I don't know whether the ex was trying to rub it in a future girl's face that she was *the one who got away* or if this was her way to alleviate her guilt at leaving such a *great guy* behind that she wanted to ensure that *her replacement* would be every bit as good to him as she was. Maybe it's a combination of the two.\n\nAgain, as others have said, you need to draw a clear boundary with your boyfriend and his friends. You accept that your boyfriend has a past. You accept that you are not his first love (and perhaps he isn't yours - ooooh). What you can't accept is that people are not living in the present. She has no place in your relationship, and having constant reminders of her serves no constructive purpose. It will certainly destroy your confidence in yourself and this relationship, though.\n\nETA: You probably feel conflicted because her writing was indeed so nice. Some of us (and I'm right there with you, sister) have a difficult time standing up against people who read as nice. For one, it makes us look mean because outsiders will fail to see the nuance. But the truth is, she could have the best intentions and still be wrong. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, after all.\n\nP.S. (Ugh, I'm not on top of my game today.) To help your boyfriend comprehend why this sickly sweet gesture isn't nice and unwelcome, tell him to imagine the reverse. Put him in your shoes. \"Let's say 3 years ago I broke up with this awesome man - he was (describe some awesome man traits here). And my friends loved him. My family loved him! My mom was planning our wedding. But then he grew homesick, and he chose his country over me. I couldn't follow, so naturally, we broke up. Then later, I met you. And since day one, you have heard about Mr. Dream Guy Overseas and just how impossibly perfect he is. My friends even tell you that they doubt I could ever love anyone like I loved Mr. Dream again. Nine months into the relationship, I give you a letter from my ex. Because my ex's thoughts on my future relationships mattered *so much to me more than 3 years after we broke up.* Now tell me, how does that make you feel?\" And let him think about it.\n\nIf he gets it and makes some changes, you're good. If not, you need to sit and think about some things.\n\nI wish you the best!",
            "Take it and just appreciate the sentiment. You don\u2019t have to do anything. And you have nothing to live up to. No one comes into a relationship without a history. This is his and he obviously cares enough about you to share it. That to me shows that you\u2019re also someone special. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to feel a little jealous. That\u2019s called being human but don\u2019t let it consume you or dictate your actions.",
            "The best I can take from this is that what you have right there is a man so good that his ex wrote a damn letter of recommendation.  \n  \nIs this strange? Absolutely! But I guess it's a lot better than your boyfriend saying all his exes were crazy or something like that. Because if all of them are like that, the problem is with him.  \n  \nCount yourself lucky. Don't feel the need to contact her, she doesn't expect that of you, live your life happily :)",
            "I\u2019m not sure if I could handle a dynamic like this. He is still hung up on his ex. So much so that he hung onto a letter for years just so she would be inserted into his current relationship. I\u2019m assuming there are other good qualities that your bf and this is just a weird little snapshot. But I would always wonder what he would do if she were able to come back. Also, is still in contact with her?",
            "I think you should ignore the letter, ignore what his friends are saying and focus on what your bfs saying because his is the only opinion that's relevant here. I personally don't think it's odd that he hadn't said anything bad about her because it's very unclassy to slag off your ex to your current partner, especially if you ended things amicably. I also think you've only been together 9 months compared to 3 years so it's not surprising you don't have quite the same level of closeness with him yet, give it time. I would also say that considering the letter was for the girl he finds love with again him giving you it is a strong sign that he is serious about your relationship and feels like he's moved on from his ex. Honestly, from what you've said i don't think you need to worry. However i would talk to your boyfriend about how his friends talking about his ex is making you feel and possibly about the letter to because you have legitimate feelings here and it's not fair that they're making you feel like that. Make sure to approach it in a non-accusatory way though because you don't want to make him feel like he has to choose between his friends and you. As for the letter, it was written 3 years ago by someone who had just broken up with someone they loved and was trying to deal with that, it doesn't really reflect how anyone feels now, deal with it however makes you feel the most comfortable but i think contacting the ex would just be dredging up the past.",
            "They are all acting like she died and he\u2019s a widower. That\u2019s weird.",
            "My opinion is true love is actually more like young love especially at those early 20's age range. Everything seems so magical and new, and your personal responsibilities are usually a lot less, than even just a little later in life. \n\nBut I'm cynical, because I'm a dumbass that got married young like that, and then had to experience the marriage deteriorate as we both grew into entirely different people than we were in our early 20s.  But my opinion is don't worry about their \"perfect\" relationship, if it was as perfect as they all claim, she wouldn't have moved away.",
            "Wait.. it's been 3 years! I would definitely be weirded out by the fact that he's still hanging on to this girl's letter and still thinks it's okay to give it to you as if her words still have some meaning..",
            "What I find the most strange is the fact that she\u2019s come up this often, and especially among his friends. Exes come up, sure, but this is a very weird and romanticized relationship amongst ALL of them enough so that they\u2019ve talked about it with you, the girlfriend. I\u2019d have a long hard talk with your boyfriend about his feelings for her, to make sure that you can both move forward completely secure in this relationship.",
            "You did not come and break them up. They were broken up before you showed. They had decided not to be together irrespective of your existence.\n\nIf this is a good guy, give him a chance, give yourselves a chance. \n\nAs for the saint thing, well, she might be the greatest woman in the world. He still broke up with her.",
            "I think this is a chance to look inside yourself to identify what void this jealousy is trying to fill. If it's a closeness that the ex had with your bf, then it's likely an ego/territorial trigger. \n\nThat said, keep in mind that there is no comparison. You are you. She was a part of his life (and ergo a part of who he is as a person,) for 3 crucial, growing years. He will never be able to relive those years again. However, what's arguably more important is that she is a part of the reason that he is who he is now.\n\nWithout her, and their time together, you may have never known him the way that you do now. They were together for 3 years, while you've been with him for 9 months- who's to say you won't feel your own type of closeness with him eventually? Besides, I promise you don't want to feel like her replacement, so why yearn for their closeness when you have the chance to develop your own?\n\nI was in a relationship for about 3 years, when I was 19-22. He was my first love, and someone I thought I would be with for the rest of our lives. Our family and friends embraced the other as family and friends. I loved his family like my own, and his parents made me feel like their daughter. We all cried with such emotion when it ended... That will never change, and they all have a place in my heart. But I've never thought to compare my ex to my current boyfriend. They are their own person. We all have a past, I've learned to embrace it rather than fight it (it's a fight you'll lose. You can't change the past).\n\nGood luck!",
            "I have to agree with majority of what has already been said. It sounds like at best, this ex wrote the letter in the heat of an emotional moment prior to her leaving him to move away and perhaps in her mind she thought she was doing some overly-emotional, \"love actually\" bullshit which she thought was cute when actually it's super creepy and problematic. \n\nThe best advice I could give you is to give the letter no reaction at all, don't contact her. If you feel you need to sit down and have a conversation with your SO, do so, lay some ground rules out and say you want to talk about how it made you feel and for him to listen and respect whatever those feelings are. Maybe if you talk to him about how confused and uncomfortable it made you, you both can reflect on your relationship, where it is going and hopefully will come out stronger and more reassured of the relationship after this conversation!\n\nAll the best to you and your next steps, hope you're coping okay with whatever you're feeling/going through right now!",
            "my friend always says \"when in doubt, take it as a compliment.\" and this applies here. this whole postal delivery was intended to occur when \"he finds love again.\" what a great thing that he's found love with you and what a kindness that this woman seeks to give you a fistbump from around the world.",
            "Is the ex from a country with very different culture? I feel like at this age she feels romantic to do this like sort of things from movie..... would expect him to think more nice of her maybe following her to her country...",
            "Personally, i think the letter is a little weird but okay as long as it's a one time thing. Maybe it's just something she needed to do to move on from him? And that she does have a deep love for him, which doesn't necessarily have to still be a romantic one, but more of someone who shared some great memories with him and she still thinks well of him, so doesn't want him to be treated badly or taken for granted. By the sounds of it they obviously had quite a deep relationship but then it begs the question of why they didn't try to make it work long distance? Or why he didn't think about moving there? (Not sure of those two didn't happen but it's not mentioned in the post). Also, is he still in contact with her, and if so, how regularly?\n\nOn the other hand, i do agree that the 'tips' are a bit of a step too far. And i also think that his friends and family constantly mentioning how good they were together etc is too far as well. Yes they might have been great, but he's with you now and they need to respect that, and respect that your feelings will be hurt given it sounds like they're comparing you. You're a completely different person, you will have a completely different relationship with this guy, unless he is still hung up on her and trying to make your relationship like theirs was.\n\nI personally think you need to sit your boyfriend down and say look, i don't know her so i don't know whether there's some subtext to this letter or not but i need to be sure that you're fully here for this relationship and not just using it as a rebound or hoping that eventually I'll move from 2nd to 1st place? And i would say make it clear to him that if that is the case, he needs to be honest right now about it, before you go further into the relationship and it festers into a bigger issue that ends up leaving you both bitter.",
            "The way I see it is when she wrote that letter, it was just as they were ending things and she was being really sentimental. And she was really young too, so maybe kind of immature and not very self aware, that's not uncommon for people in their early 20s. \n\nNow that things have had plenty of time to cool off, I think it was really inappropriate and kind of manipulative  of him to actually give you the letter! He did it to stroke his own ego and/or provoke jealousy.",
            "Honestly she probably is pretty nice. And I imagine being young she probably thought this was a final lovely/romantic gesture to her ex-boyfriend and did not genuinely consider how it would come across to the other person. Or how it comes off as inserting herself in a new relationship she has no business being in.\n\nHowever the fact is your boyfriend should have been the one to ACTUALLY consider your feelings. I\u2019m not sure if he was just being dumb and thought this was sweet or if it\u2019s his way of holding on to her and honouring her wishes. But he should have been the one to consider \u201cIs this a good idea\u201d.\n\nThat being said I also don\u2019t think he means any harm. In fact I think because he\u2019s given it to you it suggests he does love you and sees a future with you as he did with his ex. Seeing as he\u2019s only given you this letter now.\n\nDon\u2019t contact the ex. She may even have moved on by now! Yes she was lovely and it\u2019s a good thing people speak fondly of her. But that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t also a lovely person. And we definitely should not seek validation by being the \u201cbetter girlfriend\u201d. \n\nI would sit down with your boyfriend and discuss the letter. Not in accusatory time but more to understand what he thought this would achieve. Let him know how you feel about it and whether he\u2019s ready to let go of that part of his life. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly better to have these discussions now rather than letting is fester. Don\u2019t let this make you feel insecure or jealous. Accept the letter but create boundaries and explain why it\u2019s not as sweet as everyone else seems to think!",
            "Egads, give me a break. She's not his dead mother, she's just his damn college ex-girlfriend. It sounds like both of them need to get the fuck over themselves.\n\nI'd consider this a yellow flag. Maybe he hadn't had a lot of relationships before, and therefore doesn't realize that life isn't a romantic comedy movie where people do dipshitty stuff like write time capsule letters for their replacements. \n\nBut honestly, if that's the case, feel free to inform him that no, it's not saintly and romantic of her, it's freaking weird and nosy.",
            "Dude, she is not a saint. Purposefully inserting herself into your relationship like that looong after they have broken up is really weird. She probably meant entirely well, but it\u2019s a sign she\u2019s a really, really self-involved person who centers everyone\u2019s stories around herself, including you and your boyfriend\u2019s as a couple.\n\nAnd the fact that she was all \u201cmy darling, I hath enclosed a letter to thou future love, shalleth she ever come to be\u201d and instead of being like \u201cthis is a little inappropriate\u201d he ACTUALLY GAVE IT YOU, assuming you would care just as much as him about the words and approval of his ex... that\u2019s really weird too. It\u2019s like he\u2019s still seeking her permission to be with someone else,  and if he cares about having a healthy relationship with you, he\u2019s gotta let her go.",
            "Ooof this is so awkward and weird. I don't know what he was thinking in giving it to you! It implies a connection and level of 'ownership' that should make any new partner hesitate. Like, you don't need her permission or blessing to date this man! Nor do you need her \"tips.\"  \n\n\nAnd shame on his friends for insinuating that he'll never love again like that. How disrespectful! Every love is different, true, but damn. Do they just not want him to be happy??\n\nI think you should absolutely talk to your boyfriend about this. It's NOT a bad thing that he's only had nice things to say about an ex. That's healthy, as long as it's not a constant thing or comparing you two. I'm hopeful your bf is just oblivious to his friends being crappy and being a bit of a dunce about the letter. With a calm conversation you should be able to suss it out. Just state your feelings clearly without projecting or assigning blame to him. Then ask him about his feelings around it.  \n\n\nIf he can't understand your perspective on this or gets upset, it is possible that he is still hung up on her even if he doesn't know it.  \n\n\nGood luck!",
            "So, the ex is very nice.  But still manipulative.  She wanted to control who he ends up with by handing him a letter like that.  No matter who he chose, she would still get to be in control.\n\nIf you bring up this line of thinking, your boyfriend will probably react poorly as this is some A-tier manipulation.  The perfect kind of manipulation to where you look like the bad guy no matter what you do.  Take the high road.  Say it's sweet.  Never mention it again.",
            "That's fucking weird, dude. I don't think you need to be jealous of someone like that, because either her concept of normal is way off if she thought you or anyone else would appreciate a letter like that or that it would in any way benefit your boyfriend, she's so egotistical she needs to insert herself into what is no longer her business to look good to a stranger, or she's intentionally trying to sabotage your relationship to keep your boyfriend single and on her back burner.\n\nDid your boyfriend's friends say those things in front of him, or does he know about it? Because they're behaving inappropriately, too. Who says they think their friend will never find love like that again TO THE PERSON THEIR FRIEND IS OSTENSIBLY IN LOVE WITH?\n\nETA: for the record, I'm a believer in the possibility of maintaining friendships with exes and I'm a very non-jealous person, and I still think this shit is weird.\n\nETA2: your boyfriend's judgment is also weird here. I can't imagine what would possess him to think that forwarding a letter--unread!--from his ex to his future girlfriend who's a stranger to her was a good idea. What did he think was going to happen?",
            "Ugh. I can *feel* this post. When my now-husband and I started dating and became \u201cFacebook official\u201d over a decade ago, his long-term high school girlfriend requested my friendship on Facebook and sent me a private message. It said something like \u201cCongratulations, he is an amazing guy! Don\u2019t break his heart, blah blah blah.\u201d I was trusting and wanted to be cool so I replied \u201cI\u2019m glad y\u2019all can still be friends.\u201d Big mistake. She was insecure and manipulative, and interjected herself in your our relationship in so many ways. Unfortunately, my husband was naive and kind hearted towards her, and it only made it worse. He did not set the boundaries he should have and it affected our relationship long term. Obviously, we ended up fine, but there was a lot of hurt along the way that created a lot of bitterness I held onto for a while. \n\nThis also reminds me of a post I read yesterday where a woman was being constantly compared \nto her fianc\u00e9\u2019s deceased ex-fianc\u00e9. A boundary has to be set somewhere, or you might be competing with the metaphorical ghost of this girl for a long time to come. Especially if others are making comments about their relationship as well. \n\nI think it\u2019s really cool that your boyfriend was respectful enough to not read the letter and follow through with his ex\u2019s wishes and DID present it to you on the pretense that it was to be given to someone who he finds love with. But know that it\u2019s totally reasonable for you to feel uncomfortable by this. I would talk with him and be honest how it makes you feel. It\u2019s likely he does not have feelings for her, but as with anyone important in someone\u2019s life, they will always be a part of it. It\u2019s up to you to determine where the line is and whether it\u2019s been crossed. And of course, to discuss it with your boyfriend.",
            "Sigh. Lots of saintly people are codependent as fuck, and have verrrry poor boundaries.  Case in point: this woman.",
            "Do you think there\u2019s any chance he wrote the letter so you would step up your game, follow the tips on things he liked? It could be very weird way to manipulate you.",
            "Plot twist: you're his first and only girlfriend.",
            "Honestly what a weird-ass power move.  \"Oh hey new girl, I had him first and know him better than you do but have a nice life\".",
            "It\u2019s not like she\u2019s dead. The fact that he thinks she\u2019s important enough to have given the letter would put me in a bad place. Like she\u2019s giving you permission. And giving you tips? Who TF does she think she is? It\u2019s like they\u2019re still dating and he\u2019s allowed a side chick till they reunite. This is gross honestly :/",
            "His friends sound like insensitive assholes for saying that, especially to your face. And while I understand she wrote that letter from a place of love, it's also ridiculous. I'd feel uncomfortable. It's so patronising, like she is establishing the fact that he is still her property but she's letting you lease him out. \n\nIt makes perfect sense why you feel uncomfortable and jealous. You do not need to contact her. \n\nWhat's your boyfriend like with you generally? He doesn't compare you to her, does he? Does he usually praise her? Does he seem far away to you, is he in touch with her, does it seem like he has moved on? \n\nIf you are happy with him otherwise, do you need an express reassurance from him that he loves you and only you and you aren't sharing him emotionally with anyone? You can (and I believe should) kindly and gently explain how you feel to him. Relationships are about open communication. Even mention what his friends said, about how he would never find love like the one with his ex again. Explain how that made you feel. Explain you didn't appreciate the letter. Ask him how he truly feels right now about his ex and you. \n\nAgain, don't attack him--just have a discussion, not an argument. Your feelings are very, very valid.",
            "It\u2019s weird that she wrote a letter and even weirder that your bf felt like it was a good idea to give it to you. Their relationship is over, why is she in your?",
            "As someone who ended a 7 year relationship and is still on excellent (talk a couple times a month and text often) terms I find this completely inappropriate, extremely bizarre and frankly possessive. \n\nMy ex is a wonderful person and I cannot wait for him to find someone serious to build a life with but respect for a relationship is paramount. It would never ever cross my mind to write her a letter. The relationship is over and my position as his person is no longer valid. \n\nI would trash the letter and have a serious talk with your boyfriend. He can't control whether she writes a letter to his \"future love\" but to go through with handing it over says he's either incredibly obtuse or still buying into her weird romantic doomed love fantasies.",
            "This was just her way of dealing with a painful breakup, dont take it personally - Your boyfriend must be a special person for someone to care about him so much. I know it does feel too much, but this was all about her and her pain and nothing to do with you. She sounds like a nice person too, and im sure if she had been a bit more thoughtful and imagined you stressing about it, she may have never written it.\nYou can disregard the tips. You're a different person and your boyfriend is older and wiser now.",
            "This sounds like something a dying spouse would do for their partner and their partner's future partner. It's weird if the other person is still alive and just decided to peace out to the other side of the world lol\n\nAlso, his friends sound like assholes, sorry but who the fuck says he'll never love like that again to his CURRENT partner?",
            "The fact she left you is a letter is so cheesy and weird. I also find it weird that your bf would give it to you. OP - remember they couldn\u2019t have been that perfect together.. she left remember? If the relationship was as amazing as they led you to believe, they would\u2019ve made it work. If you love someone enough, there is always a way. I\u2019d respectfully tell bf and any friends that he\u2019s with you now and you don\u2019t want to hear anymore about his past relationship. It\u2019s in the past for a reason.",
            "This is kind of sweet, but life moves on and those letters are the closure of an old chapter. Now you both write a new one in your own shoes. \n\nI'd pay little attention on peoples opinion of this perfect couple phrase. An opinion based on the past and not what is infront of them. You cant live in the past, and so therefore miss placed and invalid are these opinions. To dwell on these would merely hinder and serve no positive purpose.",
            "I say everyone is over-reading this. Take it as it is. A letter. Leave it alone. You read it and don't need to bring it up again. Don't need to reach out to her. Don't need to talk to your BF about the letter. Just let it be. Is it weird? sure. I wouldn't say you shouldn't feel weird. BUT DON'T Linger on it. Lingering would corrupt the relationship you love. He feels the closeness with you as he did give you the letter albeit not knowing what was in it. Just let it go and move forward. Don't look back.",
            "Young love with no responsibilities is a lot easier than mid 20s relationships. Plus, she knew that there would be an end date on their relationship so she wouldn't need to have any complicated conversations. Makes it seem like a relationship from heaven - so don't try to compare your relationship with what he had. It's not like for like. A holiday romance vs a real relationship.\n\nSo the instructions on his letter were to give the other letter to the girl he loves.\n\nThat's you. You are the girl he loves.\n\nI think you're just going to have to put up with hearing her name. She's obviously a nice caring person. If you make a big deal every time a friend mentions her, you will look petty. Some friends might even start mentioning her on purpose to tease you.\n\nOver time, they'll stop mentioning her.\n\nLook her up on social and say thanks, it's such a kind gesture.",
            "It doesn\u2019t seem that weird to me. He had an amazing relationship in his past and I think that  intimidates you, if anything you should just acknowledge what\u2019s on the letter and try and establish an even closer relationship with your boyfriend from what\u2019s in the letter, it\u2019s basically a cheat sheet on what your boyfriend likes. Yes I guess it\u2019s kinda weird, but I imagine he just kept it and did it out of respect for his past relationship because that\u2019s something she wanted him to do. He didn\u2019t know what was on it so how was he supposed to know it would go over some line and make you uncomfortable, and from your evaluation the woman\u2019s a saint so would it be that crazy to assume that she really is just trying to help his next relationship.\n\nYou\u2019ve been with the man for nine months and a letter from some woman that was in a relationship with this man for 3 years would obviously be more intimate and in depth than what you currently have in your relationship. It could be your boyfriend has just felt comfortable enough in your relationship that he would bring this up just now? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should contact her, as there is nothing to gain from it. It seems like all your worries are stemming from being intimidated and jealousy. In your boyfriends mind this was probably something harmless and fun, and it came from somebody from a completely different culture which probably just means she doesn\u2019t understand the nuances of how we deal with relationships. I don\u2019t think you should shy away from the sword, throw yourself on it and try and make your relationship even better than the one he had in the past and talk to him about if any of the anecdotal stuff to \u201ckeep him happy\u201d even has any validity and so what if it does? \n\nIf you choose to feel intimidated than maybe it is because your relationship isn\u2019t that great, but if that\u2019s the case why wouldn\u2019t you be thankful for having this letter to make you realize it sooner so you save time and grief.",
            "No one is perfect, no one is a saint. They were young loves and didn\u2019t stay together long enough for something to sour their relationship, so I am positive they are idealized memories. You get the real relationship though. You get to be with him and she doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re worthy as much as she was.",
            "Sounds to me like she had every intention of scaring the hell out of any girl who might want him into running ways as fast as she can. Honestly. It's none of her business to tell another woman these things. Its creepy and weird.",
            "I agree with other posters that this is a 'cute and beautiful only in a movie' thing, but I'm not sure about the vilification of motive. This sounds to me like more of a coping mechanism on her part during the breakup, and it may even be mortifying to her to know that the boyfriend actually went through with giving it long after she's actually moved on.\n\nI'd definitely say don't contact her. Take the advice of the other posters and make clear to your boyfriend that her shadow is something you don't want as part of your relationship.",
            "Can't he figure out how rude and uncomfortable is this? If he always acts like this if I were you I'd break up.",
            "Write her back and tell her you appreciate her letter and being such a positive influence on him but you\u2019re good (in nicer terms). \n\nHonestly I find it kind of weird to receive a letter with tips. You\u2019re a different person and you bring in different things to a relationship. Yeah, maybe she was great but the fact is that he\u2019s with you because he decided he cared about you and liked how you treated him. I would consider talking to your boyfriend about it to set boundaries because it sounds like you\u2019re dating him and his memory of her. I mean, did he write her new bf a letter? Also this would be a good time to ask him straight up if he\u2019s waiting for her or something bc that\u2019s no environment you should be in either. You\u2019re worth loving.",
            "It's odd to me that if they were so in love, that they couldn't have had your bf move back to her country with her or something. There has to be more to this story. Lots of other comments saying you need to create a boundary, I agree.",
            "People that do things like this are so fucking weird to me. It\u2019s like she\u2019s trying to have a hand in your relationship now, after the fact. She shouldn\u2019t be telling you things to make him happy. That\u2019s for you to discover and things could change anyways just from him growing and you being a different partner.\nIt\u2019s not cute at all. He should have just thrown the letter away. I would tell him that you appreciate the nice intentions, but it makes you uncomfortable and for good reason. Your relationship is your own. Theirs was theirs and it\u2019s over.",
            "Unless its your wife and she died of cancer and left a letter to the new women in your life.....otherwise this shits wierd AF.",
            "This girl is not an angel. In fact, it's completely inappropriate that she wrote that letter in the first place and that your boyfriend actually gave it to you! What a weird and rude thing to do. They broke up, who your bf dates now is not his ex's business whatsoever. The letter was a weird way of his ex trying to always stay relevant in his life even though it sounds like she broke up with him. She's trying to make sure all of your bf's future relationships know that there was someone \"better\" in the past. She is trying to have some kind of control over his current relationship even from afar. It is so weird that your bf didn't see an issue with this and actually gave you this stupid letter. It would be different if it was a letter from a relative or something but from an ex giving you tips and shit because clearly you can't figure out how to make him happy on your own, and because you just HAVE to know how deep and meaningful their relationship was? What a weird intrusive thing to do. \n\nHonestly I would ask your bf why he felt the need to give you the letter in the first place and why he didn't seem to find anything weird about what his ex has done. And also, talk to him about the comments his friends make and ask him to make them stop! Everyone in this situation is unbelievably rude. Who says to their friend's girlfriend \"he'll probably never love anyone like his ex again\"??\n\nAnd don't contact her, it will only be her getting what she wanted which is for the letter to upset you and make you think that your relationship will never match up to hers with your bf. She's not worth the time and energy.",
            "Your boyfriend should not have given you that letter.",
            "So strange. He's a grown man not a puppy she passed on to a new home. It's weird your boyfriend actually gave it to you. Did he read it?",
            "It\u2019s odd that she said that you \u2018must be a great person if he\u2019s chosen you\u2019. I\u2019m not saying that he isn\u2019t a great person or that you aren\u2019t. To me that sounds like she considers herself a great person and he would only have someone exactly like herself, which is a bit self-centred and cringy. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d chuck the letter, don\u2019t give it to him to hold on to (will just encourage fond reminiscing and awkward sentimentality). Forget her \u2018tips\u2019, you\u2019ll find your own ways of making him happy, as will he for you, hopefully. \n\nIt takes time to get to know someone and develop real closeness. Don\u2019t lower yourself to comparing yourself to her and their relationship as it will only make you feel crap.  As someone said above, speak to your partner, clarify if he\u2019s still holding a torch for her. If he isn\u2019t, then tell him you\u2019re happy that he had a good relationship but it\u2019s over and you don\u2019t want or need to be compared or reminded about it all the time.",

I'm sorry you're dealing with this, it is definitely unusual and you're okay to be questioning how to deal with it. Best of luck.",
            "To me this comes off as something she said she wrote for his future love but in actuality expected him to read it himself and never do. Just like a letter of things she wanted to say in a goodbye but maybe couldnt stomach actually saying it to him\nIdk this when thing is weird.

Unless it was his dying ex wife on her deathbed, She doesn\u2019t get to be the one to pass the torch in a dramatic way.\n\nAnother note: what if you had a letter from your ex for your current boyfriend? How would he have received it?",
            "It seems like the level of closeness that this girl had with your boyfriend that you may not have yet was because they were together for three years, which is way longer than you have been with your boyfriend. From what I can gather based off of this post, I think they just didn't get the timing right in their relationship and that's why it didn't work out, which is unfortunately why a lot of relationships end. \n\nThe letter was clearly written with good intentions, but I think it's much more important that your boyfriend never opened the letter and that he chose it to you, because according to her letter to him, he was supposed to give the letter to \"girl he finds love with again.\" \n\nWhat you are feeling is normal, and it's good that you know that you shouldn't feel jealous of someone who he hasn't been with for the past three years. What you're jealous of is that there is a big chunk of your boyfriend's life that you'll never get to know, and that doesn't seem to be an unhealthy emotion to have. \n\nI have been in your shoes before, and when I first started dating my boyfriend, I felt extremely insecure that he had been in a five year relationship (which ended a few years before we met) and I had never been in a serious relationship before. He never bad mouthed her, and neither have any of his friends or family members, and it took me more than the first year of our relationship to stop feeling insecure and to stop assuming that everyone was comparing me to his ex. The feeling does go away with time, and it seems like your boyfriend is just someone who keeps his promises and wanted to give you the letter in part because of that, but mostly because you are the girl he's in love with.",

            "Honestly, she might be a nice girl, but the whole thing with the letter comes across as  melodramatic, patronizing,   selfish, and overall immature. Just reading about the whole thing feels icky and cringy.  \nPeople break up all of the time, and not always for terrible reasons or out of dislike or hate for one another. Their breakup isn't that unique to be honest.  \nI think your bf's friends need to consider your feelings and respect their friend's CURRENT relationship.  \nIf she had died, that would be one thing, but she didn't. She still is alive and well and she made her choice  - as did your boyfriend. It sounds like nobody in this situation is considering how it might make YOU feel.   \nFurthermore, does she really think that she is the only one that is capable of making him happy? That you are somehow an incapable lil' lamb that needs to be guided? That is definitely crossing boundaries and super patronizing.  She obviously did not even consider how the new girlfriend would feel getting a letter like that. She did not write the letter for \\*you\\*, she wrote it for herself and whatever weird level of immature self-satisfaction she wants to attain. She does not own him and you don't need her instructions. \n\nIf you are being made to feel like less-than because of all of this weird sainthood your boyfriend's ex has been bestowed, you shouldn't waste your time. You don't need to be made to feel like a consolation prize, nor like you need to compete with a woman that either could come back, or has been made out to be someone or something you couldn't attain (big ol' serving of doubt on that front, btw).  \nKeep in mind that the past is often viewed through rose-tinted glasses.",
            "I think the letter she wrote was closure for her at the end of their relationship. He must love you to have given it to you.

You do what you perceive and feel will make your boyfriend happy, not what his ex thinks. Her opinion is not valid here or needed.\n\nI think you should express how you feel to your boyfriend. And also, his friends shouldn't be making you feel like you have to live up to one of his ex's. If they were that perfect together they'd still be together.

If it bothers him you've saved yourself some time.\n\nNotice how it's all about her now?\n\nAlso, why the hell did he keep the letter and give it to you? That is telling af.",

Everyone in this thread completely understands why you\u2019re feeling the way you are and sees the whole thing as weird. \n\nShe knew that leaving that letter would only cause problems for future relationships, how could it not? Who wants to feel like second best? She just wants to keep that connection to your BF as his number 1 love of his life and now she\u2019s made it clear to you that\u2019s the case and done exactly what she wanted to do. That or she seriously lacks awareness and consideration \n\nIt\u2019s weird and the whole picture you\u2019ve painted rubs me the wrong way. What Is your BF doing? What is he thinking? All his friends are telling you about this woman as well and how much he loved her? She left some letter like she\u2019s dead or something? She\u2019s just far away and they probably still fucking talk for god sakes. \n\nAnd what\u2019s that crap with giving you tips on how to keep him happy? That makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it who does she think she is? Seriously.\n\nI\u2019d talk to him and make things clear that you\u2019re not going to be made to feel second best to this woman and the letter thing is super weird",

I\u2019ve been with my current bf for a little over three years and I would never even THINK to write a letter to his \u201cfuture gf.\u201d I would definitely sit your bf down and tell him exactly how that letter made you feel because WHY would he give it to you? She\u2019s alive and kicking, just didn\u2019t love him enough to move (which is totally valid) and not dead from a terminal illness. This situation is like what would happen in a romance movie, except this a real life and there actually is a new gf (you) that has to read the overly dramatic and sappy letter later on and deal with the repercussions. What did she expect you to do? Thank her for her tips? Thank her for being \u201chappy\u201d for you? She sounds insufferable. That letter belongs in her journal, never to be seen by anyone and I hope she is back home cringing at her past self right now.",

            "This would make me quite uncomfortable. It sounds like your boyfriend has carried baggage from this relationship with her into your relationship. Not the typical traumatic baggage that people bring when they were with a toxic ex, but the baggage of not having fully let go of a person. \n\nKnowing that partner is idealizing another person in any way, ESPECIALLY when it\u2019s someone who they have been with in the past is utterly devastating. It sounds like he\u2019s idealized her in several if not every way you can think of. This isn\u2019t healthy. No one is a saint. If she was really so perfect for him they would have found a way to be together. When your with a person that you think is \u201cthe one\u201d you do everything you can, to and beyond the extent of reason to be with that person. Your telling me he met a woman who\u2019s been described as an angel come to earth and long distance wasn\u2019t an option? He didn\u2019t even consider moving to be with the woman of his dream? Nah. Everyone\u2019s romanticizing the whole thing and framing it in a rosy way that I assure you does not reflect reality. \n\nI guarantee she\u2019s not as perfect as she\u2019s been described. Personally though, if I were you I\u2019d still be wary. It sounds like he\u2019s still very much hung up on her. \n\nAsk yourself this: how would you feel if this woman moved back to your country/state/city/town? How would expect him to react? From what you describe I cannot imagine that your boyfriend would not want to have her in his life in some capacity. Even if he\u2019d claim he just wants to be her friend, would you EVER be able to feel fully secure about his loyalty to you if they spent time together as friends? Would you feel comfortable asking him to not reestablish contact with her if she reached out? Do you think he\u2019d resent you for asking him to keep this \u201camazing person\u201d out of his life? \n\n\nIf you feel even a little that your relationship would be jeopardized by someone from your partners past moving back into the area then I think that your relationship is inherently unstable. You\u2019re not a consolation partner because \u201cthe one\u201d moved away. That\u2019s bullshit.",
            "She ain't that nice sweetheart, this is the most passive aggressive bs ever!!! Oh here is how to make my man happy since he can't have me.... WTF ignore her, if you want to be with him you have to make you own path and ignore Ms Perfect. If he is really hung up on her, I would walk away, but that is me. I have never had my partners friends talk to me about his ex, that is kinda weird to me.",
            "If she was so perfect and they were such a great couple, why didn\u2019t either of them pull out all the stops to make it work? He could\u2019ve moved to the ex-gf\u2019s country if they\u2019re bond was so strong, she could\u2019ve stayed and tried. \n\nRelationships are compromise, never known any not to be. But, if you have something special, you never let it go! Something tells me your bf\u2019s previous relationship might not have been all it seems. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s mind games. It does sound a little patronising. But, you are with your bf not her, and the circumstances and situation is different now. Her letters mean nothing. Forget it and make the best of what you have.",
            "I know it feels weird, but sometimes someone just happened to care deeply about the person you care about, and they just happen to be one of those genuine, good people. That's okay.\n\nAnd jealousy is a symptom of something else usually. The feeling will either subside when you work on whatever it is that is making you feel jealous, or it will open up a can of worms that makes you realize that the jealousy is founded and you need to leave. It can mean that you feel like you, maybe, have too many hangeups or expectations because of past relationship trauma. It may mean that you are fearful that he drop you like a bad habit if she wanders back into his life. Do you trust him? Have you had a discussion about what would happen if she did come back? Probably not, because you are afraid of the answer, but maybe that is the discussion that you need to have, because maybe he hasn't even really put that much thought into it.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that he hung on to that letter until he found someone that he found love with again, which means that he feels that you were worthy of reading that letter. That is something to consider. That was probably hard for him too.",

            "Definitely do NOT reach out to her. I'd say that letter was far from an act of kindness, it was a way of marking her territory and having an insidious influence way into this guy's future. It's a power and ownership thing and definitely not the mark of \"a nice person\", it's manipulative and inappropriate.\n\nThat letter is having the desired effect: to make you feel like you'll never match up, to undermine what you have, to make you jealous. I'm surprised he even gave you it, is he fully over her? Why does he still value her input and allow her to have presence and influence?",

A man\u2019s wife of 20 years dies of cancer. They were madly in love, they had a perfect marriage. He knows that if he finds someone else, she will need to understand and respect what he used to have, while still looking forward and building a life together. While this can be a hugely intimidating situation for a new woman to step into... If happens all the time. It can actually bring them closer. And in this instance, I think it would be a sweet gesture for the deceased wife to have left a letter for his next love. \n\nBut your dude is like 26. Everyone involved has their whole lives in front of them... This feels like a passive aggressive intimidation tactic. For your BF to go along with this... I don\u2019t know.

Why everyone here is projecting their own lack of self-esteem and trust issues onto what is objectively the sappy nonsense of children, I have no idea. \n\nYou don't need to contact her.

I\u2019d show it to him and ask his thoughts on the letter without telling him yours first. \n\nThe big red flag here is that your boyfriend thinks so highly of this ex when she clearly exhibits behaviors (like this letter) that aren\u2019t so saintly or great, because it shows that he\u2019s never going to understand your perception of the situation. Which is fucking annoying now, and will be more annoying later.\n\nDisclaimer: I dealt with a similar situation so I\u2019m biased.",

The point is, don\u2019t strangle the new growth. \n\nYou know this intuitively hence your discomfort.

It\u2019s super short sighted on what kind of effect it would have you, and your boyfriend should have never given it to you. You don\u2019t need an endorsement from his ex and he should never of given her that power in her absence. Whatever happens with your b/f, and hopefully he realizes how truly immature that was on his part, it sounds like you have your head on straight and you deserve someone who\u2019s on your level on emotional maturity.

            "I'd look at it this way- they broke up. Is it a bit weird that she left a letter, which your boyfriend held onto this whole time and then gave to you? Yeah, it's a bit weird. However, so was the way their relationship ended- she chose a place over him and they didn't want to do an LDR, but they didn't end on bad terms or on terms of incompatibility. I'm sure that made it weird for both of them. So my take on it would be 'OK, she said to give this to the person he moved on with- that's me. He has decided that I surpass her enough that I get the letter. She didn't leave multiples, she left one for his someone special- he would've kept it if he wasn't sure about me. She has relinquished all rights to him and he decided I was the one who gets this letter.' Look at it from a positive point of view. If you look at it negatively going forward, yeah it'd be a fairly natural thing to do, but it will fester in your head- if you want to be with this guy long term, you'll need to reframe it, for your own sake. \n\nThat being said, I'd talk to your boyfriend and say Hey, she sounds great and honestly the letter was really sweet, and I'm glad you trusted me enough to give it to me- but even if I have nothing against her personally, your friends have made it clear that she was special to you. They've made it sound like I'll never compare, and it's been a problem for me- this letter wouldn't bother me at all except that I've already got these issues in the back of my head. She left tips to make you happy which, again, nice gesture- but I'm not her, and we have a separate relationship. Things that worked for her won't be the same for me, nor would I want them to be. So can I ask you to please be honest- and I won't ask again and we can move forward after this- do you compare us? Would you be with me if she was an option now? And if we're good there, and you're not going to keep bringing her up beyond situations where it'd be natural to bring her up, please shut your friends down- its rude that they can think to say to me that you'll never love someone like you love her. You're not with her, you're with me, and for the sake of feeling secure with you I need that to be clear to everyone. Its your boyfriends job to make sure \"his\" people respect you and your relationship- if he can't do that, you guys will have bigger problems down the road. \n\nSorry you're going through this weird stuff, OP- I dont see this as the massively toxic or terrible thing the way many others here seem to, but I still think it'd be crazy weird and I'd be uncomfortable. Your feelings are valid; now you just have to decide if they're something you guys can move past or if it's going to get worse. There's no reason to make yourself feel like second best, ever, and if he can't help you fix that with his words and actions, you may want to rethink how long term this can go. If he can help you figure it out, then I wish you guys all the best :)",

History does repeat, people follow patterns \u2014\u2014 they do, they honestly do\n\nHer letter to you is part of her deep grieving for the break up\n\nHis giving the letter to you, unopened, is part of his total trust and dedication to her\n\nYou can love him, marry him, have children together .......... but she will always be in the background .... and will probably come back.\n\n**Question**: Do you look like her?

That's where I'd be focusing my attention, not on her, not the letter, or that she wrote the letter.",
            "Wow so many jaded people... I gotta disagree with most here. I mean yeah the letter is a little odd but you should 100% kiss your boyfriend not dump him. Here's what I'm getting from your post. 3 years ago your boyfriend was in a very loving relationship but they just couldn't make it work. She for some reason couldn't stay here and he couldn't follow her. That in no way means that they stopped caring for each other. He probably didn't get over her for a long time. His friends probably tried to get him to go on dates and they probably didn't go well. He probably had a fear of falling in love again and put up walls. You started dating him 9 months ago, so 3 years - 9months = 2 years 4 months that his friends saw him not fall in love again. In your early 20's thats a long time. I doesn't surprise me at all that his friends  just got used to him not connecting with women. They saw his relationship end, they probably saw him give up at least to some degree too. So yeah they didn't think he would fall in love again. However just because they thought that doesn't make it true. As for the letter, well simply put it wasn't for you. Both of those letters were for him and he gave you one because he loves you. That's the whole point. His ex wrote those for him because she was leaving and probably wished things could be different. One letter was meant to remind him that he was a great guy that deserves love and the second one was a wish for him to find happiness with someone else. She put a bunch of stuff in there about how to make him happy because she didn't care if your happy, she just wanted him to be OK. The biggest thing that I feel like you and a lot of these other people are missing is that your boyfriend held on to this letter for 3 years AND GAVE IT TO THE NEXT PERSON HE FELL IN LOVE WITH UNOPENED!!!",

He\u2019s not thinking about how this will feel to you because he still has feelings for her (whether it\u2019s love or just positive feelings, they\u2019re still prioritized over you). He\u2019s prioritizing her role in his life by giving you this letter. I don\u2019t think he understands that. His friends are out of line for saying those things to you. However, I think that your bf is probably not acting maliciously, here. He experienced a great love and lost it, and so he feels like she will be always be a part of him.

She is emphasizing that she was his first or true love and that you are second, again a replacement, the giving of advice is like when you train someone to fill your position when you retire from a job. But you are not replacing her, you don\u2019t need to step into her shoes, and her role is separate from yours. They say no two loves are the same. You can\u2019t be for him what she was but similarly she could never just step in or come back and be for him what you have been, what you are for him. She left and you are there. You are the one who is there for him, she is not and that is hugely significant in spite of what they once supposedly had. Every relationship has its flaws and it\u2019s special moments that could only ever belong to you and that person no matter what other moments they have shared with others. It would be a good time to have a conversation about what you value and cherish about each other specifically and leave her out of it. She doesn\u2019t belong in your relationship and you are not her replacement, or second or anything like that. You are there; she is not. \n\nThe other thing concerning is him giving you the letter and his intentions behind that. On its most innocent level he is passing the torch and saying I love you and I choose you. But the way most people do this is by letting the other person go. They usually say I don\u2019t want to be with so and so. I\u2019m done with that. I want to be with you, but by passing the torch he is keeping that flame alive. He is saying I loved her but now I love you you are worthy to be next. And on another level both in his actions and in her advice you are being measured against another person and a previous love. So now you have to ask yourself do I really want to be compared, measured by someone else\u2019s love, do I want to carry this torch and keep this flame alive? And if not how are you going to set your own standard (for yourself and what you want). Additionally what standard is he setting (or rather what is he bringing to the table) in  your relationship together you and him, and that\u2019s the only one that matters. It\u2019s a good time to have a conversation about what you both want together and again that doesn\u2019t have to include anyone else. \n\nAnd if it\u2019s not what you want then it\u2019s a good time to leave that torch on the floor and let the flame burn out because your own extraordinary, unique life and love is worth much more than either of them are giving you credit for. You are your own light \u2600\ufe0f",
            "This guy and his friends are not over the ex. Your comfort is a lower priority than honouring the wishes of his ex girlfriend and that's just not a good look.   \n\n\nI'd be seriously considering his current relationship with his ex. Why is she up on a pedestal? Why are his friends telling you he'll never love like he loved her... how is that ok or appropriate? That alone warrants a serious conversation with him asking why his friends think its ok to tell you that? How rude and insensitive. I'm sorry you're dealing with this :(",
            "I can\u2019t even. I would be so pissed if my BF kept a letter from his ex to give to me. That would make me think he keeps her on a pedestal and isn\u2019t really over her. I\u2019d walk. And all of his friends still talking about her? Rude AF.",
            "For real. Just dump him. *No exes should be involved in a relationship.* This is only going to lead to more problems since everyone is practically worshipping her. You have no control over what others do but you do over yourself. Take yourself out of a situation like that.",
            "This is something this girl should have said when they broke up, and left it at that. Your boyfriend honestly should have gotten rid of it, and not included her in your relationship.",
            "The fact that your boyfriend even gave you the letter is a huge red flag lol. Dump him, he\u2019s obviously still hung up on his ex. Maybe they are meant to be. His friends saying that stuff to you too probably means you aren\u2019t really welcome in their group, which is never a good sign. I don\u2019t see her leaving the letter as a power move tho. I actually think she meant it in the best possible way. The comments are filled with bitter people lmfao. On the other hand tho, I would be offended too if I were the one recovering the letter, but the fact that ur bf gave it to you.... yikes.",
            "They were together years, you guys not even a year yet, it\u2019s alright. I\u2019ve often felt upset about not feeling things with my partner that I felt in the past being with somebody way longer but it all takes time and you don\u2019t even know if you\u2019d really want to marry him anyway so I wouldn\u2019t take it too seriously. I mean they ended up splitting up and they were doing pretty good so I\u2019d say don\u2019t trip a relationship shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously",
            "Warning: Rebound Relationship!",
            "They are not over each other. This letter was to insert herself in your relationship, to make you aware, as if you weren't already, that they didn't broke up because they weren't in love anymore. \n\nIt's like a dog pissing on a tree to mark the territory. I don't think you'll be happy in your relationship if he doesn't move on. The fact that he thought it was ok to give you the letter speaks volumes. You're the third wheel Op.",
            "I can\u2019t believe the dumbass have you the letter. That\u2019s the real issue here. Why? Does he think she still should have influence in his current relationship?",
            "lol dream girl? more like bullet dodged. Who would think its a good idea?",
            "Some people do things like that to feel closure for themselves at the end of their relationship. Maybe it doesnt have much to do with you and more about her. Id forget about it.",
            "Honestly, you should talk to your bf about how you feel. It sounds like this person is overshadowing you, and to me, that's a burden.\nDoes your ex feel anything for her?",
            "This is weird as hell.",
            "This sht is selfish on the ex\u2019s behalf. Breakups are hard but she\u2019s trying to live this sort of novel-esque life when really it\u2019s not about her nor him anymore and shouldn\u2019t be. It\u2019s about you. Fck that letter, do you and build your own relationship with him. This is immature and selfish, to someone else\u2019s satisfaction, her letter really doesn\u2019t have you in mind I promise. It\u2019s for her to please her own feelings.",
            "Honestly, this is all weird. Very weird. Like sappy movie stuff. If he actually kept that for 3 years and gave it to you, he\u2019s got to answer some questions. It\u2019s time to move on, bro."

        "selftext": "Link to my update post: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52r6o3/update_i_28f_literally_just_found_email_after/\n\nMy fianc\u00e9, \"Dale\", and I have been together for 5 years. We are as solid as I guess anyone thinks they are before something like this blindsides them. I am in total and complete shock, I'm just sitting here shaking I can't even cry yet.\n\nDale is at work right now, I haven't texted him or called him or anything at this point. When we got together he had just broken up with his college sweetheart. She was his first love. I was afraid I was rebound, he said that wasn't true I believed him, rest is history. Sorry is this is rushed and all over the place, nothing makes sense in my head right now.\n\nI used his laptop about 2 hours ago to open his contacts list he has saved on there so I could get addresses for our wedding invites. Been telling him to get those to me for over a week so I decided to do it. He keeps his contacts info on his email. When I opened his email, I saw an email on the very top of his inbox with the the subject line \"Re: Jen (not real name), how can I when...\"\n\nThe subject line got cut off after that so I couldn't see more without clicking. \"Jen\" is the name of his ex from college. I sat there for at least 10 minutes trying to decide if I should open it or not. I decided he should have nothing to hide so I did it.\n\nRest of the subject line was \"Re: Jen, how can I when you still exist?\"\n\nThe email was her replying to a string of emails between the two of them that has gone on for over a week. Long story short, Dale is still in love with Jen. He thinks about her constantly, he'll never find another woman like her.\n\nEven worse is that he makes fun of me and she laughs about it. One email she asks him why I don't make him happy and isn't he satisfied with me? I can't remember word for word, and I don't feel like reading it again, but he said something like \"she tries. She's just not good though, way too vanilla. I love her but the only way I can get off is when I think about f**king you and how wet you'd get. I think every inch of my bed was soaked from your pussy I have the biggest hard on just thinking about it.\" And then she answered with a bunch of \"lol\"s and said she felt sorry for the \"poor girl\". Another thing he said was that he made fun of me for having a large scar across my chest, onto my left breast, which has disfigured the nipple a bit. He said it looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands. \n\nThat is almost too much to bear, he might as well have punched me in the gut. I was in an awful car accident when I was a teenager. I had a big piece of dashboard shatter and basically fly into my chest. I almost died. I've never been ashamed of the scar. It's like a constant reminder that I survived something a lot of people don't and I should be grateful to be alive. The slight disfigurement of the nipple doesn't bother me either, I've always had the attitude of \"if someone doesn't want me because of a nipple, f**k them.\"\n\nBut to hear him make fun of something he knows is a result of something so major in my life (my friend was thrown from the backseat and lost her life) is just... I have no words.\n\nThe emails go on. Some are explicit, one she describe how she just masturbated while thinking about how he used to go down on her for hours. I'm assuming that these emails are just a small portion of their contact. The first email in the thread was Dale talking about how he doesn't think he can marry me and that he thinks about leaving me almost constantly. He said if she lived in this state he'd already have left me. It didn't sound like the first time they'd reconnected so I'm guessing if I snooped I'd find texts too. I don't need to snoop further. I've seen all I need to.\n\nObviously I'm not going to stay. Despite what he said about me, I'm pretty great and I know this. He said he misses \"backdoor\". Apparently I'm too vanilla to give it to him. Thing is, I've tried to initiate that as I enjoy it and he told me he wasn't into that. So he lied. Just to cast me in bad light.\n\nI'm so f**king mad I just want to throw his shit into a pile and light it on fire. But I won't. Because I don't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing how much he hurt me.\n\nI'm not sure why I posted here. It's too fresh to talk to my friends and family. Should I just pack my stuff and leave with no explanation? Just ghost? I've got too much dignity to scream and cry in front of him. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I want comfort or advice or what, I just needed someone to know what happened so I don't feel so alone right now.\n\n**tl;dr** fianc\u00e9 made fun of me and sent explicit emails to his ex. Just found them. Heartbroken, angry, hurt, every emotion ever going on. Don't know if I should just ghost him and never see him again or confront him? I need nice words from Internet strangers or something right now.",

Don't answer his calls.\n\nYou can worry about the rest later. There's no point in confronting him. What he said and did was unforgivable. Don't give him the satisfaction of an argument. You'll get through this. Blessing in disguise. What a snake in the grass. Pathetic coward. Do not be there when he gets home or tell him to make different arrangements depending on the housing situation.",
            "Leave and don't look back. You deserve better than this scumbag. The only reason to leave him a note is to tell him that it's not worth trying to get in touch with you. If you have anything together (e.g., joint accounts, a rental agreement, mortgage, whatever), deal with it asap.",

Do you have friends or family you can lean on right now? Get as many people as you can to help you move all your stuff out while he's not there so you can get it done quicker. Cover yourself legally regarding leases and joint accounts, but take care of yourself emotionally first. I'm sorry this happened. ",
            "I'm so sorry, OP. What a spineless asshole. So spineless that I have no doubt he would have gone through with the wedding, so thank god you found out before it happened.

I know you say it's too fresh, but at least go to your parents or best friend and just tell them that it's over - that your fianc\u00e9 horribly betrayed you but you're not ready to talk about it yet. Send him a text telling him it's over, and then block his number until(if) you need to figure out wedding cancelling details. I'd be tempted to include a snarky line about how you're sure his ex can help him out if he needs to go over the reasons why you're through.\n\nOf course, that is just what I would do. Sort of - I probably would tell and scream, but I get why you don't want to. You're clearly a much better person than he could ever hope to be, and I'm so sorry he turned out to be such a jackass.",

(If he's so not into you as he claims, why couldn't he behave like an adult and break-up with you long before he entered into an engagement?)\n\nI don't really have any advice on how to handle this situation because I've never had the misfortune if being in a relationship with someone like this, but I'm simply writing to offer you support and sympathy.

He's about to marry you and the one thing keeping him from the woman he truly loves is that she lives in another state?  FFS.\n\nI wouldn't waste any time dwelling on the negative here.  There are some elaborate, childish revenge fantasies being played out here (seriously, someone actually thinks you should contact the entire wedding party about this?) but unless you think focusing on your ex's shittiness is going to make you feel better, I don't see the point.\n\nIt is interesting that he told his ex he loves you.  Which I'm sure he does, considering he was marrying you even though he still has feelings for his old school sweetheart (but he doesn't love her like he loves you, that's why he was marrying you and not her).  Obviously the fact that he actually loves you and in all likelihood is just using her to play out a fantasy (that probably involves his getting some, \"one last time\") is completely irrelevant.  The fact this conversation took place would be unforgivealbe to me.\n\nBut all of that said, having been through numerous heartbreaking situations in the past, I have without exception felt kind of silly later for spending so much time feeling bad about the dissolution of a relationship.  Because it never does anyone any good. Just keep moving forward.",

Remove all your property even if you have to put it in storage for a while. Block him on all social media. Ghost him. \n\nThese are your priorities.

I screamed, cried, and got myself absolutely shitfaced. Still, the only thing I regret to this day was the way I handled it with his family. In my rage, I told them exactly why I was breaking up with him--in explicit detail. Like you, I found incriminating emails, and I shared details of those emails with his younger sibling. That's the only thing I regret. I absolutely sunk to his level--arguably below his level--and I couldn't take back the texts I sent his family about what I had found. If I could say one thing to myself back then, it would be that I didn't owe anyone, especially his family and friends, an explanation. Remember that. You control the story, and the less you say to his family and friends, the better you'll look in their eyes. \n\nGive yourself time to heal.

So she does have a way to pay back the loans! She\u2019s pretty happy. She\u2019s now engaged to a different guy she started dating ~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. Yes, it\u2019s fast, but they live together with no issues. They aren\u2019t going to start planning a wedding until COVID eases up. She\u2019s less gullible now and more skeptical of her mom\u2019s advice. Her experience really opened her eyes to the consequences of her choices.\n\nTL;DR My friend learned an expensive lesson, but her life turned out okay. She ended up where she probably would have if she didn\u2019t transfer, but $30k in a hole. She\u2019ll be the first to tell you to prioritize your future over a short-term relationship!",

            "Everyone in the last post was right - unfortunately you gotta let people make their own mistakes; it's the only way they learn.",
            "Whew I can relate to your friend, I almost did this TWICE! Once for a boy I was dating my freshman year of college, and then once for a man I was engaged to during the first semester of my PhD. I did not follow through with EITHER and I am very glad because neither relationship ended up working out and I would have, like your friend, been lonely and in more debt! I'm glad her life worked out in the end, but that is quite the lesson to learn!",
            "I think some people just go through life not really learning the underlying lesson that connects all the drama in their lives. \n\nI had a friend at school who would \"fall in love\" over and over. Always with some nightmarishly unsuitable guy. One was writing her from prison, she was mid teens and he was in his 30s. One she met online in the early days of the internet, she actually married him days after she was legally old enough to marry. \n\nWe lost touch not long after that, every time I'd hear from her it's the same. I'm in love with my biology professor. He's 68. I'm 20. We are going to elope. I'm in love with the server at pizza hut. I'm in love with my dad's best friend. Every time it was like NO GUYS I MEAN IT THIS IS THE ONE. \n\nWe are all older now and nothing has changed. Her current husband doesn't work just stays home all day gaming. But, you guessed it, she loves him so...",
            "Glad it worked out, still makes me wince to think about how she'd basically have 30k free if it wasn't for that one guy. Most expensive 1 year relationship ever. :/",
            "$30k+ is a lot for a lesson but at least it was worth it.",
            "The burned hand teaches best. that's for sure",
            "Just saying ...It should be compulsory for throwaways to come back three years later with updates!!! \nThis was great reading.",
            "Oh god. My friend did this about a year ago. She moved to Hawaii and got into an excellent nursing school there. Less than a couple months later she met this boy off of Reddit, flew out to North Dakota to meet him, and never went back to finish school. She just gave birth to a baby boy and both of them have been job hopping and have no car. They just got their own 2 bedroom place",
            "Ladies....never, ever, ever alter YOUR plans and goals to follow a guy. This goes for men as well, but it's not the epidemic it is with women dropping everything to chase love.\n\nKeep in mind that there are people who will do their best to hold you back just for the sake of it. Always put your goals and plans first. Be your own best friend and advocate, because in the end you really are alone and if you don't care about yourself, no one else will.",
            "I\u2019m shocked! /s \n\nThanks for the update, glad she learned her lesson.",
            "I will never understand women who do shit like this for a man. I know I'm being a judgy bitch but honestly I just think it's foolish and sad.",
            "This is an example of why society should stop placing the burden of life-altering decisionmaking on 18-year-olds.  No matter how smart they might be, they still have the brains of adolescents.\n\nYour friend's mother apparently has the brain of an adolescent, too.  Which is not surprising, given how smalltown culture infantilizes women to the point where they don't view themselves as adults.",
            "Lol rip, 30k student loans to be a teacher.",
            "I am glad it's working out for her. I gave up a chance for a full-ride scholarship because I was dumb and had a HS gf and was gunshy about moving half a country away and being lonely. My \"excuse\" I guess would be trauma of being friendless until my last two years of HS, but I really wish I had gone the other route.",
            "Expensive lifelong lesson, no doubt will be feeling that regret forever.\n\nCould be worse, least she didn't get stuck with an unplanned kid.",
            "Damn, I'm so sorry for her -- 30k in debt! I wouldn't want anyone to have that hard of a life lesson.",
            "> Things did not work out between her and her boyfriend. \n\nI, for one, am shocked. Shocked, I tell you!\n\nSeriously though, it sucks that she had to learn this the hard way but there are none so blind as will not see. At least things aren't as bad as they could have been.",

            "... I genuinely only thought people made such painfully stupid decisions in TV shows and rom coms... idk how I feel about humanity right now after reading the comments and seeing that this apparently isn't the exception.",
            "Compared to what's possible to lose, even 30k $ feel like a fair price for such an important life lesson.",
            "She had lucky tbh, there's so many way this could've end up really bad, debt aside she basically did everything she wanted to do.",
            "Is 2 years really considered fast for people in their 20s to get engaged lol",
            "Yo a three years later update. That\u2019s neat.",
            "For everyone else in this situation, even if you can't control it (like lose out on your dream job like I did) - life can and does still turn out ok. Yeah money is nice but finding internal happiness is better (as long as your basic needs are met).",
            "Not to be mean or anything, but people come and go. Scholarships aren't easy to get, I wish I had one, but it's a good thing that it's worked out for her. Just let this be a life lesson for her.",
            "Sometimes you just have to let friends make their mistakes and be there when they fall",
            "I think sometimes we have to make huge mistakes. Maybe it's just to learn a valuable lesson and change your perspective, maybe it's to put you where you need to be. \n\nMy first marriage was very rushed and it gave me some trauma but it taught me so much about myself and how to process anxiety and trauma. If I hadn't married him, I am confident that I wouldn't be where I am now (both physically and locally) and I wouldn't have met my current husband. I wouldn't have my career, I would have never grown in the ways I have. While it was a terrible situation, it was a blessing in disguise. \n\nMaybe the same is true for the friend.",
            "my friend did the same thing.... unfortunately she cut off all of her friends and they\u2019re still dating and she\u2019s not allowed to have social media so i have no idea what she\u2019s up to other than chillin in his moms house in my hometown \ud83d\ude2c",
            "so basically her mom made her acquire student debt just so she could live out a romantic fantasy. What a pathetic excuse for a mother, she basically messed up what could have been an amazing opportunity had she continued going to the college with her full ride.",

            "Just goes to show book smarts and street smarts blah blah blah",
            "Hopefully she learns from this and makes decisions more carefully in the future.\n\n> She\u2019s now engaged to a different guy she started dating \\~2 years ago. They got together right after she moved home. \n\noh.",
            "Well it happen as everyone assumed and it was really stupid for her, now she was 30k in debt and no dude, all alone, but at least she learned her lesson, never put on hold your future for a relationship. A relationship should be an add on, not \"im going to live a different life so i can be with X\" thats just stupid. Im glad it eventually worked out for her.",
            "It's funny how these hard lessons work out.  If her and her fiance go on to live a wonderfully happy life, it's hard to look back and regret any of the steps that brought you to that place.  So while you would council others against making those same decisions, you wouldn't go back and change anything sometimes.  =)",
            "Nooooooo!!!! Put some sense into her!!!",
            "Your friend's mom is an idiot.\n\nThat said, life takes us through strange twists and turns. I'm happy for your friend and her fiance. They might never have met if life didn't turn out the way it did, and regardless, she landed on her feet and is wiser for it. Best education she could've had.",
            "Thanks for the update.  Hopefully this opens the eyes of others.  The BF IMO should have moved schools.  Anyway I am glad she's settled.",
            "My step daughter pulled this BS and is now in debt and has developed bi-polar like traits because of the stress. At least she still has her BF I guess. \n\nWhy are young girls dumb with men?",
            "You shouldn\u2019t be forced to give up opportunity to be with someone. If that person is meant to be in your life they\u2019ll still be there after.",
            "This sounds like it was a great learning opportunity for her. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s with someone else, a steady job, and growing as a person.",
            "Really, it's this kind of story that makes you realize that even though the worst of what was expected happened, your friend turned out ok anyway. Yes, it is an expensive lesson, but those are the ones that usually stick. Best of luck to her.",
            "Somebody at work allowed her daughter to make university decisions so she could be close to her boyfriend. They\u2019d broken up even before the university semester started and she was stuck with a crappy uni. Her mother did nothing to discourage her even though she knew that the likelihood of your first boyfriend being your only and final boyfriend is extremely slim. (The mother herself was three times married, three kids by three different men with plenty of other boyfriends so she was well placed to offer advice to her daughter).",
            "When I read that their relationship didn\u2019t work out, I immediately said, \u201cOf course it didn\u2019t!\u201d It was an expensive but necessary lesson to learn, and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing so well now.",
            "Well she's gonna regret that in the end.\nSad.",
            "a teacher.... rest in peace.",
            "It's so easy to lose friendships with gullible people and their horrible decisions. I've lost multiple over it because their decision was so bad, I managed to lose all my respect for them. I'm glad your friend moved on QUICK and built a good life for herself. Also most importantly, that she respected you and your views about it. \n\nI recently lost a friend due to her toxic relationship. Dude is extremely immature, insecure and therefore controlling af. He has her on a leash and she's just taking it because she's a doormat. Always has been. We've all warned her from **day 1**. A bunch of walking red flags and everything she hated. God knows why she would 'like' what she hates \ud83d\uddff He's also in it for a PR. She already threw away her job, friends and family for this vile being, it'd be a miracle if she woke up before wasting years or, worst, her whole life away >_>\n\nI swear, I've never seen a person double back on everything they've said while growing up and become the epitome of hypocrite within a couple of months. It's even sadder when I know deep down I expected it. Sadly and ironically, she's following her mom's footsteps that she 'swore' she'd never go down :/ Honestly I could go on about all the disgusting things he's said because it's truly shocking and utter trash, but that'd probably need its own post...",
            "I started dating my high school friend/crush second semester freshman year. His school was an hour away, in our home town. I had a full ride and he had a job in the gaming industry. I DID choose to stay local for grad school but I also wanted to be back around my family. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together 22 years, married for 14, with 1 kid, age 11.

The money saved means money they can use elsewhere. Weekend trips or the like. In the end if she goes with BF, even it it works for their relationship long term and beyond.
