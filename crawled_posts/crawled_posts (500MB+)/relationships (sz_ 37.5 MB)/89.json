        "selftext": "We have often argued during our marriage (of 7 years), but resentment has been building this year, along with many stressors. My father passed away at the beginning of 2019. Husband was laid off in April and had a very hard time finding another job. At his new job, I felt he was becoming far too cozy with a secretary and it led to a lot of arguments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday we got into what should have been a minor disagreement. Instead, it's like the floodgates of resentment on both our sides opened and we both just escalated the fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe ended up saying things I don't think can be ever taken back. I know I was saying things that I felt were true but had never really said. I assume he was doing the same. Some of the things that were said:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- he told me I was fat and always miserable and he was far happier at work than at home around me.\n\n\\- I told him other men hit on me and obviously don't feel I'm too fat, and I told him he wasn't nearly hot enough to call me fat.\n\n\\- he told me that I was lazy and boring and that anyone hitting on me was probably just looking for a hook-up and would quickly become turned off by my personality.\n\n\\- I told him that at least I didn't act inappropriately with other men because, unlike him, I am respectful of our marriage and quickly shut stuff down rather than flirting with the office slut.\n\n\\- He said at least she was fun and kind and had a beautiful body, so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she was a nicer person than me and hotter than me.\n\n\\- I told him she could have him because he was a boring, lazy lover anyway and I'm sure after she sampled his \"technique\" she would quickly lose interest.\n\n\\- he then told me he was boring and lazy with me in bed because he found me gross and he's never been attracted to my body and he only has sex with me when he really wants to cum, but he just wants to get it over with quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm ashamed of how we acted. But the nasty soul-crushing things we said to each other -- I'm guessing we can't come back from that, right? I can't imagine having sex with him again now. Is this something that we could work through in counselling? Or should we call it a day and move forward to separate?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr: after months of stress and resentment, a mundane argument exploded into vicious verbal insults between my husband and I where we attacked each other's insecurities....need to know if it's fixable.**",

            "People who love each other very much get divorced all the time because of snowballing resentments and communication breakdowns. If your marriage has any hope of being saved you need to speak with a couples counselor *right now*.",
            "Yeah I don't see how you're ever going to forget that conversation.",
            "Ooof.  I do t think i could ever trust my partner after that.  He basically said he just doesn\u2019t like you as a person, and at least looks wise,  *never really did*.  I just can\u2019t imagine counseling fixing that \u2639\ufe0f",
            "I don\u2019t think I I could come back from hearing those things. Even if you worked it out they will always be in your mind and lingering between the two of you, plus he\u2019s at the least having an infatuation over a coworker, possibly an emotional affair or more, and telling you how great she is and how disgusting he thinks you are. That sounds like it is pretty over to me.",
            "Well, have you both talked after this conversation? Did he seem like he has regrets about this? Do YOU feel like you regret talking to him like this? There is a possibility of reviving the love again, if you both can take a break from each other for some time. Perhaps a few weeks. \n\nYou will need time to reflect on how the experience of being with him has been, OVERALL. And to be able to do that, you will need a break from constantly seeing or talking to him. At the moment, the first memory to cross your mind when you see him, is that conversation you have had. A few weeks of not seeing him or talking to him, might help show you an overall picture of how life was with him. Same for him, if he gets the chance to distance himself from you. The daily routine can harm the relationship when there's something unresolved, of this order. \n\nIt appears you both have gone through major life changes, struggles with the job loss, etc. It can take a toll on healthy, loving relationships as well. \n\nAfter a few weeks, if you still feel like you are unable to gather any compassion towards him, or him towards you, separation might be the next step indeed. \n\nI'm not sure how effective couples counseling would be right away, for all you know, you both may not be in a state where you can exist in the same room for the time being. Couples counseling a few weeks later, will help.",
            "So, this is just my opinion, but if my husband were to comment on someone else's body that way and then went on to describe how disgusting my body was...I could never come back from that. No amount of apologies or counseling could fix that in my head.",
            "I've given this quite a bit of thought and I see 2 possible outcomes...\n\n1. He tells you he didn't mean it, you believe him and stay for the comfort, stay to avoid the pain of leaving... And in a few months maybe a year or so you'll find out he cheated or is cheating. You'll always be suspicious, you'll eventually find out. It will crush you and shatter whats left of your self respect and confidence, if you don't leave then, he'll eventually leave you for someone else, when the time is right. \n\n2. You decide to leave now, getting your things in order to walk with your head held high, you cry, you do therapy, you work on becoming the best version of yourself, you cry some more but you feel less lonely and day by day working on being true to yourself, filling yourself with self love and care, surrounding yourself with supportive and fun people who can laugh at themselves and the world. Go on holiday, be happier alone. One day wake up and realise you're in love... With your life. Then meet someone who loves their life too. \n\nI wish you all the best with option 2.",
            "Holy. Shit. My mouth is on the floor after what I\u2019ve just read.\n\nY\u2019all are NOT coming back from this one. How on earth could you ever look at him the same knowing that he ogles other women because he thinks you\u2019re \u2018fat, lazy and boring\u2019? He\u2019s \u2018never been attracted to you because you\u2019re *gross*\u2019!? And that he\u2019s essentially using you as something to cum in!?!?\n\nPlease - this type of venom doesn\u2019t just come from stress. This is pure hatred and resentment. Do you honestly want to work this out? You\u2019d be better leaving.",
            "One of my friends said \"once you lose respect for each other, there's no turning back.\" If she's right, you guys crossed that line ages ago; this argument simply brought out your harbored feelings. I'm sorry that it took a shocking catalyst for you two. Agree with others - if you both want to try to make it work, a counselor could help. But it has to be both of you who care enough to see what's there to mend.",
            "OP, I feel like this is a clear example and learning point in your life as to why you should never bottle up your feelings in a relationship. This is clearly above all of our pay grades and the best advice you could get was go to couples counseling if you feel like you want to make it work. But it seems like both you and your husband have personal issues you need to work out.",

            "\\>  - He said at least she was fun and kind and had a beautiful body, so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she was a nicer person than me and hotter than me. \n\nI'm never going to be one to ever say I know anything about relationships, as I feel as though I'm not great at communicating, but... That statement right there isn't something someone says to hurt another. Which, when in this type of argument, is understandable to some degree: he insults you, you insult him, he insults you back. Lashing out in that type of scenario is at least understandable...\n\nBut that statement isn't an insult at you. He already did the work of insulting your looks with the prior statement. This statement, to me, says he's either thought of doing exactly what you said - entertaining cheating or adultery - or already has done it. I'm not sure there's any other way to take that.\n\nAs I said, lashing out is normal.\n\n\\>  - he told me that I was lazy and boring and that anyone hitting on me was probably just looking for a hook-up and would quickly become turned off by my personality. \n\nThat is lashing out. \n\n\\>  - He said at least she was fun and kind and had a beautiful body, so when he had to come home to me every night of course he flirted with her at work because she was a nicer person than me and hotter than me. \n\nThat is something far different.",
            "I... could not come back from that, no. \n\nThis became commonplace shit in my ex marriage and I divorced him. Once those boundaries are broken, you can never go back to knowing you'd never disrespect each other like that, because you did. It breaks trust. \n\nIf my boyfriend of 4 years said anything like that, it would be over. We will forgive the occasional \"You're being an asshole!\" Or \"fuck off!\". But such specific nasty cruel stuff could not be forgiven. That level of toxicity is just not right.\n\nYou could try to fix it, but sometimes it's just not worth trying to mend something that's so broken. You only get 1 life as far as I know, it's not worth wasting to try and squeeze yourselves into boxes that don't fit anymore and probably haven't for quite a while.. just because you don't want to give up on a marriage. I mean, you just shouldn't be *capable* of attacking a spouse in such a deliberate abusive way. There should be that thing inside you that makes you hold your tongue and never cross certain lines. Respect and love should preserve that thing inside you. But when people lose respect and lose the love, that type of deterioration becomes obvious. Some people just suck together. You can try to improve it, but in really great and compatible marriages, you don't have to work your ass off in therapy just to treat each other with respect, get along, work towards things together, stay faithful etc.",
            "What he said was a lot worse tbh.",
            "In my experience... probably not. My second husband told me that no amount of plastic surgery would make me attractive to him. From that point forward, his touch made me sick to my stomach. We eventually divorced. Some things just can't be unsaid.",

            "Honestly this is the kind of argument that if you don't walk away, you will have lots of long term trauma to deal with. Will you ever feel comfortable having sex with him? Do you want to always feel like you're his last resort for sex? Do you always want to feel compared to every woman who gives him attention? Those are the types of comments that can cause long term issues and C- PTSD if you keep exposing yourself to the source of stress. Don't let him ruin your sense of self worth just for the sake of preserving a garbage marriage.",
            "Why do you want to fix it?  A lot of people seem to think that saving a marriage is the mature, moral thing to do.  A lot of real shit boiled over here, and while people might exaggerate occasionally when they argue, that degree of shit doesn't come from nowhere.  \n\n\nI know it sucks, and it's very easy to say \"dump him\" to everything, but in this case?",
            "Trust me when I say you can ALWAYS come back from terrible things said but only if you\u2019re BOTH genuine about wanting it to work, that\u2019s why people have emotional affairs (what your husband is on his way to doing). It sounds as if your responses were to counter what HE was saying. You seem to have enough self awareness that what you said was mean spirited and by asking reddit how you can fix you\u2019re already doing the leg work to get back on track but what\u2019s your husband doing to fix this unstable foundation of your relationship? He\u2019s flirting, he\u2019s disrespecting you by hitting you right in your Insecurities whom as your spouse should be the last person to use what he knows against you. Does he complain a lot and not share much *good news*? Does he go out of his way to compliment you or does he simply point out your flaws? What does your husband do that you couldn\u2019t  do yourself? What does HE bring to the table that makes him an positive addition to your happiness? Based on this one post it seems he\u2019s gotten comfortable in the knowledge that he has you under his foot and you\u2019re more than happy to keep licking it or give him a swift kick to the shin and get yourself from under it. My real question is, does he respect you? A man who degrades a woman as a glorified cum rag doesn\u2019t respect her.",
            "I met my husband when we where 16. We have had really stupid and loud arguments where we have both said things we regret. He called me Medusa, because I never fix my hair. I have called him stupid and an idiot on several occasions.. but the statment about him never being attracted to you or loving you or whatever.. the part about just having sex with you to cum.. I'm way to insecure because that would haunt me everytime I looked into his face. I would continuously doubt his attraction to me for the rest of our relationship unless there was a HUGE change. Like literally 360, try every new, different thing there is to restart a damaged relationship through therapy and whatever else. If it doesnt look like that's the effort both of you want to put in, I would just call it quits. \n\nI'm so sorry that you had to have an argument like this. I think it's a little more than just a few months of tension though..",
            "This wasn't just insults, he admitted to emotionally cheating on you",
            "Did you both mean those things or did you say them in the heat of the moment to be hurtful? Neither is good, but if you were \u201cjust\u201d fighting dirty you can learn to fight clean and come back.\n\nBUT only if you both have the interest and energy to do the work of change. If you do, see a counselor ASAP and be prepared for a significant commitment of time and energy.\n\nSource: husband is a licensed psychologist who does a lot of couples work. I know he could work with this if the couple really wanted to save their marriage.",
            "No kids in this relationship? Then peace out, it\u2019s over. Anyone who admits flirting with someone they find attractive and uses your unattractiveness as the reasons by will cheat given any opportunity and has no respect for you and certainly not his marriage. You, as it seems you already know, can do better. Good luck!",
            "OP what you said isn't that bad. You were mostly defending yourself from his insults. You did criticize his lovemaking technique but that's something he could work on, it's not a core part of his personality necessarily. \n\nBut when he attacked you, he attacked your entire being. Called you horrible things and admitted that he treats you more poorly than other women on purpose. He admitted to wanting to cheat, but lets be honest, he already did emotionally cheat and maybe physically too, that's why you've been fighting this entire year. \n\nHe is toxic. He admits to hating you and everything about you, cheating on you, in the same year as your parent dying no less, and he doesn't even try to pleasure you in bed. He's actively destroying everything nice in your life. Your life, but not his. He gets to screw the hot secretary all he wants, no consequences, and then come home and insult you to make himself feel better. \n\nStop letting him destroy your life. Walk away amd and you'll instantly realize how much happier you are without him.",
            "I mean do you personally feel that you could salvage the relationship? If both want to then anything is possible but it\u2019s going to take a whole lot of work to get at what caused that much resentment to build in each of you",

He doesn't respect you, tbh doesn't sound like he loves you either.  Maybe, MAYBE think about working through it if he was just saying those things to hurt you, and not actually true. However, I think you should leave this relationship.Wish you all the best no matter what happens <3",
            "It kind of seems like you want permission to end it, like you need confirmation that you\u2019re not stupid for divorcing. Wanting to leave is enough! That argument is the cherry on top.",
            "Yeah not only do I not see a way back from that I don't know why you would want to go back... he is insulting and practicality told you he's interested in cheating on you...\n\nhope you don't have kids because you don't want to stuck to him anymore \n\nOff hand if you are sad and depressed you might need counseling",
            "I see a lot of viciously toxic comments on both sides here, and I understand that OP may, unconsciously or otherwise, be making herself out to be less bad here (But why bother at this point?). \nBut damn, if that fight was a boxing match, he beat her down to a bloody pulp, punched the referee out, and then kept going on her after the match. Everything she said was intended to do damage, but she could barely get a punch in. All of it was weak blocking.  OP, if you are reading this: He RIPPED you apart. It sounds like he'd only stop pissing on you if you were on fire. That is the most cruel shit I can imagine saying to someone. \n\nHe says your body disgust him and always has, He's literally using you as a cum dumpster.\nHe hates your personality\nYou bore him to tears while being the laziest piece of shit\nHe wants to cheat on you with a specific person, that you know, compares you to her, and makes sure to list all the qualities she has that you do not. \n... how? How can you even look at him?",
            "If this is really how you feel about each other, why would you want to come back from this? You both sound miserable and resentful of each other.",
            "Wow. I'm not quite sure where to start with this.\n\nFirst question, why are you together?\n\nIf my partner and I talked like this to each other, even during an argument, I'd be questioning why I was with someone who would talk to me like that and even thinking that I was fat, lazy and boring in bed. And, let's be honest here, I'd be packing a bag and leaving to do some pretty serious navel gazing to figure out if this relationship was worth saving and if I actually wanted to save it. And when you figure out what you want, sit down and have a very open and honest discussion with him about what he wants.\n\nYou guys need to learn to communicate better, you can't have a relationship without communication. Even the small resentments should be aired when you have them. Letting things build leads to things like this, where you wonder if there's anything to come back to.\n\nSo the question is, do you want to still be with him? Do you still actually love him and want to work on the relationship? Does he?\n\nIf you're both saying yes then go to couples counselling and learn how to talk to each other. This step is super important. Whether you stay with him or leave. You'll get a wealth of information that you can take with you into future relationships that won't end up with a volcano eruption of emotional shit like this...",
            "I just want to say I've been there, and the comments about the body are the worst. It's like when men have nothing else to say they attack your body. I don't know if it is fixable, however what I do know is that it can't hurt to try and fix it through counselling. If it's fixable through counselling... great; if not at the very least, you get more insight into yourself and your relationship patterns.",
            "I feel like most of that came from his side, that was very one-sided. \n\nHonestly even if he does apologise I don't think I would ever be able to forget about it. I wouldn't want to be with someone who can be so hurtful.",
            "TBH the stuff your husband said sounds worse. Doesn't sound like he has any respect for you.",
            "Honestly, after attacks that personal and ugly, I don't think there's any coming back. You both have to WANT to fix this. There's no room for \"maybe if\" or \"I don't know\". You both have to be 100% sure that you want to be together because unless you both really commit to each other and some serious therapy it's pretty much a moot point. In highly emotional moments, we tend to let out our most personal thoughts good or bad, and this time it was for the worst. After reading what you both said, I would be hard-pressed to believe either of you if you said none of what you said was what you really thought about each other, because no one gets that nasty with someone they love just to hurt them, there has to be some truth to it.  \n\n\nYou let a toxic moment make you both be honest in the most toxic ways. The damage that's been done is going to be hard to fix unless you both can put it behind you and get help, but can either of you honestly say you can fully put it behind you bc I sure as hell wouldn't be able to.",

This should have been over when the affair started. I've been married the same amount of time as you guys, me I cannot imagine putting up with any of what you describe. And he is pretty much saying he is going to continue cheating with her. Just lawyer up, already.",
            "Oof. That's awful, but I've seen marriages survive worse. The biggest issue here is a lack of respect from both of you. I believe reconciliation is possible, but will be difficult and only possible if you both want it & are wrong to work hard.",

No one deserves to hear that from someone who's supposed to love them. Honestly sounds like emotional abuse to me.\n\nIf I was you I'd get out now while it's like this and you're young, it will make moving on a lot easier.\n\nEdit: me and my partner of 5 years have had some extreme lows and almost finished things before. Because of mental illness on both sides there have been lots of screaming matches and intense anger. With work we sorted our problems and I'm very happy we did. However, neither of us have ever said anything as cruel as this, never. If he had said these things to me we would have been over instantly. That amount of contempt to destroy a person's self worth in every capacity is deeply wrong. Not only is he a horrible husband but he's a horrible person. You deserve so much better!",

            "He basically just admitted to you that your concern over him having an affair is completely warranted.  I say for that reason alone this isn't salvageable.  If he isn't already having an affair, he will, because he feels justified in doing so.  I wouldn't bother with that mess.",

Iv forgiven him but i still don't know of he truly meant it or if it was just the anger and the alcohol.  And we have had 7 good years! But those words still linger.  \n\nCan you live with those words in your head for the rest of your life with this man? You guys may forgive each other but forgetting is another thing.  You can't just unsay those things.  Even if you both grow to truly regret it you can't just make those things go away, they might always be in the back of your mind when you look at each other.  \n\nSorry if that sounds bleak but that's just my personal experience.",
            "Uhh... yeah some of the things you said were mean, but what the actual fuck from what he said. This man clearly wants to sabotage the relationship and have you end things. I understand you\u2019re married, but you don\u2019t come back from saying those things to your spouse. How do you ever have intimacy with him again?",

            "If you are both willing to fix it there are things you can both do to make that happen. BUT, the question is, do you want to stay with a person who can go that dark and attack your appearance (low blow) and your personality when he\u2019s supposed to be the person who knows and loves you the most in the world. It sounds like you deserve better and as painful as divorce can be, imagine how wonderful being in a healthy relationship would feel. If he wants to fix things and so do you you will both go to extreme lengths to fix it. It looks like you are reaching out for help, but he is turning away and giving up.

            "As a girl who recently got a divorce, this post makes me so sad for you. He basically told you that he isn\u2019t attracted to you emotionally, mentally, or physically (nor has he ever been). He has sex with you quickly if he really wants to cum. He fully admitted he uses you we a sex toy, which, is not ok and is mentally damaging. Trust me. I still have nightmares from this same aspect in my own toxic marriage. I couldn\u2019t even see how much it had messed me up until I got out of it and found it still popping into my head at night. I was so scared of getting a divorce.  But here\u2019s the only advice I can give you to think about if it\u2019s right for you:\n\n1. Would you ever support a friend of yours being in a relationship the way yours is now? Would you want them to fix it or want them to leave? It can be hard to see how bad things really are sometimes when it\u2019s yourself.\n\n2. Make a pros and cons list of leaving. After doing so, take a look. It\u2019s not about how many points you have in either column\u2014what makes up the columns? Do the reasons for staying have to do with who he is as a person? Or are they fears about a drastic life change and fond memories? Honestly, the latter shouldn\u2019t be worth as much.\n\nIs he as a person worth going through all this crap to solve? Or is it a lot of work that doesn\u2019t seem to be worth much? I knew what answer I wanted to hear from people, but was terrified of doing it and changing my life. I was thinking more about if I could stand having a life in that marriage forever than if I actually wanted it. Just good luck. I know you\u2019ll find a way to be happy somehow.",

            "It sounds like you're both done. \n\nI can relate. I was in a 3 year relationship and we just didn't mesh in the end. Looking back, I can see that. I couldn't see it so clearly at the time. I had my minor issues with him but I really did love him. \n\nHowever, I was going through a really stressful event. I wasn't emotionally at my best. I was sleep deprived, stressed out, my apartment was in ruins because of the issue and I was trying to fix the problem in 110 degree heat. I know I played a role in escalating the fight that happened. Under normal circumstances I'd have just walked away and talked about things later. I didn't that night. \n\nI was emotional and he got on me about how I'm \"always\" having a crisis and how I \"always\" rope him into it and how I \"never\" trusted or appreciated him and all these other absolutes that I felt were completely untrue. \n\nIn the end I was just like \"Well, if that's how you feel, go find someone you like\". \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nMaybe we could have repaired things. I honestly don't know. But apparently he was a poor communicator, had been hiding issues from me for whatever reason and I felt then and still feel he was WAY over generalizing. If I forgot to say \"thank you\" for something ONE TIME then I \"never\" appreciated him. If I questioned ONE THING he said or did then I \"never\" trusted him. He had been holding onto all these problems and resentments I never knew about and guess what..... at that point I DIDN'T trust him anymore. \n\nI felt he wasn't being honest with me in the relationship. That he was just killing time and faking his way through because he was afraid of being alone. That he wasn't giving me a fair opportunity to correct or explain anything because he wasn't telling me there WERE any problems upsetting him. \n\nSome things you can't walk back. \n\nPeople are saying you can work through this with counseling if you both want to. I'm not so sure. You've both stated a lack of attraction and a loss of trust in the marriage. He said he's NEVER been attracted to you. Counseling can't fix that.

            "My ex-wife and I had some terrible arguments where we said really mean shit to each other.  It was really immature and sadly that is where we ended up.  But others do as well.  My ex-wife and I did not make it because we were incompatible.  The name calling came out of a communication breakdown and a contempt that arose over 4 years together.  That contempt came from us blaming one another for anything that went wrong individually and from our frustrations caused by our incompatibility.  But in hindsight the name calling was not near as bad as the contempt that built over time.  It was part of it but we stopped being partners and became roommates and then adversaries.   The name calling did not really bother me but it really bothered her.  But being adversaries was what she wanted and I wanted to be true partners.  I now understand that after awhile a marriage needs kindness to prevail.  There arguments should be civil and the name calling held as thoughts or vented to a therapist or trusted friend.  But I know couple who have nasty verbal arguments from time to time and have been together for years and are compatible partners.  They have these arguments in private for the most part and they always kiss and make up.",

In doing so, my interpretation is that you were hurt by his comments and you're also worried about his feelings being hurt meaning you want to come back from this. Unfortunately, it looks like you're asking for help on how to come back from this from a sub of jaded people who have bitter feelings towards their past relationships.\n\nMarriages are hard, and almost every single one of them hits at least one major crux where it seems like everything is crashing down and you have to choose to work together to make it work. My parents went through a whole lot of resentment towards each other and the solution they came up with is that they would hold hands and go for a walk every day together. Even if they were upset, mad, frustrated or didn't want to talk to each other they would do it. If it was raining, snowing, too cold or whatever, they would sit on the couch and hold hands watching TV for like an hour. \n\nThey came to that solution because similar to love languages, every person has a unique \"fight language\".

It would be one thing if he said he has not been physically attracted to me in a while, but the fact that he said that he has NEVER been attracted to you? And to add on to that, he went to insult your personality as well. From what you have stated the fight looked like, he was also a lot harsher with you than you were with him. Up until the very last comment, you were defending yourself until you snapped and insulted him as well. While your comments consisted of \"you're not hot enough to insult me\", \"I respect our marriage, but you don't\" and escalated to \"you're a lousy lover and you're bad at sex\", his consisted of repeatedly calling you fat, saying you make his life miserable, saying he's happier when he is away from you, calling you boring and lazy, saying that you're not attractive enough for him or any other man outside of quick sex, gross, admitting that he'd flirt with other women since he has to come home to you, and saying he has never been attracted to you. \n\nI, personally, would leave him and focus on myself. For example, he said he feels like you're always miserable. If I were you, after leaving him I would find a therapist and work with them on becoming a happier version of myself. If his comments about your body and weight bothered you, I'd take this as an opportunity to work on that.",

This is no reason to cheat, this is a reason to break up/ divorce so he probably wants to end this relationship but doesn't have the guts. I mean, i'm just assuming. I can't know better.

I think there\u2019s a lot to uncover and think about here. Do you two want to fix it and why? Out of love? Or routine, fear or the like? I\u2019d get professional support for this and take it slow.

Basically that resentment that you're talking about stems from poor communication, you touched on topics but never resolved them so instead they got swept under the rug to add up into this colossal fight you just had. \n\nResentments are like poison, if you don't address them they kill the relationship to the point where you just hate the other person. \n\nThat out of the way, the dirty fighting you did was some Grade A stuff, you both said some deeply impactful things that neither of you are bound to move past. From now on you'll just think he looks at you and see's a disgusting fat, boring, cum depository and he looks at you he'll think he sucks in bed so why even try. \n\nFrankly of the two of you he said some worse shit but both of you ripped each other down here, it's over. You'll never be happy even if you went to couple counselling because you guys went for the gut and said all the things you think but never say, the good news is that you guys thought these things but didn't say them so this was over before you fought. If you actually think that about someone you don't trust or even like them that much, they do make you miserable and you're just hanging on because leaving is scary. I'll let you in on a secret though, leaving will make you both much happier in the long run then this relationship together ever did.\n\nIn the future you should work on saying what bothers you more quickly, having a clear conversation about it and when you're both resolved on the topic you put it to bed where it no long affects how you look at that person. You never bring up something that is resolved in a future fight because it's been hashed out so there's no reason to, if you see yourself bringing stuff up then it means it wasn't properly resolved for you the first time around. You just have to learn how to get better at tactful confrontation and effective communication so resentments don't happen at all.",

However, you are surviving, and I am proud of you for that. \n\nPeople who truly love each other can become so stressed and resentful that terrible things are said. They may seem real in the moment, but a lot of the time things are said out of spite to piss the other person off. It\u2019s not right, but anger really can make a person do and say dumb things. If you are going to work this out I would refrain from talking about issues until you both have calmed down. \n\nI do hope he realizes that belittling you, making negative  comments about your physical appearance, or your general mood will not make it better. Nothing he said would make me want to change for the better. It would in fact make it much much worse. \n\nSo instead of watering his own garden he talks about other people\u2019s and how much better they are. Has he ever thought about those other people? And how they probably have supportive people in their life that help them keep their garden looking nice? Does he think he can constantly shit in the same place he is supposed to flourish? He needs a reality check. \n\nYou suffered a loss this last year, meaning that this was your first holidays without your loved one. That shit is hard. He is lacking in empathy and compassion. God forbid you\u2019re not in a good mood 24/7. No one is. You had a hard year. There is no room for his two cents bc they don\u2019t matter. \n\nGod I\u2019m sorry. I can see why you are so resentful. I usually try to see both sides, but man, he is doing this to himself by throwing a pity part for HIMSELF and directing his attention elsewhere. You can\u2019t fix things you don\u2019t direct attention towards. So he obviously doesn\u2019t see his responsibility in the issues. He\u2019s choosing to ignore the life he has built with you. He is avoiding it then blaming you. \n\nInstead of offering up solutions, he is shifting the blame and feeling sorry for himself. It\u2019s up to you what YOU want to do. And it\u2019s up to him.

I broke up with him after feeling like we were destroying each other. We both spent a month praying and thinking. We realized how terrible we were to each other and that we hadn\u2019t made the decision to love and that decision has to be made every day, always. It\u2019s weird but once I made that decision, I stopped focusing on his faults and we started working as a team. Once the option to leave was off the table, instead of feeling trapped we both felt better and more loved. For us, realizing that God was in charge and had to be at the center of our relationship made all the difference. The resentment healed and respect and love came back. I don\u2019t know what your beliefs are but this is what worked for us. We no longer say negative things about each other to anyone. If you know in your core that the other person loves you and has your back, it makes all the difference. You both need to decide if you want this and you both have to do it.",
            "Reposting for OP:\n\n\nJust ended an almost 8-year long relationship (<2 years engaged) due to similar reasons as OP. Equally damaging things had been said earlier in the relationship and we thought we were working on it. Over time, resentment built up to the point where my libido took a significant downturn. Started couples therapy to address what i assumed to be primarily communications issues. We worked on it for a few months, but life didn't stop. Other terrible things (outside the relationship) happened that limited our progress. Ended up having another fight more recently, typically over stupid shit. That killed my hope for the future and I ended it. Of course, with me ending it (to her, seemingly out of the blue), I am essentially made the villain. But I tried to stand by my decision - tried to renege on it 3x, but luckily she was too hurt and angry to reconsider. Else, we would be back at square one, with the addition of significantly more resentment, having ended our engagement. \n\nSo, to OP...I'll echo what's been said - if one party isn't willing to work for it. It doesn't matter how much work you put in. I'm only 31 and consider myself relatively young. Life is simultaneously too short AND too long to continue being miserable. Especially since you mention frequent arguments. I speak from experience when I say...those arguments and style of fighting typically does not get better. They may become less frequent with **a lot** of work, but in my experience (hopefully not yours), once that seal is popped, it's only a matter of the gravity of the argument before potentially worse things are said. \n\nI was lucky to be pre-nuptial. Our break up is decidedly less messy than it could be. \n\nWe still very much love each other, and I hope we can remain in each others' lives to some degree but life doesn't always work that way. I ended it *because* I love her and myself. And truthfully, it seemed like the damage had significantly accumulated to the point where I saw /r/DeadBedrooms in our future.

            " A happy and positive marriage is a team that works together in life to bring joy to the lives that they share with one another. The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thought images. All thoughts are illusions or mental constructs and the best thing that you can do for yourself and your partner is to eliminate the negative mental constructs, and fill your mind with positive objects of thought. I like the French philosophical view that thoughts are like animals that travel into our minds. Eliminate the bad animals and nurture the good animals (like cats). Once you both eliminate the negative thoughts, the rest of your experiences will naturally evolve and gravitate into positive and joyful happenings based on the positive thought images that you both have in the life that you share together.",

Sit down and talk about it once you both calm down. Come up with a strategy to avoid future fights escalating to that point. Maybe you just leave the room and stay away from each other for 15 minutes. One thing you can\u2019t do is try to one up each other with insults with the intention of hurting the other one. That\u2019s basically what happened, and odds are neither of you meant what was said. But you need to talk through it. \n\nTalking to a counselor wouldn\u2019t mean your marriage is failing. It means you both care and want to figure out a way to make things work. If you separate over a fight like this you might as well stay single, because shit happens. Marriage is a learning process that is ongoing. You will be challenged at times.",

Take the hard criticism and fix what you can on your end. This takes a lot of honesty to yourself. Those things he said about you - you at some level felt them to be true. And you know what you said to him was true on a very deep level.\n\nThese sort of fights are highly cathartic. They're a hard reset for the relationship. If you both decide your want to continue, then do it and do better than you have.",

            "It sounds like you could both use some therapy and guidance on how to have productive conflict and communication skills. Bottling up all of these emotions I'm sure you have both felt has obviously lead to a melt down. Seven years is a good amount of time and I'm sure there is a lot to hold on to there. It's never good to call each other names during an argument and that definitely shows that it has gone too far. I would look into Therapy they can help guide you through conflict and repair any damage that has occurred. You can come back from anything if you work to repair it. It's all a choice of what you both want to do. Everytime you have an unsuccessful argument that's not fully resolved the relationship becomes more and more \"not worth it\" because you feel your needs aren't meet or you aren't being understood. If you keep having these types of conflict you will both be pushed there. Seek help now! It's okay to ask for help most of us weren't shown proper communication or conflicts during childhood. I know I wasn't! Best of luck! \ud83d\ude01",
            "OK, settle down. As an old wife (hitting our 40th anniversary this month!), you need some perspective. You were both childish. That's forgivable, as you're both under stressors. You both said some really ugly, below the belt things. Well, honestly, most couples do that a time or two.\n\nThere are key words to watch out for. \"Well, at least I never...\" is a common one. Eliminate that kind of talk. Be partners, not competitors.\n\nBe very careful with the words \"always\" and \"never\". Remember, you NEVER do BAD. You ALWAYS do GOOD. That's the pattern for spouse speak. \"You always remember to kiss me good night, and I love that, darling!\"  \"Dear, you never forget to take the trash out. You're always my hero.\"  Always good, never bad. Remember that. \n\nCan you fix this marriage? Absolutely. Grow up. Stop being petty to each other. Apologize. Mean it when you say you're sorry, and show that by never doing that thing again.\n\nSpend your energy more prudently. Look for the good in each other. Admire each other. Accept each other just as you both are. Gained weight? More of you to adore. Long hours at work? In so proud of how hard you work to provide for our happy home.\n\nIt really is this simple. Respect each other, respect yourselves, spend cheerful times together, don't miss opportunities to hush up at critical times, flirt with each other.\n\nYou will forget this fight. Focus on each of you fixing your own part in this, and on how wonderful this person who married you is.\n\nAnd pray together.",

            "Such childish arguments for adults.

You will come back from this but most likely end up having even worse arguments because a line has been crossed.",
            "This is what emotional repression and resentment looks like. It's not fixable, imo.\n\nAlso, there is no way on earth to assume OP is the \"good one\" here. She may be a horrible person and we don't have any idea of what version of the truth we are getting. But looking topically at the type of things said here - they are no longer respecting each other on a basic level.",
            "Love can conquer anything. If you both still love each other and WANT to try to work it out - that's all it takes. \n\nOne night I was really really drunk and had been angry all day regarding a friends GF who neglected her child all day. On our way home I finally let out all my frustration I had been holding in. When we were walking in the door my (now) husband tripped and fell into me. I don't know what happened because I blacked out. I woke up with him on top of me on the bed trying to take my engagement ring. I thought he was beating me... We talked the next morning and I learned I snapped when he fell on me and I started beating the hell out of him. \n\nI had a busted knuckle, my hand had swelled to twice the size and was purple and black just 10 minutes later. He had a bruised rib, bruises on his face along with scratches. He flinched anytime I came near him for months after. I honestly thought there was no way we could come back from that. We have been through a lot together and I immediately started going to counseling. \n\nI have never in all my 32 years had any sort of violent tendencies, drunk or not. Turned out the woman triggered my repressed childhood feelings towards my mother. I spent a year in counseling. Now, it's been 1.5 years since it happened and we are married, expecting our first child and are still very much in love.\n\nAgain, its how much you love each other, if you are BOTH capable of forgiving what was said and you want to move forward together vs. apart. If you honestly don't think you can get over what he said or he can't get over it then it won't ever work because it will just become another tool in your arsenal when you argue in the future.\n\nAlthough, I have to admit - the things you guys said to each other - more so the manner in which you said it - sounds to me like you don't communicate and share your feelings with one another. No relationship can survive without proper communication.",
            "If these are true then maybe it's not right to plod on...\n\nI mean on a positive, it should probably inspire both of you to take care of your health better (if actually fat/overweight).",
            "What do you want? Do you want to fix it? If so, you and your husband need to sit down and talk. Maybe with a mediator. It's good you two got your frustrations out. Could've done it more constructively though. Sometimes, actually most times, long term relationship have giant potholes in the road. They can always be worked through, if you want to. \n\nY'all both said some pretty destructive stuff. But the truth is, you two have started to take each other for granted. It'll take time to get over this for sure, but if you want to hold on to poorly worded truths said in anger to have a reason to leave that's what you'll do. You two need to communicate your issues in real time and not let them build up to bombs. These all sound like minor issues. If you don't see yourself or your husband wanting to fix it, then you must part ways.",

It was in anger and full of resentment.\n\nYou *do* need to talk about the things that are breeding the resentment.  Either on your own or with a counselor, but you guys need to have a honest conversation. \n\nI've been married to the same woman for 34 years. We have both have said things that were harsh to each other. If there is honest effort and commitment then doesn't that deserve forgiveness?  It's not about just forgiving someone and sweeping the problems back under the tug. It's about deciding, with your partner, that you're going to work on the issues and move forward together. \n\nThe first step is to forgive each other...\n\n\n\nI'm an old man and this is just my opinion.",
            "Hey you  okay? I think atleast you talked out. Maybe try talking about it with him again? Start with a sorry and see how he reacts.",

It\u2019s really a thing. \n\nMarriage doesn\u2019t have to be over just like that \n\nMarriage is hard work. \n\nLove isn\u2019t a feeling it\u2019s an act of will and constant effort to act in love and then feel in love.",
            "This might go against the general reddit bs but your situation is interesting\n\nRight off the bat- you married this man or a reason. You love him, or love some part of him, and you are worried in some aspect about your relationship. Hopefully he feels the same way...\n\nBecause the way I see it, you both gave as good as you got. You both brought some actual, real life, *addressable* problems in your relationship to the surface. That's why I think this fight is a good thing- it's not like you each attacked immutable characteristics or deeply ingrained personality quirks, but you both brought to light issues that are causing resentment, issues that can be fixed.\n\nCounselling is a bad idea, IMO. Marriage counselors have a disgustingly abysmal success rate. I think you'd be better off having the same argument you had with your husband, but in a more controlled and less emotional way. Follow the threads to the root of the problem and then work together to brainstorm solutions to those problems. The hard part is going to be not getting wrapped up in the negative feelings it's going to bring out in both of you. I don't want to *blame* anyone, but this fight seems like the culmination of months or years of unresolved problems that were too sensitive to address out in open, so they fester. Gotta pop the pustule, you know?\n\nMight just be your husband needs to manage his stress better or that you need to do some intermittent fasting. Or both, or whatever.

            "I really don't think that there is no going back after this. Maybe you said nasty things to each other but these things don't have to be life-changing...\n\nWhat you both said could come out of ego and probably just tried to hurt each other. That actually shows that you care. If you were completely indifferent towards each other, then I would say that you're right. But from what you've described, it sounds like to highschool students trying to hurt each other but deep inside they want each other, lol.\n\nAnyways, maybe now you're hurt, but if you want to fix your marriage you should work hard and go to consulting. I'd be worry more about the big picture and that resentment that you've mentioned than the things that both of you said to each other.",
            "Words hurt, which is why we hurl them at each other when resentment and anger and frustration have built up to the point that everything explodes. But they\u2019re just words. You can choose to hold on to them and build more resentment, or you can choose to let them go and try to rebuild the relationship.  The last year has destroyed your relationship to the post that your husband would rather be at work than at home. That\u2019s not abnormal.  The secretary isn\u2019t the problem, she\u2019s the symptom.  He attacks how you look because it\u2019s a lot easier to say \u201cshe\u2019s skinny and you\u2019re fat\u201d instead of \u201cshe\u2019s nice and I don\u2019t have to think about all the pain and grief of the last year and I miss when you used to talk to me like that.\u201d\n\nMy advice: go apologize to him. Tell him you both need counseling because it\u2019s been such a rough year. And then tell him all the things you love about him. Even if they\u2019re buried under all that pain, tell him the things you love about him. Tell him all the things you appreciated over the last year. And see where that goes.",

            "This is going to sound SO sexist, but why are you taking your anger out on your husband?  Are you not able to control it?\n\nMy wife is going through a similar thing right now, and has been for the past couple years.  Father passed away.  Job responsibilities and stress have increased.  I've been supportive, but every weekend has been the same.  She over indulges on alcohol, and then picks a fight with me.  Once or twice she has initiated physical contact with me, and I physically pushed her away or defended myself.\n\nSo, at some point, I just demanded that she get ahold of her shit, stop taking her anger out on me, or she can leave - because I do not want to be with a person who truly believes what she was yelling at me - and I wasn't going to put up with it anymore.\n\nThings have calmed down for us over the past couple months, but we haven't been intimate for a couple years now because of this.  We're not where we were when we got married ten years ago.   Nothing is for sure yet with us, but I'm cautiously optimistic, and just now am able to approach her without wincing.",
            "This is absolutely recoverable. You cant suppose that everything said here is as true or important as it sounded- you both were trying to cut one another down and were succeeding. Whats important is whether or not you want to be together. Nows the time to remember that- if you dont want that, its over.  But you need to address these disatisfactions, because right now both of you seem to feel justified to dislike one another. Maybe its not balanced between the two of you but you\u2019re both involved in it. You can definately see a counselor together to help fix these problems.",

        "selftext": "Hi Reddit. A little while back I wrote here for advice. [Here is my initial post](https://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/73kzs8/me_33f_and_my_husband_34m_together_for_10_years/). I didn\u2019t expect it to be nearly as big as I thought it would be. I went into it trying to reply to everyone, because I expected a handful of comments. I tried replying to as many of you as possible but I did miss some, I\u2019m sorry! Besides a particular comment that accused me of sexually assaulting my husband (which has since been deleted) most of you guys really had helpful responses and anecdotes. I really appreciate that everyone took time out of their day to read through my post and give me advice.\n\nOn to the update. This feels a little messy, because I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts, and I apologise. But this update did not go as I expected. A commenter said that it sounded as if my husband directing his emotions about unrelated issues onto me. I replied to be polite, but honestly kind of put it out of my mind. My husband has never really done anything of the sort, and I had no reason to suspect he would do that now. Well, turns out that commenter is clairvoyant.\n\nIt turns out my husband\u2019s mother has been diagnosed with a medical issue and does not have very long to live. She was initially in the hospital about 2 weeks before my post, which I knew. What I didn\u2019t know is that the doctors found some things that gave her a very short life expectancy; they weren\u2019t sure what the problem was, but they knew what the problem would lead to. I, and my husband's siblings, were told it wasn't a big deal.\n\nMy MIL didn\u2019t want any of her kids to know until she was diagnosed properly with the real source of her issues. My FIL went against her wishes and told my husband, who convinced my FIL not to tell any of his other children. He also didn\u2019t tell me, out of respect for his mother\u2019s wishes, until a couple of days after my post. \n\nSo obviously my husband had been going through a *lot* of emotional things, that he didn\u2019t share with me out of respect for his dying mother. He felt he couldn\u2019t disrespect her wishes after his father already did, so his worry and his inability to lean on me for support culminated in him struggling emotionally, which led to our minor argument.\n\nWe have been discussing that our communication suffered  \u2013 and that it led to the conversation about which I asked for advice. That really hurt, and isn\u2019t a good habit to have in a relationship. My husband had never done anything like this before, and he was quick to own up to responsibility about this. We\u2019ve mostly been dealing with my MIL and trying to make her comfortable and happy, but we have spoken a little about what my post was about. As I said in my post, usually my touching wasn\u2019t \u2018too much\u2019 for him at all. But if my touching is just too much right now because of everything else going on, that still needs to be addressed. My husband admitted that he usually loved it, but right now it felt like he was being overloaded with *stuff* and my touching contributed to that. He also admitted that he didn\u2019t communicate that properly. We agreed that my husband would practice being more upfront and immediate about any discomfort I might bring if I helped him along by more regularly asking boundary questions when I *do* touch him, which I will of course be reigning in until he communicates that that can change.\n\nWe ended up agreeing that diversifying the way we show love would never be a bad thing. I showed him my post and we want to look through the love language stuff and communicate better about everything that I, and your advice, brought up in the post. But right now, we\u2019re focusing on his mother, so we haven\u2019t gone into it as deep as we\u2019d like. \n\nSo\u2026 a lot of what was in my post *is* a problem, but not as big of a problem as my husband initially made it seem like, and potentially it might be temporary (or it might not be). I\u2019m just happy my husband and I are communicating again, so we can tackle everything as a team. We will still be looking through all of your great advice, but right now it\u2019s just not a priority.\n\nThank you guys again. It\u2019s only one update per post, so I won\u2019t be able to update further along in the future when we\u2019re more actively putting all your advice into practice, but I hope this update suffices.\n\n**Tl;dr:** My husband was going through issues that led to our communication suffering. We\u2019re dealing with that now, and it\u2019s going pretty well.\n\n",

            "OP, in a nutshell, touching grounds people. He didn't want to be grounded. Denial isn't always a  bad thing. It gets us through the rough parts. Think of it as autopilot. If a strong wind touches a plane that's on autopilot, it reacts, shrugging off the wind,  rights itself, and continues towards its goal. \n\nDeath and dying is a matter of the heart. And the more we try to understand someone else's version of it, we can make things worse.  ",
            "I don't necessarily know if this will come up again for you since this situation is very specific, but I had a (much more minor) incident like this and one thing I took away that has since been very helpful has been agreeing with my partner that being honest with one another doesn't mean we can't have privacy. For example, what I ended up saying in this situation was \"Right now I'm going through something that's been really stressful. I don't feel like talking about it, but it would really mean a lot if you could support me in X ways.\" My partner took it at that, didn't pry, and gave me what I needed to be more comfortable. It also let him know that if I was acting weird, it wasn't because of anything he did and that I just needed time to process what was going on in that moment. It also gave him the ability to say something when I eventually started getting snappy with him as overflow from the situation, while making sure to acknowledge I was under stress. Sometimes you don't need to know the specifics of the situation to still respond to it. \n\nSince then, we always stop when the other asks to keep something to themselves and it's made things a lot smoother even in little things. It definitely takes a mutual trust and understanding that this isn't a tool to be used to hide things from a partner that is relevant or could affect them. If this sounds like it would be useful to you, I think it would be a good idea to have a long conversation about what that means to both of you respectively. It also takes a certain amount of self awareness to know what you need to ask of your partner in this situation, since they'll have no context to infer from themselves. ",

I think in your case the most important thing you can do for your husband is to be there for him, and for the two of you and the rest of the family to be there with her as much as possible. Make sure she knows she's loved, and don't let her feel bad for getting sick, life happens and I'm sure she's done all she can to be a good parent. Stay strong for her, and let her know that you will be okay. My SO is definitely sad that his mother is gone, but he was able to say his goodbyes to her, and he stayed by her side while she passed.\n\nAs for you being able to talk things out with your husband, I am glad you did!

I felt really alone in my pain but thanks to you i felt a little less lonely.\n\n\nSo Mark wanted to meet on sunday but i unblocked him from my phone and told him i didn't want to meet and to please not contact me anymore, he answered \"Please baby i need to talk to you, can we meet another day? I know i fucked up really bad and hurt you deeply but i'll do anything to make it up to you, anything you ask i'll do it...'' needless to say it just angered me more, how dare he use terms of endearment with me. I just blocked him again after that. I met his mom on saturday and told her to proceed with the notification of cancellation. We had an emotional moment and she told me even though she would have really wanted us to stay ''One big family'', she would have done the same in my place. She had hoped i would find the strength to forgive him but she understands. And so the wedding is indeed still being cancelled. My poor brother ( i told him personally) had already bought his plane tickets from Australia but got a refund. I rearranged all the furnitures in the house and bought new bedding sets, to make a new start and moved to the spare room for good. It looks really different and i like it. Apparently he told our friends because some brought it up to me, asking if we are getting back together, but said they ''didn't want to side''. \n\nOn sunday evening i had a visitor. I never have people coming this late usually, it was around 9pm. When i went to look through the peephole i saw Mark, **with his ex**. I seriously had a moment of panick. He must still have the key for the main entry since he managed to get to my door without using the intercom. I don't know if it was a coward thing to do but i just chose not to open. I know they knew i was there and i heard him ask me to ''Please let him in, that he just wanted to talk'' through the door. Honestly even though i feel better i don't think i'm emotionally stable enough to deal with him and especially him with his ex. They stayed about 15 minutes and then they left. I thought he would get the message but they came again yesterday around the same time!! And i didn't open again. They waited even longer. I know i'm not being an adult.\n\n\nSo now i don't know what to do. I feel nervous in my own house because i dread the moment they'll come back. He knows my schedule and he came at the time where i usually come back from my zumba class. However yesterday was a holiday so we didn't have class. I'm afraid he will come again and i don't think i can face him. What should i do? I know i can't run away forever but i need more time. Is this worth calling the police over? I fear it would make the problem bigger than it is and hurt our family relations, our moms are really close. And really he is not dangerous, i think. He didn't contact me enough for it to be considered harassment anyway. Should i just be a big girl and open the next time he or they come? Or do i wait it out? Also why the hell is he bringing her? I'm curious but i want to stand by my decision.\n\n\n**tl;dr: I decided not to take him back and told his mom to send the notification of cancellation to the guests. I refused to meet him on sunday but he came in the evening with his ex and again yesterday night. What should i do. Can i just keep on avoiding them or do i have to have that talk i do not want to have?**\n   \n",

            "Make use of his family connections.  \n\nCall his mom, explain that he has dropped by and that you want him to stop.  Tell her that he has come by your place twice already but you did not want to talk to him or let him in.  Tell her that he is not welcome to come by your home.  If there's a third visit, you will be forced to pursue a restraining order and you would rather not have to go that road.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that he was with the girl when he dropped by.  My bet is that he thinks you talking to her will persuade you that there is \"nothing\" between them. He likely thinks the reason you will not take him back is because you do not believe that the relationship between them is over.  The reality is that you will never take him back because he shattered the trust, his current relationship status has zero bearing on that shattered trust. \n\nAlso, move.  Start the process of finding a new appartment.  If you are locked into a lease talk with your landlord and explain that you have an Ex who keeps coming around even after he's been told not to.  Lots of landlords have more than 1 apartment building and might be able to accommodate you moving into another of their units (my dad owns a few buildings and has done exactly this on more than one occasion).

If he stops by again, they can tell him to fuck off and leave you alone and you won't have to.  Don't beat yourself up for not answering.

Stick to your guns. \n\nDon't give him a chance to say sorry just so he can sleep better at night. He's going to spend his life wondering what would have come from the conversation he's pushing.

For her to tell you how shitty he is? \"Here, I decided I don't want him, so you can have him back\". Like, no. In what world does he think that that's the way to fix this?\n\nThis is not fixable in my opinion, and you are being so strong. Stronger than most would in this situation, I think. I believe the best thing to do is to have a letter ready for him, saying something to the effect of:\n\n\n\"Hi ~~you stupid motherfucker~~, I am not interested in being with someone who was willing to leave everything we built together at the drop of a hat. You lost all my trust and respect when you left. You lost ME when you left. You are not the person I thought you were and I don't have any interest in what you have to say for yourself, and I have no idea why you thought bringing her here was okay. You do not deserve me or my forgiveness, and I deserve better. MUCH better. You made your bed, it's time to sleep in it ~~you dumbass douchebag asshole who should go directly to hell~~. Please do not contact me anymore.\"\n\n\nAnd I would slip that under the door the next time they show up. Stay strong. I'm not sure what he's after, but he does NOT deserve to get you back, and he does NOT deserve the closure from this either. He deserves to live his life knowing he fucked up the best thing that ever happened to him because of a stupid, *stupid*, **STUPID** decision.\n\nSending hugs your way, OP. ",

            "When this was happening with my ex, I had a rotation of friends (plus a sibling) come stay with me a few days until I was sure my ex wasn't coming by anymore (which took about a week). They all had jobs and lives, so they didn't stay the night, just for a few hours during the evening, and it made me feel a lot safer. They were my friends and happy to do it, so it really wasn't an inconvenience to them. I didn't want any of them to have to answer the door and deal with my ex, so they just hunkered down with me any time he was at the door and helped me stay strong and resist going to the door, stay calm and not lose it. So, if you want to stay at home, this might be one way to help you feel safe there. You are absolutely doing the right thing by not answering the door, by the way. \n\nI know his name is on the lease, but he should have a care for the fact that you asked him not to contact you, and showing up in person is a huge violation (especially showing up with the person he left you for, no matter what the reason is he brought her along).

He didn't expect me to reciprocate, and we just walked the rest of the way home in awkward silence.\n\n\nI realized how nice it felt to hold his hand and how much I wanted to date him, so I sent this message to him shortly after arriving home:\n\n\u201cI really liked it when you held my hand today, and I want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nIt's been a few hours and he hasn't replied back. I'm not the type of person that expects an instant reply, but he left me on read, and he usually gets back to me immediately.\n\nWe were also supposed to play league of legends today, but he wouldn't get on discord or reply to any of my mentions.\n\nSo what's happening here? Did I scare him away? Am I being really annoying by messaging him? Help!\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** My friend held my hand while we were walking home today. I sent him a message that I liked it a lot and wanted to talk about it more, but he left me on read. He's also been ignoring my other messages for the whole day.\n\n\n",

            "I'd say if he made a move by holding your hand he is into you. But if he's anything like me he panicked when things went well. Like everyone said, be patient, give him some time. I once had a girl try to kiss me and in my utter disbelief and panic I hugged her.... She was not understanding and it didn't work out. So don't stress, he's just shy. ",
            "First of all, this is some of the cutest shit I've ever read. Second, he's probably just trying to collect his thoughts so try to give him some space.",
            "He may have freaked out a little at the \"I want to talk about it\". Maybe he doesn't know how he feels about you and is taking it one little step at a time, maybe he gets tongue tied at the thought of you, maybe he has never expressed feelings like this before (seeing your ages)...  So I wouldn't get hung up about the taking part, just take it as it comes!",
            "D\u2019aww. Just give him some space because he\u2019s thinking things through. You\u2019ll see him around eventually. Then, just ask him how he\u2019s doing, act normal, and don\u2019t pressure him. Come back for more help if he doesn\u2019t want to initiate any talk about it but I\u2019m sure that he will. ",
            "Firstly I think you need to recognise that he held your hand for a reason - it wasn\u2019t just out of no where - not in his mind at least. It sounds like he\u2019s been building up the courage to do something like this with you. \n\nSecondly, you mention he\u2019s a shy boy. Well that probably explains why he\u2019s taking his time to respond. I\u2019m gonna take a shot in the dark and say he likes you! Give him some time to respond, but if he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019d reach out for him and tell him your feelings.\n\nFinally, this is really cute af!",
            "I had my first real kiss in 7th grade after school one day. I was beside myself with disbelief and giddy that I had finally gotten somewhere with my crush. I didn\u2019t know how to react or what to say immediately after so I deadpan said \u201cyou taste bad.\u201d She didn\u2019t. It was an awesome kiss and she tasted like strawberry and vanilla chapstick. Point is, people sometimes get nervous and react strangely. Give him a good bit. He\u2019ll come round. Sidebar: she forgave me and we were an item the entire school year. Eventually, I did get better at the post-kissing celebration. ",
            "If he's super shy don't invite him to talk about holding your hand, invite him to spend time with you doing something you would normally be doing together.",

            "The words \"I want to talk about it\" totally freak out many men. Including older men with much more experience. Best you wait until you are in some kind of relationship before using those words. You can still talk about it. Just don't announce it in advance. ",
            "I cringed when I read you wanted to \"talk about it\". Sounds so serious, and he's probably scared shitless. Maybe it just scared him off, give him a bit of time.",

Let him know you liked it. Otherwise he might try to brush it of as friendly since he is scared he will mess your friendship up.",

            "Well, it has been a few hours. That's not very long. There could be a million reasons why he has not responded. Maybe he has been playing Xbox and hasn't looked at his phone...",
            "This is too cute! Yeah, the whole 'we should talk about it' was a little heavy, but you saved it by the 'i really liked it'. Start talking some other pactical stuff and next time, you grab his hand and say 'want to go see a movie this weekend?' Simple as that! Help the shy guy along, they're usually worth it! ",
            ">and I want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nIt would have been way smoother if you had just left off that second part.  There is no need to discuss. Discussion means you are about to announce that you are 'in a relationship' (from a male perspective), so he has to pull back and consider the ramifications of that.",
            "When I was 18, I honestly thought that calling a girl back too fast would make me seem desperate, even after an obvious time.",
            "I was a very shy teenage boy once too. He is probably still anxiety puking. Be nice, be honest, be patient, be persistent. He may think he made a mistake or something. He may be too scared to accept or need time to get used to the idea. These were all things that happened to me.",

            "Give him time. My bf and I had a similar situation. A friend\u2019s mom was driving our group of friends home from hanging out at her house. We sat in the 3rd row as the other 3 friends were in front of us in the SUV. We ended up holding hands that night. Took about 3 days for him to ask me out after haha but we have been together 7 years now. ",
            "I suggest you give him some time. You did say, he is very shy person and perhaps he just needs time to process all of this. As he is shy, him holding your hand must  be a big move. So give him some time, I'll sure he will come around OP.",
            "> He also looked nervous, so I told him it was cold out and being warmed by his hands was a nice feeling.\n\nHe's probably insecure enough that he turned this positive response into a gentle rejection. For him grabbing your hands was a way of showing his feelings but you placed it in to the context of keeping your hands warm. He probably understood \"nice feeling\" to mean only the physical sensation of not having cold hands.\n\n> I sent him this message shortly after arriving home: \n\n> \u201cI really liked it when you held my hand today, and I want to talk about it.\u201d\n\nI can imagine him translating this into \"I enjoy that we're close enough that you can warm my hand on a cold day, but I want to make sure you don't get the wrong idea about us.\"  This would explain his silence.\n\nSo I suggest you send another message. Something like \"I am interested in you romantically, that's why I would like to talk.\" ",
            "I really want an update on this! Super cute. But he\u2019s probably just busy",
            "You're both over thinking things. Just ask him if he'll take you to a specific movie since you don't have someone to go with.",

            "One of two things:\n\n* Realization.  He made a move and it caused him to realize he doesn't want what he thought he wanted and now he has to figure out how to \"undo\" what he has done.  This is the least likely, so don't fixate on this.\n\n* Nerves.  He took a chance expecting failure and has to rewire his brain to accommodate success.  Chances are, he's thought about this for a long time, and never expected you to share his feelings and doesn't want to mess up the next step in relationship progression.  This is the MOST likely.  Source: Was an awkward guy who had to overcome anxiety when I made a move that was reciprocated in High School.",
            "Took him a lot of courage to hold your hand and now he\u2019s carefully thinking out what to do next! He probably doesn\u2019t want to do the \u201cwrong thing.\u201d You\u2019re fine don\u2019t think you did anything wrong! Just give him a bit of time. Best of luck to you two!",

            "Don't talk about it! Just enjoy it. Geez. Where did I read this?: \"Talking about your relationship status (or whatever) so soon is like going into a party, turning the music down and the lights on just to check if everyone is having a good time\". Mood killer. If he's shy he's not going to want to talk about it. Let it go and he'll probably feel more comfortable and stop ignoring you.\n\nBTW, I'm not saying relationship stuff should never be discussed but I don't think every little thing warrants a \"talk\". Let the moment have its magic. ",
            "This is so cute. He sounds super shy and probably hoped he would get some sort of response that. And now that it's come true he is probably pacing back and forth trying to figure out what to say.\nKeep us updated \u2764\u2764\n",
            "DON'T LET THIS BOY RUN AWAY!! HE'S GONNA BE HELLA SHY, HE'S GONNA SAY SOMETHING DUMB HE DOESN'T MEAN, HE'S NOT GOING TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, but you just gotta smile and let him grow and force him to confront his shyness and it'll be so freaking cute",
            "You probably did scare him a bit. My suggestion is to invite him to do something normal, and then you take the lead. You hold him hand, or give him a little kiss. Don't kiss his cheek, he may see that as a friendship thing. I once kissed a boy that I liked on the forehead and he didn't get it.\n\nSince he is super shy he probably thinks he messed something up because of the \"I want to talk about it.\" Or you could expound on the talk about it and just tell him that you wanted to tell him that you've been into him for awhile. It may be best to tell him that at a time where he is alone and doesn't have to look at you or anyone else (ex. via text). You need to lead now.",
            "This would be what'd go through my head if I were him:\n\"fucking nice yeah i did it fuck fuck what do i say dont fuck it up dont say something stupid shitshitshit\"",

            "Editing to say you'll update then no update? Uh...",
            "When a girl says \"let's talk about it\" I get anxiety. Maybe he's worried. Assure something with him so he doesn't think your upset. ",
            "Sounds exactly like what someone who is really shy might do. Nothing wrong with that though! \n\nI would give him a little space today and then text him in the morning saying that you missed hanging out yesterday and seeing if he wants to get together. When you do, you might have to be the one to take the lead. Just take it slow, talk things over, and I hope it works out for the both of you!  ",
            "He's just shy or embarrassed. It will all be fine.",
            "When you feel attracted to someone, time can seem to move really really slowly, and you will blow up their phone before you know it. It's only been a few hours. Wait for him to respond, and just act like your normal self. You'll see him at school. ",
            "Before my current gf and I started dating, she kissed me. It took me the next day to ask if that meant she was into me. It might be a while.",
            "He's probably just anxious because he never actually planned for the scenario in which you liked him back. At least that's probably how it would have been with me at that age. ",
            "I can tell you that when you said \", and I want to talk about it\" he thinkd that it's going to be something bad. I was like him when I was that age and you constantly panic and expect the worse so if something could be read the wrong way (even if unintentional) he would have read it the wrong way. He might be spiriling thinking that he has lost a friend as well as the person he likes etc. \n\n\nJust my take on it though. Maybe leave it a day if he doesn't message then say directly that you liked it and want to do it more often and make the first move and invite him out to something or to do something together. \n\n\nGood luck! ",
            "He likes you and he is nervous. Give him some space and time. This made me go awww. Good luck OP!",
            "Bunch of other people have said it, but yeah. He\u2019s probably just trying to think of something to say. \n\nI have always been a pretty forward person, but back in college I was hanging out with this guy for MONTHS and when he finally tried to kiss me I panicked and froze. It\u2019s like oh shit, okay, this is happening, now what? \n\nGive him a little space to figure out how to move forward, but don\u2019t feel too weird about messaging him in a day or two if he doesn\u2019t answer. Just mention that you\u2019ve been thinking about it still and don\u2019t want to weird him out, but it was nice, and he\u2019s welcome to do it again. ",

How you worded it could have made him think you DID NOT like him.  If you filter something through your head enough times it comes out like nothing that was meant or said.",

One summer day we were hanging with him and his friends and they all started saying that he wanted to date me, in front of him, who wasn\u2019t denying it.

You should decide whether that's worth it. I'm a few years older than you, but I've had too many relationships..\n\nShy and easily scared guys are cute, but they get lost and don't know what to do. It takes months to teach them how to treat girls and sometimes it's not enough because they tend to retreat back into solidarity. They often lack initiative and let you/require you to push them around.\n\nPushing a man your whole life is no fun, it makes you feel like a mother pushing her baby in a stroller and you're too young for that. I'd say drop the guy if he doesn't make a move back - you already did your part. Don't message him further, don't come out as needy. Also - don't be needy.

This makes me uncomfortable, but he says I am being greedy for trying to discourage him from doing a good deed. Am I worrying over nothing, or are my concerns justified?\n\n***\nSince many of you asked for an update, and you were kind enough to offer advice, I have decided to give one. \n\nThe first thing I did after making my initial post was to confront my husband directly again. I asked him point blank if he was so involved with Kelsey's pregnancy because he was the father of her child. He denied it. I then asked him to introduce me to Kelsey since he had given her money that belonged to both of us. When I mentioned this, he got very defensive and accused me of being insecure. I responded by saying that I at least had a right to know the person I was helping and that he shouldn't have a problem with me meeting Kelsey if nothing was going on between them. He then told me that he wasn't going to introduce us and that I needed to work on my jealousy issues. \n\nI decided to contact Kelsey the next day. I found her, or at least the woman I thought was her, through a mutual friend's Facebook page. I sent her a message telling her who I was. I explained to her why I was concerned about her relationship with my husband and requested that she please let me know if she was having my husband's baby. \n\nShe sent me a very nasty message back. I will spare you many of the details. The basic gist was that I was old and unattractive and unable to satisfy my husband, so he found someone better (i.e., Kelsey). Among other things, she claimed that the baby was my husband's and that he was planning to leave me but felt sorry for me and couldn't bring himself to do it. She ended the message by telling me that I should let him go so they could be together. It hurt a lot to read that message. It still hurts me to think about it. \n\nI confronted my husband that same night. I showed him the message. He got really quiet and admitted that she was telling the truth but denied telling her all of the horrible things she said about me. He said it (getting her pregnant) was a mistake and he was only trying to do the right thing by her and the baby. He denied that they were still sleeping together and said he wanted to stay with me and have a baby with me. I have no idea if either of these things are true.  \n\nI'm not sure what I'm going to do. Everything has happened so fast. A couple of days have passed now, and I'm still thinking things over. He wants us to go to counseling to try to work through this, but I don't think I'm interested in working on our marriage. It would be hard for me to get past this if he had cheated, but the fact that he may be having a child with this woman makes it harder. If I stay with him, she's always going to be in our lives. I have thought about waiting until we can do a paternity test to make a final decision, but I don't know if I want to do that either. It may be easier if I just make the change now. I have started looking for divorce attorneys. Most of my family and friends have told me I need to get out of this marriage, and each day I get closer to making that move. I just need a bit more time before I'm ready to make a decision.  \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: It's my husband's baby. He wants me back and to work on our marriage, but most likely we'll be getting divorced. ",

He is the man who will cheat on you, who will lie to you, who will get someone else pregnant, and who will use your money to support this other woman. \n\nWhat kind of life could you two have together now? First, this woman (who hates you) will always be in it. Second, he has a child who he needs to take responsibility for. That means you may be caring for another woman's child - or at the very least, a significant part of your household income will go to support this child.\n\nHe made so many choices that have brought him to this point. Now you need to make yours - know that you deserve better, contact a lawyer, and begin divorce proceedings. There's a better future that awaits you, I promise.",

            "Wow, your (ex)husband is scum. He cheated on you, got another woman pregant, kept committing *your* money to taking care of her, acted as though *you* were the jealous one when you expressed feeling uncomfortable, and lied every step of the way.\n\nA man with a shred of morality would have confessed as soon as his mistress got pregnant. Instead, he...expected you to be okay with him playing Daddy to another woman's child whilst keeping the child's paternity a secret? \n\n>he was only trying to do the right thing by her and the baby.\n\nAnd what about doing the right thing by you, his *wife*?\n\nThere is no forgiving this. Cut him out of your life, let him have his babymama and begin a life afresh. \n\nEDIT: I found your old post - \n\n> I asked him if he could see how this situation could make me uncomfortable and how it might lead me to think something was going on between them. He said that he was disappointed that I would think his good deed was anything other than him trying to help a coworker. He has been giving me the silent treatment since that fight and making passive-aggressive comments, which is frustrating. \n\nSeriously, this guy is amongst the worst scum I have seen on this subreddit.

No question, no hesitation, divorce him and never, ever look back. You deserve so much better. No one should ever be cheated on, let alone shackled to an unfaithful spouse while they have a child with someone else. \n\nJust think about it, if you hadn't pushed the issue, he would have kept this hidden from you. Also, you might want to get tested for STDs, just in case, because God knows with whom else he or the other woman might have been sleeping with and you don't want to risk your health any more than your unfaithful husband already has. \n\nStick with your family and friends, they want what's best for you and they know that staying involved with this man will irreparably harm you in the long run, so please, for your own sake, cut all contact, except through lawyers, and never allow him to set one foot in your life again.

            "Hi. This is my first ever comment on Reddit. I just signed up specifically so that I can say something to you that no-one else has mentioned and I think is REALLY important, OK?\n\nFirstly though, from the bottom of my heart, I am so sorry that this has happened to you. Everyone has already given you all of the advice and compassion the internet can provide (feel free to keep coming back here as you're healing, ok? We're here) and clearly you realise logically that this is over. The reason you are even questioning if some miracle could save this is, as others have observed, because you are in shock, which is completely understandable. This is huge and horrendous. But of course this is going to sink in and when it does you will be certain in your heart as well as your head that divorce is necessary.\n\nOnle piece of advice I really have to offer and no-one has really stressed. And from one woman to another, I get it, OK? I have done some things I'm incredibly embarrassed to remember when men who I loved broke my heart. I have stayed in abusive relationships for YEARS longer than I should have, I slavishly follwed a guy who beat me up, and another who dumped me 8 times. This was as a result of low self esteem, depression and fears of growing older/not marrying in time etc. Sorry for TMI, I just mean to demonstrate that I totally get why you might hope for a miracle even in the face of the horrific monster your husband has just revealed himself to be. \n\nBut clearly your marriage is over. Because you have too much self love to subject yourself to a second longer of this disgusting man. That means if we skip into your future, maybe to say the beginning of Feb 2016, maybe a bit further into your future, you are going to be coming to terms with what has happened, and you're going to be sad, right? But safely no contact and surrounded by people who love you and whose hearts are breaking for what he has done to you. You are going to realise that what he has done was not only disgusting but also completely HIS FAULT and in no way a reflection on you. And sometimes you are going to be FURIOUS AS FUCK about what he did to you, and wonder how you ever thought marrying that slimeball could have been a good idea. And you are going to think back often to the moment you found out and remember how it took you X days after you found out about his PREGNANT 22 YEAR OLD MISTRESS to realise it was over, and you're going to think one of two things:\n\n1.'When my ex-husband devastated the bond I thought we shared I understandably went into complete shock, and it actually took me 48 whole hours before I was able to even think clearly enough to walk into the room where he was, look him in the eye, and say \"there are no words for how disgusting of a person you truly are inside. You will probably never realise what you have lost, because you are completely broken, but honestly my heart breaks for a child that must call you their father. You have ten minutes to pack anything necessary to stay in a hotel and then you are going to get the HELL out of my house.\" And you will remember his sheepish face as he left and think, sure, 'he made me feel humiliated before I realised this travesty had absolutely nothing to do with me, and God, I was so out of it I even wrote a Reddit post asking people if I should leave him!' And you will cringe, but totally understand and feel compassionate for yourself that it took you a whole 48 hours to slam the front door of your house in his face as you left his pathetic ass.\n\nOr. And it's a sad or\n\n2. You will look back and think, this man betrayed me, verbally abused me, STOLE my money for his mistress, exposed me to STDs, actually dared to sleep in the same bed as me while he was fucking someone else without protection, and I waited A WEEK / TWO WEEKS and had several conversations weeping in front of him, really making sure he knew how devastated I was and how important I thought he was as a person, in a sick way reinforcing his ego, saying things like 'I don't know if this can be fixed but maybe a miracle will happen.' I love myself so little and I am so damaged that I hung around for X long time before I found the last remaining shred of self esteem that fucker left me and asked him to get out.\n\nAs someone who has to live with the memory of begging a man not to leave me who took my virginity, beat me up and then dumped me for a teenager, PLEASE do not ask your future self to have to remember you as someone who took longer than it has already been to get him to leave your house immediately and never speak to him again. Please choose option one. Because I'm better now, building self esteem, understanding codependency. But now that I have healed from what others have done to me, I have discovered the things that I have done to myself. And those are far harder to come to terms with.\n\nGive yourself the gift of a dignified exit from the marriage to remember, and go ask him to get out right this minute with your chin held up, looking him in the eye. Please, for an easier healing process in future.\n\nLots of love.\n\nJx",
            "PLEASE DON'T STAY WITH HIM. He has destroyed your trust, and he NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH if you hadn't found out yourself. I mean...think about how he gaslighted you and tried to make you feel crazy for your TOTALLY VALID AND ACTUALLY TRUE concern!!!!!! UGH.\n\nIt makes me FURIOUS on your behalf. I hope you're angry too.

Having a baby with him now would be really stupid for a variety of reasons.  Not the least of which is because he is going to owe this woman child support.

You need to start making quick action to protect your assets and your rights in the event that you do decide to proceed with the divorce.  Your husband has been lying,cheating and giving away money that is yours.  Don't trust him to do the right thing financially.

Guess what that means?  Now you get to pick up the financial slack in the relationship to offset his child support payments.  CONGRATS.  You'd be subsidizing your husbands own love child.  And lets be real here...would you even want to stay with a man that would abandon his own child?  \n\nThis marriage is over.  You know it.

            "I didn't read the original, so I don't know if you have kids or not. But I just wanted to share. This happened to my parents. Dad and Mom had us four kids, then when my youngest brother was 13, he got some other woman pregnant. It was devastating to us, as I'm sure it is to you. I have my doubts that the only reason she got pregnant was to try to keep my dad. Anyway, long story short, my mom forgave him, and they're still together. Mostly for our sake. We have joint custody of my little half brother. We absolutely love him to death as this whole situation is 100% not his fault. Even my mom loves him. But it's really really hard for her. We're pretty sure his mother tells him (he's four now) to disrespect our mom, to not trust her, to not love her. It's really unfair since my mom has welcomed him with open arms. My point is, that she is struggling and probably will struggle with this for a long time. And I know she does it because of us, she doesn't want us to be in a broken household. I'm sure my parents love each other, but if we weren't around, I'm not sure my mom would have stayed. And I don't blame her. Since we are all older, we understand that he's now the baby of the family, and he's treated a little differently than we were growing up. If you do stay and have kids with this man, your kids might (but I hope not) get the short end of the stick. She's already proven how nasty she can be. This will not get better. If you stay, you'll have to stay through him trying to be involved in his kids life, and her blocking him. You'll have to stay through him bending to her will, but not to yours because she has a kid to barter with. If you stay, you'll have to love the kid like it was your own, because it's not the kids fault, and it won't be fair that they grew up in those circumstances. They need extra care, extra love, extra stability. It's your decision and if you need to talk to someone I'm here. But if this had happened to my mother before she had us kids, I'd tell her to leave.

Judges often don't care about the circumstances surrounding parents and their significant others. Judges focus on what is in the child's best interests. This means that since your husband is definitely on the hook for child care, by extension, if you're still married to him, you may be as well. Talk to an attorney as soon as possible, *even if* you choose to work on things.\n\nI know personally how difficult it is to feel like you've lost everything. In this case, your husband didn't come clean about one mistake. This is an ongoing affair and a constant coverup. I had to deal with a situation where my ex carried on a long term affair. When I finally found out and ended the relationship, my friends warned me about trying to reconcile. One of my friends put it quite succinctly, \"Q. How do you know she is lying? A. When her mouth is moving.\" I would apply the same blunt assessment to your husband. You are his meal ticket.

Let those two ruin their own lives. They deserve each other. You on the other hand need to leave and you need to use the message from Kelsey as proof of his infidelity. You don't have kids, the decision to leave is easy. If you value your future, you will either get a lawyer or pay a paralegal to write your decree and go file it so you can serve the papers.

Don't feel too bad for yourself, he did you a favor by showing you his true colors now. After the divorce you will better yourself in all different ways. And him? He gets to raise two children on his own. You'll look hotter and hotter while he becomes a sad old man. Sometimes good things fall apart so that better things can fall together.

Healing is made even harder if you let poison keep seeping in.\nI do hope you can find relief. I know it sounds stupid but this will pass. I thought I would die of a broken heart and never ever be happy again....it took a while and sometimes I can feel it trying to sneak back in but it will pass. See about maybe getting help with situational anxiety, even depression. Do something you like....even if it's sitting in a store reading a book.

It must seem crazy that a person who is pregnant by a married man is making demands and being nasty to you; it feels unfair.  You have tons of things on your mind now, but when you make your decision about whether or not you want to stay married, make it because of what's best for you.  It's tempting to stay with him out of spite; keeping a distasteful woman from taking your husband, but he will always be a cheater and she'll always be there. I mean no disrespect, I've been there."
