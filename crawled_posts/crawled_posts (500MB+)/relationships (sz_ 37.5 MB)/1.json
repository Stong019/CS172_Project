        "selftext": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i7wkqu/i_30f_caught_my_husband_31m_in_an_affair_and_i/\n\nFirst of all, I just want to thank everyone here for the support I received following my first post back in August. At the time, it truly felt like my world was ending. It was important to me to make this update because I need to tell anyone who\u2019s currently going through the same thing\u2014IT GETS BETTER. You will get so much better. \n\nI had one conversation with my husband since everything happened\u2014by his choice. It lasted maybe five minutes and was like talking to a robot. I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret. At this point, I don\u2019t care. I know him and the other woman are still seeing each other and frankly, they deserve each other. Good for them. \n\nWhile I still feel angry occasionally, I no longer mourn what I once had. Instead, I\u2019m so excited for the life I now get to live. I moved to a small walkable city and gave myself my dream apartment. It makes me so happy to see how I\u2019ve decorated it and to just live in a cozy place instead of our old dreary house.  I was the breadwinner in our marriage, and he would make me feel awful about wanting to pay for nice meals or do fun things. Since moving here, I\u2019ve done a ton of foodie fun stuff and don\u2019t feel guilty. It\u2019s so refreshing. \n\nI have dipped my toe into the dating pool again and had plenty of mediocre dates from dating apps. Recently, I found someone who I\u2019ve really clicked with and am enjoying how appreciated and desired he\u2019s made me feel.  It\u2019s definitely early and we\u2019re moving slow, but overall, dating has made me realize that I\u2019m a catch who doesn\u2019t have to settle. \n\nTherapy has done wonders and I\u2019m so happy I immediately dove into it. My therapist is proud of me. I\u2019m proud of me. I\u2019ve stopped looking at being divorced as a failure. He failed\u2014not me. I\u2019m genuinely happy and excited to wake up each morning and no longer feel like this terrible weight is sitting on my chest. The holidays were surprisingly easy and I found myself so happy to spend time with my family without having to compromise anything. \n\nSo all in all, life is good and there\u2019s so much of it ahead. Looking back, I can\u2019t believe I wasted so much time thinking about how I could get him to come home. I\u2019ve made my own home and my own happiness and that is worth so so much more. \n\nTLDR; Husband left me for another woman. He sucks, but things get better.",

Tomorrow morning my journey begins as I go talk to a therapist for the first time and begin the road to recovery. Thank you for being so strong and sharing your story so others may find their strength through you. You\u2019re amazing.",

            "It made me sad reading in your last post that you were worried about overanalyzing the times you might have looked pathetic to him. For starters he was pathetic for doing that to you and it's not pathetic being lied to, manipulated and gaslighted. \nSo I'm glad after reading this post that you see it as his failure and not yours because that's exactly it. You've done nothing wrong and you're well rid of this guy. I'm happy you're doing so well. You sound awesome.",
            "I read the earlier post, then this. What a great happy ending. I love the way you see it, as a new beginning and his failure not yours.  I believe that it's 100% true and very helpful to see it in that light. I wish you the best, but it sounds like you've already got it.\n\nWell done!",

            "This is awesome.   Is there any substitute for time to give you better perspective??   When I was in your position, I thought the pain would never go away.  Then slowly over time it improved, sometimes with a setback, but moving in the right direction.  Great job!!",
            "So glad for your happy update!  Your husband did not deserve you.\n\nI am so glad things are going better for you and that you can live your life as you please!",
            "I hate that you had to go through such betrayal on multiple fronts, but so proud of you and also thankful that you took the time to share this with us. \n\nYou had to experience some acute pain and trauma but ultimately you're coming out the winner of this situation. You are actively working through everything rather than settling for instant gratification. It always works out better in the long term when you can lean into your discomfort and find healthy coping mechanisms and solutions. It's so much easier said than done so that's why I admire you.",
            "> I know from others that he cries to people about how he ruined his life, but I have never once gotten an apology or the same show of regret.\n\ni just want to say, wise move on believing his ACTIONS and not words or rumours. I should have done that during my divorce, would have saved a lot of heartache. sounds like you're doing it right.",

            "Yours should be a primer for anyone experiencing the same situation. You made all the right moves in a timely manner. And you seemed to instinctually understand that events like these are often the Universe telling you that you deserve much better.",
            "I just went through a very confusing, earth shattering breakup myself, while I was living in la la land thinking we were so in love. Thank you for your words of encouragement... I\u2019m in a similar situation and I\u2019m going to be gifting myself my dream apartment next!",

You are indeed a catch. Wishing you all the best!",

I broke up with my ex early last year after he cheated a couple of years ago, and whilst I sit here and think \u201che ain\u2019t shit\u201d, I still struggle somewhat with my own happiness and self worth because of it. Seeing you taking the time to improve on your happiness and enjoying yourself is genuinely uplifting! \n\nI\u2019m so happy for you, thank you for giving a wee little lass some hope",
            "Thank you for this OP. I had someone break my heart and have had a similar moving on situation--I moved and got an even better job, I found perfect little home to rent for me, the area is delightful, and therapy has been helpful. In general, I'm okay, content even--also started dating around. Some days are still difficult, but your \"He failed--not me,\" really picked me up and I think I'll carry that when I feel low. That's such a powerful realization.",
            "We have really similar experiences. It\u2019s been 6 years divorced for me.\n\nI\u2019m so much happier and many of my friends say I\u2019m a different person. I put all that energy that was drained from my relationship into my career and now I run a marketing department for a national nonprofit. I have a great boyfriend and an amazing dog. I close on my own condo next week.\n\nLife isn\u2019t perfect but I\u2019m grateful he made the dumb choices he did and he\u2019s her problem now.",

            "I\u2019m so glad that you are back up on your feet and moving on so well. In just half a year you successfully created a new life for yourself which is amazing, some people take years before they even scratch the surface of healing their trauma. I\u2019m sure therapy had a lot to do with that and you are really strong for getting through this. Still don\u2019t understand how they could do that to you and how people can cheat on the ones they vowed to love, but honestly good riddance!",
            "I just know that everything is going to fall into place. I keep hearing the same thing... love on yourself HARD, and then everyone else will start to do the same. Enjoy the new job, dating, food and new found freedom!!",
            "Im so happy that you have a happy update to give. I remember your story and honestly, F him for feeling zero remorse and not giving a crap what he did to you. I\u2019m glad that you are healing and are happy with how your life is going. I hope you find your forever soon, or when you are ready. Good luck",

It\u2019s not. Finding balance is. I\u2019m so happy for you! What a wonderful post to read and a great way to kick of 2021! It\u2019s already going right.",

            "Life goes on... once you realized that you can do it in your own, and that happiness is something you make happen and not your partner or boyfriend and obviously maturity on how to handle the situation. After 19 years of my marriage, I can say: paying for my house and my Testla? Was one of the most satisfying events in the last 2 years! And I am happy as well that the relationship ended.",

            "Hey, I never saw the original thread but I just checked it and I went through something very similar. I just want to say, I'm so happy for you and proud of you! As someone who went through it about 5 years ago now, there are still shadowy parts lurking in my brain-- but they get smaller and quieter every day. I look back and see almost an entirely different person, and entirely different life, than what I have built myself in the last 5 years. And I am THRIVING. Remember that healing isn't linear, and you're a badass.",
            "I have been going through the same exact thing and I've just started looking at apartments for myself. All this time I have felt like I was drowning with no hope I'd ever be okay. For the first time I feel as if I'm about to break the surface of those dark waters. I'm so glad to hear you're doing well, and I'm hopeful that someday I'll be okay too.",
            "I am so proud of you and happy for you! I went through a similar situation 5 years ago and I can agree with everything you\u2019ve said. Husband left me for someone else & now they\u2019re together. I went from being basically a society wife who never had to worry about bills to having nothing except my beautiful daughters. My ex was mentally and verbally abusive behind closed doors so the first thing I felt when he left was peace. I finished RN school, got my dream job at an emergency room and 2 years later, met a wonderful man I\u2019ve been with ever since. Now life is amazing. We do fun things as a family and I\u2019ve become tough and able to stand on my own two feet. My ex\u2019s family still loves me and helps with my kids. Your story is never over. There\u2019s always something better to come!",
            "I am so genuinely happy for you. My ex-husband cheated on me two weeks after our wedding. I found out almost immediately, and I decided to forgive him. I spent the next two years putting everything I had into that marriage, but he refused to put in any of the work. He claimed that since I chose to forgive him, it should have also been immediately forgotten. I was miserable for the entire duration of our relationship from that point on. I drank incessantly. Things got abusive (on his end) and it took me a while to come to terms with that, but when I finally left him I got my life back and then some. I moved to Austin, somewhere I\u2019d always wanted to live. I got an amazing job. I lived with my best friend and a few other incredible roommates. I got to experience the city and everything it had to offer without feeling hindered by the \u201cfailure\u201d of leaving my husband. I went to therapy, and I *really* dove into that. He\u2019d always refused any sort of couples therapy. It was such a good feeling to be in charge of my own healing! When I was ready, I started dating again, and met the man that I\u2019ve been with for three years now. Things really do get better when we take control of our lives. I\u2019m so proud of you!",

And still  I'm proud of you!\n\nTwo things that you said that I loved:  \"I'm so excited for the life that I get to live.\" and \"made me realize that I'm a catch that doesn't have to settle.\"  Such great realizations that show a very healthy mental state.  Wishing you so much good luck moving forward.",

This just goes to show how self-absorbed and callous he really was- he only cared about the image he received as a cheater, not the actual cheating itself. Hence he showed humility around his friends for his actions, but never to you. Good effing riddance, he sounds like a literal nightmare. \n\nOP, you are a champion! What a turn around, and I wish you the best with your new chapter in life.",

            "I'm so happy for you. I'm excited to hear that for you, you come first. I wish more people would apply this to their life. If you don't look out for yourself, no one will. You always have to be your top priority. \n\nA man that can't respect you, that can't ser how much you're worth, is not worth your while. You deserve better and I'm absolutely positive you will find much better. \n\nIt's so good to know that you're in the hands of a professional. Just a tip, remember that mourning has several stages and you can navigate from one to the other at no particular time and in no particular order so if you find yourself back in sadness or anger or bargain, please don't feel it's a set back because it isn't, it's part of the process and if something, it's moving forward. \n\nReally love the positive feeling I got after reading this update. I'm thrilled for you. \n\nI read this a while back and even though it seems like you don't need it right now, it's always good to keep it in mind so here it goes: \n\nLet's get out of this habit of telling people well:\"That's still your mom. That's still your dad. That's still your brother. That's still your sister. *(That's still your husband)\".\n\nToxic is toxic whether it's family or not. \n\nYou're allowed to walk away from people who constantly hurt you. You're allowed to walk away from people who've abused you. You're allowed to walk away from people who don't love you. You're allowed to create boundaries. You're allowed to choose your breaking point. \n\nStop encouraging people to deal with toxicity and drama. \n\n(Lessons taught by LIFE)\n\n*Added by me. \n\nHope it helps. Sending your way best wishes, positive vibes, blessings, prayers, and a huge virtual hug. \n\nHappy New Year!",

This all happened almost 6 months ago and I\u2019m still feeling the sting of it all. My life was flipped upside down and I am still trying to figure out who I am again after he left me with a word of self esteem issues. \n\nTurns out, he found out he was bipolar and we started dating in his manic phase, and when we lived together, he blamed me for the depression. It sucked and I\u2019m still trying to move past it. I want to start dating again but I don\u2019t feel like I can bring much to the table yet.

I found mine had been cheating very early on and as he was a manipulative, lying, sociopath - we went to counseling and I thought things had changed, they never did.  He cheated on me many times; I didn't find out about most of it until later.  It took me so many years to build up the courage to get divorced.  When I finally did, it was like my life opened up in front of me... so wide and so beautiful.  You are SO RIGHT that things DO get better!

She and her fianc\u00e9 are now moving into our apartment building, and my boyfriend is seeing and talking to her more and more. I don't know if it's time to set boundaries or if I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot has happened since my last post, and I got some good advice there, so I wanted to post an update!\n\nAfter I made the last post I came home from the trip with my family a couple of days later. I told my boyfriend that I wanted to talk to him about something and I brought up his friendship with Liz. I basically brought up all of my concerns from the post. I told him that I didn't want to discourage him from having a friend, but I also felt like they were talking quite a lot and spending a lot of time together, and that it was starting to make me feel uncomfortable.\n\nMy boyfriend took it really well! He immediately reassured me that he only saw her as a friend, and that he hadn't even realized how it could look to me. When I brought up how I felt like he wasn't being forthcoming with information (like how he didn't mention the phone call from her), he said that was 100% unintentional. He then immediately asked what he could do going forward to make me feel more comfortable. He offered to stop carpooling with her and to cut down on contact with her except for work-related stuff. I told him I didn't have a problem with the carpooling because financially it does make sense (he spends a lot of money on gas), but maybe he could try to text and call her outside of work a little bit less. I also told him I would really love to meet her and her fiance, and he enthusiastically agreed.\n\nHe set up a hang out for the following weekend - the two of us and Liz and her fiance all went out for drinks at a bar by our building (they'e moved in by now). It was actually really fun! It turns out we all have a ton in common. Liz and I do very similar work, and we all have common nerdy interests. It was a little awkward at first as meeting new people often is, but once we all got comfortable we had a blast. From there, we have all become fast friends, and Liz and I have developed our own separate friendship too. We text often, go over to each other's places for dinner sometimes, and hang out on weekends. I can honestly say I really like Liz (and her fiance) as a person and trust her 100%. I no longer have a problem with her friendship with my boyfriend at all. They do still carpool sometimes, but they've never hung out alone outside of work - it's always the four of us. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.\n\nFinally, I have a separate - but slightly related - update: my boyfriend is now my FIANCE! Less than a month after I made my last post, he took me out for a really beautiful and romantic dinner. When we came home, our apartment was covered in roses and candles. I was so shocked I could barely move as he got down on one knee and proposed. I said YES and then cried for about two hours as we called all of our friends and family. It was absolutely perfect and we are getting married next year!\n\nIt turns out that Liz actually helped him plan the proposal and that was part of why they were talking a lot too! Since she lives in our building now, he had all of the flowers, candles, champagne, and accessories shipped to her and kept at her place until he was ready for them. He even had her hold onto the ring the week before he did it. After he proposed she came upstairs and took photos for us and cried with us. That was the moment I realized what a great friend she is to both of us.\n\nSo communication saves the day again! We're all great friends now, and Liz and I have regular girls nights to plan our weddings together :)\n\nTL;DR: I talked to my boyfriend and he introduced me to Liz and her fiance right away. We're all great friends now and I'm no longer uncomfortable - but I am engaged!\n\nEDIT: Wow, wow, wow!!!! I know this is stereotypical, but I never expected my post to blow up like this. I started reading the comments last night and planned to reply to some but then I got busy, and then this just got out of control! So let me just say here, thank you all SO MUCH for the support, advice, and well-wishes! You guys rule \ud83d\ude2d And thank you for the platinum, gold, and silver?! I\u2019ve never gotten any of that before and now I\u2019m a little sad that this is a throwaway and not my main, haha. I\u2019ll pay it forward and gild someone today :)",

            "This is lovely. It made me think about my friendship with a friend of my husbands, she used to worry me abit untill one day on Christmas we had a gift at the door from her, one for him, one for our baby and a little one for me. I had never even met the girl but just the fact she included me in that showed she is obviously really nice and has respect for our relationship. Green flags all round. ",

            "Huge congrats! I read your first post and felt pretty nervous for you and this is such an amazing reminder of how WRONG our brains can be and how critical it is to have those conversations, even the ones that are hard and embarrassing and you can hardly get the words out-- DO IT.",
            "I \\[28/f\\] always feel awkward with my husband \\[32/m\\] about that. As he's the only one that's working right now, he's bound to connect with work friends. One of his closest is a female around our age, who just recently got engaged. He told me about their friendship as soon as it began, but still. I actually feel kinda jealous about the connection that they have versus the connection that I have with my husband. We have a game night every other week and I've met both her and her fiance, but still. It's always going to be in the back of my head, you know?",
            "It\u2019s amazing how meeting and getting to know the woman your partner is friends with can change how you feel. When I was having jealousy issues, (not saying you were jealous but I sure as hell was), my psychologist recommended I meet the girl in question and to spend time in the social situation I was worried about and it worked treat! I\u2019m so glad this worked out, congratulations!",
            "glad it worked out. you seemed way too jealous in your last post. your fiance seems like a great and patient guy",
            "Omg my heart was waiting for bad news until you mentioned proposal?!?! Wow congratulations !! I'm totally the jealous type so hearing your story really gives me a more positive look on opposite sex friends. Its ironic bc I make guy friends easily but when my bf makes girl friends and they connect well I get jealous haha even though it's normal! Maybe I'm just selfish xD ",
            "That's probably why he gets along so well with her, because she reminds him of you!",
            "I'm not sure if it's been said yet,  but your common interests and quick friendship with Liz is probably why your fiance (congrats!) developed such a strong friendship with her in the first place.  He probably saw a lot of you in her which made him trust and like her inherently. This obviously could have gone wrong,  but in this case I would take it as a very good sign about who you are and how fiance sees you! ",
            "This is awesome. Haha I totally was Liz one time to my friend, I was going over to their apt a lot and helping her build out a PC and load games on it for her boyfriend, and her neighbor was wondering why I (a dude who wasn't her BF) was coming over a bunch when he wasn't around and we were always giggling when I left.",
            "Yay! I'm glad this was a happy update and now you have made another(apparently wonderful) friend and it seems like you and your FIANC\u00c9 communicate wonderfully. You are both very lucky! Congratulations!",

            "This is nice. For the longest time, I was so against having friends of the opposite sex, tbh I still don't quite understand friendships with past exes. \n\nAnyway, at my last job, I met a guy & we became friends. There has never been romantic feelings, we both like to cook & garden, so we became friends because of our interests. Like any other friend I have, we text every once in awhile & hang out every few weeks. It's never weird.",
            "OP, it's a bit concerning that on the one hand you say you trust her completely, and on the other that you feel relieved that she and your boyfriend do not hang out privately outside of work. It doesn't seem like those two statements should co-exist.\n\nTo me it seems like you are still uncomfortable with this friendship and haven't really gotten to the root of it. Jealousy is a complex emotion and worth exploring.\n\n\n\n",

            "I find it alittle odd that he started talking to and about her a month ago but is good enough friends to plan his proposal with her, and have the stuff sent to her house. Opposite sex or not, I wouldn't trust just anyone with expensive and important items like that. I'm cynical though. \n\nCongratulations on your engagement and I'm glad it worked out for you.",
            "This is awesome \ud83d\ude42 congratulations!",
            "Okay in all seriousness, I didn't relax reading this until you talked about the proposal. I mean, I'm super ecstatic for you, OP! It genuinely sounds like a case of good communication and compromise, and I wish you the best.\n\nHowever, my heart was so low through the entire post bc I was in a situation with an ex that was identical from an outside perspective. He made quick friends with some other girl, and spent a lot of time with her, so I compromised by also becoming close friends with her (and /her/ boyfriend) to get rid of my anxiety. Turned out that he actually was cheating on me for a full year with her, starting on the day they met which was also my first Valentine's Day with that ex...\n\nAnyway, I'm glad it worked out here! It actually makes me feel a lot better because maybe now I won't be so quick to assume the worst when I hear about situations like this. ",

That I miss how I was physically at my peak in college. \n\nShe said she is also having a bit of a crisis, worried about longterm health and missing the shape she was in before kids. \n\nWe made a commitment to each other to get into shape and have changed our eating habits and bought a treadmill. I have been working out daily and my rumination issues have really dwindled. We also planned a nice vacation, and a few get togethers with frends in the next few months. \n\n\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Told wife I was having a crisis without much detail.

            "That\u2019s a great update. I can promise you that the one month relationship would have never worked out, because it didn\u2019t. And how it ended suggests that it never had staying power. \n\nI hope that getting into shape helps you both. I think the pandemic also makes relationships tough because you\u2019re likely no longer getting out and doing the things that brought you together (or, simply having time apart and separate interests). At least that\u2019s been the case with my marriage! I think that would make it tempting to fantasize about some other reality that \u201ccould have\u201d been (but really, it could have never been).",
            "Aww, that's great! Enjoy your fitness journey together and your vacation!",
            "I learned a technique for getting stuff that keeps popping into your head to go away. It worked for me, and it helped my brother with something too.\n\nStep 1. Get a minimum of 15 minutes where you won't be interrupted, sit down and start writing your thoughts on it down. Write it down with an actual pen and paper - not on a computer. Just write whatever comes to mind, but keep writing for 15 minutes. If you run out of things to write, just repeat yourself, it's fine.\n\nStep 2. Burn the paper. Literally burn it. Careful not to burn your house down. \n\nStep 3. Do this every day or every other day until you've done it at least 4 times.\n\nThe psychologist that told me this technique explained that often when you have thoughts that keep coming back over and over, it's because instead of processing them to a conclusion, you're stuck in a mental loop that is self-reinforcing. By writing things down in an uninterrupted fashion, and in a method where you can be completely honest with yourself because you know no one will ever see it, you help yourself develop a mental path out of those thoughts.\n\nI've used this twice, and it's worked both times.\n\nEdit: Meant to add that personally, burning the paper felt cathartic too. Not sure if that actually is part of why it worked, but it felt good.",

            "I've had this happen with someone from my past as well. It faded but it actually took a couple years. One thing I just kept reminding myself is that the person I was obsessing about did not exist. It was some mixture of longing for simpler times, youth, my fantasy of a person, places from my past I missed, etc.\n\nI'm so glad to hear you turned it into a positive! Mine was something similar as well and I would imagine for both of us it came down to not being happy with ourselves and then projecting it into something else.",
            "My therapist told me that our dreams are our brain\u2019s way of trying to process things. It makes a lot of sense to me that you\u2019ve been feeling in a funk and looking to the past to process the difference. I love your update. Y\u2019all have a great partnership.",

            "Thought I'd stop by and mention that this could've easily been physiological anxiety that presents itself with invasive thoughts. \n\nYes, things like not eating well and not being in the next physical health can cause this soooooo easily. So I'm glad you're talking care of your health. I'm fairly certain, it was simply invasive thoughts but don't discount making sure to have fun. :)",
            "I think it\u2019s alright to reminisce about old flames. I think it\u2019s more about something in yourself that you want to reignite and not necessarily having to do with your former lover. Glad to hear you\u2019re doing good.

            "Carl Gustav Yung - man and his symbols \n\nBrother but the book it will blow your fricking mind once you understand the lingo. You dreams are not about the woman 16 years ago, it is about the self manifested in symbology of the female, you feel you are missing vitality, vigour, energy, youth.\n\nYou will not find it in the lady 16 years ago you will only find it within the self, your subconscious had projected a time stamp of what once was to remind you, hey you could be this again (not with the lady) but with the self. So how you incorporate the message is up to you.  \n\nAre you missing unbridled sex with your wife, passion desire and lust you feel you would get from a stranger? \n\nThen read Esther Perle and watch her seminars on relationships. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be hard on yourself you are human and every human has these thoughts.",
            "Aww. I love the communication from you two! A good example of how communication between a couple doesn't need to hurt the other person. I think it's OK that you don't tell your partner every little thought in your head if it might hurt them. Instead, approaching the issue by explaining that you're ruminating on the past is so much better than specifically mentioning that you're thinking about an ex. Good job, OP.",
            "This is exactly what I mean when I say the grass is greenest where you water it.With effort and communication on both parts most any relationship is savable.

            "Wow I'm literally going through the exact same scenario right now with almost the same exact timelines. I even had a dream about the 'other girl' which set this off in my mind a few weeks back.\n\nIn my case I haven't talked to my wife, I am afraid of what to say that won't set her off, especially since she made me promise to stop being friends with the other girl. Glad you guys are making love to cope, we have no drive on top of everything having a 2 year old and covid, but that's more an excuse I've never had much desire for it.\n\nGlad to hear your case and it's a mini-inspiration for us, I guess I just have to move past it.",

            "36? Mid-life crisis? Goddamn. I was expecting it later.",
            "Yikes. This made me not want to ever get married again. I don't have time to be worried about a woman from 16 years ago. Get over yourself.",
            "I'm glad you have plans and a constructive way to get over this. Because no-one is perfect and if things had lasted with Ms Less than 2 Months you still would have had all the usual couple problems and dissatisfactions.",

            "Many people are absolutely shocked at the mental benefits of being in good physical shape.  I think the intense focus in social media/tv/movies/whatever on \"good looks\" being the primary benefit of a healthy lifestyle pushes the mental benefits completely out of the picture for the vast majority of people.  Good on you for examining your situation, sitting down and discussing with your wife, and then actually doing something about it!  \n\nGood luck in your journey towards better physical AND mental health!  Plenty of scientific studies have proven how working on one can have measurable impact on the other!",
            "Yeah, good thing. I read your original post and honestly it's so pathetic to be hung up on a ONE month relationship from when you're 20. You shouldn't want to be that guy. Really, nobody should be that guy but there's a lot of pathetic people out there.",

            "It seems to be about control. Not fully-realizing or experiencing what you could with that ex. But Truth is...you made a Covenant with your wife....stick by it. If you got married for illogical reasons, then problems will ensue.\n\nBe a man of your word, do not regret your agreements and descisions. I know i would resonate MUCH more with my ex's than my wife. But i made the wise descision for the \"best possible\" mother to my seed. I really never cared about social or physical interactions.\n\nIts much Easier to accept your own truth. Which you choose when u got married. Should your wife not support your will and descisions, then dump her quickly.  A good man should \"Never\" be controled by his wife, rather supported. \n\nKeep your word, if wifey does not....exit without regret.\n\nDon't dwell on the past. What may seem like regret, could actually be an important Learning experience.",
            "My tactic of nuking my ex out of my mind or rather reduce it to almost zero is just condition yourselfe.\nThink about Something that is extremly disgusting for you like dead kittens or sodomized babies, Something that makes you almost puke. Now whenever you catch yourselfe thinking about her concentrate your mind on your disgusting thought.\n\nAt First you will see little effect, but Overtime your mind will asoziate negative emotions with her, thus reducing your Attraction to her.",

But I always feel like as a woman that\u2019s had children, my partner could \u201cget into shape\u201d if he wanted, but my body is never going to be the same? I can\u2019t work out and get rid of sagging parts and stretch marks and tbh i try to gain weight to try and fill out the sagging skin. Does she seem like working out is making her feel like she\u2019s getting back to where she wanted? I know not everyone is the same and she may have just been lucky enough to not have had pregnancy and birth damage her body so much. But I\u2019ve always wondered how other women feel about that.",

            "I'm so glad everything worked out, and I definitely wouldn't read too much into your dream. I'm VERY happily married and sometimes (like every 6 months to a year) dream about a particular ex who things didn't work out with. \n\nI would never want to go back to that place in my life, or that person, but I sometimes wish I could have a \"do over\" with the knowledge I have now. So many of our problems were due to our youth, relative inexperience with serious relationships, and mediocre communication skills. \n\nIn the dreams I have, I am my current self in that past relationship behaving the way current me would have behaved if I had the knowledge/relationship skills I do now. Sometimes I wake up from the dreams feeling a tiny yearning for that relationship, but then I roll over and see my husband and that all vanishes. You mentioned in your previous post that you had struggled with girls prior to this short relationship. it could just be your brain rehashing an old problem (she ghosted you and you never found out why) now that you have new skills (a happy marriage).\n\nAnyway, brains are funny like that, and will sometimes just pick something to fixate on. I wouldn't read too much into it. Either way, it seems like you've ended up with the best case scenario!",

            "Happened to me, too. I'm single, though, but when I think about dating I remember all the chicks I \"dated\" (pretty much just screwed because all we did was talk and fuck) back in my 20s. The thing is, I was trying different dating techniques in different towns and would cycle through them. It was the real me in one town, and completely fake personas in other towns. I couldn't ever date them again because they didn't even know my real name. I know it's bad but I wanted to see what really attracted women.\n\nFor me, it was pretending to be an amateur MMA fighter (there was a local gym I said I went to) and just generally being overly sexual as a guy. I had a ton of shirtless pics and was in good shape so I could easily lie. I know hardly anything about this one chick, but she was really into me and we hooked up a lot. We'd fuck for hours at a time. She was around 18 and had a super hot body (athletic but with a big volleyball player bubble butt). I think she found out my name wasn't what I said it was or someone snitched on me. I let her find out where I worked and another chick came at the same time or found out too. It was scandalous.\n\nThe other chick I \"dated\" was an old coworker.  She was a petite hispanic girl with a bubbly and overly talkative personality. She was the very definition of spinner but talked like she was on meth and it was really hard to keep up with her. I don't even remember why we stopped dating. I did fuck her and volleyball butt back to back, though, like literally left one's house to go to the next without showering.\n\nI've dated several since then, but it was my peak, I suppose, as I had about 10 women I was talking to and hooking up with that year, many at the same time. None of them ever became serious but one because we lived together for about 6 months and then broke up. I slowed down quite a bit after that but had a lot of shorter flings between then and now.\n\nFor me, the crisis came when I saw who I'm attracting these days. It's mostly my age, and I expect more from people I guess. I don't even show shirtless photos. I'm not chubby but I need to get more toned. Years of trucking does that to people, but I'm making efforts to walk more and eat healthier. My old gym is too far so I'm looking for a place with a gym included. I guess I'm not so superficial anymore. I'm really tired of the hookups, but really it's mostly what I've gotten. I have had several female friends that I knew were into me, but I wasn't into them. I could never meet someone I was both attracted to and had a good relationship with. I have had way, way, way too many sexual partners and will never tell a woman my real number. I don't have any STDs though.\n\nMost people I know got married in their teens or early twenties, and already have teenagers of their own now. I never did. It's also very hard now because women in their thirties generally want a surrogate father figure, even if they don't have kids. They want someone \"mature\" and not someone to really get to know on a deep level, at least from my experience. The ones I've talked to are boring and just want to nest up somewhere and eventually have kids. It's superficial on a different level, a family level.\n\nI'm sure it's a commitment issue as I'm deathly afraid of knocking up some terrible, evil person. I am from a divorced family so that's probably why, and my sisters both had kids before they were 18. I didn't want to \"have to\" work and just spend my days supporting a stranger and our lovechild. I'm not very religious even though I grew up that way, so I'm not really seeking marriage, just someone I really love.\n\nTL;DR: I had a crisis about relationships and not being as attractive as I used to be. I'm working on it but still have a problem with just getting hookups and not meeting people I really get along with. I'm working on just talking to people and trying to show interest without being flirty or sexual since I'm apparently some kind of man candy women can't resist. Or was at one time. I also have commitment issues.",

            "This is amazing. I had this same crisis happen and I attempted to explain my struggles with my husband, but instead he went off the deep end and got intensely abusive. Took our 2 year old son and wouldn't tell me where he was for 48 hours. I had started therapy to explore these feelings about a month before I broached this subject with him and she spent the entire time easing me into the realization I was already in a dangerously abusive relationship that I was blind to from overrationalization and childhood trauma. \nHe had solicited prostitutes while I was pregnant multiple times and when I found out, we went to couples therapy to \"work it out\" and I swallowed my pride for my son and tried to salvage the relationship but I never recovered emotionally from it. After 2 years I had had enough of the covert abuse and having my eyes opened by my therapist, I've now spent almost 2 years trying desperately to separate myself from him but he continues to drag out the legal process and use my son as a weapon. \nI am so glad this worked out for you and this was the only kink in your relationship. I forgave everything he did along the way for the sake of the relationship and it set a never ending precedence that he could continue to up the ante by tiny increments all the way to total betrayal and I still got forced to forgive until I just couldn't anymore. Keep working on it. I hope some day my ex can grow and be a different, healthier person with his new life outside of mine. Today is not that day.",

        "selftext": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/bctq5b/my_28f_colleague_30f_didnt_invite_me_to_her/)  \n\n\nSo it took me a few days to decide the best way to approach this, but yesterday I had lunch with her again and had the conversation. \n\nI started by saying: \"So you've sent all your invitations out now, haven't you?\"\n\nShe looked immediately panicked by my question and I knew right away that she didn't want me to go down this road. \n\nWhen she said she had sent them all, I asked if that meant she could show me her venue now. \n\nShe showed me the website of it, including the photo gallery, and talked me through all about where everything was going to happen, all the flowers and decorations she was going to add etc. It's a nice enough country hotel with some pretty gardens, but I'm not sure what all the secrecy was for. \n\nI probed a little more, asking who she's invited from work (the list didn't include me), said I was looking forward to seeing the photos so I could see how everything looked (she didn't correct me that I would see it on the day) and then I was completely sure that my lack of invitation wasn't an accident. She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she's excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress. \n\nSo I'm definitely not invited. I thought it over carefully and I have decided not to ask why, for three reasons:\n\n1) The reason is already fairly obvious. She clearly doesn't think we're anything more than colleagues and I've misread the situation. (There were some other theories suggested e.g. jealous husband-to-be, associating me with her past grief, but considering everything I know about her and our history I'm sure it's not that.) I'm not sure why she didn't cool it on the wedding talk with someone she had no intention of inviting, or even just bring it up with me and explain why I'm not invited, but never mind.  \n2) Having an awkward relationship at work is the last thing I want. I'm worried that if I push this and turn it into an \"issue\" that I'll look pathetic and needy, or it will just be unprofessional. I also run the risk of her badmouthing me to colleagues and mutual friends, and I will find it much easier and less messy to handle my own feelings quietly.   \n3) This is a once in a lifetime experience for her, and I don't want to be the source of drama that dampens her spirits at all. I'd rather just let her enjoy her wedding, make good memories and not bring her down. \n\nAnd you know, I'm fine with not going. It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship. That's not all on her, because she was never obligated to be my friend.\n\nTalking it through on my previous post actually really helped me work through my feelings. When I went back to work on Monday I felt much calmer and more detached from it emotionally. \n\nI have looked back on our whole relationship and honestly she's always been self involved, entitled and narcissistic. Being a bride has just made it more obvious, but it's always been there. She's also never given back to me (besides helping me get my job, which of course I'm grateful for), in that she's never been willing to talk me through any problems I've had, and although I help her happily with her work, she says no if I ask her for help in return.\n\nShe has a few office enemies and even though I saw her negative traits that caused her to be disliked by some people, I overlooked them and defended her anyway. Now I have put a little distance there it's quite apparent that she's not a very nice person, and I'm genuinely OK with just moving on.\n\nShe hasn't really noticed the distance between us so far (or she has noticed and doesn't care/is relieved that I'm giving her space), so I intend to just continue with doing that. If she eventually asks why, or I get the sense that she's trying to rekindle our friendship, then it will be time to clear the air with how I've been feeling. If she doesn't and we just continue drifting, then that's probably for the best.\n\nIt's sad to lose a friend, and it will probably take me some time to get over it and to become comfortable with the change in our relationship, but I have other genuine friendships, and plenty of colleagues who are lovely people who I can get to know better now.\n\nThe main thing I really took from my original post, and I'm so glad I did post because I needed some tough love on this, is that my fear of confrontation really needs dealing with. \n\nIf I can learn how to better speak my mind as things are happening, that will stop things from building and building until I have to have a Serious Conversation and it makes what should have been a molehill into a mountain. \n\nI also need to figure out how to have difficult conversations without having an anxiety attack, which not only weakens my message but is extremely distressing and puts me off dealing with things and being honest with people. \n\nI had a couple of books on assertiveness recommended to me, so I've bought them to start me off. I'm also looking into going to a coach, or maybe a couple of therapy sessions at least, to try and better myself. I don't want to hurt other people by doing this, so this has become top priority for me. \n\nThank you so much everyone who pointed that out to me. I was aware of it but I didn't think it was a problem and figured I'd just be that way all my life. Now I know better. Thank you for being so honest with me.\n\nAlso thank you to those who talked me through the one-sided friendship issue. I'm a good listener and have always attracted people who need to vent, but I only ever noticed the one-off conversations, and didn't think I was being taken advantage of as a long term listening ear.\n\nI have been examining my other friendships in the last few days, to see if anyone else is using me in the same way, or if I've even been doing this to others and not had the self awareness to realise. There are a couple of changes I need to make, including a friendship that I need to set some boundaries in, and another one where I've not been giving back to the other person as much I should have. I have learned a really valuable lesson from this about maintaining healthy relationships, and I'm very grateful for that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR So I'm definitely not invited, our friendship is likely over (but that's actually OK) and I'm going to work on my assertiveness so I can handle things like this better next time. I'm also going to move forward having learned a good lesson about friendships being two-way.\n\nEdit: A few people have been asking about the books I was recommended:\nNonviolent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg\nWhen I Say No I Feel Guilty by Manuel J Smith\nWhy Men Love Bitches by Sherry Argov",

This isn\u2019t to blame you for her actions and how she treated you, but it sounds as if you had more than a few red flags and big clues about your relationship that you ignored because you were desperate for her to be something more to you. You were, to a large extent, using her for validation. \n\nAnd instead of acknowledging that, you\u2019ve shifted the blame on her for being a narcissist.

You put a label on her that she never wanted. You assumed a lot of things about your relationship and once you figured out you were wrong, you point out everything bad about her to justify why you were in this position. Why has this entire situation has been turned about her acting this way because she specifically is taking advantage of you and she specifically is being mean towards you. \n\nYou will continue to repeat this cycle until you stop over examining others and get into your own head in a serious way. \n\nYou keep saying you were taken advantage of and I don\u2019t really see how you were beyond sometimes talking her through her issues. Which, it sucks to play therapist for people who don\u2019t reciprocate. But that\u2019s very low ball taking advantage of. Unless she forced you into that position, you made the choice yourself. You had the poor boundaries and it is your job to enforce your own. \n\nThere will always be people who are poor at reading situations and other people. There will always be people who want to vent to someone that they shouldn\u2019t vent at. There will always be people who will over share and talk their head off. \n\nIt is completely up to you to set boundaries and not drag another persons personality through the mud to prove to others (all of reddit in this case ig) how you were taken advantage of in such a vague way.

A good friendship is of benefit to both parties. \n\nIf you think someone was just a \"fairweather\" friend who wasn't there when you truly needed them, chances are you weren't there for them when they needed it either. (This obviously isn't the case with you however.)  We can't just be drains on our friends.  If they need to put work into supporting us, they need to be getting something back out such as companionship, respect, etc.  Your friend was a drain.  You had rose coloured glasses and failed to see for a long time how little you were getting in return.\n\nI had a similar friendship to yours.  I gave my friend a lot.  Found him an opening at my company.  Hosted his wedding at my home, etc.  One day I realized that I wasn't getting much in return.  Just a friendly smile and a nod.  One day I realized that we only ever spoke if I took the initiative - if I called him.\n\nI conducted an experiment... One day when the situation aligned in such a way as it was more appropriate for him to be making the call than myself, I waited for the call and I DID NOT reach out.  The call never came.  Five years went by.\n\nI bumped into him at a food court because we work near each other.  He was all excited and said we should catch up and do lunch.  I agreed.  We confirmed all our contact information and I made it clear that he needed to call me to setup the lunch because my schedule was more flexible and accommodating.  He agreed.  The call never came. Two years have gone by.",
            "you're patting yourself on the back for still not directly asking her, assuming her reactions and responses confirm you're not invited, and then declaring her a narcissist. you still don't know if you were invited and there was a mistake or if there was a not shitty reason that she didn't invite you. \n\nyou twist yourself in every possible way instead of just asking her and then congratulating yourself as the bigger person. you're exactly where you were last post.",
            "You get an A+ in being a grown up about all this.",
            "You are such a kind and genuine person. \n\nI\u2019m not, so give me the address of your office and I will spell out the situation so Tootsie can be made aware of exactly how awful her behavior is. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve to even breathe the same air as you.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f",
            "This is the most mature, healthy and self-aware response I think I've ever seen in this sub. Congrats on being an awesome human! I read your original post but didn't comment because I felt like people who had already made comments had covered all the things I would have said anyway. Thanks for the update and have a great day friend :)",
            "I\u2019m really grateful I found this post.  Your update was amazing.  How very big of you to come to these conclusions.\n\nI too have been in similar situations with friends and over the last few years have taken a step back from several people for the same exact reasons.\n\nPeople responding to your post saying \u201cThis is on YOU.  She NEVER said she was going to invite you.  You are over thinking this!\u201d  are wrong.  Reciprocity is everything in relationships.  Or you are just a sociopath.  Like, text book definition sociopath.\n\nWhen you sit with someone and be their bestie for YEARS, helping them through hard times, then listening to every agonizing detail about their wedding (when they were invited to yours and ATTENDED) it IS a slap in the face not to be invited, especially since other people at the company were invited.  That\u2019s BS.  I guarantee the people that were invited weren\u2019t THAT high on the ladder that your friend thought they would give her a house for a gift.\n\nWhich tells you exactly what you came to conclude:  this has been one sided.  Which makes you reconsider how much time and energy you want to give this person in the future.  Which is a fantastic realization!  She\u2019ll feel that the waters have cooled, but she won\u2019t care or consider her actions.  \n\nYou were a great friend to her!  And are very giving.  That is something we have to all look at with all of our relationships.  If you are doing all the work and the other party is doing all the taking\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.it\u2019s not equal.  And you can find other equal friendships out there.\n\nI was struggling today a bit myself with a work friend I\u2019ve had for years who was recently very insulting to me.  And then I realized how she\u2019d been insulting to me for YEARS and I had just put up with it because we were besties at work.  I called her on it and she did NOT like that.  We have not spoken in several days and I was feeling rough about it this morning.  \n\nI am no longer feeling so bad after reading your post and how you dealt with this entire situation.  This whole post and all the replies reminded me where I need to actually be putting my time and resources.",
            "You sound really level headed OP and your response has been very mature.\nIt\u2019s ok to feel hurt by this. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if your head keeps circling back to it time and time again.\n\nA similar thing happened to me in my office in 2005, and you know what? Those people are distant memories but I can still get a pang over why I was excluded that way.\n\nYou sound like the sort of colleague/friend someone would be lucky to have.",
            "If it makes you feel better I had a similar type of friend laugh at me when I saw party favors from her wedding I was never invited to and asked what they were from. \"My wedding, duh\". The look on her face after I said I wasn't invited made up for the snub.",
            "You handled this more thoughtfully than most of us probably would have. I admire your introspection and restraint in dealing with her. You sound like a lovely person who would be a great friend to have. You deserve friends who give as much to you as they get. I think I would be happy to count you a friend if had the opportunity.",
            "Bravo OP!\n\nThis is the precise update I would want to read. Youve looked within and found some liberating - if initially sad- truths.\n\nYoure a class act and im as proud of a complete stranger as i can be of you. Magnificent.",

            "Thank you for the update.  You sound like an *incredibly* self-aware, balanced and lovely person. I'm so sorry it went down like this but this is a friendshit dealbreaker; a gift wrapped in a super shitty package... you can now be free to pursue other/more-fulfilling/balanced friendships. I just hope you stand your ground and don't give her anything more than what a work colleague would. Don't ask her about her wedding/ honeymoon and if she tries to talk about it, shut her down \"i'm sorry... i have a ton of work to do\". She doesn't get any more of you from now on.",

Not only are you clearly there for your friends and help them with any problem, you have the ability to recognize flaws in yourself, admit to them, and work at being better. Seriously you are on a great track and you will attract amazing people just by being who you are! Not everyone is able to analyze situations/relationships this way and hold such composure. You should feel proud of yourself for how you handled this situation. It is rare that people let experiences like this actually teach them a lesson about others and themselves, too many people enjoy playing the victim and/or making things into a bigger deal than they need to be",
            "I was so surprised with the way you handled things. I felt so bad for you when I read the original post and would have probably been way more childish dealing with something like that. Losing a friendship always hurts because it is so personal. You handled it like a pro. Good luck bettering yourself!",
            "I'll probably get downvoted to the basement, but there are numerous reasons to not invite someone to a wedding, and rarely are they personal. Limited space, large needy family, controlling partner.... I'd say from the very fact she was so willing (and even excited) to share her plans with you it is very likely NOT personal. She wouldn't be comfortable doing so with someone who she wasn't, well, comfortable with. And while it may change the lense through which you view your relationship I don't see why it would inevitably end your friendship for good or why it would make things strained at work. \n\nIt's all about where you want to take it, obviously. But it doesn't seem, from what you've said, that SHE means to take it to \"we aren't friends we we're never friends we are never going to be friends\". \n\nGood on you for not wanting to put a drama damper on her once-in-a-lifetime event. But one way to clearly deal with the situation would be to talk to her about it a couple months after the fact. \"When you didn't invite me I took that to a hurt place and it bothered me to that point that I still want to know why.\" \n\nWhen we are hurt it is very easy/natural to assign all sorts of motives and try to counter out hurt feelings with \"I didn't want to go anyways, she's a narcissist\" etc.\n\nAgain. Downvote to hell. But.... It's about perspective.",

I would say that I am an assertive person, but if somebody that I am close to didn't invite me to an important occasion, then I would simply take the hint and not bother to ask. It's not that I want to avoid a confrontation, it's that the other person should offer an explanation without me prompting for it.

Her daughter is 6 now and she isn't even FRIENDS with that girl anymore. At the time her daughter was born, we'd been friends for 20 years! She knew I was super offended but I never said a word. Over time I got over it. We're still friends now.",
            "You handled this so gracefully. \n\nNot only was this an opportunity for you to learn more about your friendship (or lack of, I guess) but you took the time to reflect inwards and realize that friendship should be a 2 way street and you deserve more! You didn't become petty or hold a grudge just because you didn't get an invite. In fact, you still want this to be her special day.\n\nYou are an amazing friend and I hope you find someone else at work that you can bond with.",
            "I feel you there. \n\nOn a similar vein, I told my friends to not feel obligated to add me to their wedding party because I already knew how awkward it could be to have to decide those things. \n\n\nThey all really appreciated me saying that but still added me to their wedding party, ironically enough.",
            "Good luck with everything, it sounds like you made a rational and reasonable call.  Sorry it sounds like the friendship was so one-sided, but now you know, and you salvaged the work dynamic in the process.",
            "Wow thank you for this bittersweet update. Although I cant imagine working that closely with someone for two years and not developing a good friendship with them.  I can relate to you in a way that I feel like I'm not as assertive and I feel like I get taken advantage of at work. What were the books that were recommended to you?",
            "OP You\u2019re a nice person. I\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t invite you and I guess she didn\u2019t value the friendship. Time to apply the golden rule, and keep your head held high.",
            "I don't get it though.\n\nYou eat lunch together. Known each other since you were children. Went to the same school. And she helped you get her..her current job.\n\nIf you haven't done anything negative to her...you deserve to be invited or at the very least you deserve an explanation.",
            "I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re not just work colleagues, you said in your OP you were *lifelong friends*. You had every right to tell her that she has been tactlessly parading her wedding details in front of you with no intention of inviting you, and that is textbook poor etiquette.",
            "You\u2019re amazing ... she sounds like a real tool. Very grown up response. You clearly have a lot of integrity. However can I suggest making friends with her office enemies ????",
            "Could you tell us what assertiveness books were recommended please?",
            "I hate to mention this, since you've handled this so very well, but even though her behavior gave you clues, you still can't be sure that you were deliberately not invited.  If you tried using Non Violent Communication with this you might say something like, \n\n\"Hi, I feel confused that I haven't gotten an invitation to your wedding and I have a need for understanding.  Would you be willing to take a few minutes to talk to me about this?\"\n\nThen you simply listen without judgement.  After she says whatever she says (there may be good reasons why you weren't invited or there may have been an error) then you thank her for being willing to communicate honestly with you and exit.  \n\nAt this point, you know a lot more about the situation and it may make it easier to move on without baggage.  You probably want to give yourself lots of empathy, but, as you already know, you'll be completely OK, no matter what she has to say.  Trying to imagine why she wold act like this is probably a lot more painful than dealing with the truth, which may be that she's simply not the person you thought she was.",
            "Thanks for your update. The thoughtfulness and care you have taken in examining the situation and your friendships more broadly is an inspiration to me.",

            "You have a good attitude about this. Seriously. I had kind of the opposite thing happen...a friend that I became close with through work chose not to show up to my wedding and went to a movie instead...despite acting excited and despite the fact that we hung out outside of work several times a month. I noticed her absence and it hurt my feelings, but I didn't want a fight associated with my wedding. I let it go. I still wonder why she made that decision and I definitely put distance between us after that and today we aren't friends. But honestly, having those negative memories around a wedding just wasn't worth it to me. You did the right thing.",
            "You are so compassionate and kind. The thought you put into this is truly lovely. I commend you for not pushing the issue. It's her loss for not realizing what a great friend you are.",

            "I can completely relate to this. My colleague and me joint project manage our small team. It's a lot of responsibility and we have to work very closely together. She got married this Saturday. Not only was I not invited, I wasn't even told she was engaged. She invited other people from our office and our manager, who she always complaining about. I dont know what I've done wrong. She is back in work after a week off on Tuesday and I have no idea what to say to her",
            "I had the exact same thing happen to me in college. Had this girl who was in every one of my classes, we worked together and studied together. When she got engaged I thought for sure I was going to her wedding because she would tell me every detail of her wedding planning. Never got an invite. It really hurt me but I never confronted her because I had low self esteem. I still don't really understand why but I definitely feel like I never clarified how important her relationship was to me. She was my only friend and I was probably just a colleague.",
            "Wow - a great well reasoned approach to a common but complicated problem. Very instructive, very informative - I wish you well in your future endeavors.   That said what excites me about this for you is the idea of rebirth and retooling.... I think you are about to build a better you and that\u2019s great.",
            "As many other people have said, your reaction is incredibly well measured and mature. I honestly don't think I would have the gumption to respond so well. You're a good friend, even if other people aren't good friends to you.",
            "I got into a small argument with my two best friends (twin sisters) a week after I got engaged (which was planned 6+ months in advance). One of the girls had gotten engaged a couple months before me and had already started being a bride I\u2019ll, refused to pick bridesmaids but still expected people to start helping her plan, etc. I actually cried tears of joy when she told me she was engaged, dropped everything to take photos of her and her fianc\u00e9 for a social media announcement, and made her a basket with her favorite snacks and a bunch of bridal magazines the day after her engagement. \n\nWhen I announced my engagement, I got no such response. We got into an argument about me being left out of a big group hang out, and it turned into a vicious fight. I said some things I regret (they were true, but not worded too kindly) and then proceeded to apologize for THREE MONTHS. I even left a bridal catalogue and a note on the girls car. I stopped trying, and watched as 17 years of friendship went down the drain. \n\nStepping back, I realized just how one-sided the friendship truly was. I would drop everything for them (bringing one sister ingredients in the middle of the night (we were pastry chefs), leaving my physical therapy appointment early to bring the other one gas (because she constantly ran her car to empty)), and they wouldn\u2019t do the same for me. They put me down, to the point where I was incredibly self conscious of my every move around them.\n\nI had to go through my biggest steps in life (wedding, buying a house, etc) to date without a best friend by my side. I avoided the sisters\u2019 social media like the plague-accidentally seeing a wedding photo of the one sent me into tears. Luckily my husband and I have been together a long time and he\u2019s always been my rock. My point is-you will recover from this. You will be better off from this. You will be stronger for this.",
            "You are so emotionally mature in your handling of this. Good for you. It's a learning experience for you, now you know where you stand. I've had similar experiences, and have always felt better once things are out in the open. It hurts at first, but it sounds like you're a really good friend, and deserve friends that put as much into your relationship as you do. \u270c\ufe0f",
            "I too have learned something from your experiences (I too hate having confrontational conversations and need to build some courage) and know that it is a good thing to have some better insight about my friendships and to have self awareness within them. Good luck OP!!",
            "I feel so bad for you. I overvalue people and relationships all the time. I misread the situation and then get hurt realizing that we\u2019re just colleagues and not friends:(",
            "The thing with weddings is, if it\u2019s not yours.. who cares? I try not to be offended when I\u2019m not invited to weddings I feel that I *should* have been invited to, because I realise the stress that comes with culling a guest list. It\u2019s very possible you were on the initial list but didn\u2019t make the cut. I can\u2019t hold that against anyone. I can\u2019t imagine how hard those decisions are. You really went the right way about this, but I would definitely stress that wedding invites hold no bearing on your actual friendship.",
            "I think your attitude towards the whole situation is very admirable and enlightened.   You could waste the next few months pondering about something you have no control over, or move forward with your life.

            "You handled it perfectly. Not too probing but just enough that you got your suspicions confirmed and you made her squirm a little. You have taken a giant step forward in your life!",
            "You sound like a remarkably kind person, and have handled this better than many people would. I hope you have a good support system, because you deserve it. This is a heartbreaking thing to have to go through, but you deserve healthy and strong friendships, and this clearly wasn't one.",
            "I had an on-again off-again friend all through middle school and high school that would always use me to complain to. I thought I was getting something out of it but when I would try to talk about something going on in my life she would stop talking long enough for me to explain and then go right back to what she had been talking about (usually a boy she was obsessed with). We would get really close and hang out a bunch and then drift apart for a while. My now husband was always skeptical of our friendship because he could see right through her. A few years after high school we rekindled our friendship and it finally clicked that she was only interested in me listening and providing feedback on her life, but not the other way around. I probably should have told her I no longer wanted to be friends but I'm super nonconfrontational so I just deleted/blocked her on all social media and haven't seen her since. It didn't help that when we did hang out the last time I told her about something that had happened to me and she told a bunch of people and it came back around to me.",
            "OP, you seem like a fantastic human. Wishing you many happy celebrations with good friends who cherish your kindness.",
            "One of my ex friends was very narcissistic to the core very selfish full of herself plus on top of that she was also a drug addict \n\nI kind of was like in your position minus the wedding she had her enemies and people saw threw her bullshit except I was the one who defended her character and choices I felt sorry for her i wanted her to be liked though after dealing with her for 10 plus years I realized that in fact I was enabling her behaviour and after so much drama including stealing her landladys vodka and liquor and attacking a woman with her child I was done I couldn't due it anymore \n\nSometimes we are so focused on feeling sorry for them that we don't really see the toxicity till the drama starts to unfold I eventually dropped the friendship but it's incredible the control and clibglyness and damage that narcissistic people can do to us",
            "I think your approach to this is great. In the end, what would confronting her really do? I think distancing yourself is probably for the best.\n\nI keep my home and professional life as separate as possible so it's easy for me to see how she thought she could talk to you about this stuff because you're her \"work friend\" and she leaves that friendship behind when she goes home. Not saying that's cool or not hurtful but I can see how it happens.\n\nPerhaps the people she invited from work were because she thought it would be good for her career, like if they are higher up or influential. Either way, it's completely acceptable to not want a friend like that in your life.",

I\u2019m very much the \u201ccaregiver\u201d type and recently realised someone was just taking full advantage of that and dumping all her issues on me. It was when she would start happily coming round for dinner without offering to help / bring anything / pick anything up and just freeload off us that I realised the phasing out needed to begin.",
            "I really admire your ability to set aside your own feelings and let this be about her day and her wishes. That is super conscious of you! And it is great that this has helped you see her for who she really is and is probably saving you a big headache down the road.",

            "We had a hard cap for wedding attendees due to the venue.  By far the worst part of the wedding/wedding planning was deciding who could go or not go.\n\nI didn't invite any coworkers even though I technically knew them far longer than some attendees.  That's just the way it goes.  I can't invite everyone who I would like to.  I've similarly been not invited to some weddings simply because they couldn't get me in, even though they wanted to.  (I later got an unsolicited apology letter from them).\n\nSo I sympathize with both sides.  I wouldn't judge against the person for not inviting you since it's 100% their call.  (their including the spouse BTW).  It is fair to reevaluate the friendship of course.\n\nOne last thing:  I know for a fact that there are people who really wanted to come to our wedding who weren't invited.  \nI'm not happy about it either but life is full of tough choices.",

She looked so relieved when I switched subject and asked if she\u2019s excited about her honeymoon and having a rest from all the wedding stress.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a really blunt person, but I would not have understood that exchange as to be about not being invited.

Odds are most people have a regret or two in terms of someone they left off their list (I have one that bothers me all the time).  Maybe you'll be that person for her. \n\nKudos to you for your attitude about a tough situation.",

Similar in that I thought the other person regarded me as highly as a friend as I regarded the other person, which they didn't. And I slowly (very slowly) learned that actually, he/she is a very nice person, smart and witty, caring and nice, and those are 100% my judgements of them and me thinking those things in no way changes how they think of me.\n\nI and only I am responsible for what I expect from people.",

I am now able to have hard conversations without immediately bursting into sobs so intense I hiccup for breath and it has been LIFE-CHANGING. I hope with all my heart you're able to experience same.\n\nTL;DR You seem like an amazing person. Best of luck in all things in the future!",
            "This lady sounds like a bad \"friend\". I'm glad that you're fully aware of this now. Just rip the bandaid off. If she asks why you've drifted apart (i.e., you've stopped supporting her), I would not recommend explaining it to her, since I do not think you are going to get anything out of that conversation. This kind of transgression will take time and energy for her to sort out, and you've put in enough on this relationship already. \n\nSo feel your feelings, make progress for tomorrow!

            "I think you handled this with so much dignity and maturity. You\u2019re right, at this point it doesn\u2019t really matter what the specific reasons were. All you need to know is that the friendship wasn\u2019t reciprocated in the way that you thought, and it\u2019s healthy to recognize that and move on.\n\nFrom one \u201cgood listener\u201d to another, I also want to caution you to evaluate why it is that you assume this role in so many friendships. I was someone who often found myself in situations like this, where I came to resent the other person for essentially using me as a soundboard and not investing anything back into me. But what i realized was that my intentions were also a bit selfish. Being a \u201cgood listener\u201d was a way that i believed would help me earn favor with other people, and it made me feel special and validated to be someone\u2019s confidant. I\u2019ve never been good at talking about myself and am a bit guarded, so it was just more comfortable for me to assume that role and hope that this alone would earn respect and brownie points (for lack of a better word) with potential friends. It would hurt when I would find out that I didn\u2019t mean that much to people and that they were just using me, but how could I expect them to feel a closeness to me when I never really asserted my own personality Into to our friendship? I would blame the other person for barely knowing anything about me, when it was sort of my fault for making the entire friendship about them. And like I said, my intentions were partly selfish, so when I felt like I wasn\u2019t getting the treatment I felt I deserved back, I would get bitter and resentful and blame those people\u2019s perceived lack of character. It\u2019s something I still work on today, so I just wanted to point it out in case it was something you could relate to. \n\nAgain, though, you sound like an amazing person and friend who many people would be lucky to have.",

The fact he refused to extend an invite to my fiancee (because he hadn't met her) confirmed to me that we're done. I won't ever tell him that, because like you, what's the point? I don't want to spoil the day. And mentioning it now will forever do that.\n\nI commend you for handling it how you did and I actually think you've dodged a bullet.",

Good luck although you won't need it.",

It was never really about getting invited to a wedding, it was more having to face the fact that I'd been naive and taken for granted, and I felt silly that I'd invested way too much in this relationship.

(Much as she might deserve it, it would only make you look bad.) You might seek out info about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  I think it gives a framework for the type of behavioral changes you showed interest in.  A little work now in therapy could serve you for a lifetime.  It can help you to not fall into your old pattern with her as well.  I think you are smart in showing gratitude for the job referral, and for not gossiping about her in the workplace.

Rest easy in that you don\u2019t have to spend any more energy with keeping a friendship that was one-sided.  Your time & energy is better spent on those who you know value you, but perhaps who is a good friend that values you is something you\u2019re already evaluating.",

Perhaps that\u2019s what happened with you, but my god for her to keep talking to you about it the way she did just goes to show how ignorant she is to the feelings of others!!! The friends who I couldn\u2019t invite I either spoke to directly and they understood, or there were a few who I just stopped mentioning it to them and let them figure it out on their own (these were just barely friends, almost more acquaintances). \n\nProps to you for handling all of this the way you have! You are very clearly the kinder person here, and who knows maybe distancing yourself from someone who has that type of personality will open doors for yo unto become friends with some coworkers who didn\u2019t want to associate with a friend of \u201cthat\u201d person.",

Like they didnt think I would be very fun to be around, which I dont get. I am quiet sometimes but I've had decent conversations with all of them and made them all laugh at various points. I dunno.\n\nBut you're doing the right thing ignoring it and moving on.\nI wish I didnt know as much as I do.

            "I wouldn't take it to heart. I don't think she intends to hurt you. Weddings are expensive and having limited seating can be an issue. I know for me personally I'm not inviting about 75% of my family to my wedding because they are not that close to me and didn't see my relationship with my partner evolve. And it's hard to think of how they may respond when some relatives get invitations and not others. But then I have to remember that I've had dozens of cousins get married and I didn't even find out till I saw wedding pics on Facebook. I wasn't hurt but mostly because I haven't talked to them in years. In your situation I know you considered your coworker a friend. And maybe she doesn't view the relationship the same. It's good to find a new perspective and redefine your relationship with her.",
            "Taking the high road ! Can never be a bad idea.  Good for you !  Buy be ready to answer the questions from other invited co-workers after the wedding when they ask you why you weren't there.  The truth is the obvious answer. \"I wasn't invited.\"",
            "I have been you.  Seriously, I could have written this about 8 years ago about someone I had considered to be a very close friend.  Looking back, I realized she treated me more like her \"less than\" sidekick than anything like a good friend.  \nI am telling you, it feels so good to hold others accountable for their actions by standing up for yourself.   That doesn't even mean it has to be a confrontation, either... Just choosing to not allow people to treat you in a way that you're not okay with by distancing yourself emotionally and/or physically is a huge thing.  You can't pour from an empty vessel. \nGood on ya, lady.   \nFeel free to message me if you ever need.",

If I were you I would even look for a new job elsewhere, make new friends, and never give her another second of your time. Nothing worse than ungrateful people who just see you as a pawn in their little selfish bubble of a world and yet they string you along in case they need a favor from you down the road or someone to dump their problems on. They're too afraid of being disliked so they pretend to like everyone even if they don't. Honestly I'd have a hard time not cussing her out and calling her out on her BS. Start a new life, with her OUT OF IT completely.",

I hope not to offend anyone with this decision that I want. I was the same way with graduation parties, only having 12 people invited.

I\u2019m in a long term relationship and he was too, it was always transparently platonic but we clicked really well. He talked to me all about his plan to propose and then their wedding planning. I was pretty shocked and hurt when he told me he wasn\u2019t able to invite me. I honestly felt like I really should have. But I didn\u2019t push the issue because of basically all the reasons listed in this post. What\u2019s the point? What\u2019s done is done and I don\u2019t want a pity invite anyways.
