So this wasn\u2019t a terribly popular post but I just wanted to share the happy ending. \n\nThe evening after I wrote this post, I went over to his house after work and we hung out and ate and stuff. While we were just laying on the bed, he faced me and said \u201cbaby, there anything I can do to be better for you?\u201d. It was the perfect opportunity to share how I felt about that. So I just went ahead and said \u201cidk if you know you still do this but you check out a lot of people when we\u2019re out together. Mostly woman and I worry that it sexualises them and it makes me uncomfortable.\u201d He seemed a little fake surprised and was like \u201creally? Oh I didn\u2019t know I did it so much and so obviously.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to push the agenda so much because I know he\u2019s a thinker and will think about it even if we don\u2019t discuss it further.\n\nThe next day, we were on our way back to his house and there was a girl walking towards us who was quite beautiful. I saw him glance at her then he turned and looked at me and I was already looking at him and we both burst into laughter. I said to him that I see that he\u2019s struggling and we just laughed it off but he very clearly got the message because since then I haven\u2019t seen any overt staring at both men and women.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me to confidence to deal with this head on.\n\nTLDR managed to speak to my bf about this issue and I\u2019ve seen effort from him dealing with him",

            "Unfortunately we all notice attractive people, but it\u2019s all in how you react to it. It sounds like he\u2019s more aware of it and if he can be more aware that a few moments of checking someone out is not worth the insecurity you will feel, then I think you\u2019ll be all right!  \n\nI really like how receptive he was to this though. This is a good sign for future communication! My husband and I have been together eight years and have had to have some uncomfortable conversations but it\u2019s all in how you approach it and how you react to their response.",
            "I was married to a man that did this. It was very hurtful and no matter how many times we talked about it he carried on. Turning his head to get a better view of waitresses butts and staring at any attractive woman. When we were breaking up we got therapy and he said he had been doing it on purpose. I\u2019m glad your guy has been sensitive and made efforts to change.",
            "There are a surprising number of comments trying to fault you for \"controlling\" him, or that perhaps you misunderstood - that he was just people watching.\n\nNothing you posted here or in your comments makes me think you're being controlling. I think you brought this up respectfully and you guys even had a laugh about it happening again. You did a good job bringing it up when you did and he received it well.\n\nIf it were just people watching, I think he'd have pushed back on it more. Just my opinion. He may not have thought about him self doing it, but when you brought it up clearly he reflected enough and came back in agreement with you. Shit happens. \n\nI wouldn't pay any mind to the passing comments saying you were being controlling or misunderstanding. I think you done good and he done good.",
            "Hey, good to know that you had a happy ending (if you can really call it happy. But good that you are so cool about it). My ex boyfriend of 1 year used to look at women when we were out there together and it bothered me so much. I first  checked it for a while if he does it to men and women, but in fact he never did it to men or any other people. Just women that looked good. I talked to him and it was a big drama and at the end I was apologizing. It was a fucked up abusive relationship and his reaction was \"i cant believe you even THINK that I'd be doing something like that in front you.\" Etcetc blablabla and it lasted hours. \n\nWe broke up recently and there were maaaany other problems, but I find it extremely disrespectful checking other women out when you're with your gf. It is already horrible when you're not with her, but with... come on. I think it doesn't take a lot to also realize \"hey my gf is by my side\" before staring these women. I really think it is not that hard.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I don't mean looking at other people. I mean really staring and checking them out. We all notice beautiful people of course, but I dont think you need to even turn your head back to realize it's a beautiful person. \n\nEven though my bf said he never did that consciously and that he would never do such things, after we had this talk he never did it again. All in all the problem left was his manipulations and blaming me bc of his shit etc",
            "Wait you mean this IS disrespectful behavior and i wasn't just trying to control my ex?? He made me feel like i was the one in the wrong for calling him out whenever he did this. *yes i realize it is ok to admire attractive people, i never said it wasn't.",
            "Why the hell don\u2019t people understand this.\n\nYes we are broken down to a biological level. But I am so tired of people using this as an excuse even in extreme situations such as cheating. \n\nYou have the highest cognitive functioning brain on earth, and yet you choose to explain your shitty choices on evolution and genetic conditioning that bodes no relevance to a person who can control themselves and is not a fucking animal flinging their shit around anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s garbage.",
            "Ahhh this is so wholesome! Your man evidently cares about your feelings so props to you both!",
            "Thank you for this post OP. i (22m) also checks out other girl when i was single, now that i got in a relationship not so long ago, i have been trying to maintain my glance regardless being with my SO or not. this post makes ma realize how my SO would feel and also let me know that i am not the only one out here trying to work on it. good to know there are other people who is getting rid of this bad habit that shows up without intention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngenerally makes me see things in a better way!",
            "I did this a lot in my last relationship and it was done in poor taste. Now, I\u2019ve made a more concerted effort to not sexualize every damn woman I see IRL and online. It\u2019s bad, and i had to stop once I realized it started leading to thoughts embarking on my relationship.",
            "Not to be a Debbie downer but my ex did this, and while it\u2019s true everyone finds other people attractive in a relationship - it\u2019s human nature, it should be obvious to control yourself and your \u201cgazing\u201d at other people while in a relationship... it shouldn\u2019t have to be a topic of conversation. To me it was a red flag, and a huge sign of immaturity. I\u2019m glad it worked out, he sounds receptive, but also be wary.",
            "I (23f) have the same problem, glad to hear that you sorted it out, but for me it didnt stop even after i told my bf that its uncomfortable and we are together almost 2 years. I started to think that im not good enough or he isn't ready for a long-term relationship...",

As a thinker myself, I tend to get into fight-or-flight mode when confronted with something directly, usually resulting in defensive behavior.  It's nice that you let him stew on this.",

No one's perfect, and we shouldn't expect a partner to be, but when someone acts the way your boyfriend has when faced with a problem in their relationship, that's a huge green flag. Great news, OP.",
            "I\u2019m really glad that we was understanding (as I feel he should be, especially since you brought it up respectfully and appropriately). He sounds like a good one. Good for both of you, OP. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Good job! I like how you handled this, very mature.",
            "That's awesome. I imagine it will be hard to stick with it for awhile cause at this point it's probably a habit. Breaking habits are hard. But I'm so glad he's trying his best. That means he really cares for you.",
            "You are doing awesome! Very patient and inspiring really. \nI\u2019ve heard it could take up to 3mos for people to change things like this... \nbless you both\u2764\ufe0f",
            "Hahaha. Reading all of these replies makes for a good laugh. Some of you talk like you can train men like dogs. Kudos to OP for trying effective communication. That is what adults do in a relationship. If you want things to work cut the games and start talking. If you decide that he won't change then you need to ask yourself... Is this the kind of man I want to grow old with? If there are doubts... Move on.",
            "Ahhh the classic \"top voted advice on original post was to end the relationship turns out to be wrong and the solution is open and honest communication with your partner and a willingness to grow together.\" Who could have seen that coming? /s\n\nGood on you for opening a line of communication with your partner, expressing your feeling and expectations, and being willing to work on it with them.",

            "I dealt with the same thing when my boyfriend and I initially began dating! I told him how I felt about it, and now, whenever other women are around, he\u2019ll hug up on me and kiss me in front of them to make me feel like I\u2019m the only woman he cares about. It\u2019s an amazing thing, and it makes me feel so loved and beautiful.\n\nGood on you for communicating OP, and good on your partner for being receptive to your concerns and actively trying to change for the sake of your happiness and security. Best of luck!",

            "I'm so glad you guys worked it out! Some people just don't talk at all and have their relationship end over something that could have been so easily fixed if they would've just talked it over for a few minutes. Unfortunately it's a human instinct to look at people who look good. It's not even only men who do so. Even women can do so. There are just a lot of people who don't do it. Or who do it without knowing it. \n\nGood luck together, hopefully he's the one and we'll see a wedding bells update in a few years ;)",
            "Good for you, I notice my boyfriend doing the same. I don't think he realises how obvious he is at times when checking out girls. He's improved over time, so I try and not let it bother me.",
            "I don't always call people out on things like this.\nI figure it'll only make them better at hiding it.\n\nInstead I take note of it, sit back and think weather I wanna be with someone like that or not.\n\nAfter all.....I don't want to 'teach' someone how to be a respectable person in a relationship. \n\nI'm looking for someone who already is. \n\n\n\nAlso I'm big on statistics and it shows that people that have a wandering eye are more likely to cheat.  At this point I start looking at all their behaviors and personality traits and weight the pros and cons on whether or not they're worth investing in.\n\n...... Something I should have done a lot more of throughout the course of my life and relationships.",
            "That\u2019s great that it is working out for you guys.\n\nMy wife and I check people out all the time, together.  We will comment on men / women.  Man, that guy is rocking some sexy forearms!  Man, that woman was beautiful!  Different strokes for different folks!",

            "It sounds like he handled what you had to say well, and is making an effort.\n\nI do feel for him in some ways, because as a man, there's just a totally involuntary reaction when you see a woman you find attractive.  I've caught myself and gone, \"Geez man, get it together!\" internally.  Obviously there's a whole range between noticing someone and outright ogling/catcalling, but on some level this is an instinctual thing.  Good for him for being willing to hear your critique and try to change his behavior to make you more comfortable.\n\nAlso, good on you for speaking up.  Sometimes you just have to be your own advocate and ask for what you want, and I'm glad you did.",

Most people don't take criticism very well, but I think he is really taking it to heart. That's good because it shows that he respects you as a partner and wants to make changes to make you feel more comfortable. Just remember to keep the line of communication open and healthy like this. This is a sign of a good relationship. He understood you weren't trying to make him feel like he was doing something wrong, just explaining how it made you uncomfortable.",
            "When i see someone attractive (regardless of gender) i feel like my sight automatically keeps shifting to wherever they are.

            "You handled it in such a great way. I especially admire how you know exactly how he processes stuff, that he'll digest it a bit at a time, so small bites are what he needs. I've had a partner or two like this (have one now, in fact) and it makes all the difference to respect that. I instinctively want to VOMIT OUT EVERY THOUGHT I'VE HAD ON A TOUGH SUBJECT during *hard discussion time* but I've learned it's a lot better for my partner and - this is the salient part - I get better results, when I just drop the acorns and let them germinate.  I shouldn't be surprised, he's a thinker in all aspects of his life.\n\nWe talk about Love Languages plenty (and I think it's really important) but it transcends just relating via love style, in my experience. It's important for intimacy and caring to learn communicating style, processing style, recharging style (this is the introvert vs extrovert thing) and so on. And OP, you did a great job here!\n\n...and of course, we should all expect that our partners want to put forth the same effort, getting to know our own quirks, too! That mutuality shows respect, dignity, and commitment to us as important individuals. And again u/admirableroof, I think that's exactly what your guy offered you when he asked what else he can do. \n\nSometimes how our partners handle concerns we have, speaks a lot louder than than addressing the actual concern.

Simply because your significant other may glance at another man or woman doesn't mean they are unfaithful though. I can however see how this would bother a majority of people though because it makes you question yourself and your partner as well. I would suggest talking to your partner. I firmly believe that open communication is a key to a lasting & trusting relationship. If the other person isn't aware of what their doing that may upset you then it will never get fixed. My last relationship of 8 years taught me the most out of any relationship and with that I have learned what to do and what not to do in the future.",

I've been with my ex for 12 years and my boyfriend for 3 years. Neither of them checked or check out women because they were/are like me in that regard. Probably because I am only attracted to other \"demisexual\" people so I've been with only 2 men and both of them were. I think if you don't desire other people in the street or wherever, and it feels really really negative and heart breaking to have a partner who does find others attractive... you need to try and date people with a bit more similar personality/sexuality to you. But sounds like you guys laughed it off and you're able to tolerate it. Perhaps you check the odd guy out too, I don't know. \n\nBut just wanted to say it's ok to be demi and to want a demi partner.

I asked him if he would be willing to go to therapy with me, and he refused. He told me when we first starting dating that he would never go to therapy, and I assumed he'd change his mind at some point because he would care enough about me and our relationship to work through the hard things in counseling. We see this all the time on this sub, but really, when people tell you who they are, believe them.\n\nRefusing to go to therapy really left me with the two choices of staying and having nothing change and being unhappy... or leaving. I opted to leave even though it was scary and so, so hard. The initial heartbreak is starting to fade, and I'm working on rediscovering myself. I know that I did the right thing for myself, but it was also the hard thing.\n\nI kept this throwaway account around, and I'm posting this update because I wanted to thank this community and the individuals who offered their input. I know I didn't comment on anything in my original post, but it was very helpful to have some outside opinions. I appreciate you all so much. Thank you for your advice and assistance when I was faced with a difficult situation.\n\nTLDR: I ended things because he refused to go to therapy with me to work on our issues.",

I\u2019m happy to hear you\u2019re doing better and hope you find someone that respects you enough to work with you.  My husband was a slob when we met... LIKE A HUGE SLOB!! When we moved in together, I let him know that I would not live in a pig sty and expected help.  It took some work, and I had to lower my expectations a little bit but he is way better.  I\u2019d say if I lowered mine 2 points, he raised his 8 points.  We celebrated 28 years recently because he cared about something that I cared about, a common thread in our marriage.",

            "You really had no other choice. He said he's not going to change. That's fundamentally unfair and shows he does not respect you. Get on with having a better life now.",
            "You're a good person. You were willing to work with him. You were willing to try. Sadly, he was not. You deserve better, and deserve a partner who may not be perfect, but is willing to work on a relationship rather than just coast. \n\nI know that my partner and I had to do some therapy to work out issues we've had, and I'm immensely thankful for her patience, and willingness to put in the time to learn to communicate with me better, while I put in the effort to listen more effectively. We've been able to grow and become stronger as a result. \n\nI hope that the next person you meet is willing to be that kind of person with you and that you'll have the strength and joy you deserve with your next partner.",

I also chose to break up with him - and let me tell you, though it hurt, it was the best goddamn decision in my life. \n\nShortly after, I found my literal soulmate and the best partner I could ever have asked for. \n\nMost importantly though, I got some newfound respect for myself by learning I could be independent and be totally fine. The fact that I had the guts to do something SO scary and still be okay - that gave me a lot of confidence in the end. \n\nI hope you get the same :)",

            "I just read your first post about this and i have to tell you, it's like reading a page out of my own life. BF says he doesn't help me clean cuz he doesn't care to, so i need to keep doing it because it's something i care about (same message, basically). I've never been so... disappointed. It's not so much that i \"care\" about cleaning. Cleaning is a part of a normal adult life. You clean because your apartment is lived in and it gets messy and dirty. You clean because it's healthy. So yeah, i guess i do care about these things, but it doesn't mean i \"like\" doing these things. \n\nThe only way i could put it in terms he might understand was that when we first met i didn't care about the things he cared about but, then i took time to develop an appreciation for these things and now i actually see the value in it (but I'm taking marvel movies, rpg's, video games, collectibles, not chores). i also told him that I'm in this relationship alone, it's not a partnership when one person does all the work. he seemed to understand and he's a little better with helping out but i still have to ask him to do obvious things like laundry. Honestly, i don't even want to ask anymore because I'd rather just do it then be disappointed it didn't get done after i asked him to do it then still end up doing it myself. \n\nIt's been over 6 years. Six. Years. I work full time, go to school full time, and I'm trying to get back to the things i need to do for myself but I'm always the one cleaning up, doing laundry, grocery shopping, taking care of the cat. You fucking name it... I do feel like his maid. I feel unappreciated. And it's never going to change. \n\nI wish i could do what you did. I wish i could put myself first. Congratulations!! Keep your focus, and do what's best for you. Maybe some day I'll post my own update.",
            "I celebrate the date I left my asshole ex every year!! It was the beginning of my life where I don't let people abuse me and treat me like shit.

            "No one ever said that \"easy\" and \"right\" were the same. Good on you for doing what's best for you.  Never forget that feeling of knowing the hard thing was right. It'll make similar choices later in life so much easier.",

Life is about relationships and the way you treat yourself is the way people will treat you!\n\nTreat yourself with respect , honor yourself and damn it love yourself how in the hell are you going to love someone if you don't love yourself.\n\nDon't carry these same bricks with you in your next relationship building another house with another person will not stand if your using the same bricks that you used in your last relationship so flush , smash and throw away everything that relationship brought you that person wasn't the bad person you were because you allowed someone to treat you like that well guess what those days are over as of now ! \n\nDon't beat yourself up and don't walk around acting like a bad ass be the real you kind, compassionate, loving life but don't bleed on the people who didn't cut you.\n\nYou are a good person you don't need to be the greatest just be the best you can be and show people how you want to be treated and if a boundary is crossed tell that person and if they ignore your wishes then it's time to ignore them.\n\nEveryday look in the mirror and say I'm alright , I'm going to be happy with myself and I'm going to heal. Say this until you fucking believe it don't let someone have the power to fuck up ur life.\n\nThere are 8 billion people on this planet now does it make sense to you that one of these 8 billion people has the power to fuck up your life , hell no!\n\nYour not a drop in the ocean the ocean is just one drop of you so heal , learn and be the greatest person that you want to be and when it comes to revenge kill those thoughts it's the person who treated you so badly who's going to realize that they screwed up.\n\nSo the time is now squirrel season is over your hunting bear!\n\nSo be kind to yourself and never stop loving life and those people who are lucky enough to be in it, okay?",

            "OP, it's only been a month. I think he might pop up in a little while begging you to come back. I really.hope you wont let him. If you do, the only thing he learns is that he can treat you like crap and *still* take him back. He's been this person for 35 years. For him to actually make real change would take incredible amounts of therapy. I don't think you should wait around on a 3% chance that he'll really change.",
            "I'm hoping he realizes his mistake and understands what a rational, understanding, and loving partner he has lost through his own selfish behavior. Hopefully he wont treat anyone else like that ever again.",

            "What does rediscovering myself mean? You mean you somehow lost yourself ?",
            "So I'm glad you got out of a toxic relationship. That being said why do people always think that they can change someone?  If you knew he wouldn't  go to therapy, for example it could be anything that a partner says they won't do, why would you think you can get them to change who they are.  While it is true that people can change most never will.  As soon as you find out that your partner won't  do something that may be important to you such as going to therapy or whatever then stop wasting both of your time and end the relationship. Sorry if this offends some of you.",

If ANYONE treats you like that, if they talk to you like that or make you feel creeped out...that is not acceptable.  Regardless of who they are, that is sexual harassment and possibly worse.  It can hard in this sexualized world as a young woman to find those boundaries.  Your brother just gave you a great example of zero tolerance of people who push your boundaries.

They would tell him things about my attendance, etc. The day I turned eighteen I got a notarized letter stating I did not want them to contact him ever or give him information about myself and gave it to every teacher and the administrative office. I understand yours does not have any legal guardianship over you, but I recommend your brother getting it in writing (and notarized) that they are to blacklist him. It's possible not every faculty member will know your situation and will assume it's okay to say something if he calls. It protects you so if they do slip up, you have proof they went against your guardian's wishes. Good luck to the both of you!",

Hes an amazing person and loves you... that's all the family you need. Don't be afraid to talk to him about anything or anyone that makes you feel uncomfortable in the future.. he's got your back and you were (by no fault of your own... you're only 16) in an incredibly dangerous situation.

I should have left that night. Not too long after posting that, the emotional abuse finally turned physical. I was held hostage in my home for over an hour while I was assaulted, demeaned, and scared for my life. I left that night. \n\nIt was a hard road. I\u2019ve questioned myself, my sanity, and sometimes even whether I did the right thing. Emotional abuse took a huge toll on my psyche and self-worth. \n\nI am happy to say, though, that life has drastically improved for the better. I bought a new home for my kids and I. We\u2019ve got a sweet dog and two precious kitties. My son just started 2nd grade and really enjoyed his first day. Everything is falling into place. I feel horrible for what I put them through, and I know there will probably be rough patches ahead, but we are infinitely better off than where we were. \n\nIf you read my original post and it resonates for you, please take the advice of the commenters. Get. Out. Leave. No one deserves that sort of treatment, and it\u2019s only going to get worse. \n\nTLDR; emotional abuse turned physical as many commenters feared, and I feel lucky to be alive. Emotional abuse is not a joke. But we\u2019re all doing well now, and life is looking up :)",

        "selftext": " Original TL;DR - It\u2019s always been my new husband and I\u2019s plan to spend our first Christmas Day just us - my mother initially had no issues, but recently has become annoyed about the situation and is suggesting that we\u2019re alienating ourselves and no longer see ourselves as part of the family owing to this and our previous decision to elope. Who is in the right?\n\nOriginal post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/a88m1g/is\\_my\\_24f\\_mother\\_56f\\_overreacting\\_about\\_me/).\n\nSo Christmas has been and gone, and there was a bit more drama than I wanted. After my original post I contacted my mother to reaffirm to her the reasons we wanted to spend Christmas Day itself on our own, and she said that she understood, and said she looked forward to seeing us on Boxing Day. However, a few hours later I got a call from my father asking why my mother was crying and saying that I\u2019d rung her up screaming and shouting about her interfering with our life. I said that nothing like that happened, and that it hurt that she was accusing me of that when I was just trying to be mature about the situation. My father sympathised, and said he\u2019d try to talk to her about it.\n\nI checked in frequently in the days up to Christmas, but my mother read and ignored my messages. Whenever I spoke to my father he said that she was telling him I hadn\u2019t been in contact and she was waiting for me to apologise, but he had seen that I was in her call and text history. He advised that visiting on Boxing Day might not be the best idea, but if it got to that stage he would visit us alone since none of this was our doing.\n\nWe had our own private Christmas Day, during which we found out that I was pregnant! We had started trying for our first child in secret a few months ago, but didn\u2019t suspect anything until I felt sick at the smell of turkey! We\u2019re going to keep this our little secret for the next few weeks at least with everyone, my husband\u2019s family included. I texted my mother to wish her a Happy Christmas in the morning, and sent another text in the evening asking if she still wanted us to go up to visit tomorrow - I got a one word reply, \u2018no\u2019. We took my mother at her word and we didn\u2019t visit the following day - I think she was expecting me to grovel at her feet begging for forgiveness, but that\u2019s not going to happen anymore. I called my father and told him that she had decided that we weren\u2019t visiting and it definitely wasn\u2019t on our end. He visited in the afternoon and brought the dog, and we all went for a walk instead of worry about what my mother was doing or saying to other people about it. Apparently a horde of her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things, but I\u2019m done worrying about what my mother says. I\u2019m not at this stage going to completely cut her off or say she can\u2019t see her future grandchild, but our relationship is definitely strained.  \n\n\nTL;DR - Mother tried to act like I was cutting her out when in reality she shut down and ignored me before telling me not to visit on the expected day. Had our own Christmas, and unexpectedly found out we were expecting our first child instead of sitting through an awkward day.",

            "I am really concerned about how much she is lying to your father, her *husband*. He also *knows* she is lying. And she told a pretty big lie to an entire group of friends. This is really troubling. \n\nBut wow, did you all handle the situation well! Wow! Great job there. I think she absolutely wanted you to grovel (what did she want you to apologize for anyway?), and you just went about your plans. I'm glad Dad followed through as well and visited. Just brilliant, calm, mature behavior shown by the three of you. \n\nAnd what a great Christmas gift! Congrats! ",
            "Congrats on your pregnancy! \n\nYou might find some good techniques on dealing with your mother and her obvious lying issues on r/justnomil",
            "Congrats on everything! A new marriage, and now a baby? This is a really beautiful time.\n\nNow the next bit. Take what anyone says with a grain of salt, me included. You know your relationship best.\n\nMy mother has done this to me as well. I tried for years to please her. Using that to go one, your mom probably doesn't see you as a person. She likely sees you as a resource of attention for herself. \n\nHaving your own life, and beginning your own family, might bring out the worst in her.\n\n... And having a father that \"gets it\" is both a good and strange sign. He can't rationalize with her. But atleast he won't abandon you.\n\nIf you suspect she'll get worse. I suggest you set your boundaries now. What are you willing to put up with? Possibly include your husband and father in the discussion.\n\nYour priority should be to protect yourself and your new family. If it continues, remember that you DO NOT need to please or include your mother. \n\nGood luck, and congrats again! ",
            "The second your mom finds out you\u2019re pregnant, she\u2019s going to act like nothing happened. Don\u2019t let her get away with it. She needs to be accountable for her lies.",
            "Do yourself a favor and do not just wait a few weeks to tell your family you're pregnant, wait longer. If possible, get the excitement and enjoyment of revealing your pregnancy to friends (who do not know your parents) whenever you get that itch.\n\nYou don't know how this pregnancy will make you feel yet (sick, fatigued, moody, etc.), so just spare yourself the effort of having to deal with your mother for as long as you can.",
            "Is the lying out of character for your mum? I've definitely met people who are oberdramatic, and would make a scene out of the visiting issue, but this is a whole other level. \n\nShe's been telling people that you sent back a shredded Christmas card?? What the fuck?? \n\nIf this is out of character, it might be a good idea for her to check in with a doctor. Behaviour like this could be a sign that something deeper is wrong. ",
            "Eventually she is probably going to try to make amends. Especially if she finds out you're pregnant. That's cool. But please keep this in mind:\n\n>my mother was crying and saying that I\u2019d rung her up screaming and shouting about her interfering with our life\n\n>her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things\n\nTAKE HER TO TASK FOR THIS\n\nDon't let her yadda yadda this shit. Don't let her pretend it didn't happen. Those are blatant lies and you should make her acknowledge each one: that she lied, that she slandered you, and that she did it on purpose. Trust in her needs to be rebuilt because now you and everyone else knows she's perfectly fine making shit up to try to get her way or shame her on daughter. ",
            "Congrats on both the pregnancy and the new shiny spine!\n\nYou and your husband (and your dad) did good against a full on toxic manipulation stunt with Christmas bells on. \n\nPeople in the original post suggested subs here you'll find useful but I think with a baby on the way you're going to need a bit more crazy-proofing. \n\nI don't want to armchair diagnose but I do get a strong Cluster B personality disorder whiff from your mom so I suggest you order a copy of 'Will I Ever Be Good Enough?' by Karyl McBride about the daughters of narcissist moms and also grab Shannon Thomas's book 'Healing From Hidden Abuse'. Both are about ten bucks each on Amazon and worth as much as a some professional therapy if not more if your therapist doesn't understand crazy making moms.\n\nThe best way to proof your new family against your mom is to understand that she wants a reaction more than a relationship and she will do anything for it. You will never understand why she chases that reuplsive high of attention and drama so much because you are not wired that way and would not treat your kid or anyone else like that. \n\nThe fact you don't understand her is what will ultimately proof you against her as long as you set your boundaries and stick to them. This may be very low contact, leaving the room when acts up, going full no contact or whatever works for you. That's a personal choice you make for you as one size does not fit all.\n\nBut be aware that she's likely to 'repent' when she finds out about the grandkid so she lulls you into a false sense of security where you tell yourself that she'll be different with junior because you want to believe your mom isn't toxic and you didn't suffer her shit yourself. \n\nAnd this is where you might need therapy as well as simply toxic proofing, you did suffer and she won't be different with your kid. She'll just use your baby as her newest source of drama and control because a person who treats their own child the way she has clearly treated you all your life isn't going to treat any other tiny baby better. People of any age are just objects for her unquenchable thirst for attention.\n\nAnd any time you try to tell yourself she'll be different this time I suggest you listen to the song 'The Snake' by Al Wilson and remind yourself predators cannot turn cuddly.\n\nI have a mother like yours and for me therapy, educating myself on Cluster B personality disorders and full estrangement was the only way to go. Cutting her off was the easiest bit though because the lack of drama was so restful. It was working through my childhood and dealing with the 'but faaaaaaaamily' folk that was hard. Both absolutely worth it though.\n\nGood luck!\n",
            "I was in a similar situation almost 25 years ago; my mother pulling some of the exact same crap. I would say that I wanted to spend the day with just my wife, and she acted like I shot her in the heart. Once, my wife bought a Christmas present for my mother that was more expensive than what she bought for me, let alone anybody else, and my mother responded by writing a group email to tell all about how her awful new sweater had a zipper instead of buttons, and how selfish I was. She would lie to friends about what we did with her for Mother's Day, etc. \n\nI wish I could say that my mother got better, but all that really happened is that I stopped putting up with it. I'd rather not talk to her than deal with that, and we really just exchange some texts. Oh well; I'm happier this way. Just stick to your guns and lean on your husband for support, like you have been doing.\n\nAlso: congrats on finding out about baby. What a Christmas present.   :)\n",
            "> Apparently a horde of her friends have been told that I shredded her Christmas card and posted it back to them among other things\n\nDid you give your mother a lot of attention before you got married? Because the only thing I can infer from this is that your mother is used to getting a lot of attention from you, and since you're now living your own life, her lies are a double-whammy to A) punish you for your independence, and B) get a new stream of sympathy. Because those are some pretty serious lies - not just, \"my daughter is refusing to spend Christmas with me because her husband is more important than her mother\", but \"my daughter is *abusing* me, and on *Christmas*!\"\n\nIf this truly is new and completely out-of-character behaviour for your mother, your dad should take her to a doctor to get checked out. Otherwise, maybe this new behaviour is her reaction to your new independence as an adult and a married woman (and soon-to-be mother!). Neither option is good and I'm sorry. But you, your husband and your father are handling it in exactly the right way. ",

            "First off congrats on the pregnancy! \n\nWhat fitting news to come of this tough situation. Your husband and yourself had to stick to your guns in instating new boundries for your new family. Looks like the family is growing. I'd like to imagine this news is a gift that you and your husband earned. \n\nI am very impressed in how you handled the situation. The lies and manipulation must have been hard to not engage in. I guess that's why people CHOOSE to engage in such a deplorable tactic. \n\nI'm glad your dad is making the choices he did. He also had to stick to his guns and I'm sure he's getting flak for it from your mom. I guess now we can all hope your mom will eventually get over her tantrum. \n\nI wish you and your family the best! Keep up the strong and mature effort!",

            "That's a...concerning level of vitriol from your mother.  Is this within her usual realm of behavior when things don't go her way, or is this new?  \n\nIf it's new, this kind of dramatic change could be an indication of a larger physical or mental health issue that maybe should be checked out. ",
            "> usually whenever anyone posts about their parents the advice is to go to specific subreddits and to call the parents abusive narcissists - I don\u2019t believe at all that my mother falls into that category. I believe that she is openly sharing her personal opinion and feelings with me, and she is completely justified in doing that without being at all narcissistic.\n\nShe might not quite be an abusive narcissist but this is some pretty crazy behavior. She told her friends you shredded her Christmas card? And she cried about you being alienated from your family, and then canceled your visit. Because it was a day later than she wanted. That's nuts.",

Sometimes, Easter. She had her holiday plans for fmaily, she had her expectations, and everyone was required to go along.  If there was ever a sin in my non-religious household, it was missing a major holiday. A lighter sin was missing a minor holiday like Easter or the traditional Christmas brunch in early December. When I was first married, my then wife's family had their party on Christmas Eve. That night, traditionally, was when my family would go to my  aunt's house (who was more like a mother to my mother). It became a huge cause of stress between my mother and I, even though she still had us for Christmas day when she would put on the feast. \n\nShe was wise to move her Thanksgiving celebration to the Sunday before the main day, as that allowed everyone to show up and satisfy her need to have family together. I miss my mother dearly, and when she passed away holidays got a whole lot easier and less stressful.\n\nI'm saying this because it seems like there are deep-seated needs that some people have, related to holidays, that just don't make sense. It's like all the dysfunctions around family get filtered through those days and fermented into a heady cocktail of emotions. ",
            "It always happens to me. 7 years married and two kids and still my mom makes a scene and tries to manipulate me if I let them know we are not going to spend Xmas with them. My husbands family is only his sister but she lives like literally in another continent... so every year we have to travel pfff is hell for me. Today I had to tell my parents we are not going to spend New Years with them and I cried cause I was nervous (my husband was mad \ud83d\ude21 but helped me) and the point is is not right.. do whatever you feel is right, not spending Xmas with them doesn\u2019t mean you are a bad daughter or sister or friend or whatever. Sometimes no explanations is better. Draw your line now or deal with this every single holiday :( like me. ",
            "I think you handled it perfectly (other than offering reasons, but that's easy to fix). Just continue as your doing. Maybe in the future just include your dad on any replies so he gets the full picture and she can't triangulate.\n\nI'd also check out /r/JUSTNOMIL to get an idea of what to expect, because I have a feeling she's going to ramp up the crazy once she hears about your child and will likely pull out all the stops to return you to your place in her mind and will probably rebel against any boundaries in place around your kid... ",
            "Congratulations on the news!  I think you did well handling the whole situation.  \nMany posters here are saying your mother is a narcissist.  I don\u2019t know if she is or isn\u2019t, but if this extreme level of behavior is unusual for her, there may be value in her seeing a doctor.  I don\u2019t know how old she is, but menopause and perimenopause can cause some extreme behaviors, as can other medical conditions.  If this is normal behavior for her, she\u2019d have a history of this, if not encourage your father to get her to a doctor. Good luck with everything, OP!",

No amount of being nice and prodding her is going to make her react to this situation normally. \n\nApathy is your greatest power with a narcissist. \n",
            "I am a person who stayed away from family much of my life. I guess I had to do that because of who I was at the time. Now more and more I wish I had family around. Thank God my husband's family welcomes us for holiday dinners. I can't go back and create what I missed out on with my family. On the other hand, I did need space from my family because their value system felt awful to me at the time. Have reconnected with sister and brother. That is wonderful. Wishing you the best. ",
            "I'm amazed at how well you handled the situation. Your mother sounds absolutely horrendous. Personally, I'd call her out on it and let her know that she won't be seeing you until she clears up the lies she told and apologizes. If she's going this nuts over spending one Christmas together, I hate to think the shit she's going to pull when there's a pregnancy involved. ",

Maybe over time she will learn to treat you properly if you insist on it, or maybe she won\u2019t but you have a new family now and you need to nurture the new family and not let the old family interfere. My husband and i (we are also newlyweds) spent time this christmas alternating by ourselves and with his family. We are religious so services and time with family are important to us. I texted my dad and talked to him on the phone and we will see him later because he was with my abusive brother and knows while my brother is around i won\u2019t be. It took awhile but he understands and respects my boundaries there.

At each xmas we were presented with a beautiful delicious food spread that we mostly ignored, since we already feasted that day) on Xmas several years ago.  We had a 6 month old.  We announced a year in advance that we would be celebrating at home next Xmas and that family was welcome but we were not travelling within on xmas toddlers anymore.\n\nNobody got hurt with the advance warning.

Making a massive argument out of nothing, crying on the train and saying nothing is wrong. Unhappy that I didn't want to listen to her in that moment (just had some news from another family member, really wasn't in the mood to hear her complain about how the family member was in the wrong even though I know she's always gaslighting people).

My family can also be a bit\u2014dramatic\u2014about these things. The best general advice I can offer is to remember that you\u2019re an adult, your boundaries are reasonable. Enforce them and rise above the guilt trips. Sounds like you did very well this year. \n\nWe also had issues with our weddings; parents demanded a lot of stuff and in the end were bluntly told that if they wanted it their way, they could pay for it. Both sides did\u2014they saw the reason in \u201cif you want X wedding that we can\u2019t afford, you\u2019re going to have to foot the bill, otherwise just deal with our plans and what our budget allows\u201d\u2014and worked with us, and it was fine. My MIL in particular was adamant that she be at the Scottish legal wedding, when we had planned something much smaller. We basically told her that if she wanted the celebration, we would be happy to comply, but she was going to have to finance it because we couldn\u2019t and that\u2019s why we had our original plans in the first place. \n\nJust remember that neither set of parents can demand that you spend money or time to meet their needs\u2014especially if they won\u2019t expend the same effort. \n\nIf you want to chat more specifically about this, my inbox is always open. Sounds like we are in similar positions and I\u2019m happy to swap stories, share support, and give whatever advice I can. \n\nMerry Christmas and congratulations again on your wedding and new little squeak.

            "So, she sounds a bit off. Is it possible the stress of the holidays/the need to validate her feelings led her to lie? I mean, someone suffering from a bad case  of empty nest may feel utterly overwhelmed, think that they shouldn't feel so overwhelmed, and therefore feel the need to make up something that justifies how they feel. We all do, to a degree, but this is more than that, and maybe this was her (bad) way of dealing with her own internal freakout about her baby being an adult.",

Mine would have understood if we'd stayed home on 'their turn' and never pressured us, but I felt it unfair not to go to them if we were spending the others with his parents-why should they miss out? \n\nWe're no longer together (my decision, and a good one) but spent our last Christmas as a couple at our own home, which was something, I suppose. It taught me to bloody well stand my ground in future though! \n\nLuckily my new partner and his family are wonderful-they live much nearer too, so we were able to do something that worked for all of us (Christmas eve with them, Christmas day at home and Boxing Day with my family). \n\nWishing you the best of luck and hope you enjoy your next Christmas as a new little family :) ",

I have read about too many mothers (and mothers-in-law) who make their children's pregnancies all about them and announce the pregnancy on social media before the couple is ready. And if you don't want your mother in the delivery room, consider not telling your parents that you're in labor until after the baby is born. \n\nYour mother has shown that she does not respect your boundaries or the truth. Having a baby will bring all new opportunities for your mother to trample over you and make everything about her. It sounds like your husband is a supportive partner who can listen to you, strategize with you, and help you stand firm as you set reasonable boundaries with her. This will be hard, but you can do it.",

If she\u2019s always been like this then I would continue not going over on Christmas.

            "I\u2019ve had a similar situation with my mother in law. To summarize, she is a bit crazy to put it nicely, and everyone who knows her, family included knows that about her, so when she acts toxic or erratic everyone seems to understand that this behavior is actually all on her part, and not whoever it\u2019s directed at. So if she suddenly becomes upset with me and my husband for something like the situation you described other family members know not to give into or listen to her bad talking us. I hope that you can get to the same place. \n\n\nMy best advice is to ignore her until she comes around. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to work. She doesn\u2019t sound rational so there\u2019s really no reasoning, especially if your dad doesn\u2019t seem surprised by this behavior. It probably means she\u2019s always been like this. \n\n\nIf you ignore her long enough, eventually being in your life will become more important to her than this incident and she will come back to your life.

It wasn't until her granddaughter came that she realized she needed to adhere to our boundaries.

She wanted to see us on days that  we had already planned ahead of time with the family. That was right around the time our little girl was due, and we said that if she chose to behave like that she would not be allowed to come to the hospital when baby girl came, and that her contact with us would become limited.

Let them play with their toys in their pj\u2019s while grandma comes over to visit and bring hugs and more. \n\nMy wife and I went through exact same thing 30 years ago and only had drama first year. After that, the precedent was set and Christmas was for kids at home with no more grief.  If you want to show respect to family pick another day, (like weekend before mother\u2019s birthday) and make that \u201cfamily reunion day\u201d where all kids come back home.  You could also do schlepping back home in thanksgiving, but keep Christmas for your new family. \n\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that grandma will do the same manipulative stuff with grandkids that she did with you. The stuff with you will probably not end, but grandma role is different from mom role and you might be surprised a bit there, so give her a chance and let your husband play the heavy if rules need to be set or reinforced.

You wanted to spend Christmas alone. Neither of you were willing to budge. Your fantasy was to spend Christmas alone snuggling with your honey. Her fantasy is to spend Christmas with her children and their spouses/kids and enjoy some family bonding time. As it is, both of your holidays were soured by the drama and emotions.

My personal beliefs are weddings and Christmas are very important times to be with your family. I by no means say my beliefs are facts, just my personal beliefs.  I know your husband is family but just because you have new family does not mean old family is any less important and your mom may feel less important because of not being able to attend your wedding do to you eloping and now not being able to spend Christmas with you do to another decision you made. There are always two sides to a story and your mom may feel as though you are not considering her side / emotions.\n\nI think your mom has a point that you may not be fully acknowledging.

If one side thinks that way the other side should initiate the conversation because if both sides feel that way it will just keep boiling until it erupts.  There are always two sides and the other person on the other side will always see things differently. Both sides need to make an effort to see the other point of view. "
