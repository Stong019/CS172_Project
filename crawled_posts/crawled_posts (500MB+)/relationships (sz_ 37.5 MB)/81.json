        "selftext": "This all went down about an hour ago and my wife is still crying in our bathroom with the door locked. \n\nBackstory: We had our son (now 11 months old) while my wife is in residency. She took a few weeks off before giving birth, and then went back to work a few months after, while I transitioned my hours to part-time so that I could stay at home and raise our son. My mom moved in with us shortly after the birth in order to help out, which allows me to get in the few hours of work per day and also not get swamped with taking care of the baby/housework. She's quite old-fashioned and would definitely not prefer this arrangement with me being a stay-at-home dad, but she hasn't said anything to either of us and has been a great help.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with medical residency, it is *brutal*. My wife has just over a year left. Sometimes she comes and goes for 1-3 days and our son is asleep the whole time she's home, which has been happening more as his sleep schedule shifted to sleeping through the night. My mom and I make sure that when she's home and the baby is awake, my wife gets him 100%. I know it's been hard on her, but unfortunately it's just going to be this way for another year.\n\nThe first big milestone she missed was him rolling over. When she got home, my mom pulled her over to the baby all excited. I thought she was going to tell her, but instead she says \"Julie, you came home right on time! He's been moving about as if he's going to roll over!\" They both stood there encouraging him, and right on cue he rolls. My wife was *elated*. She was so worried and guilty about not being there and she took it as proof that she can still be a present mother while working. \n\nSo we continued. I send texts over little things she misses through the day so that it's not completely unbelievable, but my wife has been 'present' for every single BIG milestone. He coincidentally started crawling with her right there, his first words were in front of her, and he began standing, cruising, and walking when she happened to be home. The walking one was difficult- there was a tough 7 day stretch where she just wasn't home during the daytime when he was awake, and his walking went from teetering to walking a couple steps pretty confidently in that time. We put little beanbags in one of his pants pockets so he'd be wobbly and unbalanced and it looked believable since he fell after the first step like he was doing a week ago. Yes, it was mean to our poor son but my wife's face was worth it.\n\nToday it all unravelled. So far he can just say 'mama', 'dada' and 'nana'. Yesterday he started saying 'bye-bye'. My wife has today off and has been home all morning. My mom and I have been trying to get him to say bye all day without giving it away that we already know he can say bye. Successfully got him to say bye to the ducks at the park, and we both gushed over his newest word the whole way home. My wife was using my phone to take pictures of him and began showing my mom at home while telling her about his newest word acquisition. She was swiping through my gallery and saw a video from yesterday and goes \"oh you never sent me this one!\" It was literally like a slow motion film happening in front of my eyes. I had taken the video of him yesterday waving bye-bye.\n\nMy wife isn't an idiot. She figured the whole ruse out pretty much instantly. I've never seen her look so upset and heartbroken before. I couldn't say or do anything to comfort her. Now she's locked herself in the bathroom crying and won't come out. I'm on our bed hoping someone can please tell me what to do to make this better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tl,dr:** my mom and I lied to my wife about our son's milestones for months, and she just found out.\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Oh god the title read as if you and your mom had a baby together and I was like dying so this didn\u2019t seem as bad after thinking that",
            "OH MAN, this is a very different story from the one the title suggested it would be! \n\nYour intentions here are very, very kind, but lying to protect your wife's feelings is still lying. It sounds like your wife is feeling some guilt or ambivalence about not being able to spend as much time with your baby as she wishes she could, and pretending that she is a part of all his firsts isn't ultimately going to help her deal with those feelings. You need to be honest with her and give her the space to feel whatever she feels about this - but she also needs to understand that a LOT of working parents deal with the same disappointment she's feeling, and come to terms with it. ",
            "This is a difficult situation.\n\nRight now, my suggestion would be to give your wife space. She needs to process this. It\u2019s hard, but the fact is that you can\u2019t do anything to fix what she\u2019s feeling. Her emotions are incredibly heightened, not only from new motherhood but from stress and pressure, and they\u2019re hers to ride out until she\u2019s ready to be helped\u2014and frankly, she might not want that help from you. While I understand why you did what you did, and I see the love and compassion that fueled the choice, you and your mother were dishonest in a very complex and conspiratorial way. That\u2019s simply it. And your wife, even if she also sees the love behind the choices you mad, has been impacted by your dishonesty. She has been wronged. Right now, it\u2019s most important that you don\u2019t try to fix or chase away that feeling, because if you do, you will not lay a foundation to build up from this low and difficult point.\n\nLet your wife decide when she\u2019s ready to talk and be helped, and what form that help will take. Give her that space.",
            "Stop lying and start recording or live streaming these things to her. ",
            "Oof, your heart was in the right place, but I completely understand why she feels betrayed. She is probably just as angry as herself as she is upset with you. I can't imagine how tough it would be for a new mom to be away from her infant so much, she is probably carrying a tremendous amount of guilt despite knowing she's going through residency for your family.\n\nI'd just give her space for now and when you talk, promise her that you'll be transparent going forward.",
            "Oh gosh, you all sound like you're trying to do the best you can.\n\nI think it's sweet that you and your mother are trying hard to make your wife feel less bad about being so busy with work. Lying is not black and white, you all have good intentions.",
            "Man, OP. I can sympathize with why you lied - you don\u2019t want your wife, the mother, to feel horrible about missing a milestone. But gosh... if I were her, I\u2019d be devastated and angry and hurt. \n\nYou had good intentions, but you still lied. For months. That trust is eroded and it\u2019ll be tough to get it back. \n\nI\u2019d apologize and ask her what you can do. ",
            "Doesn\u2019t matter what your intentions were. Even tho they were good, you still lied. \n\nMultiple times. \n\nFor months. \n\nAnd you probably would\u2019ve continued to lie if she hadn\u2019t found out I\u2019m guessing? \n\nStop. \n\nLying. ",
            "Why on earth would you lie to your wife? A baby learns a new skill on their own timeline. No one would need to see every big moment especially if your child was in daycare. Your wife has a right to be pissed at you and your mother.\n\nIt's hard to believe you would lie to your wife about something so small. And collaborate the lie with your mother. You have caused your wife a lot of anguish when she is already stressed from work and feeling guilty she can't be home with her baby. It will take a while for her to trust you again. A long while.",
            "You are an awesome husband. Honestly. I don't think this is about the movie clip at all. It is just that she feels guilt about being away so much. And seeing this on the phone made her questioning and doubting her motherhood, and probably made her realise the reality. But it is just what I am guessing here.\n",
            "I mean, your first wrong move was not pulling your mom aside after the first incident and telling her that was wrong and you don\u2019t want to lie to your wife and this just put you in a terrible position. To continue collaborating with your mom and keep your wife from actually being a part of these milestones is absolutely terrible. You need to be honest and let your wife know how it happened that first time, so she knows it wasn\u2019t you who first initiated this deceit.... and then apologize for stealing these milestones from her. You should have been keeping her updated while she was at work and sending her these videos. Who\u2019s idea was it to put the bag in his pocket?? That is just taking it to a whole new level. ",
            "I\u2019m so sorry. I have some things to say but first can you please tell me if these little lies were mostly your moms idea? "

I dwindled my days down to 2 and have recently started training at my new job the remainder of the week.\n\n\nI developed alopecia and started losing my hair from the stress. I was not going to allow this woman to take my hair along with my sense of self worth.\n\n\nThe news went better than expected when I explained I was leaving. Of course I didn't tell her my true reasoning, I cited somewhat truths to keep her happy and my side gig secured with her. \nShe offered a huge raise and other benefits, but nothing could keep me there, minus her pressence.  She said I was irreplaceble. Too late for praise now, maybe you should have treated me with respect. I didn't say this, though I wanted to, oh how I wanted to. \n\n2 decades of stress, anxiety , and being talked down to by my boss is officially coming to an end and I have the very kind redditors who messaged me and responded with words of encouragement to thank. Some of you offered to help me write a resume and some even offered me a job. If I could hug you guys I would, I'm truly that grateful. \n\nMy poor replacement is already feeling her wrath. I have warned her and told her to not allow herself to be a doormat. She's young, so I'm worried she's a bit naive, as was I and will accept the abuse. \ud83d\ude14\n\nI was offered a job as soon as I mentioned wanting to quit to a friend.

            "I had the same issue at my first IT job. My boss and I had good laughs but most of the time when he called or talking to him my anxiety would shoot through the roof.

            "Keep up the good attitude. I was in a situation very similar to yours where my boss was straight up emotionally and mentally abusive to me. I raised the concern several times with upper management but nothing was done. Fortunately I work in a field with a really high demand so I found a job as soon as I started looking. I was only under that manager for 6 months and its taken me months to shake the paranoia and walking on eggshells attitude. My new manager is super laid back and kind but I was so jumpy when I started there because I got used to all my flaws being pointed out and announced loudly. There might be an overlap with you too since you were in the bad situation much longer than I was, so if you start feeling paranoid or jumpy you'll know what's up. ",

            "I read your original post and that situation reminded me so much of what I went through for 2 years. Back around 2010 I took a job in another department (government). I knew by the end of the first week that something was wrong. I knew by the end of the second week I had made a huge mistake. Two years I worked under a narcissist psychopath. Every day was like a psychological cold war. It destroyed my confidence and left me with severe anxiety. In the end the only way out was to quit. I ended a career because of this person.  \n\nIn the end you have to decide what your sanity is worth. Sounds like you made that choice and I'm happy for you. There's life afterward. And don't be afraid to seek professional help. Counselling has done wonders for me. I don't think I'll ever be the same but it helps.",
            "I was in a similar position a few months ago. I, too, was a personal assistant. To an ambassador at an embassy. He was such a narcissistic egomaniac. He would yell at me if I did something wrong or hesitate an answer to something. If I did something right, he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge it. He would call me out of hours sometimes just to ask about something stupid. When I was first worked there, one of my lovely coworkers told me that nobody really stays in my position for more than a year. When I asked him why he said, \u201cbecause he\u2019s crazy.\u201d Lol. I was there for 9 months and just had to quit. Anyway, I don\u2019t regret it as it was a good experience overall and I\u2019ve learned a few things but I\u2019m just glad I don\u2019t have to deal with him or see his face again. ",

They come with any job, if you work there long enough and actually work hard.

I sat on the floor to go thru a filing box and she came in and threatened me that I better not get up off the floor until I found the invoice she wanted (that didn\u2019t exist in the first place). I should have grabbed my purse and gone home, but I really liked my coworker and she too was in the midst of a nervous breakdown. My aunt told me that night to give notice the next day, so I did. A generous 30 days. I was waiting to hear about my replacement but my coworker said the owner had not placed an ad because she was sure I\u2019d change my mind. So I had to give yet another 2 week notice that she finally took notice of.

I've always been her shoulder to cry on and I've supported her through everything as best I can. \n\nShe has gotten jealous of my relationship with Charlie, saying things like she wishes she could have a \"perfect\" relationship like ours and she wishes she could have that connection with Jack. Recently (within the last two months), she's started saying things like \"I should just steal Charlie from you\" and \"I wish Jack was more like Charlie, I think Charlie and I would be a great match.\" She started flirting with Charlie (which made him super uncomfortable) and overstepped boundaries. I was uncomfortable and upset with her behavior, we had a serious talk and she broke down. She told me she was going through a rough patch with Jack and wasn't handling it well. She apologized (to me and to Charlie) and told me she knew what she did was wrong, it wouldn't happen again, etc. Charlie and I talked about it and we decided to forgive her.\n\nAt the time of the incident, Jack and Kendall were still going through a rough patch.\n\n**THE INCIDENT**\n\nTwo weeks ago, Charlie invited close friends and family to dinner (this included Jack and Kendall). It was at the restaurant Charlie and I had our first date, down to the exact table we sat at. We had talked about marriage (at great length), so I had a feeling.\n\nLo and behold, Charlie proposed to me. It was perfect, I was so happy. I cried like a baby, lol.\n\nOur family and friends congratulated us. Kendall seemed super excited. She gushed about how cute it was, started talking about the wedding, and hugged us both. \n\nThe only person who didn't seem happy for us was Jack. He told Kendall that he wanted to go home and they left early.\n\nFast forward a few days. Kendall texted me and she was pissed. She called me \"a dirty traitor\" and \"a disgusting cunt.\" I was like wtf??? I asked her why she was upset. She claimed I was trying to ruin her relationship and then stopped replying to my texts.\n\nI texted Jack and asked him wtf was going on. He told me that he was planning to propose to Kendall at dinner. At first, I felt bad because maybe he had planned something beforehand and maybe it was just a huge misunderstanding. But apparently, Jack wasn't even planning to propose to Kendall until we got to the restaurant. He saw how nice the restaurant was, our friends and family were there, and decided \"hey, this is perfect.\" He thought it would help them out of their rough patch (which is a horrible idea because marriage doesn't magically fix relationships), but then Charlie proposed and \"stole his thunder.\" He didn't even have a ring!\n\nCharlie had been planning that proposal for *months*. He's had the ring for six months, made the reservations two months beforehand, invited all of our family and friends. Even the staff of the restaurant was in on the proposal! He put a lot of thought into it and I don't think Jack's heat of the moment decision to propose is more important than Charlie's carefully planned proposal. I'm actually upset that Jack would make something this special and important into something dramatic and all about him.\n\nI didn't apologize. Charlie and I talked about it, he agrees and doesn't think we should apologize.\n\n**THE AFTERMATH**\n\nSince then, Kendall and Jack haven't talked to us. Which is fine by itself, but that's not the end of it. Both of them have been shaming us on social media, twisting the story to make themselves look like victims, and have even coined us \"The Proposal Thieves.\" \n\nMutual friends (and even some family!) are disgusted with us. They believe Jack and Kendall's story, even after I've tried to explain what really happened. As funny as it is to be called The Proposal Thieves, it's not so funny to have friends and family turned against you. I'm really upset that my own sister would do this.\n\nCharlie has been super supportive and sweet through this mess. We both agree that we shouldn't apologize and have been standing our ground. \n\nHonestly, after everything Kendall has done, I'm pretty much fed up with her. She's my sister and I love her, but after she tried to seduce my boyfriend and now this, I don't really have a desire to talk to her anymore. Which sucks, because we've always been close. I think Jack has turned her into this horrible, self-absorbed person and it's just.. ugh. \n\nBtw, I'm **not** talking to Kendall right now and have no plans to talk to her until we receive a sincere apology. Even then, I think I might limit contact if she stays with Jack.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit? What should we do? How should we handle this? Advice/perspective/anything???\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you for all of the advice! I will **definitely** post an update after we make our post explaining the situation. I really, really appreciate all of the help and support. It means a lot! :) I can't wait to see what a mess actually planning the wedding will be, lmao. See you guys in a week or two!\n\n**EDIT #2**: **JUST TO CLARIFY!** The people who believe Jack and Kendall's story are the ones who were **not** at the proposal dinner! A large amount of mutual friends who weren't there + extended family believe the story. Our parents, Charlie's siblings, and the few close friends that were actually at the dinner **do not** believe the bullshit story. We just haven't made a post addressing everything/telling our side of the story because we wanted advice on how to approach it (which is why I posted here).\n\nTL;DR: Sister and bf are upset that we \"upstaged them.\" Spreading lies on social media. Everything is a mess, please help?\n\n\n",

He wants to avoid the marriage convo entirely.\n\nJack: \"Well..I was going to! They RUINED it.  Now I can't possibly propose to you, and it's because of OTHER PEOPLE!\" (aaand internal sigh of relief for Jack).\n\nDon't apologize, give them time to cool down, and maybe when your sister is being more reasonable, suggest she talk to Jack about that incoming proposal she's so excited about...you know, the one that's totally happening.

No way do I believe that he was going to propose that night. After all of their problems? Crikey. \n\nGo no contact with Kendall for the forseeable future. Try one more time with the really important people to clarify what happened, if they are feeding into the drama, they also go to the curb with the rest of the trash. Ignore all of them unless they come to you with a *sincere* apology. And don't invite those fuckers to the wedding. Not even Kendall, unless she apologizes. She sounds like a piece of work.",

Emphasize the facts that:\n\n* Charlie arranged the dinner.\n* It was at your first date location down to the table.\n* He'd planned this for months.\n* Nobody's proposal was stolen, as Jack had literally told no one of his plans.\n* Mention that you are baffled at the way you are being portrayed.\n* Your family that was present can obviously corroborate all of this.\n\nTruth and sense have a way of cutting through all of the insane drama and lies that your sister is saying.\n\nYou only have to say these things once. At which point, I think you should cut your sister and her boyfriend out of your lives and try to focus on your new life ahead. It's sad that your sister is so focused on her own misery that she's determined to destroy your happiness, but that's reality right now.

Then mention how baffled you are that people are accusing you and your fiance of stealing a proposal from a guy with no plan and no ring, and how sad you are at the number of people who are so eager to believe the worst about you two without getting your side of the story. If anyone brings it up to you afterward point out how nice it is to see the true character of certain people before inviting someone to be in the bridal party or to the wedding.

So Jack claimed he was going to propose that night in an attempt at damage control and threw Charlie under the bus in the meantime.

Let's see how it SHOULD have been handled.\n\nLiz and her boyfriend Fred have been together for years. Fred was planning on proposing on a family summer vacation. Liz's brother ended up proposing right before the family vacation to his girlfriend. Instead of being all butt-hurt, Fred just delayed a couple months until Liz's birthday. This is a logical response. Fred was a little bummed because he was so excited and had been waiting months already, but he also respected Liz and her brother enough to not try to steal the spotlight from him.\n\nNow, Fred had actually been planning for month. I doubt Jack was. What probably happened was, after dinner, Kendall complained about wanting to get married and how nice the proposal was (because really, it sounds fantastic. Props to Charlie), and Jack panicked. \"Well, *I* was gonna propose because the restaurant was so nice and it seemed perfect, but then Charlie did it first!!\" I would be astounded if he had actually thought about proposing.\n\nKendall wants to get married. Jack doesn't. Jack has now been able to move all the blame onto you and Jack. Give Kendall some time. Maybe she'll come to her senses, maybe she won't.

I didn't do things like what your sister has done but I just sort of checked out of everything going on with my family. The relationship between me and my family faltered, obviously, and there were a few disputes until finally things boiled to a head and they sat me down. They told me my behavior was disrespectful and I was straight up shunning my own family, and if I wanted to be that way I could just leave the family altogether.

I cut the guy out of my life, shaped up, and have had a great family dynamic ever since.\n\nI couldn't imagine losing my sister the way yours is drifting away now. Sometimes the path from valued friend to total jerk is a gradual slope, and she may not realize just how far she has strayed. If you want to salvage that relationship, I would lay it all out on the table for her; everything she has done, how it has made you feel, and how things will be in the future if she doesn't make changes. Be direct; she gets her act together or she loses you as a sister. Hopefully that'll wake her up, but be prepared if it doesn't.   ",

But as soon as I was on my own, I got into drugs and they took over my life. Within a year I was stealing from my friends and family and only coming to my parent's house to rest up.  During that time in my life, no one could make me change. Even when my parents forced me into rehab, it didn't stick. In fact, a week after rehab, I stole my moms debit card and emptied her account.  \n\nThey eventually cut ties with me, and not having that safety blanket made things just bad enough to want to clean up. It took a while, but I eventually did. When I reached out to my parents and they saw I was sincere, they welcomed me back, but it took years for me to be able to forgive myself for what I put them through.\n\nOne of the top comments on your original post says that your son will never be the same again. That's not an absolute fact. I was a meth addict for years, but after I cleaned up, I graduated at the top of my community college class (I gave a speech at graduation and everything!), and went on to attend an Ivy League school. It's completely possible that your son will one day put this behind him and lead a fulfilling life. \n\nYou did good letting him know you'll be there as a resource when he's ready to live his life again.

They know the dance that the addicted do, and how to deal with the lying, the hurt feelings, the loss, etc. \n\nSeriously. Your best bet in both helping your son and saving your family from mental anguish is through a good sponsor. Hint: they will basically show you how to 'lovingly detach yourself and your family from the addicted, and only help him when he is truly ready for help'. You cannot save him without him wanting to save himself. Get a sponsor. ",
            "My brother is 31 and hasn't worked for over 3 years. My parents completely support him financially, enable the hell out of him, and don't deal with the issue because it's been 15 years of fighting with him. Mom and dad let him come around to every family event, every time I'm home, and it's exhausting. My dad has a heart condition and it's going to put him in the ground eventually. I have virtually no relationship with my brother. I don't have any answers for you beyond I know how burnt out you feel.\n\nHe deals with mental health issues and copes using alcohol, weed, and hiding in gaming. Everything is a fight, there are no casual conversations. \n\nI'm sorry OP but at least this way, you keep some of your sanity.",
            "You did the right thing. My only suggestion is not to send him any money directly. If you are going to pay for rehab, pay the rehab itself. Any money you send, well I think you know how that goes. \n\nhugs to you. ",
            "This is exactly what I was hoping your update would not be.  You did the right thing even though it is probably agonizing.   I'm so sorry. ",
            "I know it's heartbreaking...I have done it with my own son. But in the long run you're doing what's best for you all. ",
            "OP, wish you were my dad. **You are a good man.** Much love. ",
            "Please look into AL-ANON for you and your family. You did the best you could in this situation. I hope for the best for your son and your family.\nAnd yourself.",
            "Good for you. Hold your bottom line! This is the best thing you can do for him and yourself.",
            "You did the right thing. I was a social worker and a therapist, and people with substance abuse problems will have trouble getting clean if their families enable them. They need to hit rock bottom before they see that getting clean and staying that way is the better option. It's not an easy thing to do, but in cases like this, it is the right thing to do. Explain that you are always there, ready to help, but that you can't support the choices he is making.\n\nMy mom had to do this. My grandfather was an alcoholic who was abusive. He'd be sober for awhile, and then he'd fall off the wagon - he even fell off the wagon at my mom's wedding. Four years later, she was pregnant with her first baby, the first grandchild (me), and she stated point blank that while she would stay in contact with her dad, he would never, ever meet me. He passed away two years ago, having been sober for 33 years. Were it not for the consequence my mother provided, he might have continued bouncing between sober and drunk his whole life. He was an amazing granddad and a good great-granddad. We were always really close. It's hard to imagine him as an abusive alcoholic, and while my mom does exaggerate, he really was one, and it's hard to reconcile the kindly old grandpa with the drunk asshole father. It's a dichotomy, and I'm lucky to be on the happy end. We were close enough that I identify as Serbian-American, even though my family (both sides) have moved around so much that you could throw a dart at a map of Europe and hit at least one country some ancestor lived in. This is all because my mom put her foot down and enforced consequences. Wanna meet your grandchildren? Go into recovery. It sounds simple, it's hard to do, but it works. At 50 years old, with 3.5 decades of being an alcoholic, my grandfather got his shit together. If he can do it, your son might be able to do it too. ",
            "I know this is heartbreaking but do keep in mind that you are doing the best for him. It might not be in the sweetest way, but he has to face harsh reality to help himself.",
            "God this is heartbreaking, OP.  Just know that you handled this the absolute right way - firmly setting boundaries, but still keeping the lines of communication open when or if he decides to get clean.  If you need to talk to someone, feel free to send me a PM.",
            "You're not a bad dad, this isn't something you did wrong, and it's okay that you can't do this anymore because frankly this is your son's journey that he has to figure out himself. There nothing you can do to make it better. I'm sitting in a sea of substance use disorder research, films, workbooks, memoirs - I work at a facility and am getting my councilor's certificate. If you ever want some direction in where to look to maybe understand where your son mentally is right now, feel free to PM me.\n\nI've also been on your side of having a substance dependent person in my family. Its so maddening to watch them spiral and seem to not care at all that they're dragging everyone down with them. Honestly? I'd rather be around my hundreds of clients trying to pull themselves out of the hole of addiction for 8hrs a day than spend one moment in a room with my active use uncle.\n\nLook out for you first. You did your best, you really did. You're not alone by any means - perhaps look for a support group for parents? I'll be thinking of you and your family. \n\nEdited: paragraphs.",

            "I've been sober since May off opiates, my family cut me off and gave me the same ultimatum. I knew I would have a family and a home again if I could just stop using. And right now I am doing the best I have been in years, I'm volunteering with animals and even got a pt job. I think you're doing exactly what your son needs. As long as he knows that when he's ready to get clean you'll be there, that's the best thing you can do for him.\n\nCheck out Al-anon, or nar-anon if there's one around. A meeting is only one hour long, and you don't need to share if you're not comfortable. But trust me, it will take a weight off your shoulders knowing that you're not alone. *hugs*",

As a drug addict in recovery I know how difficult it is to get to the point where accepting help is a possibility. You should check out al-anon groups in your area it should help you deal with all of this that is going on, it has helped my father greatly ",

            "I divorced an addict who refused to get help. Ironically, they left me first. It took some time in counseling to realize how sick I had become. \n\nYou're doing the right thing, as hard as it is to realize it right now. ",
            "I'm so sorry. But he did this for himself, and you're doing everything you should - keep him from your family, and be there for him the day he decides to sober up.\n\nI hope that you know that you did the right thing. I hope your son will realize that.",
            "You cannot help the unwilling, as I found out dealing with my alcoholic mother. It's tough realizing they don't want to fix themselves, and eventually you have to draw the line to preserve your own heart and sanity.\n\nCutting off your son means protecting yourself, your wife, and your daughter. That makes you a good father and husband.",

You've done all you can for him and now things are up to him. I'm so sorry your family is going through this. I can't imagine the pain you're going through. Sending internet hugs and positive thoughts your way. I wish you all the best.",
            "All I can picture is my dad as I red this. For what it's worth, you're doing the right thing. I know that doesn't make it easier, but you won't do any favors for him by helping him anymore. I'm sorry if that's harsh, I wish you all the best, I know how hard the road forward is.",
            "What kind of fucked up disease has symptoms that make the victim protect the disease at the expense of so much suffering for everyone involved? Addiction. Fuck it. Lost both parents to it for different reasons. My mom tried hard to stay sober for me, but my dad lost me because he didn't try at all.   \n\nI can only suggest that you remind him addiction is basically a disease of the brain and he needs medical treatment and therapy to overcome it\u2014that no one expects him to beat this alone. ",
            "I am a parent of young children, and hope to never have to face the situation you are in. It takes an amazing amount of love and strength to make the choice you did. Although it doesn't feel like it, you just showed that you love your child enough to say \"NO\". No I won't let you kill yourself. No I won't let you destroy your life. \n\nHe needs boundaries. He needs people in his life willing to say no and to stop enabling him. Once that is gone, he can finally look at himself in the mirror and stop making excuses and justifying his lifestyle. Only when that is gone can he truly assess if he wants to change. \n\nYou love your son enough to say no. And I admire you. I can't imagine having the strength to do it. You just did one of the hardest things any parent could ever face. It's the right thing, even though I'm sure it feels all wrong. \n\nI wish I could be there to listen and hug you and your family. Why don't you try getting to an AL-ANON meeting? Or perhaps a counselor who specializes in addiction issues? I think seeking some perspective and closure would be critical for you right now. ",
            "I'm your son. Not really, but I mine as well be.  The stories are all the same aside from some acute details that make it unique and differently interesting.  \n\nAddiction is something that you or anyone will ever fully understand by experiencing it.  I didn't read the original, so I don't know what he's on, but I'm just gonna guess and say it's opioids.  Those are the main drug that seems to destroy families and want almost 60 year old men to help their boy out like he's still 12.  Only that dragon can turn a 40 year old into a little baby.\n\nI woke that dragon, I think it was born inside of me, infantile just like myself.  Time passed, quickly, and one minute I had this incredible life, friends, loving family, money, tons of choices for the future, super hot girlfriend, and most of all, I was happy.  I was confused about life and could find myself in a depressed state when I started philosophizing too hard about the insanity of \"living (whatever that is)\" on a ball of rock, water, and other living things of all sorts.  This ball we're on is currently at it's cruising speed of around 26,000 mph on this repetitive oval, or orbital path, around a giant yet very small ball of flaming gas we named the sun.\n\nThe depressiveness comes in when I think about how fruitless and futile our society is.  Concerned with one thing only: To produce and consume stuff for a trading note we call paper.  It's grown so big and fast that there's really only a few people in control of it.  So we get jobs that pay us money to spend on things that end up in the pockets of the people who paid us to do our jobs.  And that's just supposed to be it.  That's \"life\".  \n\nMy point is, I became a junkie after having what I thought and what most people think a \"good life\" is.  I didn't start drugs to escape from that thought of an insane society, but I kept doing drugs to escape from it.  It made it easy to forget about.  Grocery shopping could be fun.\n\nDrugs, or opioids in general are fantastic at providing this sense of comfort and confidence combined with the most perfect level of numbness you could ask for.  You were numb to stupid, and wasteful, and political, but if your best friend just died you would feel that, at least for a while until you started using more to try and numb that pain away. \n\nFrom age 24-26 I spent over $100,000 on heroin.  Money from a trust set up for me to pay for school that turned out to be very successful during my first 21 years of life as I think it started as $15k when I was born.  By 21 had everything I wanted or needed, but I also wasn't outlandish.  Nobody in my friends knew about it, not even my girlfriend.  I used it for school, and worked for rent and food and if ever in a jam I could use it to help out.\n\nFast forward and after several years of tuition and rent I've got 100k left.  By this point I'm taking around 5,000mg's of hydrocodone a month (10/325's - little yellows) and now the dragon is still sleepy, but now I have awoken him from an eternal sleep he planned on. But really every 3 weeks I'd run out, so I'd go through w/d hell for a week until I could get more.  Sleepy dragon wasn't happy, but too  sleepy to do anything about it.\n\nFinally I told my family.  They understood and were supportive and said Rehab.  2 days later I'm in rehab toughing out a gnarly addiction.  28 days later, feeling like a million bucks I'm freed.  Then about 10 people died in 2 weeks, all good friends of mine. A \"Friend\" from rehab came over, said he could get opium.  \n\nThat's how I woke my dragon to a full state.  And man, he was cool.  The opium was just cut up heroin sold in a college town under the idea that opium would sell easier.  Who knows, I was hooked, and if 5,000mg of hydro sounds like a lot, let me tell you how quick 100k can vanish when you have an unlimited connection of heroin.\n\nExactly 1 year and 4 months later my bank account was now -6,000.  I was smoking it.  I was buying it once a week and spending $2,000-4,000 each time.  \n\nThe money ran out, the dragon became very angry and in withdrawals he's great at guiding you to salvation. First it's overdrafting my account as much as possible.  Then pawning everything I own, then stealing from my family (nothing was off the table).  If it had value I was going to take it and pawn it and go get dope. I wrote myself a few checks from Mom's bank, then from girlfriends, and all at once it caught up to me.  7am until 12pm one day I had over 140 missed calls all from girlfriend or parents.  \n\nI called back, begged and pleaded not to call the cops.  I swore I'd make it right.  Parents paid my girl what I stole, kept her from the cops.  Parents just wanted to be done and said bye.\n\nSo I'm living in my car in Denver in the middle of winter.  Hustle hustle just for a 20.  Gave up hope, wanted to die.  Tried a hot shot about 6 times only to wake up a day later dope sick and out of money.  Hadn't showered in a year.  Somehow stayed out of trouble.  Stayed away from the other homeless, stayed isolated, stayed high.  \n\nThen my sister called on my prepaid virgin mobile phone I had, it had 8 mins left.  I told her to make it quick after realizing who it was.  She asked to meet for coffee, I was sick and had no money, so I said yes thinking I'd have some chance to get cash from her.\n\nCoffee was weird.  I was sick. She knew it.  She asked me to get help, that all I had to say was yes, but that it was not going to be like before.  I had imagined this moment the night before laying in the back of my car re-reading one of a few books I had.  At one point I felt a glow of warmth, it felt like hope, but then I let it go.\n\nToday was the day, the day that little flicker of hope I had inside of me would be tested.  \n\nThat was in 2009 (March).  I just had surgery a few weeks ago, but up until then I have not had a narcotic in my system since.  It was a lot of tough work, still is. The surgery and drugs didn't wake the beast and I haven't had anything for over a month.  I don't crave them anymore.  That took at least 4 years to happen. \n\nI did start out in 12 step and stopped 3 years in.  I quit counting my days and just remember that day I rode on an airplane looking and smelling like a bum.  \n\nYour son is me, he's just a bit older, but it doesn't matter.  He's got a beast that is in control and what you've done is the best absolute thing you could.  You shared your love and support of him and offered him help if he'd take it.  That's not turning your back on him.  That's all you can do, and I want to thank you for doing so.  I would check in on him every now and then, you might catch him at a time where the beast is busy and that glimmer of hope is making him feel warm. \n\nI'd like to add something I feel is important to address. Rehabs in this country are money making machines.  They employ ex patients, they have very little concern for anybody's well being and they charge an amount that should be illegal.  If you have money to   spend on rehab I suggest you speak to someone who knows the system really well and isn't invested in it (like me), or know that your son still only has a tiny percent chance of making it.  I was in a small rehab, mostly used for detoxing, but they had inpatient for 4 clients and I was one of them.  I met 100's of people coming in to detox and then off to rehab nearby.  I knew every rehab owner, every person in the program with more than 3 years, and every single newcomer as I was one of the first people they'd meet.  I've seen every rehab owner relapse.  Every person after 3 years would also relapse, but it was rare to ever see someone get that far.  Between 1 year and 3, I don't know if I ever saw one of those relapse.  They were in it and committed.  Just know rehab is a fucked up place to send a junkie.  It's full of other junkies that know things you don't.  You'll learn more about drugs and how and what to do in rehab than you ever will anywhere else.  Almost everyone there on a 90 day stay will relapse, a few times.  They will do it in groups.  \n\nIf your son says yes, you better have a plan, because that yes can turn into a no really quickly.  Give him some cash so he can not be sick.  And reach out to me PM if you'd like to hear more or want some more advice.  I'm sorry for what you and your family are going through.  Just know that your son is going through something even tougher.  Waking up every day wanting to die is an experience that you can't just imagine, you really have to live it to understand its power.\n\n**TL;DR:  There's hope, I made it out somehow and haven't taken illegal drugs since 2009.  It's been a tough road, and there's lot's of lessons that can be learned now, and many that can't be learned until later.  But I came back from the dead, and I'd love to help anyone who needs it.** ",
            "So I don't know how much this will help...but here are some things I've learned in my 25 years on this planet.\n\n1) My dad has a very addictive personality.  He went into the army at 17 because he hated school and wanted out. Did well and got out after a 2 or 4 year tour of some sort. He drank somewhat before the army....but partying became his life after the army.\n\n2) With parties come drugs and if you're not responsible...you will get in trouble. My dad had a huge coke habit by 25. He was 26 when I was born and my mom though he would get his shit straight. He did not.  Location changes only delayed further involvement with drugs.\n\n3) You will get caught doing something stupid to fund your drug habit.  For my dad...it was a meth lab. He got arrested on his 33rd birthday.  I was about to turn 7. \n\n4) Jail cleaned him up....from the coke anyway.  He threw himself head first into work and now owns a successful online business. Hasn't touched drugs in quite a while, as far as I know. Jail helped him take the step of getting clean. I have no idea what helped him stay clean.\n\nYour son needs a make or break rock bottom event. You might be able to provide it by cutting most if not all of your support.  I can tell you now that if he comes to you for rehab it will have a better end result than if you give him the ultimatum of something crappy or rehab.  He NEEDS to choose getting and staying clean on his own.  While jail provided my dad the opportunity....something in him realized he needed to get clean. He tells me he knew he would die if he stayed on the path he was on and jail kind of shocked that information into him.  I don't know, I wasn't there or old enough to understand what he truly was going through.\n\nI hope your son has his rock bottom moment before the drugs kill him.",
            "For what it's worth I was given a very similar ultimatum by my parents. I was much younger but, the misery I was bringing about in their lives was no less tragic. The final straw for them was finding a large quantity of drugs in my stuff. I was told I was going to  rehab or I would be cast out of the family. Initially I left. I didn't last long before realizing that without my family I didn't have much I cared about. That was over a decade ago, married, kids, career the whole nine. Life turned around for me, let's hope the same for your son. Most important is to know that you did not cut him off, you have given him a choice that protects everyone involved from further harm. You did the right thing, he now has to make that difficult decision. The relationship you have with him going forward is in his hands.\n\nTl;Dr\nYou didn't cut him off, you made him choose. This is a good thing, your a good husband, father, and person. ",
            "I'm sorry you're going through this OP, but I think you've made the right choice.  ",
            "I did a similar thing except the roles are reversed. I tried to get my dad to rehab and he told me to kill myself. It sucks, I know. ",
            "Damn. Sorry man. ",
            "I'm sorry OP, I've grown up with addicts, I've felt the anger, the helplessness and the fear... I know you're trying to help him. Good move, stay strong. ",
            "I can't begin to imagine the internal debates you must have had with yourself through all the years. Good luck, OP. Maybe you find a tiny bit of peace from this very hard decision you made.",

I'm proud to say he turned his life around 180 degrees and has stayed clean for 8 years.\n\nBut my family has been in your shoes, and you did the right thing. You have to stay true to your promise to cut off contact. If he truly wants to get clean, he knows he has to come to you.\n\nThe last time my brother told my dad he wanted to get clean, there was no hesitation in getting him to rehab--I'm talking that day. There was no staying at home for a minute to collect his things, because there was the chance he'd just take off again. So maybe have a plan like that in mind?",
            "If it counts I basically went through this with my brother, and am now a father. I watched my dad basically do what you did. I remember waking up one night while by brother on one of his benders was yelling and screaming, waving a gun around and threatening to kill my mom. \n\n\n\n\nHe stormed out and came back later that night and passed out. My dad put him in the car, packed 1 duffel bag for him and drove him to the halfway house in town. He had woke up by the time we got there and put on an indifferent face. My dad's last words to him that morning were \n\n\n\n\n*'Don't come home until you've fixed your problems. We're not helping you any more.'* \n\n\n\n\nToday I'm a father and I can't imagine how my dad felt. Telling his first born child, never come home unless you can come home properly. I can't imagine how you feel. I wish the best for you and your family. I hope you can all heal. \n\n\n\n\nAnd if it offers any hope my brother got clean eventually. He was an alcoholic and frequently did coke. It took some time. I want to say close to 6 or 7 years. ",

It's hard because you know they will go through a hard time but after a certain age you gotta stop bailing them out or they will always rely on you.\n\nDon't feel like you're being selfish because it's not a matter of them being a burden but rather giving them the opportunity to live through the consequences of their own actions and become a mature grown up human being. It will be hard, and there may be times when you feel like they've changed and they reintegrate themselves into the family, only to have a relapse and go through everything all over again. It's a huge strain on the family financially and emotionally and to be honest, it's not fair to the other siblings.\n\nWhat happens is they become the collateral damage because they don't get to experience a life with happy and content parents, and they always live in the shadow of this sibling who is a well known fuck up.\n\nBest of luck to you and your family, but you must stand your ground.

            "Dear Sir,\n\nThank you for posting this- both the original and the update.  It was interesting to read the perspective of a parent in this type of situation, and helped to put a few things into perspective for me.  The situation you describe about how your family has suffered through your son's actions is, I feel, fairly accurate as to what my parents and sister have gone through with my own struggles with drug addiction and mental illness.\n\nAddiction is a selfish disease, and that selfishness destroys relationships.  This then can become cyclical; the further damage done to relationships by the addict results in the desire to mask the negative emotions such a disruption causes.\nI myself couldn't see past my own difficulties and problems, had no capacity for empathy towards friends and family who tried their best to help me.\n\nIf your son truly wants help, and to make positive changes in his life; it is up to him to do it.  If my parents had continued to offer me shelter because they believed it to be the right thing to do, it would have only enabled me further, and not inspired any desire to turn myself around.  Recovery is something the addict must do for himself- and only they can can make that decision.\n\nYou still love your son, don't lose faith in that, but sometimes loving someone means letting them go.  Hopefully, he may realise what his actions have caused and start on a better path.\n\nMy family instituted a \"tough love\" approach, much like the one you are currently experiencing and I am blessed that through the work I have done to change my life that this relationship is well on its way to being mended.  I wish that I could guarantee the same result for you.  In the meantime, you have done what is best for your entire family.\n\nMy sincere best wishes that this situation resolves itself to the best interests of all involved- even if that may not be the resolution you hold as ideal.

Is there a family history of addiction or mental health issues?  Did something happen at University that could lead him to medicate with hard drugs?  What kind of medical treatment, if any, has he and your family engaged in as a result of his addiction disease?  Hope you find some compelling and informative opinions in everyone's replies.  ",

He's been to rehab twice ( his father out him there) but mom would go get him when it got hard. He put the family things hell, stealing money and valubles to sell in order to feed his habit. Eventually his father left because he couldn't handle the stealing, drugs and how he couldn't get through to his wife. \n\nHe's since alienated his entire family, including mom. The sister hates him, the grandparents won't let him in the house. he finally crossed the line with mom when he stole her new boyfriends truck, drove it across the province and went on a wild bender without returning anyone's calls. He did this to a man who wanted to help him, let him stay in his home and borrow his truck to go to work. \n\nMakes you wonder what he would be like today if mom had giving him tough love.",

            "I am a heroin addict who's been clean for a little over 4 years, but is no longer active in any sort of recovery, or treatment, other than taking a maintenance dosage of a 2mg Subutex tablet, every other day. look into the possibility of treating your son's opioid addiction with a partial opioid receptor antagonist, like Zubsolv, Suboxone, or Subutex, they're all buphenorphine. Which partially antagonizes opiate receptors; subduing cravings, with only a limited euphoric effect. I can honestly say that without bupe, I would almost certainly have returned to intravenously injecting heroin every few hours, in order to stave off severe physical withdrawals.\n\n Opioid withdrawal is like having the worst flu you could possibly imagine, multiplied by ten. Then add in the constant psychological torture of knowing that you can instantly end your suffering with one shot, with one line, with one hit. That is heroin addiction. By the end of my 4 year dive into utter, and complete despair, I could not even achieve the numbness...the escape, that I so desperately craved. I was shoving old, dull needles into my arm, and injecting myself with poison just to prevent sickness.\n\n Only by incarceration was I able to achieve sobriety, and even after my first stint in an institutional treatment center, I almost immediately began shooting heroin again. The second time I landed myself in incarceration, they chose to forgo the treatment, and sent me directly to a medium security prison, which I spent 13 months in. I learnt my lesson that time. That may be the experience your son needs...it will certainly change his perspective on life, one way or another. \n\nAs someone who put my family through hell; who lied, and lied, and lied to the people I love...someone who stole and stole and stole from the people I hold dearest; I can almost guarantee you that your son is filled with regret and remorse in regards to you, and the rest of your family. That he wishes he could change the way things are between you all, but he can't...he just cannot escape the darkness that is addiction, and the sad thing is those feeling of regret and self-hatred only feed that all-consuming black hole of nothingness and disparity he calls a reality..I can say this with a high degree of certainty because I *am* your son.\n\n Although not literally, everything you described your son as, all the turmoil you experienced..they are identical to my life. \n\nI hope your son can find some sort of peace; wherever it may be, and I hope you get your son back, and the peace you, too, most certainly deserve.",
            "Remember when he was really little and at the park he wanted to go on the big kids structure but he wasn't ready for it developmentally so it was dangerous and he screamed and jumped around and begged and tantrumed because he wanted up and you wouldn't pick him up and put him on it because you like... didn't want him to die...?\n\nThis is the same thing. This is good parenting. You aren't responsible for lifting him onto the big kids' play structure. That's not good parenting.  Sometimes good parenting is saying no and walking away. ",

He's going to have to find the will to fight it from within and not from an outside source, so it's good you cut him off because while your family has been trying to help, it's just helping him stay high. He has been comfortable. I hope you're able to stand your ground when he inevitably tries to get something out of you again,  but I do understand how difficult all this is. I just wanted to send my support I guess. My big brother has battled with a heroin addiction. It put my family through some shut for a couple years but he seems to be doing good now. Knock on wood.

It's unfortunate, but nobody can make you get clean. It really does have to come from within. I'm sorry that your son's put you through this for so long and I think you're making a smart decision by telling him not to contact you unless he's truly done with the drugs. I also hope that if and when the time does come you and your family are able to forgive him for all of these years. Addiction makes you do some fucked up things and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I've seen the nicest people go down that path - I really don't think anyone's completely safe. I'm not the praying type, either, but you and your family are definitely in my thoughts.",

            "Hey OP, it sucks you're going through this.  My brother is a heroin addict as well, though he started younger than your son.  Really smart, phenomenal at anything mechanical.  By far and away the hardest thing my family had to do was to set up boundaries and maintain them.  We still talk to him (in fact, talked to my bro a bit today), but it's difficult.  I think the worst part is that we can tell there's a part of him that wants to get better.  Every year or so he'll do something dumb and end up in jail, go through rehab, and for a bit he'll be fine but eventually just relapses again.  Recognizing that for what it is is difficult.  Things will seem to be looking up, and then you'll find out he stole from you again, and it's another disappointing betrayal.  You don't even get angry, you're just sad because you're hoping this time is the one that sticks, and it doesn't.",
            "Recovering alcoholic here:\n\n\nThe only way he will ever truly benefit from recovery is if he enters with no reservations.

It's painful but you must completely sever ties and let him hit his bottom alone. sink or swim. \n\nDon't take this the wrong way but you are actually enabling his addiction. Although his actions are his own, you enable him to continue making them. This is because he knows he always has a security net to fall back on.  \n\n\n\nIf you really love your son I recommend you attend some \"alanon\" or \"narcanon\" meetings.

He'll come home, clean up and break the habit, but then the chain grows taut and drags him back into the lifestyle. I don't know what it's like.

It affects EVERYONE around who cares about them. \n\nThe thing that sucks the most? The drug addict believes the lies they make until it becomes the truth. Then there is no truth or lies. Just this blur of getting to that next fix - no matter what.  Until they either hit that bottom and decide to get help. Or die. \n\nOP did the best thing he could do for his family and for his son.

Rehab has cost $35K in less than a year, but it's the best money I've spent. \n\n\n\nHe's been in three levels of care: residential hospitalization for 60 days, 90 days intensive outpatient (house with an on-site manager and a few other io residents, drug testing every day, individual and group therapy, supervised outings for shopping, a series of steps to achieve privileges such as a phone and unsupervised pre-arranged outings), and several months where he is now in sober living (part-time house manager, unsupervised outings, daily meetings, drug testing, and residents must be employed). This process is working so well. He is happy, healthy, and learning how to actually live a life.\n\n\n\n\nGoing to rehab, getting clean, and then just coming home never worked for him. He was back to old habits within days. He never knew how to function, how to operate in the real world. This longer, more practical, stepping-stone approach is working. It's like a miracle, except that he's worked for it every step of the way\n\n\n\nDealing with an addict is emotionally, physically, mentally, and financially draining. You live with the knowledge that the next phone call you get could be the one telling you they've died. You walk around your home and count the missing items they've stolen from you and pawned. You don't want them to starve, but you know that any money you give them will go straight into their drug of choice. They can not see their own problem. Their brain is disordered. \n\n\n\nMy family member went into this current rehab process straight from an involuntary psych hold. The police took him because he was a danger to himself and others. He detoxed from heroin for three days in a shitty, scary psych ward, and was too sick to protest inpatient rehab at that point when the family offered it. He accepted. \n\n\n\n\nHe knows he can never go back to certain places, never see certain people (even some family members, because they're untreated addicts) ever again. In the past, as soon as he had the chance, those were the first people and places he ran to. \n\n\n\n\nI'm sorry, I'm rambling, but I do have a point in trying to get out. You're doing exactly the right thing right now. Tough love, no enabling, you've got it. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if he accepts your rehab offer, please help him look into what's available for him after rehab. Intensive Outpatient. Sober Living. See, it's not just about getting clean. It's about learning how to actually live, and staying clean. Building a life that makes them think twice about using again, knowing that they'll lose it.\n\n\n\n\nPeace, love, and comfort to you and your family. ",

            "There is a podcast called Jay and Silent Bob get Old, the first four episodes are Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith recounting Jasons drug history. It's maybe 4 hours and spans probably 20 years, you should listen to it, its incredibly powerful. It's an insight into addiction like you won't get anywhere else.",

            "This all sounds very much like my oldest sister. She got pregnant in high school, was married and divorce at a young age, had decades of going on and off heavy drugs, several abusive boyfriends who she would refuse to leave, lost custody of both her children (one of which lived with us for about 3 years before custody went to his father), and stole from nearly everyone in the family or alienated them some way.\n\nNow my mother, this sister was an adopted child from my mother's first marriage and didn't have particularly strong ties to my father or his family, tried to do the tough love thing for probably close to ten years and cut all contact. However, my grandmother undermined my mother's wishes and continued to enable her drug habits and generally sleazy life style. It wasn't until my grandmother died and her last scumbag boyfriend was literally found dead in a ditch that she started to seek help and straighten out her life. By this time she was close to forty, I think.\n\nOn the upside, she now really has her life together and is doing pretty well for herself. She's been clean for several years and has a good relationship with my mother.\n\nI guess the moral is, it can get better. However, your whole family HAS to be united in the tough love approach. If aunts, uncles, grandparents, anyone continues to bail him out or enable him nothing will change and he'll only blame you guys for his issues.",
            "Almost 10 years ago. I was hooked on drugs and stealing from my family and using anyone I could. My father let me move home. Stole money out of his wallet. He told me if he couldnt have his wallet in his own home, without fear. Get the fuck out. Sat on the curb, waited for a ride. Never did drugs again. ",
            "Yeah, this is tough, but you did the right thing. Offering moral and emotional support along with offering to pay for rehab are great ways to support him without being taken advantage of.\n\nIf he ever wants to get sober to change, you will be there ready to help him in the right way.\n\nJust be strong and don't get roped into supporting his habits or lifestyle.\n\nGood luck.",
            "I can't even imagine how hard that was for you. But you are absolutely doing the right thing. Nothing will get better, nothing will change until *he* wants to. Maybe seeing how much he's hurt his family will make him want to get clean, or maybe it won't. But at least you aren't contributing to his addiction, or torturing yourself and your family by laying down and letting him tear you all apart again. Be strong.",

Don't let them manipulate you or twist your arm in any direction.  Someone mentioned that people have different thresholds for what \"rock bottom\" was. Don't be surprised by how low someone would go to get an edge over you. For your family's sake, you need to have structure or framework that guides how you interact with your son (I.e. No money, only food, maintaining boundaries, calling police when necessary). It's easier to cope when you have a framework, so find support group that could help you make that.",

            "I was recently in a very similar situation, OP. My ex is an extreme alcoholic (although he's allegedly recovering now, after going to rehab), and after draining me emotionally, physically, and financially -- along with his family -- for years, I had to apply some tough love. I ended our relationship and refused to be his crutch anymore. It was one of the hardest decisions of my life, and I can't even begin to imagine what it must have felt like for you as a parent. Stay strong, OP. They say one has to hit rock bottom before they can begin to climb back up. Sending good vibes your way.",

            "As a son who had been here, DONT GIVE UP. Regardless of how you feel, regardless of his actions, regardless of anything anyone else can say, HE NEEDS YOU. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But I hope the day will come where he recognizes that he does. Don't lose your love, ever.",
            "Sorry to read this story, OP. I am also sorry I did not read your original post... Oh well. Anyways, here I am throwing my hat in:\n\nIt appears you son is mainly addicted to heroin. He also most likely mixes it up with cocain (speedball) from time to time, and he is also most likely doing benzodiazepines. That's your typical opiate addict cocktail. Whether I am right or not does not really matter, as long as we know that he is hooked on heroin/opiates, ie: the worst drug on the planet.\n\nWould you \"give up\" on your son if he had cancer? Of course not. Well, your son has a terrible disease called Addiction. Do you know who is the very first person who knows and wishes he was not afflicted by that disease: your son. That fact, I am 100% sure of. He wishes he was not caught in that death spiral, because a death spiral it is, and he knows it - life expenctancy of habitual heroin addicts is under 20 years, from time of first consumption. I know, I know, 95% of people in society do not believe it is a disease, but a growing body of science, as well as on the field experience tend to prove it is. One caveat, not all drug consumption is \"addiction\" (the disease), but habitual heroin consumption IS addiction in ALL cases.\n\nThat being said, addiction is most often linked with a) mental illness, b) unresolved personal/family issues.\n\nWhen one is addicted to heroin, it becomes the central focal point in one's life. It's the only thing that matters. Not parents, not friends, not spouse, not children, not food, not health, no nothing, no nobody. Only heroin. Hence the fact he does not give a shit about you... it's totally normal and expected. Now let's discuss why?\n\nTo make a long story short, opiates profoundly change the brain chemistry as well as the physiology of the human body. After a very short period of time, the body adapts, and that \"high\" state becomes the new normal. Every time an addict becomes low on drugs (at his stage, that's every 8-12 hours max) he experiences EXTREMELY VIOLENT and continual psychological and physiological reactions. There is only one things that can make  him well again: more dope (the name of heroin in the street). Trust me, your son absolutely hates being caught in the clutches of the devil, that's a certainty.\n\nI hope that simplified description of the addiction cycle makes you better understand what is going on.\n\nThe first step of a successful rehab is ridding him of the obligation to feed the withdrawal symptoms, which in turn will allow him to work on himself and start caring about his surrounding and loved ones: he will need to get on methadone, subutex and/or kratom. Then he will need to do what is called a \"taper\", a gradual reduction of those opiate substitutes. At first, he does not need to go off of them, and he might even stay on them for several years, that's OK, as those substitutes are much. much better than being on H on a daily basis.\n\nI mentioned that in most case, I will say all cases, Addiction is accompanied by an underlying condition a) mental illness, and/or b) personal/familial issues.\n\nWell, once his withdrawals are under contral and that he is in a more comfortable and appeased state of mind, then it's time to figure out what's wrong. with points a) and b). That in itself can take a while, of course.\n\nAs he eventually get better (no more withdrawal, better mental health, coming at peace with his issues), he will start to figure out that there is hope on the bright side of life, and he will naturally wish to regain a normal life. That's your typical addict progression.\n\nFinally, he will have to change his social setting (he cannot hang out with people of remotely bad influence) and he will have to draw plans for his life.\n\nOh and one final thing: heroin procures the most intense pleasure and sensations in the universe (on a high, of course). Once one has experienced it, it's kind of normal one want to experience it over and over again. Even once he will have gone through the 6 steps I just described, he will have haunting, recurrent thoughts about the drugs, of course. Who would not want to experience that intense, unrivaled rush of pleasure? Those are the times your son will need a permanent support structure, to distract him from those thoughts and to remind him of all the negative consequences assicated with shit consumption (another slang term for H). Good luck, dear father.",
            "These questions remind me of that quote in The Mexican. When you love someone, when do you say enough is enough? Never.    \n\nThat doesn't mean you let someone abuse you or you enable them to harm themselves. But you never really say enough is enough and write them off or make them feel unloved. I hope you find the way to balance the love (deep down) you all have for one another with this terrible disease. I'm so sorry you're all going through this. ",
            "I'm an ex addict who pretty much lost his family even after getting clean. My brothers both think I still use despite having a one month old. They haven't forgiven me for my transgressions and probably never will. Granted I did do some pretty horrible things to them and held an adoption for one and an entry into the army for the other. My Mom, i don't know what she thinks but we still talk from time to time.\n\nWhile I feel like my family has abandoned me I've moved on from them at this point. I have my own family and if they choose to hold grudges and refuse to forgive and forget it's them that loses the love, familiarity, friendship and companionship of their middle brother. \n\nProviding/throwing money at a problem, even in the form of rehab is not solving the problem. Most addicts don't need rehab, AA/NA or any other source of help. Most addicts just get tired of waking up tired and choose to finish. (Although AA/NA is always happy to take credit for those at the end of their rope).",

I hope I don't sound judgmental here because that's not my intent, but I don't think you're making a practical decision.\n\n33 or not, your son needs professional help. Addiction's a powerful, powerful disease and your son might crash very hard before seeking treatment. I understand your need to protect your remaining family but I think you need to keep close tabs on your son to make sure someone (you) is there to help him pull out of this. I really wish you the best of luck. Believe me, I understand, I've been through some of it.",

I did return home from my business trip, and after another physical incident, I said that was enough.  I called my parents (who are awesome), and my dad (who is awesome) came and helped me to safely get out.  We were even able to get my car out (its in only my name, and the lease is held by a major bank).  Funny thing was, that my dad had remarked to me that he and my mom had been waiting for that call from me for six years now.  In hindsight I should have gotten out *way* sooner, but hindsight is a bitch.\n\nDuring this process, the tribal courts and tribal police were way more helpful than I had expected.  A distant cousin of my spouse in the court actually helped us by writing a letter which would have compelled access to my car (and how to work the system), even though civil matters weren't his area and the obvious relationship.  (We didn't end up officially using the letter since we couldn't get is signed by a judge in time). The police were very understanding, and felt my request was extremely reasonable, and they did everything they could do to make sure the retrieval went smoothly.\n\nSo after an over-night stay in a major PNW city, getting the car to a transport service, and a cross-country flight, I am safely with my parents now.  It's not the house I grew up in, but it still feels like home.  And by the way, my boss and his boss are fantastic.  They have been nothing but understandable and willing to work with me so far, and that is absolutely fantastic.\n\nSo now I begin the process of rebuilding.  I'm going to focus on me, and do things I want to do which I know I wil enjoy.  I *will* rebuild myself financially and emotionally (my spouse subtly and not so subtly siphoned off resources by not having much free cash of his own, since he kept buying shit), and I will rebuild relationships which have frayed either due to alienation or distance.  Friends I have already talked to have been nothing but supportive, and I have warned them my spouse might try to manipulate them to get to me.\n\nWhat about my spouse you may be wondering?  Well, as soon as he realized that I had left his parents' house, turned off a family locator app, and was not answering his calls, he tried to guilt his way back to me.  He supposedly had a nervous breakdown, and was admitted to a local hospital off reservation.  When I landed last night there were messages from him that he had moved to the psych ward at a larger regional hospital, that he was going to try and get money back to me that I had given him for closing costs on the home purchase, and that he was sorry.  While if that is really the case, I'm sorry it happened that way, but I have the closure I need, and from now on I need to focus on myself.\n\n---\n**TL;DR**: I got out of my (financially, emotionally, physically) abusive relationship Monday, and I am not looking back, since I have amazing people in my life and things can only get better from here.",

            "I remember your original post. I'm so relieved that you're safe.",
            "Beware love bombs to guilt you into going back.  Let his \"I love you\"/\"I'm a changed man\" messages go unanswered and you'll see them eventually followed up with hate because you didn't react.  Save the hate and reread it whenever you have a moment of weakness.",
            "So glad you were able to get yourself out of a terribly abusive relationship.  \n\nA couple important suggestions for you:\n\n* Lock down your financial accounts.  Call **all** your financial institutions (banks, credit cards, loan accounts, etc).  You need new account numbers for your credit cards, checking and savings accounts.  If there are accounts that have his name on them (whether it is joint or he's a signer) you need his name removed.  Change the passwords for all your online financial accounts and telephone access accounts (my bank has a separate pin code I have to say when I call in).  You also want to have them put a note on your account that explicitly says your ex is not allowed access to those accounts.\n* If you were a signer or authorized user on any of **his** accounts, call those institutions and have your named pulled off.\n* If you had utilities in your name at his address (telephone, cable, power, gas, etc) call all those companies and **cancel** the service.  These are easy to forget about and he could easily run up your bills, not pay and force you into collections.\n* Call the credit bureaus (all three of them) and freeze your credit so he can't open any accounts in your name.\n* Change the passwords on **all** your online accounts, social or otherwise.  If the site has an option to deauthorize or force a sign out of all devices...do it.  For example, Facebook applications on iOS will remember your login information (like if you left an iPad at your exes that had Facebook logged in).  Using the force-logout option will make sure he doesn't have access to any of your information.  Facebook, iCloud and google services are some good examples of sites you want to do this on.\n* File a change of address form with USPS that forces **all** your mail (not just companies that you've changed your address with) to get diverted to a new address.  You don't want him to get his hands on important paperwork.\n\nI know this might sound a little over the top and unnecessary but it really is important.  Abusers will find any way they can think of to get back in your life, even if it's only to cause you trouble and even if it means he gets in trouble in the process.  I wouldn't put it past him to open an account in your name just so you're put in a situation where you have to call him on the phone.\n\nLastly and I think this is most important...find a counselor that specializes in abuse and trauma.  You've been through a lot and like you said in your post, you're in the process of unpacking and processing everything that happened to you.  Some of the bigger more obvious issues are possible to work through on your own.  But some aspects of abuse are very subtle and it would be helpful to have a good therapist in your corner to guide you.  \n\nFor example, you mentioned that you \"fell\" down the stairs which implies that you've at least partly bought into some of his manipulation tactics and have accepted blame for actions that are 100% his fault.  This type of abuse, where the abuser is \"rewriting\" events to make you at fault is a very nasty form of abuse, commonly called gas lighting.  It's an effective form of abuse because it causes the victim to start questioning their own memory, identity, recollection of events and hands power over the abuser.  This is one of those nuanced and subtle forms of abuse a counselor could really help you with.\n\n",
            "You took action like a champ! What a great update! \n\nDon't be surprised or alarmed if part of you still misses him. This is a normal oitcome of having beem in an abusive relationship. The feelings will fade with time. However, it wouldn't hurt to get a therapist who specializes on helping people get over abusive and manipulative relationships. \n\nCheck out the website Out of the Fog. It sounds like your ex may have a personality disorder. You may recognize a lot of his behavior there. They have a lot of good suggestions as to how to handle personality disordered people. Hopefully you will never have to face this guy again out of a courtroom, but it will be helpful for your recovery to know how to respond to abusive and manipulative behavior in the future. \n\n",

Sorry it took another physical incident and all of this work to become free through.\n\nYou sound* ok right now (which is telling) but don't be surprised if you go through a type of grieving for your relationship and who you wanted your ex to be. It will be ok, eventually.\n\nI'd probably block or permanently divert your ex though, you don't need him in your head right now. Perhaps correspondence only through a third party or something.

So happy that you got out safely, that you're able to see clearly through the gradual fog he built around you, and that you're not going to get sucked back into the abuse.

Good job.\n\nRandom but ... every time I see an update about an abusive relationship, I always think it's a different OP until I backtrack to the first post and go, \"Oh wait, it's one of the 10 other abusive relationship updates I've been waiting for.\" I think it's crazy I have to keep track because there's so many stories like this. It's sad.",
            "I just re-read your original post and realized I actually was one of the comments! I am SO glad you got out. At the time you posted the original post, I was incredibly worried that you would ignore Reddit and stay in that horrible relationship (it's hard to leave an abuser). BUT YOU'RE FREE! :) Congratulations!",

            "So happy for you! The day I walked out the sun began to shine again and my smile slowly came back. It was devastating yet freeing. Freedom is a mindset & life worth, not an economic set.

            "The beating on returning home, or soon after, was inevitable. He would have felt he needed to reassert his power over you after you threatened his self perceived superiority.\n\nI'm only posting this so that others in a similar situation might read this and get out immediately rather than risking death or permanent injury by returning.  People always think their situation is different and it usually isn't. That's why people have such big Aha! moments learning about abusive patterns.... reading lists of red flags, for example.  Someone will read this someday, thinking that their partner is different and go back for their Rolex or something, and get killed over it or get a broken cheekbone. Things can be replaced! Even your SS card and passport can be replaced!\n\nOther random bits of advice for those in this situation: File for divorce First in a location favorable to you. Change banks to a small local bank.  Change all passwords. Get a safety deposit box for your important papers and expensive jewelry if theft is possible (remember what can be considered joint property until you file). Consider a PO box if you'll be staying somewhere temporarily and it will help you stay hidden.  See if you can work from a different office location or work from home temporarily.\n\nBest of luck to you OP! HUGS!\nI'm glad you're now safe and rebuilding, OP. Hugs!",
            "I'm glad you got out. Also glad he's getting help. What he's done is unforgivable but maybe with therapy he won't do the same to someone else. You deserve way better op, good luck with everything. ",
            "There's a post I made about...an hour ago in r/gaming about how I got out of my abusive relationship (long story short:  Made a friend on xbox live, turned out he was local, we became friends in real life, when he noticed I wasn't logging on (because abusive then boyfriend broke my xbox and isolated me from my friends) he came looking for me.  Gave me a place to stay.  I never left).  I'm so happy you managed to get out of there!\n\nDon't fall for his bullshit.  That's all it is.  ",
            "A thousand times this. When I finally called my mom and told her I wanted out of my relationship, but was scared to leave since I found out he was drug dealer she and my three very large uncles showed up with a car. They had me packed, guarded, and out the door in less than 20 minutes. Never looked back.\n\nLike you, my parents and family and friends had all been waiting for that call and were just ecstatic to get it. None of them judged me, particularly those who had been taken in by my ex in the beginning and talked me into going out with him again after I initially decided he put me off for some unknown reason.\n\nI'm really happy you've gotten out. Live your life, learn from the experience, move forward. And thank you for posting a positive update about this. Hopefully someone else will see it and think, \"I can do that too.\"",
