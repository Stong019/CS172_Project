        "selftext": "Sooo in the middle of this whole pandemic we\u2019ve managed to start a family. Life is tough with a one-month old but I\u2019m afraid my husband\u2019s very helpful behavior is actually very unhelpful.\n\nMy husband grew up in a big family and is very familiar/comfortable with the care of children and babies, including small infants. I had the opposite experience. When we decided to have a baby, for me it was kind of as if we\u2019d decided to start a llama farm. I had zero experience or prior knowledge and I had to do (and still do) a ton of research.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I have severe PPD. I have already been seeing a therapist for a long time for depression/anxiety and have been put on an SSRI by my GP. So if you tell me to see a therapist and/or get medicated I\u2019ll ignore you because I\u2019ll know you haven\u2019t even bothered to read my post.\n\nThe problem is that my husband (and his mother, who is actually a lovely and helpful woman who is bugging me for the same reason he is) is always swooping in to show me how to actually do things. \n\nI don\u2019t have the muscle memory to execute the optimal way to fix a diaper or fill a formula bottle. My logical brain is confident that I\u2019m not going to kill my baby but the depression and constant wearing down by husband and MIL is getting to me. They also know I\u2019m not going to kill the baby but they always seem to know JUST what to do and when they see me struggling with something it\u2019s like they\u2019re hovering with itchy fingers just waiting to take over. The even more annoying thing is they\u2019re right; whatever they do to soothe the baby and get him to sleep works like a charm. So on top of knowing I need to learn this shit myself I feel like a failure.\n\nI feel watched and surveilled in my own home and like I\u2019m not getting one-on-one time with the baby. I feel incompetent and helpless. I can feel learned helplessness setting in. I feel useless. I\u2019ve chosen not to breastfeed for several reasons so it\u2019s like the baby really doesn\u2019t need me. (I logically know this isn\u2019t true because of attachment and all that but again, the severe depression speaks.)\n\nI know someone\u2019s going to be like wHy dOn\u2019T yOu JuSt TaLk tO HiM. Well no shit, I HAVE. Multiple times. I\u2019ve told him he needs to like, go out somewhere and take a break and just let me handle things so I can learn and bond with the baby on my own. He says \u201cOkay, okay, I get it,\u201d and then seems to promptly forget we ever had the conversation. He amazingly has selective amnesia regarding this specific topic. Ditto his MIL. He\u2019s a very fatherly person so he wants to be all over the baby all the time, which obviously I get, but it results in this issue.\n\nMy family all lives far away so I\u2019m stuck with these two. I really have vivid and deeply satisfying fantasies of taking my sharpest kitchen knife to both of their faces (which I want to say is just the PPD talking, but seriously I\u2019m infuriated). But outwardly I\u2019m too tired to protest. I\u2019m tired all the time and I just want to be left alone. I feel like I\u2019m being tortured in some kind of weird way and it kills me that we\u2019re not all able to just chill and enjoy this special time with the newborn.\n\nI told husband I think maybe we should try couples\u2019 counseling and his jaw very nearly hit the floor. He\u2019s a great guy overall obviously so he was open to this idea but I could tell he was totally dumbfounded and couldn\u2019t tell what the problem was. So I told him I just don\u2019t feel heard and I feel like both he and his mom are overbearing. So then he got sad and was all like \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help, I know it\u2019s tough to be a new mom.\u201d I got REALLY angry with him and said some not very nice things which I regret. My husband has (bizarrely) never dealt with mental illness so I think he\u2019s really freaked out by the PPD.\n\nLater I heard him talking to his mom in whispered and concerned tones about my mental health. So I feel like he is pathologizing this specific problem. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. Which I guess I already am. But you know. Is it going to kill either of them to watch me fumble a bottle or deal with a couple blowouts a few times? \n\nMy Amazing Husband I Can\u2019t Complain About has already taken it on himself to find a couples\u2019 counselor. Which obnoxiously is making me feel guilty, like, am I really complaining about nothing when I clearly have such a great guy? I mean, I know I\u2019m not. But it\u2019s driving me crazy.\n\nAny advice in advance of us seeing this counselor would be really appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: MIL and Husband are childcare know-it-alls and preventing me from learning and bonding with the baby on my own. Yes, I talked to him and no, it hasn\u2019t solved the problem.",

            "Just a practical suggestion, could you remind your husband that the hovering is making you angry and you need time to figure out the baby stuff on your own, so you're going to pick a two hour block of time daily that is mom-baby time, and either everyone else has to go away or really truly commit to not intervening unless it's an actual emergency. I'd have picked the first two hours of the day because that's when my babies were happy and fun, but evening bathtime/bedtime would be a great time to practice a whole bunch of feeding, bathing, diapering, dressing, and soothing skills.\n\nIf you have a set window, it might reduce the effort required of you to push back if someone encroaches. Like instead of a whole explanation, you can just repeat \"No, this is my time.\"",
            "\u201c.08M\u201d  \n\nNever thought I\u2019d see it written like that",
            "Ok this might sound a little crazy....but my husband was in the same position as you (minus a MIL 'helping') with our first and I was in the your husbands position ( a lot of childcare experience, but I also had PPD/A). My husband told me multiple times to leave him be but my anxiety would get the better of me. Eventually he would put on a bright red t-shirt which we called his 'I GOT THIS' shirt. When he had it on, nobody was to mess with what he was doing with babe. It was a big blaring visual reminder for me that he did not want help/suggestions/to be watched while with baby. He would put it on when he was going to practice/learn/figure out his own way of dealing with baby and it helped me sooooo much to know that when he was wearing it he didnt want anyones help. I wouldnt offer and he wouldnt feel like crap about it. That way he could communicate where he was at without having to verbalize/risk a fight.",
            "You should tell him that you want MIL to leave and give you some space to be a new mom. You feel like it's him and her vs. you. Tell him that you need him to back you up.\n\nIt sounds like he's smothering the hell out of you and that would drive anyone crazy. Get used to telling him and MIL to give you space. \"I'm changing the diaper. Go into the other room and let me handle this,\" or \"I'm filling the bottle. Go sit down and do xyz.\"\n\nGet used to this phrase: \"I am doing this thing. I will tell you if I want help.\" When he forgets, reiterate that you are doing it and you will ask for help if you want it. Really nail it into him.\n\nHonestly, if you have to, drag him to the doctor with you and explain all this to the doctor.",
            "The way I see it, you are doing tons of stuff right. You've talked to your husband about your concerns, and when he hasn't listened, you have pointed out that he isn't listening. You've told him you want to go to counseling. So on that front, I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you've done what you can. You've communicated. I really hope that the couples counselor helps.\n\nMy advice for things in addition to going to counseling is to phrase a request to your husband in terms of what you want him *to do*, not what you *don't* want him to do. It looks to me like your husband sees that you are struggling with PPD and wants desperately to do something helpful, but the only way he can think of to help is to take over whatever task you are currently doing. Perhaps if you said, \"can you please help me by letting me practice changing the diaper?\" it would click a little better for him? If you directly phrase it as, \"the way you can help me is by letting me bond with our baby right now. please go back to doing what you were doing before,\" or \"I know you want to help me, and I appreciate that. Right now you can help me by going for a walk and giving me some alone time,\" etc. \n\nAlso, does your MIL live with you two, and can she leave? I feel like living with your in laws always causes more problems than it solves, personally.",
            "Couple's counseling or solo counseling for him is a good idea. It sounds like your PPD is making him anxious, and he's doing what a lot of people do in response to anxiety, try to reassert control over anything they can. He needs to find a healthier outlet for his anxiety than micromanaging you. Acknowledge his anxiety and concerns, then request ways to deal with it together.",
            "Sounds like you established a boundary (good) but that boundary is not being respected. Try to stay cool when one tries to swoop in and tell them that you need to practice and learn. Failure and Struggle are good teachers and you have to learn. Husband and MIL were not perfect baby caretakers when they first started and neither are you and that is OK.",
            "One more suggestion, could you and your husband come up with a key word that you could say whenever you feel he is being overbearing and you really want to try on your own? A random word like \u201cpineapple\u201d or something.\n\nMy husband felt like I was constantly criticizing him and we had talked about it multiple times. I just wasn\u2019t recognizing when I was doing it until after it would get so bad that he would get upset. So we set up our word, and when he felt I was getting into negative territory he would say it and I\u2019d know immediately to back off. It helped me identify my behavior and correct it in the long run too so it happened less and less often.",
            "It will take all your strength but can you say \u201cokay guys! Tomorrow is your day; grab some breakfast, whatever you need. I\u2019m going to go solo tomorrow with baby. It\u2019s important to me to know I can do that as a new mom.\u201d\n\nNext morning? \u201cOkay guys! What\u2019s your plan today? I\u2019m solo today remember.\u201d\n\nEvery time they come at you or hover? \u201cHi! That makes me a little uncomfortable. Can you give us some space?\u201d\n\nAnd you know it\u2019s time for MIL to go home. If it takes all your strength, prioritize that.\n\nAlso try to put your confidence first here. Right now you\u2019re agreeing they know best. *They may not*. You\u2019re a parent. You don\u2019t just need experience you need instinct and you have that! Look how well you have done so far! So I would practice saying \u201chey, all moms learn this stuff. Can you help me by backing off a bit?\u201d Say it with a smile. The first few times.",
            "You\u2019re not crazy. I don\u2019t even have children and just reading this post gave me a sympathetic impulse to climb straight up a wall. This is *so frustrating.* \n\nI think a couples counselor is a very good idea. You need a third party in the room to make sure you\u2019re heard and to help you articulate your feelings when you get stuck and overwhelmed. It IS important that you get a chance to learn and bond with your baby without anybody swooping in to correct you - not just for you, but *for your child*. And it\u2019s also important for you to feel respected and treated like a competent adult in your marriage. Your husband may think he\u2019s being helpful, but what he\u2019s actually being is overbearing and infantalizing. If he doesn\u2019t trust you to figure out how to care for your own child, that\u2019s a serious problem at the heart of your family that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later.",
            "Go to the couples counselling and take it from there. I think him telling his mother about your problems is crossing the line as well. Does MIL live with you? If so then she needs to go.\n\nHim being open to counselling is a start.",
            "Oh, mama.  This sucks.  It doesn't suck your baby is being taken care of or that you have care.  But you should get to feel like a parent, too.   \nIf you aren't sure what to do and don't have the skillset the best thing I'd recommend to my patient would be skin to skin.  Lots and lots of skin to skin time.  Babies frikkin love it.  Parents love it.  Everyone loves a cuddle and it doesn't require any special skills.\n\nJust snug you baby close to you.  Don't wait until they are upset (though it works a charm then) but do it when they are happy or just starting to get drowsy.  It's pretty magical.",
            "I went through a much milder version of what you\u2019re going through, with no over-involved MIL in my house. I can tell you that I didn\u2019t have PPD and I was still so infuriated by the constant undermining of my new role as a mother that I felt like screaming at my partner and in fact was driven to angry tears and nasty rows a few times. In our case my partner was secretly very anxious about how to look after our newborn which manifested in constant interrogation about what I was doing or planning to do or constant \u201chelpful\u201d suggestions. It was micromanaging and undermining and it didn\u2019t improve until he went back to work when our baby was 4 weeks old. It negatively affected my early bonding with our baby. \n\nYou absolutely need your MIL to spend less time in your house and you absolutely need time alone with your baby. Regardless of any marriage counseling, perhaps you could schedule a joint session with your own therapist? Or do you still have a midwife or someone providing post partum care that you could speak to? \n\nPs there is no optimal way to fix a bottle or change a diaper. Just remember which goes in which end and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nI really hope things improve for you, it sucks that you have to spend precious energy to advocate for yourself when your partner should be propping you up, not tearing you down. Good intentions are meaningless when his actions hurt you. Your baby needs a mom who\u2019s supported by her partner. All the best",
            "Maybe try making the boundaries more concrete?  Like instead of asking for more bonding time, tell them that you want alone time with your baby from say 4-6pm and there are to be no interruptions unless you specifically ask.  You will go with your baby into a specific room any they stay out unless you call for them.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to brush aside boundaries when they are more.. fuzzy I guess but naming a time, place, and rules gives no room for them to claim they didn\u2019t know what you wanted.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t HAVE to do this I understand.. but maybe some enforced alone time will build your confidence and make them chill.",
            ">Is it going to kill either of them to watch me fumble a bottle or deal with a couple of blowouts a few times?\n\nI was asking myself this from the very beginning. I think this problem has an easy fix\u2014but it\u2019s all on him and mom. They have to listen to you and they have to respect what you want. Maybe you can find a way to tell him that literally he and his mom just need to leave you the fuck alone with the baby and let you bond and learn how care for it.\n\nOP this isn\u2019t your PPD talking. I fucking hate when people do this. I. Didn\u2019t. WANT. You. To. Stepping in for someone isn\u2019t helpful if they don\u2019t WANT it, and at worse it can actually *dismissive*. And that\u2019s why you want couples counseling because he keeps fucking dismissing what you\u2019re saying. \n\nYou\u2019re not being irrational, your response to this is normal as fuck. If he\u2019s scared or concerned to leave you and the baby alone, those are feelings that he\u2019s going to have to work through. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a trauma survivor w learned helplessness AND an elementary school teacher. You know how kids get learned helplessness? \n\nWhen their parents do everything for them.\n\nPlease don\u2019t dismiss your feelings as PPD. It\u2019s time for a come to Jesus talk with your husband. For the love of fucking god everything will be fixed if he and mom just back the fuck off.",
            "Go to the counselor, air your grievance, have the counselor agree and look at your husband to hear his side then make it clear you need space to learn and bond. \n\nYou are right.\n\nWell done expressing it out loud to your family and here to us. You are doing entirely fine regarding the PND that shit is hard, I know I've been there too.",
            "Show him this post. \n\nAlso, if you want him to go away for 3 hours, set a timer and if he comes back in that time, remind him that it hasn\u2019t been 3 hours yet. If that keeps being a problem, add 20 minutes for every interruption.\n\nEdit: also, perhaps point out that you can\u2019t get better at this if he won\u2019t allow you to. For example, when learning to drive a car, it doesn\u2019t help when someone drives FOR you - you still won\u2019t be able to drive. And it certainly doesn\u2019t help when they grab the damn wheel from you every time you try to move forward.",
            "I\u2019d lock my ass in the nursery with that baby and rock away the hours. Go on long walks just the two of you. Take the late nights. Try baby-wearing and skin to skin. Set a timer for three or four hours and tell him it\u2019s your time and don\u2019t interrupt. I\u2019ve put miles and miles and hours and hours in the rocking chair I\u2019m sitting with my 1 year old now (and her sister before that). \n\nAlso, as annoying as his helpfulness may be I do think I would have valued that kind of input in the early days. But make sure you both understand that (unless it\u2019s a real serious safety issue) there are a lot of different ways to do the same thing and don\u2019t let him deter you from doing things slightly different just because he says that the way it should be done. There are different ways to rock a baby, burp a baby, mix a bottle effectively etc...\n\nSo sorry about the PPD my dear, good for you for taking control of it. I imagine you are kidding about the kitchen knife bit (and I get it!), but if you aren\u2019t you definitely need to tell your therapist that NOW. (Sorry I worked in mental health, mandated reporter and all that)\n\nYour baby knows you, your baby is most comfortable with you and recognizes YOUR heartbeat.\n\nAnd it\u2019s time to send MIL packing! Too many cooks in the kitchen!",

            "Oh man, that must be very hard to deal with. Maybe write down what you feel and agree on a \u201csafe word\u201d. Make sure he understands what you mean and when he\u2019s doing it again you can remind him by using your safe word.\n\nHoe long is your MIL staying? Or does she live really close by and does she drop by a lot? You can try to carry your baby in a ringsling or another wrap/ carrier type of thing. Skin to skin is really awesome, even if you don\u2019t get to bottle feed or change diapers as much as you\u2019d like, you at least get that bonus feeling of snuggling with your baby. \nThe first few months are so busy and chaotic with all the bottles and the diapers and whatnot, why not focus only on the cuddling and bonding for now. Let them handle the diapers for a bit. Baby needs only you. And you can focus on your health and rest. You probably already know this, but there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with letting baby sleep in your arms every day. Baby can take every nap in your arms and it will only be good for you and baby. There\u2019s nothing as enjoyable as lying half naked with a baby on top of you (it\u2019s honestly one of the reasons I have a third baby lying on top of me right now).\n\nThis time will pass, but you won\u2019t miss out on the diapers and feedings. You\u2019ll be changing so many diapers, you\u2019ll be preparing so many bottles. Let them help. Don\u2019t fight it. Accepting help (even if they\u2019re a bit overbearing) is not a sign of failure. Trust me mama. You are in NO way failing as a mother. All the rest you guys can discuss during the couples counseling sessions you guys have planned ;) but please don\u2019t doubt yourself.\n\nPs. I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t be annoyed or that your wrong or anything, I\u2019m trying to see the positive side as somebody who was very alone and had it reversed. I breastfed my first child for 18 months because he wouldn\u2019t take the bottle. All the fun stuff was for my husband and the family, I was the one feeding 3x a night. It was really rough. So maybe I\u2019m biased, but taking only the fun stuff and allowing others to do the tedious bits doesn\u2019t seem like such a bad deal to me :)",
            "I doubt you'll see this, but I feel compelled to respond with my story, which is selfish of me, but I think might help.  It sounds like you know a lot of this, but here goes.\n  \nMy little girl is going to be 1 year old in 2 days, and I was in your situation.  My partner had a 3 year old (now 5) daughter when we met, so she had been through all of a baby's firsts.  Her mother lives with us and I'm very grateful to have another person helping with the house and child care, but that's another person who \"knows what they're doing\".  \n  \nWhen she got pregnant, I was excited but quickly got scared.  I never thought I would have kids and had not had hands-on experience with any of my friends' children for any length of time.  My partner signed us up for multiple child-care classes, pretty much entirely for me (she insisted she \"needed a refresher\" - she's pretty great).  \n  \nThe classes were taught by a wonderful woman, certified nurse, works in a hospital (where the classes were), and has children of her own (not necessary for knowledge, but she had a lot of good anecdotes).  We learned:  \n  \nEACH PARENT NEEDS ALONE TIME TO BOND WITH THE BABY.  She emphasized this for wives, since the baby grows inside them and many nurse the baby, but pointed out it is advice for any gender.  Each parent needs to learn their own way of doing things.  If one parent swaddles one way, they need to let the other parent figure out their own way.  If one parent is overbearing, they need to be sent away to see friends for the day or go shopping or rent a motel room and sleep.  Each parent can have something only they do with the baby - she suggested fathers take over bath time (which I did, and is one of my favorite things in the world).  If one parent never gets alone time, they lose the confidence they need to take care of their own child.  THIS IS WORSE FOR THE BABY.  \n  \nOTHER FAMILY MEMBERS NEED TO KEEP THEIR DISTANCE.  Visiting is fine, and god knows new parents need chores done or food made (she stressed that if anyone asks what they can do to help, ask them to make you food and drop it off).  But family members, especially grand-parents need to let the parents bond with their own baby.  Also, a lot has changed since they raised each of the parents.  40 years ago, parents were told to make their babies sleep on their stomachs.  Now doctors say to make babies sleep on their backs.  Science has learned new things, and grandparents aren't always willing to adapt to methods that lead to healthier, happier babies (with less risk of SIDS).  They should not be spending more than short visits with the family.  If they interfere with learning how to take care of the baby, it makes parents feel less able to care for their own baby.  THIS IS WORSE FOR THE BABY.  \n  \nObviously, every parent needs help sometimes.  You have to be there for each other.  \"Honey, can you change this poopy diaper, I'm dizzy.\"  But its the difference between asking for help, and having someone take over.  \n  \nI am very stubborn.  I want to be able to handle everything myself.  I got frustrated when I struggled with learned how to swaddle correctly.  I got heated when my partner would check on me.  But she was not jumping in.  She was waiting until she thought I needed help.  And I did.  A lot.  But I also got left alone a lot, and now I feel ready for anything with the baby.  \n  \nSo.  A lot of people are suggesting marriage counseling and are being kind of gentle about things.  There's nothing wrong with marriage counseling, it can really help.  But I'm going to suggest two other things that a few people have mentioned.  \n  \nFirst, take child care classes with him.  I don't care how many babies he's raised - times change, recommendations change, and babies live longer because of it.  Hopefully he'll see some of the things I mentioned above about letting you learn and hopefully you'll get some knowledge that will make you feel more confident.  \n  \nSecond, grandma cannot come over without permission.  She may be hurt, but this absolutely needs to happen.  Its your baby, not hers.  She can spoil them rotten and come over every day in a year or two, but she needs to stay away for at least the first year.  Even with my mother-in-law living with us, she let us handle everything, and would just check in a few times a day to see if WE needed anything, not the baby.  \n  \nJust frame everything above as being better for the baby, because it is.  I hope this helps even a tiny bit.",
            "Perhaps look into childcare classes. Yeah, you already have the baby, but when was the last time your MIL had a baby? Generally, people who have a baby are the ones who update the knowledge. And the role of the partner is also now different, being both more involved and relied on. Fathers don't babysit anymore. But it means that sharing the chores and roles has a different approach than before. If you are both the most recently updated about childcare, your MIL is not needed. That gets rid of a big part of the problem, two vs one. \n\nAs terrible as it sounds: parenthood comes with the frustration and tears and in one month you're already dealing with a lot. At some point, you'll have to learn to set it aside and try again and he's preventing you from that part. Coping skills are skills that improve by practicing them. So what if you're crying with a poopy diaper that's not perfectly put on one day? Your kid will produce another one and there are cleaning solutions for the rest.",
            "I feel for you I really do. Your body and mind are all over the shop and will be for at least the next few months, the joys of having a baby. I can say it will get easier with time. \nAre you in a position to talk to your MIL? Remember she had to start the same way, she had to learn from scratch how to raise and bond with her children. Would you consider sitting her down and explaining that you actually need to learn how to handle the baby and you will only learn by doing it yourself, if they keep swooping in that they take that opportunity away. \nI\u2019m sure you are blue in the face from trying to express this to your husband, but they both need to actually hear you. \nThe awful thing about ppd and hormones flying in general that first year, everyone\u2019s view is \u201coh it\u2019s just the hormones\u201d so they actually don\u2019t take what you are saying seriously. Everything that is slightly out of character is just brushed aside or ignored completely. \nLeave your husband find the counsellor, look at it as a job off your already hectic list. That is once you are comfy talking to them. \nIf the MIL lives with you and they are discussing things about you, you should be part of the conversation. You don\u2019t need to feel like it\u2019s two against one in your own house. \nIf you sit them both down at the same time and express that they just need to take it down a notch and let you bond and learn then they can\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d what you said, if they do then remind them. Believe me, when you start to feel better you will resent them for doing this, and you will kick yourself for not standing up and saying time and again until you are heard. Also if you feel like you are having your bonding time hindered by them it will prolong the bonding with your child. \nPlease believe me I have been in your position and I didn\u2019t get to really bond with my son until he was 16months, that first year is a blank for me I can only look back a photos and remember how that year was. It is a gut wrenching feeling. I really regret not screaming from the rooftops that I need to do this by myself to learn. So please do not do this to yourself.",
            "I think you\u2019re on the right track going to couples counseling.\n\nAlso, is MIL living with you a semi-permanent living arrangement? Because if not, she should go home. You and your husband need to find a parenting dynamic that works for you two, and I don\u2019t think his mother being around constantly is conducive to that.",

            ">bond with baby (.08M) \n\nI read this as \".08 months\" and was confused how you'd have all these issues already with a 2 day old baby. Still though, this means... 0.96 months so almost 29 days old... lol weirdly precise age.\n\nI agree with the commenter who said you need nonverbal cues to avoid arguments.",
            "Get your MIL out of your house. When my mum was 9 months pregnant with one of my brothers, her MIL came to stay to help out with the other kids to give my mum a break. They didn't get on too well, and having her in the house landed my mum in hospital, she became so stressed that she became horribly dehydrated and started having symptoms of a phantom heart attack. When they realised that she was okay, the first request to my dad was to get his mother out of the house before my mum came home from the hospital. \n\nIf you can have some alone time in your own house, you might feel a but of relief. You won't be ganged up on and the feeling that you're constantly being observed may reduce. It sounds like your husband and MIL are trying to help, but they're helping in the wrong way for you. Reclaim some of your space, and then you can begin to make your husband understand what you need from him.",
            "First off, I'm sorry this time isn't going the way you wanted and for how frustrating your husband and MIL are being. \n\nYes, new moms often need help. Yes, it's tough being a new mom. But here's the thing: you are still a person who gets to decide what kind of help she wants*.* And if what you want is time to figure out how to actually get to care for the kiddo you BUILT YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN BODY - then your husband's response should be to step out of the way. If he has that much experience with kids, then he knows crying for an extra minute while mom works out a blowout or finds the right way to bounce or shush isn't going to harm your baby at all. \n\nYou DO have a great guy...who is still being an ass. You absolutely CAN complain about his behavior because he's ignoring the one thing you have asked and asked for. He isn't respecting your needs.  My advice would be to really remember that when approaching counseling - do not be afraid to really explain how you feel and why his actions, despite the good intentions, are still hurtful to you. You are not irrational at all for feeling this way. Not even a little bit and your PPD has nothing to do with that (except by possibly magnifying those feelings...that were still caused by his lack of respect for you). \n\nHang in there and I hope you start feeling better!",
            "I get why your husbands behavior is annoying... but that's actually really common behavior for new parents. Most of the time it's the new mom who just can't bear seeing the father fumble around with the baby, it's just now the roles are reversed. It's only been a month. It's a big change for everybody and it can be really hard to let go of a new baby. I don't think he's doing this because of you specifically being a failure, he's doing this because trusting ANYONE with his new baby is really hard right now.\n\nI can sense that your patience is really thin (judging by you pre-emptively roasting any helpful comments that wouldn't be helpful, lol), but you might just need to give him a little leeway here. Work it out in couples counseling, and in the meantime, remember that it's only been a month and everyone is just trying to catch their breath and take care of that newborn.",
            "Hey, I'm really glad you suggested couple's counseling. That was my initial thought before reaching to that part. Like it would be better if there's this neutral person who can listen to the both of you. Your husband does not seem to understand just yet how serious you are when you asked him to let you bond with the baby. But with the help of a counselor, I'm pretty sure it will finally sink in to him what you truly mean.\n\nNot much advice from me before the therapy. Not sure if you like writing, but if you do, try to organize your thoughts by writing them down. Imagine how and what you want to say to the counselor. Try to do this when you have the energy. Best of luck dear!",
            "A couple's counselor will be amazing.  They are used to PPD and they will help explain how you feel to the husband.  Make sure it's one you like too.  The first year is really hard and they are trying to protect you, even if it's really annoying.  A counselor will address this and work out a solution for you.",
            "Your irritation is palpable in this post. The rigidity of your approach to this problem, too. It's NOT your fault. You're suffering from PPD. But you can work on unsticking from some of these very black-and-white thoughts. And I'm notiicing you're saying there's a TON of super intense emotion going on underneath that you can't communicate to either the MIL or the hubs. TBH, gurl. You sound like you're SUPER in your own head, which is symptom #1 of PPD. \n\nI know you have a therapist. Get a new one. These are all internal systems you can be approaching with more kindness and flexibility. There are surely moments of enjoyment you can be relishing if practice (really, practice! Like a workout!) switching your attention from the internal thought-loop that's keeping you stuck in anger. \n\nAs a therapist, there's about twenty things in here I could suggest, but as a (slightly tipsy) human being, consider this: LET THEM do all the work. \n\nWhy not? What's telling you you need to be as good at diapers and bottles as your husband is? Think of all the men who have successfully raised healthy, happy children while letting their wives do 95% of the diaper changes. That could be you! If you husband is good at it and likes it, let him do it! Less work for you! Then you can just enjoy the parts you like-- cuddling your baby, reading stories, booping his little nose. Whatever it is that works for YOU. Don't stress about forming your \"bond\" with the baby. If you're spending time with him, you're bonding. Literally that's all it takes. He'll know your face and your voice and your smell and if you look at him and smile and snuggle him, a bond will form. I promise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe MIL sounds annoying af, tho. You can ask her to come by less, and/or ask her specifically to help with tasks you DON'T like, so that you can focus on the ones you do.   \n\n\nSooo... quick re-frame: what if this was a blessing in disguise? What if you could just enjoy being the exact kind of mom you are, RIGHT NOW? That baby is gonna grow and change, it's not going to be just like this forever. Just relax and let them take care of it while you heal, and rest, maybe do some yoga. Tell yourself you'll be \"super mom\" when the kid can use words, or something. Until then, ENJOY it!",
            "I feel suffocated just reading this. As someone who has anxiety this behaviour from them is overbearing.\n\nYou have spoken to him .. hes not done anything to fix this and his mum living there may be actually fuelling this behavior...  is he a mummy's boy with something to prove?? \n\nHonestly I think mother in law needs to leave you both to enjoy being new parents and he needs to stop being such a perfectionist .. I'm sure it's not just with the baby there will be other ways he displays this and it's all to seek approval from someone hes always trying to get a gold star from if u guessed his mum ... u would be right .\n\nCouples therapy is absolutely a fair suggestion but as it stands theres no privacy in your home with his mum there I get the feeling he runs to his mum with everything about the relationship that needs to stop ..that behaviour undermines the relationships",

His mother sounds neither lovely nor helpful. She sounds horrible.\n\nI think the PPD is likely caused or worsened by their abuse.\n\nI was raised by a mother who sounds just like your husband and his mother, and it took me a long time to realize how abusive she was. For the longest time, just like you, I thought they were great and helpful and that I was the one dealing with mental illness.",
            "Honestly, I'd just like to validate your feelings. I think you're completely justified in feeling frustrated and anyone would feel the same. You're working hard to establish a proactive parenting role and set boundaries with your husband and MIL. It sounds like you've been clear with your husband, and he's continued to undermine you and disregard your feelings. \n\nThis is not ok. It must feel very emotionally draining when you're already tired and feeling vulnerable. He may be a great guy, but he's not behaving very great right now. I understand he's outwardly saying his intention is to support you, but his actions are saying otherwise. Even after you have explained how he is actually making you feel, he's still choosing to carry on. \n\nWhy is that? Does he have a reason? Is this the first time he's behaved in this way or is it a reoccurring pattern from him? \n\nPractically, I think some of the other poster's suggestions are really good. Set designated mum-and-baby bonding time each day that is uninterrupted. I'd go so far as to block it off on a calendar and pin it on the fridge for all to see, so no-one can claim ignorance. Also, the idea of baby wearing is excellent. It's a lot harder for MIL / Dad to sweep in and take baby when he's snuggled in a sling. I highly recommend a Tula carrier, I used one with my tiny premmie, so they're ok with newborns (you can get a newborn insert) and I still use it daily now he's a toddler. There's plenty of different ones out there though. \n\nBest of luck to you. You're doing great. Your MIL and husband should be making it easier for you, not harder.",

Also maybe in the moment of them hovering or stepping in be more vocal about what they're doing and how it makes you feel, etc. Just remember that what might work for them won't necessarily work for you and that's just the way things are. You and that baby will find your own things together as time moves on. You're doing great!",

Just a thought, not necessarily the case. But no matter what it is, MIL needs to go home. Any help she is offering is completely nullified by her effect on your health.",
            "You have nothing to feel guilty about. Your frustrations are valid. It's unacceptable that they are both helicoptering. And if they are pathologizing your needs, that's not acceptable either.\n\nI'm glad you'll be going to couple's therapy. That will help. Until then (and you very well might already be doing this), I'd keep reiterating your demands every single time they helicopter you. \"Husband, I told you to let me take care of the baby on my own.\" When he \"forgets\" and comes back, \"We just talked about this. Give me time with our baby.\" When MIL steps in, \"I appreciate your help, but I need time to bond with my child on my own.\" When she comes back, \"MIL, I was perfectly serious. Let me take care of my baby.\" And just keep repeating it until they back off. Don't apologize. Just tell them how it is. And I agree with others that sending MIL away might be a good idea. It'll give you some respite.\n\nI know you're exhausted. I wish I could help with that. I will say, you are doing everything right. You're communicating with him. You're getting the help you need from your doctors. You're stuck between a rock and a hard place, and you're refusing to let them crush you, and that's awesome. You'll be ok.",

            "I wasn\u2019t a childcare novice when I became a parent, but my first children were twins, which is... overwhelming in the first days even if you know what to do with babies in a general sense. There were times I just broke down sobbing because I was *so goddamn tired* that literally any activity seemed impossibly difficult. I had PPA and there were days that just felt impossible from start to finish. So I empathize with how miserable this is (honestly, I am impressed that you had the wherewithal to write it all down).\n\nSince you aren\u2019t nursing, and since you are exhausted, can you tell your husband that you desperately need a solid night of sleep, and could he and MIL please handle all the night feedings and wakings for a solid twelve hour block? And then, as a thank you, have them go somewhere else for the day (this may be tricky right now, but maybe an outdoor activity?) and you get some one-on-one time with the baby without anyone looking over your shoulder. \n\nFor me, when I finally weaned and got that first night of unbroken sleep... it wasn\u2019t like my PPA magically resolved, but I went from feeling like I was drowning in it, to floating on the surface and able to see land. \n\nAnd I agree that flat-out telling them \u201cno, I\u2019ve got this\u201d when they hover is essential. Baby care is exhausting and stressful, but it isn\u2019t difficult in a technical sense. You will become proficient *very* quickly with a little practice, and it is okay to be blunt with them if they\u2019re butting in on your chance to get that.\n\nAnd hey, take heart- the baby stage is so all-encompassing while you\u2019re in it, but it is chronologically so short. In a matter of months, who was the slickest bottle prepper will be forgotten and meaningless (and it will forever be that way to your actual kid, just as it is now). This fog of overwhelming exhaustion is not forever.",

My mil had three kids and I have one and she was instantly and aggressively up my butt about what I was doing wrong and what I should be doing instead. And my husband responds to stressful situations by getting bossy.  It felt like two-on-one at times. I did not expect to be defending all my mothering choices three weeks into it but there I was. I distinctly remember being in the shower and thinking about things while washing my jacked up body and just feeling totally alone. I really had to dig deep in ways that I was not anticipating.  \n\n\nPlus right now you are getting pretty close to rock bottom in terms of sleep deprivation. I know this is utterly miserable but honestly you are close to rock bottom here and there is nowhere to go but up. A month from now you will be better at holding and changing and feeding, a month from now your baby will be less fragile, and a month from now hopefully you will be sleeping a little more.\n\n\nHonestly if he is so helpful and everything she needs to go home. You need to bond with your baby. That is just as important as making sure the baby is fed, clothed, whatever else the \"right\" way.  It sounds like she is helping with some things but making others much worse.\n\n\nMy heart goes out to you. It will get better soon.",
            "First I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. I too went through some very bad PPD after my second child. It was almost crippling. So crippling that I found something to be angry about all day. My husband told me that he thought he lost the person he fell in love with. Until I decided to see a counselor. I know you said not to suggest that but I can\u2019t help but worry about your feelings. Not because you will hurt your baby but because you don\u2019t deserve to feel this way and be alone in your feelings. I can see how your husband and MIL are being overbearing and they absolutely need to give you some space. I think a couples counselor would also help your husband see that. Right now with our current pandemic, being limited on activities, and have a newborn - that\u2019s a lot to handle. I feel for you and I\u2019m so very sorry. It\u2019s ok to feel angry and all of the other emotions too. Just know that talking to someone isn\u2019t the end of the world. I only say that with love, no judgement at all.

            "Let me just say your feelings are probably what your baby is sensing. I felt this way too when my son was first born. He was extremely collicky and my mother always seemed to know just what to do. She stayed with me and she would swoop in after about 10 min to calm him. I had a mental breakdown and locked myself in the bathroom with my collicky screaming, breastfed baby, we took a bath, I rubbed his back, it started off with me sobbing and just trying to get away from my mom because I wanted to figure him out. And it ended up being the best 4 hours I've ever spent locked in the bathroom. When my emotions calmed down he did to. That's when I realized that her constantly telling me to stay calm and breathe was her trying to tell me that your infant senses your anxiety. Things got a lot better after that. My mom stepped off after that too realizing that she was hurting our bonding time and putting a damper on the breastfeeding relationship by soothing him instead of letting him nurse past his frustration. We breastfed for 18 months, his collick started to go away after a month or two. And he's still very very close to his Nene",

I was never able to just sit around and not jump in when I heard our baby cry so I'd send my husband and LO out on walks or errands together.

I regret acting that way and I truly believe I deprived my son and my (now EX) SO of important bonding experiences.

            "PPD SUCKS. I'm sorry. I read the post and a few comments so I'm not sure if this has been suggested, but write down your feelings for him to read- including some phrases you plan on using when you want to be left to it and don't want ANY pushback because you don't have the emotional, mental, or physical energy to both be a new mom and fight to be recognized and validated. Have him acknowledge that when you say \"x\" phrase that he will leave you alone and that his mom not only knows this, but that he will police his mom on it. That's the best I can come up with besides telling you that you're on the right track, and marriage counseling will be amazing. Go into it as open as possible; it's similar to regular therapy in that you have to decide what you can do, not tell the therapist \"My husband sucks at this\" and expect them to scold him for you. A good counselor will guide your husband and you into ways that you can communicate about this better, both now during the fun postpartum issues and later as you parent together with a child that will react differently to each of you,  no matter what you do. Make sure you stick to a counselor that you both respect and click with; I'm sure you know but therapy isn't one size fits all. Oh and I just thought- do you have one of those baby slings? The fabric ones for teeny babies, not the big ones for 6+ months so you can literally walk away with your kid when you want some bonding time :) might be nice,  plus it feels a heck of a lot better on your back when the weight is in the front, even little baby weight.\n\nCongrats on the baby!! My daughter is 20 months now, and while the anxiety and depression are pretty much back to my more \"normal\" pre-pregnancy levels, there are still a few moments that get to me. I had a list on the fridge that my husband and I  referenced that had a portion with my \"triggers\", things that stressed me out or set me off, and a list of \"symptoms\" which were just ways my PPD expressed itself- often it showed up before I even recognized it, so I'd be flaming mad about something or feeling especially lazy and exhausted and then a day or two later realize it was beyond the norm... having it written down for us to recognize and address helped. Just as a dumb example, I stopped watering my plants when I was feeling down. Always a few days before it became too much,  they'd be dried out. Weird stuff like that. Mainly, just know it gets better and you've got this. You're already miles ahead of many new parents, and your obvious attention to priorities and acknowledgement of your own trials here shows you'll work to be a good parent. You're awesome and I hope everything becomes smooth sailing over the upcoming weeks!",
            "Wow. I used to think that my hubby (now ex) who was a hands-off dad was bad. But at least I got to work out the things myself that you want to work out, with carrying for your child... And I'd ask him to be more hands on. And it took a while but he improved. But I think that you might have it tougher in a different way. \n\nI really wish you the best lovely mummy. I really do.\nAt least you do have support when you're head is a bit sad.\nBut then I really feel the crying out for space you are asking for. In a different way to you but I still feel you. Oh I have a sad head too. So just acknowledging that everyone's struggle is a little different too. Similar shoes. Different path. \nI felt suffocated when the hubby came home. Like my mothering and household management was under scrutiny. \n\nAnyway honey. Enough about me.\nYou are your own person who deserves to be heard.\nGood luck with the counselling. I really wish you the best.",
            "Your MIL needs to leave. It\u2019s sounds like you\u2019re finding being home unnerving. If she goes then you have just one person to engage on the topic. I also think it will be impossible to manage the situation without both your husband and MIL taking it personally. Her leaving minimizes the risk and/or impact of thereof.",
            "I have no advice to offer, I just wanna echo that you are not going crazy, and you aren't \"complaining about nothing\". Good luck, sending good energy your way.",
            "You've tried to talk, now it's time to demand.\n\"Honey, while a greatly appreciate that you have more experience than me, it's time for me to do this on my own, without you or your Mom swooping in to guide me.  LO, feels the anxiety I have when you guys are around to save me. How about you and Mom go have a mom-son lunch (or day, weekend, week.... however long you feel you need to yourselves) so LO and I can figure this out on our own\"\n\nYou could also insist that you get time alone with your babe on a regular basis. Whatever schedule you feel you need to bond with him.  The babe is feeding off you anxiety, which is most definitely exasperated by you knowing your husband and/or mil are ready to swoop in. All you need is some time alone with him. \n\nCongratulations! You got this.",
            "Post natal depression is crippling. He is coming from a good place but it is hurting you. Mental illness is mostly invisible so he maybe forgets because he can't see the symptoms himself. Write down your thoughts, feelings and concerns before going to see the counselor. This will help you get out everything you need to if you're overwhelmed or forget. Hopefully they will help put some boundaries and practices in place that give should the space to be a mother. You need to build the confidence in taking care of your baby by TAKING CARE OF YOUR BABY. I really hope the counselor helps your husband see that you're hurting and you can start feeling like you're a mother. Because you are. You are a mother. You have every right to take care of your child as your husband does.",
            "Omg hahaha. Do I resonate with this. My boyfriend is TOO nice and TOO helpful and it makes me feel so useless. One time I was sharpening my kitchen knives and while doing it I started fuming already having the imaginary discussion in my head where he'd kindly point out a better way to do it (and by doing so prove that I'm doing it wrong). \n\nSo when he DID come over and of course he tried to help, I immediately burst into tears, put all the knives away and stormed out. \n\nThe poor guy had no idea what was going on... and I 100% know that I was just being crazy, but it's so frustrating! \n\nHere's where the difference lies with our scenarios though... I came back into the room and explained to him why it gets so frustraring sometimes and how it makes me feel like I cannot do anything properly. \n\nHe then proceeded to use one of the knives and spent the next three days gushing over how sharp they were and how well of a job I'd done. I know it's silly but it did actually make me feel better, and he's more aware now of not trying to always offer friendly tips. \n\nI GET it. They just want to be helpful and friendly and you're the crazy one for letting 'nice'  bother you. But it sounds like your husband isn't listening to you, which is a secondary problem. \n\nSO.... \n1. Your feelings are valid. \n2. You aren't crazy.  \n3. Ask for one hour alone  with the baby a day. Even if it's locking yourself in the child's bedroom to read them stories etc. so you can have proper bonding time. If he doesn't like this idea just say your therapist has suggested it? Bit of a white lie but it might be easier to get his mum  off your case too. \n4. Try not to get mad at him. He sounds like a bit of a doofus, but a nice doofus. \n5. Don't be mad at yourself. What you're  feeling is SUPER common. \n6. Why not try a mothers group? That will get you some time without him and his mother, and you'll get bonding time PLUS be around other people that can give you some tips. \n\nGoodluck x",
            "Couple of random thoughts, in random order: \n\n1. My mom told me a story that always stuck with me: when I was a newborn, I started crying. Nothing she could do would comfort me, soothe me, shut me the hell up. She ran up the hill to the hospital, three blocks away, and I was starting to turn blue from crying. The nurse took me into her arms, I zonked - stopped crying, turned pink, snuggled into the nurse's arms, and fell asleep. Mom, of course, thought she was a failure - the nurse said it was very common with new mothers, that they got tense and the baby picked up on that and cried. I'm telling you that, because you're not a failure. \n\n2. When you talked to your husband, how did you approach it? You are in therapy, so I'm guessing you used I-statements, but did you get any kind of actual buy-in from him? Did he engage? That might make a difference, like asking him what he hears you say, rather than assuming he understands your words. \n\n2.A. One of the \"rules\" in my biz is \"the first person to speak after the ask, loses.\" When you talk to him, make your ask - and then shut up. Make him come to you, either agreeing or not agreeing, make him tell you whether he'll comply. (This isn't game playing, it's communication skills.)\n\n2.B. When you talk to him about this, use short, simple sentences, and address one small part at a time. Pretend he's a half-witted non-English speaker and you're translating for him. Often, when asking for something from someone we love, especially when we're depressed, we'll try to explain, rather than ask. You need time with your baby. It doesn't matter why, so don't explain why. Just say so, and then check in with what they heard. \n\n2.C. Before you talk with him, prepare yourself. Create a road map of what you need from him. Break it down: I need both of you to keep your grubby mitts off my baby unless I ask for help, or whatever. Again, why is your business. My advice is to get the agreement before giving any explanation. \n\n3. When I used to work with horses, the \"rule\" was: ask, tell, make. Use that with your husband - ask him to stop hovering; if he doesn't, tell him to stop hovering. And if he still doesn't, you know what to do. \n\n4. Don't feel guilty about your husband finding the therapist. He's doing the minimum. You grew a person in your belly, fer cryin' out loud! The least he can do is find the fix-it for his smothering. Seriously - you already know that, just validating. \n\n5. If I found myself in this sort of situation, I would get a tiny water pistol - small enough it's not easily seen. When my husband \"forgot\" our agreement, I'd squirt him without warning. You want him to learn that breaking agreements causes discomfort, not that you cause him discomfort. (Yes, another from horse-training, and surprisingly effective with husbands. Or so I've heard.) That might work for you, or it might give you an idea of something else that would work for you. \n\n6. I forgot the part about talking when everyone is calm and rested. You knew that, right? \n\n7. Maybe have The Talk with all three of you. His mother might actually recognize what you're saying, remember being a new, first time mother herself, and knock some sense into her spawn. If not, at least all three of you will be aware of what's going on. \n\n8. I'm really sorry you're going through this, but it sounds like you've got a great handle on it all, even if it doesn't feel that way. Yet. \n\nBest luck.",
            "Men who blame your reasonable behavior on PPD are not amazing men. It\u2019s normal to want to parent your child without constant intervention. Stop putting him on a pedestal.

I would go to bed with the baby at 7 or 8 and get up through the night. I\u2019ve always loved naps so getting up then napping 2 times a day worked for me. \n\nHang in there! You can get through it!

            "First of all, I'm really fucking sorry. It sounds like you're in an awful purgatory, and you've tried everything you possibly could think of, and things are still terrible and alienating and shitty. That fucking sucks.\n\nLots of smarter more experienced people have chimed in with better advice than I could ever give, but I do want to say, I don't know how long you've been on the same SSRI, but you might want to check in with yourself and your doctor. Is it helping? Did it feel like it helped in the beginning, but is helping less now, weeks/months later? You may need your dosage or your particular brand of meds adjusted. Or maybe it never worked for you in the first place, and there's a better option out there. Mental health struggles are awful and insidious largely because they alter our perceptions without us realizing it, and the medications we use to treat them often become less effective over time.\n\nYou sound like an awesome, loving mom. You WANT to bond, you WANT to be the best mom you can be, but sometimes that awful saying, \"perfection is the enemy of progress\" is true, and your desire to do things perfectly immediately rather than adequately for now prevents you from feeling like you can say (to husband or MIL), \"Nope, I'll figure it out, thanks.\" It's so much easier to give in when you can sense them hovering, antsy, just waiting for you to hand Baby over so they can do the thing \"correctly.\" But here's the trick: there is no one perfect way to do most of these things, only the way that works for your baby. (And what works now might not work in a few weeks! And what worked for your MIL's kids might not always work for your individual, unique little person.)\n\nYou feel wrong. You're not wrong. Learning is not wrong. You are a great mom. Things are fucking shitty right now. They will not be forever. It will get better.

            "I too just had a baby in this craziness and I see a lot of similarities between the two of us. The day I had my son was the day they locked down the hospital and our province. When I got home I was tired and exhausted,  tried breast feeding and it was not happening and I was feeling very disconnected from my baby and that I was failing everything and my husband was being this super awesome dad only compounding my feelings of failure. Although I was lucky to not develop PPD, I had a good dose of baby blues and severe fear of developing PPD which cause a  bunch of anxiety.  Several things I would suggest/note:\n\nYou are not alone in what your feeling and seem very conscious of your feelings... there is nothing wrong with you. \n\nDont feel bad about taking time to developed that bond with your child. Dont forget they're kind of a sack of potatoes right now and really dont do much other than eat, sleep, poop and stare at the wall... you gots time. I didn't feel like I truly started bonding until month 2 after I also gave up trying to breast feed. \n\nDont forget your hormones are going crazy. If you had a csection all those drugs you were on can really inhibit bonding, which they dont really tell you about.\n\nTalk to your dr about your medications because they could be aiding in your exhaustion and bonding. They might have other options or dosages that can help.\n\nEnsure you keep the couple counselling dates. Specifically ask the therapist to help give your husband guidance and tools on how to properly help you with your mental health and PPD. Sounds like he really just doesnt understand that the help he is giving you is not the help you need right now.\n\nWhen you're having a good head space day ...hour... talk  to your husband/mother in law and say it's too much and that you need your MIL to leave. Right now there are too many hands in the cookie jar. Maybe when hubby or you or both go back to work, she can step in to support again. \n\nUltimately you need to take care of yourself and through that you take care of your baby. Be patient with yourself, and stick up for what you need. A stern \"I got this\" and not letting the other BS get to you. \n\nYou're doing a good job.",
            "Aw! I feel this. I had PPD too and honestly your MIL would probably do this even if you had 400 younger siblings you cared for. Try to remember that they mean well and that it's not a personal attack on you. They probably are just trying to be helpful and not condescending to you. Also, when your hubby corrects you or tries to take over, stop him in that moment and say something like \"Please stop. I need to do this and you taking over or helping feels like you think I can't do it and I'm starting to resent you.\" It sounds like he's genuinely trying to be helpful so I think he'd hear you in the moment best and it gives him a clear idea of exactly what it is he's doing. Once he \"gets\" it tell him you feel the same way about his mom and hopefully he can gently tell her to butt out. MILs are hard with stuff like this sometimes.",

(Sorry if you mentioned in the post and I missed it) If not then that might be a really good idea, to help with the PPD and help you work through your specific emotions around this better than strangers on Reddit can.",
            "I would\u2019ve already kicked his mom out. Then maybe he\u2019ll actually listen to you.\nI agree that you could benefit from couples therapy.",
            "You are not crazy.  You are having a normal reaction to a very complicated circumstance.  You are not wrong to acknowledge your desire to forge your own maternal instinct.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019s wonderful, that doesn\u2019t mean your desires are crazy.  Listen to YOU and keep working to find ways to get them to do that also.  Therapy will help.  Seek strategies to communicate your experience, don\u2019t seek ways to change your behavior.  Good luck, mama.",
            "You seem to have a sensible outlook and clear view of what you want; keep that vision in your head until he gets it. Tell him that you learn by doing. Or \u201cI will get better as I go, back off and let me do it many times.\u201d \n\nIt is difficult enough to struggle forward with tiredness and feeling overwhelmed. The situation is made more delicate/frustrating because your roadblock is caused by loving people who want to help you and the baby. Do you have a friend or relative you are close to that you can get support from by phone? Just having someone understand and affirm your emotions would be a relief.",
            "Show him this thread. Also I think you need to correct his behavior in the moment instead of letting it build and then having a talk about it. When he tells you how to do something, you say, \"please don't tell me how to change a diaper, we talked about this, and this is an example of you not following though on what we talked about.\"",
            "OP, it\u2019s YOUR baby. YOU are the expert. It\u2019s a learning curve for you and baby, but there\u2019s no right or wrong. You just do. You and baby will figure out together and adapt to each other. You need to be alone to bond. To figure it out. To mother. Don\u2019t listen to anyone\u2019s advice ever about your baby. What worked for them and their baby has no relevance to you and your baby. Your baby will flourish if you love her/ him. If loved, all else falls into place.  Put your foot down to any help from anyone else, including Dad. Especially MIL. She needs to be out now. When a woman becomes a mother, she roars to protect her baby. You need to put your foot down and mean it. It\u2019s your baby. You say what goes. Best of luck to you",
            "Maybe remind both of them that he and his mother probably have that bond now because his mom had her time with him as a baby, that you'd like to have the same relationship with your own baby, and that you feel like you're getting robbed of that opportunity when they butt in every second of your time with the baby. The baby won't die if you spent 3 extra minutes putting on a diaper funny but the constant what they call help and what you see as interruptions will make sure your relationship with him, his mom, and/or the baby do. If your mother or MIL didn't kill her first baby, it's pretty damn clear you probably won't either. \n\nAdditionally, he needs to know that unwanted help--in this case help you overtly said you wanted to be without--is a burden, irritation, annoyance and offense.\n\nAs many others pointed out, I also think you should definitely have a set schedule that you all follow. You guys are in it for the long run and tired parents means irritable parents. Neither of you will be able to keep this up for the next year or so if everyone is in it 24/7. Take turns, say, every 3-4 hours or so when you're both home, and only one person spends time with the baby during their time slot. You can have a \"together time\" where you and your husband both hang out with the baby. Your MIL _needs_ to go home and chill before she destroys (or gets blamed for destroying) your relationship with your husband and her. Most importantly, it's not her baby.",
            "I think your husband needs to take some time to educate himself on mental health. I don't think it will be helpful for either of you long term if he continues to respond in hushed whispers behind your back and dismiss your very real needs while you're currently experiencing PPD and long term depressed.\n\nPeople with limited experiences of \"mental health\" treat it far too much like an unknowable or a boogey man without taking any time to be compassionate or empathetic about what the other person is feeling. You are different to him. What would help him is not always what would help you. What would help him is actually actively damaging you, draining you, and making your PPD worse.\n\nSo while he's great at the other stuff, he needs to sit down with you and by himself and do the work of understanding your specific brain (1) while having PPD, (2) your depression/anxiety.",
            "Hi, I know you feel like you are going crazy.  I remember being a new mum well! Not going to lie  you have a crazy amount of hormones surging through your body right now. Also you mentioned in your post you have stopped breast feeding. If you stop suddenly this causes a hormone dump which can exacerbate any feelings and make you want to act on them more irrationally. I wanted to say I have been where you are literally feeling like I am falling apart mentally. Angry at everyone and every little thing. Sadly with all the hormones rushing you have to ride out the crazy irrational phase. You will feel normal again but it will be tough for a while. My best advise is remember yes you feel a little nuts but stop breath think its just the hormones. Take a break with your baby if you can go for walks or sit in the garden for fresh air. Try to explain that you don't need help but you will ask for it when needed. But most of all hang in there. I honestly have been where you are and it does get better. I stopped feeding suddenly and man I was nuts. Feeling terrible all the time. Shouting at family,not right, not happy. It will get better day by day. Hold in the muma.",
            "I know you\u2019re seeing a therapist and medicated. I swear I read the whole post haha. But I really suggest seeing a psychiatrist for your meds, not a GP. My mental health has been a struggle my whole life but it vastly improved when I found a good psychiatrist. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say a GP almost killed me by providing SSRI\u2019s they didn\u2019t have proper knowledge on.",
            "How about showing him this post? I understand you've talked to him a bunch of times but I feel like this would really make him realize that he's being unreasonable (sorry I have a much more severe word in mind but that would get my comment removed lol). Especially the fact that you feel so helpless that you're turning to other people for help on what to do.",
            "This is a problem. One of a kind that won\u2019t fade away with time. So I\u2019d suggest doing something different than talking since that didn\u2019t work out. Something that u usually wouldn\u2019t do so he realizes how big of a deal this is for you. Maybe write him a letter & explain how you feel? Obviously everyone is excited about the baby but it\u2019s like playing games as kids- if you don\u2019t hush and let your friend play like he wants to, your friend will have a terrible time and eventually doesn\u2019t want to play at all. Harshly said- he needs to let you have positive moments with your baby, uninterrupted without anyone\u2019s opinion, because otherwise you\u2019ll have a problem with the baby you inevitably have a problem with him, with the whole family. Ask him if that\u2019s what he wants. Because right now he doesn\u2019t seem to realize the long term effect this can have in your relationship. \nHe doesn\u2019t seem to realize that what him and his mother do does not help you with your depression but it adds to it! Something needs tk change because right now this is clearly not working and if you really love someone you gotta support them and find a solution together, not just brush it off and put it all in the shoes of the one who is mentally unstable and let them feel they are superior. Sorry but that\u2019s fucked up.",
            "I've been there with PPD so I get it.\n\n1) yes, PPD turns your emotion-o-meter up to 1000. \n\n2) couples therapy is actually a good idea. You'll be able to express your needs and they (therapist) will be able to convince him that this is a real thing\n\n3) the hovering and etc is understandably infuriating and frustrating. \n\n4) sure they only want to help, but *it isn't helping* and *it is actually harmful for you*",
            "Have you got headphones? Listen to an audiobook so you can block out the helpful advice - you can even just put on headphones. \nEnjoy snuggles with a sleeping bubba - you dont Have to put baby in the cot to sleep. \nBabywearing suggested a few times in this thread, 100 percent agree, plus you can be the expert. \nAnother thing you could do is learn together,  try watching the Oprah interview about Baby Dunstan Language.  Pretty cool to learn what your babies cries mean.\nAlso - you do not need to be a baby expert. You already are an expert at being mama to This Baby. And soon this baby will be a kid. Your skills may yet win over everyone else as you guide this child through eating good food, using the toilet, learning to read, being kind to friends, and making yummy cakes. \nYou have so much to look forward to, Mama. It is going to get easier, and harder. Both of you (and the MIL) are going to have so many learning moments, because parenting changes throughout the ages. We just had to teach our kids to stay 6ft away from everyone, and what a virus is! I'm teaching my 7yo how to be safe - on the flipping internet. Anyway - your time to shine will come, for now, glow Mama, and smell that delightful baby smell as much as you can. \nArohanui, kia kaha (big loves, be strong)",
            "It's not so much advice, but you're not going crazy. You're going through a hard time right now and it's understandably stressful",
            "Okay so start of with sitting in a room, alone for a bit. And just try to breath calmly. Just focus on your breathing for a bit. \n\nIt makes sense you're feeling negatively, I felt very claustrophobic just reading about your situation so I can't imagine what you feel like. \n\nIt's good that he is trying to find a counselor, that means he is willing to sit down with you and a counselor should understand you better than your husband at this moment. \n\nYou have tried talking to him, but have you also confronted him in the moment? It might be difficult for you, but if you have the energy. When one of them swoops in try to say: \"no, this is what I meant talking to you earlier. I'm the mama and I want to do this. It doesn't have to be perfect. So back of and let me be the mama!\". \n\nAlso how is the living with your MIL situation for your mental health? I'm just asking because I also have had issues with depression and anxiety and I really need my own \"safe\" home. If I'm living with someone who I didn't choose my mental health drastically takes a turn for the worst. You don't need to change that right now, but you do need to think and maybe write down the things that are bothering you. Bring those up with the counselor when you are there. \n\nYou're all very stressed, a new born is a lot of pressure and everyone wants to do it perfectly. But your husband and MIL need to learn to let go. MIL is first of not this baby his parent, so she gets no say whatsoever. She can only support you when and IF you ask for it. Husband also needs to learn to let go. \n\nIt might sound like an impossible task, but you've been so strong so far. Take the road that helps you get there best, albeit through a counselor first. But somehow you need to find your shine spine and learn to stand up for yourself. You'll feel much better when you finally get some room to breath. \n\nFor now, keep breathing for a bit. Try to just feel your breathing in and breathing out. After you feel like you can, grab a piece of paper and write some of these feelings and difficulties down. Husband doesn't have to read it, it's just for you. \n\nI'm sending you hugs, you're not crazy just a bit understandably overwhelmed.",
            "It sounds to me like your husband is really worried about you, and is trying to help by taking a lot of the burden away from you. The more worried he gets, the more protective he'll be.\n\nExcept you need to feel confident with the baby on your own. Tell him to leave you on your own, with the baby, for a whole day. Tell him you're fine, you just need a day alone with the baby. Don't take no for an answer, don't get angry, just keep repeating it until he gets it.",
            "Show him this post. Show his mother, too. Seriously, you need to escalate this situation because neither he nor his mother are getting it. If he then \"forgets\" about it, remind him--forcefully. Don't ask him to stop, **tell him.**",
            "Couples counseling doesn\u2019t have to mean that you\u2019re dealing with a toxic or abusive partner. In fact you *shouldn\u2019t* go to therapy with an abuser. The fact that your partner is supportive but misguided is great because that\u2019s something that can be fixed. Do the counseling with him and take it from there.",
            "You should try written timetabling. Have it on a fridge or a door, times where you want your own time. Having it written means you can point to it out so he can't forget and if he does it's limited wording so you don't break your alone time. \n\nCouples counseling is a great idea, don't ever feel guilty for saying you need help communicating. You know your husband better than anyone however a third party may be able to explain your difficulty in a way you can't and make him understand. \n\nAs much as your husband and ML know about childcare there is a lot of psychology articles about the importance of mother child bonding. It's natural to want to try and fail rather then not try at all and they should respect that. \n\nAs for tiredness, if possible try getting outside for a walk, with or without baby. Take a little bit of time to just shut your eyes and listen to what's around. Try pinpointing 5 sounds and where they are coming from. Then next time find 5 new sounds. Stress and mental health are exhausting, you're a saint for managing how you have. It's okay not to be okay :) but self care is important and if you focus on your body and how it feels by giving it a moment to speak to you, you'll find yourself much calmer",
            "OP, maybe I\u2019m reading too much between the lines and if I\u2019m off base here I apologize. Are they afraid you are going to hurt the baby? If they have no experience with mental health, all they have as a guideline is what they know from the news. Which of course is not good. This could be the reason they won\u2019t leave you alone with the baby.  If this is the case, you absolutely need to bring your SO with you to the doctor to help him understand. I think there are a few points need to get across. They way they are helping is making you feel inadequate and making you feel worse; they are interfering with your ability to bond with your child; and this is putting your relationship with your SO and MIL in jeopardy.",

            " Being a parent unfortunately is about learning and its also about failing.  You are going to have to stick up for yourself they are helicopter parenting and MIL should fuck off because its not her baby and they are able to soothe her where u cant because the baby has bonded with them and not with you.  You need to talk to them and you need to be assertive when you do passive shit doesnt work for people like this.remember you successfully carried your baby to term when neither of them did.  Nothing happened to baby while it was in you despite your conditions",
            "Write all of this down like you have here, and when and if, you feel overwhelmed make them read it, take it to the counselor also so you don't have to try to remember everything in the middle of the session.\n\n Repeating yourself over and over verbally is leaving you feeling exhausted. It just drains you, unfairly.\n\n Having it on paper allows you to just be like here read this, every time to where it will become a symbolic reminder and they won't even need to read it, but will see you point to it or whatever and back off. You could use a stuffed bear too as a back off bear. Whenever the bear is on a table etc that could be the back off bear. That way you don't have to keep going through this dialogue over and over. They see it, they know. They respect the bear. They respect you.\n\nYou are feeling displaced as your baby's mom and disrespected in your own home. Of course that would upset a person.\n\nI know it seems hurtful but in all honesty they are probably afraid to leave you with the baby unsupervised because of the PPD. I know that feels insulting and messed up, and hopefully the counselor will have ideas around it, ideas about balancing it all.\n\nThe PPD doesn't last forever, thankfully. But I understand how you feel. I had it and everyone was always watching me and I felt so much like I just needed to bond with baby. I did breastfeed but I couldn't make enough milk and there was a ton of stress around other people trying to force my body to do things it couldn't do and all the feelings around that and just being tired, really exhausted and just changing from becoming a mom.\n\nIt's hard work and you are going to be okay, you have every right to feel how you do. Your baby loves you. You don't need to do anything to create a connection with baby, even with others there, the bond between you and baby is already the strongest. Nothing is going to change that right now.\n\nI know you can worry about it, about losing bonding time. It pissed me off too. I realized that as the baby grows you will be spending the most time with baby, so right now having more faces around is good and okay for your baby really, in other parts of the world it's a whole family effort caring for the baby for the first few months, and grandmas and aunties barely let the mom hold the baby. \n\nThe babies and moms come out just fine. So don't worry about that part too much, don't feel like your baby bond or baby is affected negatively by that part.\n\nBut I know it's like just give me my baby. Because that is your little baby, and you deserve some time to be a mom and feel like one, because you are a mom.  I mean you deserve to feel like the mother of your child.\n\nWhen you mentioned fantasizing slicing their faces with sharp knives, you word it like you recognize that is not a healthy sign. I think you should definitely share that with your doctor, because sometimes the medication they give you can fluctuate with your hormones and you might need a different kind or adjusted dosage, which is actually very very common in PPD situations. That way you don't have intrusive thoughts like that, because they can create more feelings of stress for you.\n\nI had some intrusive thoughts and I was like why am I thinking these things when things are basically good? It upset me so much, but it's like the brain is full of so many hormones and everything and I got an adjustment on my meds, and then I didn't have intrusive thoughts like that any more and things felt more level.\n\nBest wishes for you and baby and family. You are already a good mom, you did research and are trying your best, it's such a learning curve for most of us, you are not alone. I had no clue. It's such a fun adventure though, you are going to start really having some very great times together.\n\nI didn't feel like a mom at all at first and I had so many feelings of guilt around that. I brought my baby home and time passed and one day he looked over at me and he kind of rolled towards me, even though they are not really supposed to roll, he moved, moved over to me to snuggle into me. As soon as he did that I instantly felt everything they said I was supposed to feel, like in that moment it just all happened, my heart exploded, total bonding. \n\nSometimes it takes time, but it will happen. Noone tells you that the first few months are often not a blissful beautiful time even without PPD. They usually are not carefree days of calm and ease for any new parents in reality, they are usually a huge transition, a ton of work, changes in the marriage, in schedules,  and total exhaustion. What gets everyone through it, what will get you through it, is love.  Please be kind to yourself.",
            "I don't have suggestions to add, but you're 100% right. Your husband and MIL are making it worse and are driving you crazy. You need to feel competent and confident and you can't if they're hovering, waiting for you to screw up. \n\nDo not feel bad for feeling the way you feel. Do please go to couple's counseling bc this is a couple's issue.\n\nI'm very worried about you and your health and just got yellow wallpaper vibes from your post. Please be well",
            "I think you need to be upfront about how they are activity contributing to the problems you want to work on.   \nTell him upfront, the lack of one-on-one time is getting in the way of your need to bond with your baby.   \nLots of mothers don't feel an immediate rush of overwhelming maternal love after birth, but instead just need some time to get to know their baby. You aren't getting that time.   \n Lots of people need to DO an action themselves to be able to learn it and get comfortable. With regards to taking care of the baby, its very hard to learn anything when someone keeps doing it for you.  So long if the baby is safe and ok, it doesn't matter if you struggle with a diaper or a bottle for a few minutes longer, that's all part of the process. You need to do it over and over to become confident.   \n\n\nThe fear people have have with PPD, is the stories of mothers hurting their babies. Your husband is not inside your head, he can't see what is going on. You need to remind him you are not having any thoughts of harming the baby, that is not a danger. If you felt you weren't capable of taking care of your baby, keeping them safe, then you would tell them and stay away - but you are not experiencing anything like that, and you need to remind him.   \nBonding with baby one on one and working through the care routine is something you need to do. For the long term sake of the family, you need this time right now.",
            "Hey, Im sure you\u2019ve heard all the great tips and advice so I will just tell you my story. I also went through severe PPD and had 0 experience with babies and the like. My husband was also extremely helpful to the point I hated how natural it was for him and me the child\u2019s mother it was so foreign to me. I thought when I gave birth I\u2019d connect right away and this maternal instinct would just come out naturally and it didn\u2019t. I hated myself and my partner and everyone who tried to parentsplain things and not letting me do things on my own. I felt useless like why am I even here? As time went on it got worse before it got better (god, I hated hearing that too) but by the third or fourth month I had this mom shit figured out. My PPD didn\u2019t go entirely away though and once I saw I knew what I was doing I became one of those people that just wanted to do everything on my own to make up for loss time and my depression got worse because I forgot to dedicate time to myself. So, what I\u2019m going to say is it will get worse before it gets better and if they try to to parentsplain and not let you do anything just say \u201chey, I got this thank you.\u201d I wish I could offer better advice or whatever but I honestly had to stand my ground and continue on what I was doing even if I was doing it wrong.",
            "I'm sure its probably been  said already... and I know you have spoken to your husband about what the problem is, but now point it out when he is doing it. When  he hovers tell him he needs to take a walk and let you be and that these are the moments you were tellinghim about before. You won't learn if you aren't  allowed the opportunity to do things on your  own and he needs to let you. You appreciate his help, but now if you need it you will ask for it. Maybe mil needs to go away for a bit too?",
            "I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this and it sounds very frustrating. I wanted to assure you that no matter what you\u2019re feeling I find what you\u2019ve laid out here to be very rational\u2014so don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. \n\nI honestly think going to counseling is a great idea and the counselor will help straighten this out. \n\nBesides that I think some others have suggested dedicated time with the baby that husband should not interrupt unless you ask. That is a great idea. What I might also suggest is dedicated time for him to provide help and suggestions. So once a day, once a week, or just at your discretion the two of you sit down for deliberate time where he can offer tips or you can ask questions about areas that have been challenging for you. Outside of that, he is not to offer advice or swoop in. I think this may help because it provides him with the opportunity to help and share his knowledge (so he feels better) but hopefully in a way that is less overwhelming and that does not interfere with you bonding. Also, it goes both ways! It should also be a time that you can give advice to him\u2014you are a very new parent but you will very soon learn tips and tricks of your own. Also I agree that MIL needs to go!",
            "You're so strong mama. Doing a great job for sure. Everybody needs to learn how to do things as a new parent - and that's what you are: THE PARENT. Your MIL needs to leave, this is not her place or role. It's her grandchild, not her child. Maybe you can try to redirect your husband's helping impulses on other things? Like, '' hey, I want you to let me change the diaper now. I need to bond with baby. If you want to help, can you prepare a snack for me/clean the room/tidy up/take out the trash? \" my point is, he can help by doing things unrelated to the baby, and take your share of the chores, so you get more time to learn peacefully how to take care of a newborn, discover your baby and bond. That way he still feels like helping and everything, but he is not taking your place as a new mother. Remember, your birthed that baby and that is incredible! You are so strong and perfectly capable. Your baby knows that you're his/her mother, regardless of the fact that you decided not to give him the boob (I am so so very sorry for that sentence. English is not my first langage and I cannot remember the right term, again very sorry lol). I send you lots of encouragement. You're great \ud83d\udc4d",
            "There's a lot of great advice here so I won't add on,  I just wanted to say you're doing an incredible job navigating all of this and it's really impressive to hear about someone tackling mental illness, a new baby,  relationship problems and more in the midst of a pandemic. You may not feel it right now being so close to everything, but from the outside you sound like an incredibly strong woman. Your child is lucky to have you as a mother and I have no doubt you will raise them well!",
            "I'm seething for you. I promise they are a big part of your PPD. If you can't take your baby and go elsewhere, then step one is tell MIL to GTFO and not come back unless YOU invite her. Step 2 is to tell your husband that unwanted help is not help. Being a new mom is hard, having a baby that no one will let you take care of is harder. \n\nI mean, I guess you have told him this, maybe hearing it from a counselor will make an impact since he's decided not to acknowledge what you're telling him. Ask him if he understands that you don't have it in you to fight right now, and he's forced you into a situation where you probably need to fight to make yourself heard. Ask him how he thinks that makes you feel when he ignores your wishes again and again and again when you're at lowest. Is that something that her thinks is helpful to your PPD?\n\nRegardless, MIL has to go. Non negotiable. You don't need the 2 of them clucking about how you're being crazy when they're the ones making you that way. \n\nYou are beaten down right now, and you're not up for a fight. But you won't be this way forever. And you're going to remember how you were treated, so they better make this right.",
            "So, I\u2019m probably going against the grain here, but this is a \u201cyou\u201d problem. You are probably seeing all actions through a lens of PPD and that cannot be easy for you. As much as you discuss with hubby that you want to try and do things your way, if this is his first child having Bub be unsettled or crying while you try and figure out what to do would be frustrating for him. Especially when he knows what to do and can easily stop the fussing with some tried and true tricks. You will need to go to therapy for yourself as well as couples counseling to teach you both how to work better as a team. \n\nYou are both the caretakers for this baby and frankly it seems that he has taken over the traditional \u201cmother\u201d role. You will need to carve out your own niche time with Bub and find special ways to bond.  Sometimes just a little walk in the pram, bath time, or some morning weak sunshine sing alongs are all you need to establish a great bond. \n\nAt the end of the day as much as you want to bond with Bub, her actual day to day needs come first before this Imaginary magical bond that you thought you would have.

She answered me with a smile \"someone teached me first\". \n\nYou can ask them the same question. And then ask them how are you supposed to learn if someone is always preventing you to exercice. \n\nAre you friend with some of his male friend's spouses/partners ? \n\nIf yes, ask them to make their men to invite your husband, no to kidnap him for few hours\n\nAs I typed this I wondered about something, are you sure your husbamd is 100% fine right now ? Is it possible he has some abandonment anxiety with the feeding tube, excuse me, the baby ? That would explain his sudden amnesia.\n\nEdit : autocorrect.",

We\u2019re so similar, but the difference is they treated and respected me as THE mom and I respected them as dad and grandmother, and we all knew our roles. I got to learn my baby and learn to feed and learn to change diapers, and this is not bragging, but me showing you what you deserve from new motherhood.\n\nI would take baby and immediately shut them down with each word they say. \u201cI\u2019m the mom, I will be doing this\u201d. I would tell your husband MIL has to go ASAP, and that you know he wants to help your PPD, and that that would help it. I would be extremely stern and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.

            "Okay so I'm writing this from a place of somebody who had depression and anxiety (sometimes along with suicidal impulses) for my entire 20s and has taken meds for many years. Yay meds! Glad you talked to your doctor and got help.) Depression is an insidious monster. It can make you do and think some weird shit. I've dealt with some rage and frustration that seemed inexplicable to people who weren't in my head, and paranoia that made me question motives and intentions that now, looking back, were not sinister as I had imagined.\n\nWhen did you start taking the SSRI? Sometimes it takes a few weeks for the medication to really take full effect. Rage or anger can be a huge part of depression or PPD, one that isn't talked about that much, and you are explaining your frustration as wanting to take a knife to him. (Please hear me, I'm not saying you are actually going to stab him or that you are dangerous, just that you seem really REALLY frustrated in a way that is probably due to the PPD).\n\nI mean, therapy or counseling might be a good thing to add for you. Couples too, if it would help you and him communicate about this issue.\n\nYour feelings are valid, but some of your sense of dismissal or frustration that your husband is upset over your mental health might be because things are worse than you perceive. You're getting help, you're on meds, and everyone is aware that you are having this issue, which is good. You're not in a danger zone as far as I can see. But therapy for you might really help you have an outside perspective on some of these things that are driving you up the wall or making you feel so angry.",
            "Your MIL needs to be at her own house, and only come over for short and previously arranged periods of time. \n\nYour husband needs to get on board with this. No \"but she's only trying to help\". If he doesn't understand the need to not have his mother around, you have a real problem.\n\nI'd say you have a problem (with your husband) regardless, in that for all the good intentions you mention him having, he's completely ignoring your pleads for space and intimacy with your newborn. He doesn't need to be a psychologist or have dealt with mental health in the past in order to be an empathetic human being. \n\nFrom that PoV, do not desist on your quest to go to couple's counseling. In fact call today and make an appointment. Children decrease happiness in all marriages temporarily; but to on top of that have your husband add to the problems of the PPD and the difficulty to bond, that's just too much. He needs to be reminded that you're supposed to be a team in this. You and him, and that the baby isn't a pet that requires **only** good techniques. It's a human being that you hope to one day raise into a decent human being.\n\nBut yeah, MIL needs to go.",

Twice a day the baby is taken from you mid task.\n\nI would stop talking and start dictating, set boundaries don't ask for them because as you said he won't listen. Enforceable boundaries.

They can pull into line or you'll walk. 50-50 custody would give you more quality time with your child than what you currently have and you'll chose a relationship with your child over him any day.\n\nAnd be willing to walk of they don't fall in line because this is something you end a relationship on.

They are being very unreasonable. \n\nI had a nephew a year ago, i knew a few things but i barely know how to take care of a baby, i knew a few basics, my sister even less, we dont have a big family, this is the first baby we have to take care of, we are all learning, even tho his diaper in not correctly put, whats the worse that could happen? Poop out?\n\n The only thing that is hard really is the sleeping time, but all babies are different, if they are a few months old rocking them while they are in your arms and singing mostly helps, after that...well im still figuring out, but really out of that, theres no reason for them to be that concerned of you doing anything wrong.

I understand feeling lost with a kid, I was second oldest of a big family but I never had a active Male parent in any real sense. I felt very lost. But the cure is time and bonding, and trust starts to manifest in yourself, I don't know how you can solve your problem, creating a space that is explicitly yours?

            "Not sure how to advise being every situation is different but i went through similar feelings at times. I had a rough start after having my daughter, i contracted sepsis during a failed induction and so was very ill for a bit and then my lung partly collapsed too. I was very weak from the c-section and complications that I couldn't do much from the off. I also failed at breastfeeding that even my health visitor told me I needed to accept that it wasn't happening to ease the pressure on myself. My fiance took to parenthood easily, he is very good with kids and seemed to find it really easy to look after our daughter while I struggled hugely. I started to feel like I wasn't bonding or that my baby didn't like me, even though at that point they cannot truly feedback their feelings. \n\nI joined a group of mothers who suffered with postnatal depression and other issues, like a group therapy thing where we went with our babies too. It was good, learnt a lot about how other women experience similar and learned some coping mechanisms. Not saying this is right for you but if you have something similar nearby it's a good outlet. I should add i had no friends and family nearby and both of my parents passed a few years back so I felt quite alone too.\n\nI was lucky that I had a good health visitor that I could express my feelings too and she helped me hugely to overcome. As well as mustering up the courage to sit and talk with my fiance about it who it turns out whilst I thought was breezing through the situation was actually just making up as he went along and was terrified, he just outwardly appeared to be coping. \n\nEven now I worry my daughter really favours her Dad over me, especially as he's looked after her during lockdown and I have had to work. But as she is older she can express her feelings with hugs and kisses and she clearly does love me and wants to play with me, even if Daddy is probably her fave haha... i guess what I am trying to say is maybe try to find a separate group, perhaps a mothers group who you can vent to, even better if its a group run by a womens health counsellor like i had.

My spouse though,  she had a lot of mom issues from her own past that led to many insecurities that I had to compete with.  I felt I did what I did out of necessity,  it's quite hard to sit there and let the baby cry for a second longer than necessary when you know exactly what needs to be done.  I don't think it's about you,  it's about the baby,  we as parents are wired to care for them and to jump to their needs. Maybe it would be helpful if you asked him to take some time for himself,  a guy's night or go have dinner with his mom once or twice a week lol.  Just get him out of the house for a bit so you can do your thing without feeling like someone is going to step in and do it better and out mom you.  I will say, it gets better too,  you will come into your own,  and no matter how good of a dad he is,  babies need their mothers and the bond grows to where you'll realize that sometimes all a child wants is their mom.  Keep your head up.  Try not to let it get you and dont hold it against your husband too much,  he's just trying to be the best father he can,  which he can't help and if anything is a blessing.

            "We're hitting 5M now with our little one, so this is still pretty fresh. You need to get your MIL out of there. The social rhetoric of \"it's so hard being a new mom\" is one thing - IF YOU NEED HELP. Frankly, if there's two of you, that's enough. It's not *that hard* if your baby is a typical cry-poop-eat machine that you need 3 caregivers. Let her stop in for an hour, or bring food over, or scrub a toilet, but no more babycare. \n\nAs for husband...it's taken a lot of time for us to become confident solo. It does get better - 1 month definitely had us each stepping on each other's toes. We still try to do certain things together more often than not - baby bath time is a task we do *together*, not one teaching the other, for example. \n\nThere were times I would swoop in, and my husband would get annoyed. It's hard when there is crying or distress coming off the baby to remember, but...\"No\" and \"stop\" are complete sentences. One thing he needs to be told is there isn't \"one way\" to do things. I was bad for that, saying \"oh, he likes being tapped on the back not rubbed\" or dumb shit like that. We each have our own ways to soothe kiddo. Sometimes when he is being an absolute freakout, we switch off, but if he's in someone's arms, the most either of us will do is say \"think he needs a change?\" Or \"Maybe try the kitchen thing?\" (Kiddo instantly calms down when carried into the kitchen, the weirdo). Whoever is holding the kid is the boss though, they ultimately decide what to do, even if the other person thinks it isn't correct. Childrearing isn't something you can be \"optimal\" at, it's a constant state of \"good enough\". He has to accept that, and that an extra minutes of crying because you are doing x-y-z isn't going to harm the kiddo.\n\nWhat felt very freeing for me, and really I should do it more, is going on long walks with kiddo. Can you pack the stroller up and go out for an hour? Then more? I slowly worked my way up to driving to a trail for a 5km walk. It feels very weird to be off home base, but....a good weird. There's no reason you can't handle it!",

Your husband obviously loves you, and is trying to help, but he's not perfect. It can be especially hard to advocate for your own needs when you're depressed too, so a neutral third party could be a godsend here. \n\nI really feel for you, hope things get better.",

Don't listen to any voices internal or external that mention the word failure. You're doing  great. Most people find this period a shit show. I do. \n\nThere is lots of good advice here but I'll share what I was told just in case it applies (not saying it will):\n\nAt some point in the first three months you will probably want to kill each other. You may question your relationship. Now is not the time to make any significant life decisions or changes, or to put the huge effort required into fundamentally changing your relationship dynamics. Keep communicating, sure, but cut each other the maximum amount of slack. Assuming there are no threats to your safety, just try to get through it together. Take a deep breath, remind yourself of one of your partner's good qualities, take one day at a time and remember if you still feel angry in 2 months time you'll be better equipped to do the work of solving any ongoing issues together. Your marriage will still be there.",
            "First calm down for the sake of your baby(i know it's hard but try your best),second plz don't feel guilty to dig up dirt on them just because they are 'perfect' outwardly,you have every reason to get mad at them because from what i can see  they are stealing and taking over your natural right as a mother.It happens a lot in China too,but mostly it's tho MILs who gets all dominant when it comes to taking care of the baby.The only you can 'get' your baby back is that you need to confront them seriously,it's your baby,you get a share in her/him,and you need to show them that the baby is in good hands meanwhile learning things from your husband and MILs on how to take care of her/him.Hang in there,i know how hard it is especially when your own family is far away,but hey be strong for your baby,and best wishes to you\ud83c\udf39",
            "I just have to say don\u2019t feel like a shitty mom. The newborn phase is short, although it feels infinitely long. It is also so unlike all the other stages. Your baby is still going to bond with you. My husband had zero experience with babies and was pretty hands off for the first 8 months... kids still adored him and they developed a really close bond when they were around a year old. \nThe first few months are so insanely hard, take a deep breath, take a 1 or 2 hour window alone with your baby and then be thankful you and your baby have so many loving people in their lives",
            "Have you tried reminding them before you do something. \"I'm changing his diaper now, and I need both of you to go do something else while I figure it out.\"\n\nAlso, even though he's looking for a couples counselor, maybe you should too. It's your needs that aren't being met. He might not choose a counselor who can give you the support you need.",
            "Maybe you can set up a time where you are alone with your baby once a day, like in one of your bedrooms. Like from 10AM to noon or something? Just an idea",
            "I don't know if you've tried presenting it to them in this light, but you might explain to them that it's extremely important for you to be able to learn **(and that includes making mistakes)**, to take care of your own child. They're not both always going to be there to help you, and they're doing you and the kid a disservice by taking over whenever they feel that you don't have a 100% grasp on what you're doing. \n\nAlso, there's more than one way to take care a baby! Just because they know one correct way to do something, doesn't mean that is THE correct way to do it. \n\nYou have a right (and I'd argue, a responsibility) as a mother to learn these things for yourself, and to learn what works for you and your child, not for you, your child, your mother-in-law, and your husband. \n\nYour husband probably thinks he's helping, but what he needs to understand is that in the long run, he's not. And even in the short term, he is hurting your already damaged mental health and ability to bond with your child. He sounds like a really sweet guy, and I'm sure that he knows that you appreciate him. I know it can be hard to set boundaries with people like that, because you feel like you're being mean somehow. You're not. He has to learn just the same as you do that he is only half of the parentage in this situation. He can't do everything, and it's not a good idea for him to in the first place.\n\nGood luck, girl.",
            "Have you ever heard the phrase, \"you don't know what you don't know, and you don't know that you don't know it?\"\n\nThis is both you, and your husband, and his mom.\n\n\nYou don't know where your reasonable frustration begins and ends, which is confusing to deal with, and the PPD doesn't make that easier.  Remember, stress and anxiety shut down the part of our brain in charge of rational thinking, because these are examples of fear. So a normal fear response is to shut down your digestive system, your reproduction system, and the thinking part of your brain so you can just ACT QUICKLY.\n\nWhich, when facing a tiger with nothing more than a stick, is a good idea because you need to run, hide, or stab it in the eye - trying to reason with it will get you killed.\n\nBut this is not true of your husband and mother in law. Stabbing them in the face, while fulfilling a primal need to solve this very understandably confusing situation, is a bad long-term strategy. You will want their experience in dealing with teenagers at some point, which is around the age that your own child will suddenly become a tempting stabbing target as well.\n\nAnd what they don't know that they don't know is exactly how to make this situation less frustrating for you. It is probably hard for you to talk about your feelings without blaming someone, because when we are feeling frustrated, this is normal. We look for the cause of our frustration because that is the source of our fear... Kinda.\n\nI mean, that's what our body believes.\n\nBut the real source is what we don't know. That damn uncertainty.\n\nYou don't know how to deal with the baby, you don't want the baby to suffer, they don't want the baby to suffer, they know you are tired and going through a lot, and...\n\nBug families and small families create different experiences. Different worlds.\n\nBig families pitch in and help each other. A lot. Because they need to, because nobody has time to wait around because a big family has lots of shit going on. Everyone has their own life, and that means that everyone has to pitch in at home. So when mom is adding a new member to the family...\n\nThey step in to make her life easier. Because after a baby, new mom's (you may have noticed) are pretty exhausted and beat the hell up. So for them, they feel very confident you will learn these things, but that being barely into everything, being sleep deprived and going through PPD will make it harder to learn. So... It makes sense to them to step in when you are having a rough time now, because it will give you a break so that when you try again, you will be better able to focus on practicing.\n\n\nBut, if you are from a small family, this is annoying as hell. Because you are more independent. In small families, you have to learn to be independent because there isn't always someone around to help you figure some shit out. You aren't worried about looking stupid learning something (too much) because you had to figure out a lot on your own. They don't know what that feels like. To them, it's the worst thing in the world.\n\nAnd to you, that's a way of life. Give it to me, let me fuck up trying until I get it, and then onto the next thing.\n\nWhich is why it can really make us feel bad when we don't catch up to the skill of others with something that is important to us.\n\nWhat they don't know is how GOOD it will make you feel to learn these things the way you are asking them to help you learn them. They think that letting you \"take a break\" is a way of helping you relax so you can learn it a little more a bit later (they won't put it that way, but this is the main idea). I mean, there is no end to the dirty diapers and bottles, etc.\n\nBut if you can help them learn this, that would be the solution.\n\nOf course, because this is an experience that they don't have, they won't understand it. Which is why you will have to remind them. \"Thanks but I have to learn this my way. I will feel so much better if you just let me fuck this up until I figure it out.\"\n\nThe other thing, and this is because this is Reddit and you are going through PPD - so out of an abundance of caution - this is a baby, not a video game. So, if some of the things involve you growling menacingly at a diaper while fumbling with seemingly pure, concentrated evil inside, they might be reasonably concerned for the baby too. If in your frustration and PPD you are losing touch with how rough you are actually being, it might be that it's better for your baby that they take over while you work out that frustration away from the baby. Not that you would intentionally hurt the baby, but you aren't thinking clearly. That's part of PPD. Which means things can and will look different from your perspective. Hence why you feel like you are going crazy. Your brain is literally trying to make sense of a hurricane of emotions caused by your bodies hormones going back to normal for a single person rather than hormones for 2. So that might be worth trusting them on even if they are overreacting, simply because that's what putting your baby first means. Putting the safety of your baby above your feelings of inadequacy. While you are going through PPD - trust them on those calls specifically. And make sure that you talk to them about what that looks like.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the most important point.\n\nTalk to them. Yes, you didn't want that advice, so I am going to explain how it's a little different.\n\nTalk to them by telling them what support you want, not telling them what you don't want.\n\nSo, in a moment when you are trying to learn and they are trying to help, think about how they can help you LEARN, and ask for THAT help.\n\nThey just want to be useful for you. Let them by telling them what to do.\n\nThey are scared because they don't know what to do about making your life easier.\n\nYou are scared because you don't know what to do about the baby or them.\n\nBut they are easy. Help them make your life easier by asking them to do thing that will free up your time to practice with your baby your way. Ask them to talk you through a process, or to explain what detail you are missing that is making something difficult, etc.\n\nBear in mind, some of it is just feeling calm in that situation. I mean with soothing a child. New mom's have hard times doing this because they are DESPERATE to soothe the child, and this can be felt as stress in the body. And the baby responds to that non-verbal communication, and so the baby get stressed too. And so the baby resists being soothed because it feels how stressed you are whole you are holding it.\n\nSo when they take over, having held millions of babies and having put them all to sleep, baby 1 million and 1 is held with that same level of calm. The confidence that their super secret family technique will work.\n\nBut the confidence is the secret there. The confidence makes the baby feel safe, the way it makes boys in bands seem cute. It is infectious, and feeling like the person that is holding them is safe, they feel safe, and then pass out.\n\nAny technique can work when done with confidence and patience. Some work faster, but confidence is the key ingredient, and that is a result of success over time.\n\nYou will get there. You have the next 5 years to get used to these things before everything starts to change. :P It's not a lot of time, shorter than you might think, but it's enough to get good at this stuff.",
            "a friend of mine had anxiety- even legitimate delusions- with her PPD. She went to therapy and it really helped her, and I hope seeing one helps you too!\n\nBefore you go, take some time to REALLY think about how you want to articulate how you feel, and have concrete examples ready. In the heat of the moment (because seeing counselors can be emotional) it can be hard to recall some things or elaborate on how you feel and it can make sessions less productive. It is also good practice with mindfulness.",

            "Sounds like this is a convergence of a few different things.  I think couples therapy is a good idea so he can perhaps get a better perspective on what you are dealing with.  Have you talked to your own therapist about him attending a session or two with you?  That might also help a bit.\n\nEDIT:  hit submit too quickly.\n\nI think it is important to note the different aspects that are converging here and have someone that can properly relate that to your husband as well so he can better grasp what you are going through and how he might be able to help.  It sounds like not only is your general anxiety affecting this, but then the PPD, and physical weariness are all adding to the mix.  And even though you may understand it, it doesn't necessarily make it easier on your own anxiety.  It is something you are going to have to gradually work through as well.\n\nFrom your husband's perspective he likely is trying to help, but just doesn't understand the right path to choose.  He sees you physically tired so he wants to help.  He sees you emotionally drained, so he wants to help.  He sees your anxiety so he wants to help.  The problem is some of these work against each other so he may see that he has no good option and become frustrated.  And that may be valid, sometimes there is no good/best option.  Sometimes there is just what you may need in that moment.  So the more information he can get and the more you can both work together, then gradually you can both communicate better so you can determine what your needs are in those moments.\n\nAlso, as it seems you are already working on, it is perfectly okay to make mistakes and not beat yourself up over it.  Just because he may have some more experience at certain things than you do, it does not at all make you a failure.  You do not always have to be the best or most natural at everything.  Just keep reminding yourself and especially your husband that sometimes the best way to learn is by practicing over and over on your own until you get it right.",
            "I think you're right, couple's counseling is a great idea.  Hearing what you've said before, but coming from someone of \"authority\" might make more of an impact (it's unfortunate he can't just take your word for it, but alas...).  Also maybe can you agree on a safe word for you to use when you need him and MIL to back the f\\*\\*k off with their hovering?  That way you don't have to have a whole conversation about it, you can just say \"banana\" or whatever and they'll know to remove themselves from your orbit",

When he was born both my parents flew out and my mom wanted to do everything so I could rest. She was a tremendous help but all I wanted was to be alone with my baby. I didn\u2019t even have PPD and I felt that way so I want to reassure you that you\u2019re not crazy. So when I started to get angry about it I just scooped him up and took him to go lay down with me so I could calm down and coo at him for a little while behind locked doors. You\u2019re the mother, don\u2019t be afraid to sternly say \u201cgive me back my baby\u201d. You are well within your rights and any other mother you ask has probably had to say it at some point.",
            "With all due respect, I think this is PPD making you feel this way and less about your husband/MIL. Most women would kill to have a husband +/- a MIL that is so proficient at helping with a baby. Not bonding with your baby is a classic sign of PPD. Also, finding other people infuriating is also a sign of PPD. From how you describe things, they\u2019re not know-it-alls but rather their baby experience makes you feel insecure. Another PPD symptom. Your husband is probably ignoring your requests for him to settle down, because he knows it\u2019s the PPD talking and is trying to go out of his way to help you with the baby because he loves you, plus it\u2019s his right as a father to provide love/care to his baby.

With PPD, sleep deprivation, etc, all that does is kill your filter and let your emotional brain take over.\n\nYou need to listen to your logical side, especially on rare times when you're more well rested, and remind yourself of your wonderful husband. What you feel is your ego trying to defend your self worth, and attacking any source of criticism.\n\nWork with a couple's counsellor, but also work on yourself. I highly suggest CBT to challenge your feelings with evidence. You have to realize that when you're deep in PPD, you are not yourself. The thought loops you find yourself in, the anxiety, the worry, sense of failure, etc. All that are not you.",
            "To take another tack plenty of moms don't bond with their newborns right away it can take a few months.  Is it so bad to let them take over some of the hardest parts of care while you recover physically. In a couple months your baby will sleep regress and you can have the privilege of sitting up all night and seeing to bub's every need. But by then you'll be physically recovered and hopefully in much better headspace. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong to complain just offering a different perspective. You can never be useless bub wouldn't exist if it wasn't for you. Letting others take over for a month or so might not be so bad.\n\nEdit>> regardless of what you choose send MIL home.",
            "I think it's your PPD talking. Who cares if he hovers or tries to help when it's not really needed? Try to look at what *motivates* him.\n\nIs he trying to provide the best care for your newborn, or just trying to undermine you? The fact that you feel the way you feel about it is not really relevant.\n\nTo me, it sounds like both your husband and his mother recognize you are having a hard time and are trying to help. Are they overbearing? Maybe, but PPD is scary to other people and they don't know how to handle things without making the mother feel negative about herself.\n\nAlso, about the not bonding with your baby part, don't worry. You can and will bond just fine, it's not your husband who won't let you do so right now, it's the depression.\n\nRight now, it's all about the baby, so put your feelings of inadequacy aside, and try to think about what is best for the baby. Also, when they become overbearing, it's very easy to just politely say 'I would like to try doing it my way so I can learn, so I got it, thanks' and take over. Try not to take things to heart (I know, it's hard) and let stuff affect you so much. Take over when you want to. It's your baby.",

        "selftext": "Hi,\n\nOriginal post was here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying\\_i\\_love\\_you\\_too\\_soon/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i2ymiq/saying_i_love_you_too_soon/) \n\nThought I'd drop a quick update as so many nice people gave advice.\n\nI was definitely over thinking things and suspect I was just being over worried due to his widower status (I've never really consciously associated that to him before I started reading some of the replies to my original post)\n\nOver the past few weeks I've stayed at his more often than not and things have been great.\n\nHe hasn't said \"I love you\" yet but here's a list of things he has said/done that helped me realise not saying it doesn't mean he's not feeling it....\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nThe little messages in the morning/evening on the rare occasions I didn't stay at his. Yup he's still thinking of me even when I'm not there.\n\nHe ordered some toiletries for me on his weekly shop so I had some at his place too (After checking with me what I'd need) Plus I'm getting invited to join his \"meal planning\" discussions where everyone one in the house gets to pick at least 1 meal for the coming week (This is making me feel like part of the family and not just a guest)\n\nHe's cleared out some drawer and wardrobe space in his bedroom so I can keep stuff at his too (this one was pretty huge to me)\n\nWhen his daughter asked \"Is Miss teacher going to live with us forever? his reply was a cheeky little smile and a \"Not yet\" - yup irrational or not the \"yet\" sent a few flutters off :D\n\nHe's really open about everything. He's admitted to me that at one point in his life he really didn't believe that he'd be capable of love again (in a romantic way) but he knows now that's not true (Perhaps irrationally on my part - I really did read that as \"I love you\" Just in a, I really can't say it way) \n\nHe's arranged for his parents to have the kids this weekend so we can have a night away and a date or two because and I quote \"You deserve to be treated like a princess too sometimes and I don't want you to feel I only want you around for the children\"\n\nHe's posted a few pictures on social media of us (with and without the children) my favourite being a selfie of all four of us snuggled on the sofa with the caption \"Star Wars night with the family - life is good\" \n\nAfter the previously mentioned Star Wars night, whilst we were being intimate I let slip another \"I love you\" in the heat of the moment and he replied \"I know\" which if you're a bit of a Star Wars fan (which we both are) is kind of the cool guys way of saying it. A little bit nerdy I know! \n\nTLDR: An update on my last post. Partner still hasn't said \"I love you\" directly but I'm 99.9999999% sure that he does. And I've definitely not scared him off lol",

            "I remember your original post, this is a very sweet update. Actions certainly speak louder than words and his actions seem to be saying that he loves you. I wish you two a happy future together!",
            "He Solo-ed you! He's a keeper \u2764",
            "awww that is so cute! sometimes it is really hard to untangle specific phrases from the person they were first used on (a lot)!   \nI know it is totally not the same, but in my second relationship 'I like you' (translated) meant the real deal as we both did not feel like 'I love you' was the right thing to say. so you finding out that you are quite content with the reply 'I know!' is wonderful!",
            "As a man who lost a child and then his wife ran away I know the sense of loss from a mans perspective. A death and a loss of your close trusted confidante.\n\nRight at that moment He was processing feelings of happiness and joy at being with you but tinged with guilt because he felt like he felt like he was  cheating, just a tiny bit, on his deceased wife.\n\nWhere does that leave you?  \u2014\u2014- you are an angel who has gracefully spent time with him and shown him love in your 7 month relationship. He has had time to process this and probably cant believe it him self.\n\nHe was probably resigned to bringing up the kids and who would want him, he was too old ....... believe me women of your age  tell you that when you are his age.\n\nHe is definitely happy to share his family with you, that little enclave of his deceased wifes legacy, that final private space,  that is TRUST and you must have built a solid foundation to get there.\n\nI think he will respond in time with those key words but maybe choose the time well. He would not have brought you into his most trusted world without serious emotion.\n\nConclusion\n\n(My story is only stated to show I qualify to say what follows)\n\nFor me the death of my infant son, my ex blaming her self and running away was like a death of her.  A man in love takes time, a long time to pass those guilt feelings that make you feel like you are cheating just a little bit, on the dead.\n\nThese are traits of a faithful and loyal man, loyal even to death. You girls would call him a keeper\n\nYou are inside his inner sanctum \u2014\u2014\u2014 he loves you. He just needs time (what he sees as suitable time enough not to be a betrayal of her memory) but he is also rationalising that it is a memory and that is why you are now with his kids\n\nBless you \u2014\u2014\u2014 bless you both heaps\n\n(yes you are an angel to him)",
            "My Nan and Papa were married for 60 years and she could count on one hand how many times he's said I love you, but he always provided, was an excellent father figure and always tried to make her happy by doing the things he knew she appreciated and vice versa, of course.\nMaybe your beau was rebuked at a young age by saying it to someone and it makes him overly cautious, you'll never know till you ask! Sounds like you're almost comfortable enough to, if he's the real deal it wouldn't be a fatality to the relationship at all. Good luck!",
            "I\u2019m literally standing at the store shopping for wedding stuff and tearing up like an idiot. \n\nThis post makes me so happy for you and I don\u2019t even know you. Congrats on your amazing little family and a lifetime of even happier moments!",

            "This made my day to read! He loves you. He is showing you in all the major ways. I, too, said I love you first to my husband. He waited until the next day to tell me he loved me too. We had been at a friend's house having drinks. He wanted to make sure we were sober. Regardless, I felt comfortable saying it because he showed me how he felt. I'm definitely a \"words of affirmation\" person, but he taught me how to see it in actions as well. I think I find the actions so much more comforting than just hearing \"I love you\". It makes you feel secure. \nI am so happy for you! Have fun with those sweet kids too!",
            "This reminds me of my boyfriend. He was so scared to say \u2018I love you\u2019 to begin with, that he\u2019d say, \u201cI don\u2019t need to say it because you know what I feel so you already know I do if you know what I mean...\u201d I\u2019d always play dumb and say I had no idea what he was talking about, because I wanted to hear him say it. Eventually I just blurted out that I loved him and I could visibly see the weight lifting off his shoulders and a huge grin appear on his face. Immediately he told me he loved me too and he was just too scared to say it first in case I didn\u2019t love him back. \n\nMaybe your guy needs to hear you say it a few more times before he gets the courage to say it. Even though, his actions clearly illustrate that he certainly does love you!",
            "That's a sweet update but I wouldn't force him to admit anything until he wishes to. Give him the space he needs",
            "Awwww that's so cute! He definitely has the love feelings. You and your new fam will be happy \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "This was such a sweet read. It seems like he's not quite as comfortable expressing his emotions through words (whether that's due to his underlying personality / \"love language\", his past relationship, societal gender norms, etc. - honestly, not that important), but his actions definitely speak volumes.\n\nWishing the best to all of you (including the kids)!",
            "You know, even if he hasn't said the phrase \"I love you\". You can totally tell he is falling for you and head over heels for you. Just the way he treats you and includes you.

            "You should tell him that while he shows you he cares about you that you would appreciate some more verbal expressions of how he feels for you as well",
            "I didn't see your original post, but I'm glad things are going well! Yes, I totally agree that even if they don't say it it doesn't mean they don't feel it. Saying those three words can be intimidating, especially if they they've gone through a lot. I finally mustered up the courage after a year of seeing my current boyfriend, but I just couldn't keep it in anymore. It's probably good you said it when you did, if not you might've gotten in your own head trying to find the perfect time (like I did lol). I never found the perfect time but I finally said it and it felt good letting him know. Even though he didn't say it back they still say it in the things they do and showing that they care. It sounds like things are going great with you guys, I wish you the best of luck!",

            "Just a trought... He might not feel ok telling you i love you, not because of how he feels about you or he doesnt love you, but because saying it makes his conection with his wife go away. \n\nDon't worry, and dont try to take her place in his heart. He loves her, and he loves you... but there is no name to the love he feels for you that doesnt take the love away from his wife (in name only, but words build reality)...he'll work it out, and you should not push it, Just love him (and his wife) back and he will figure out is not a competition (as you should know), is just another step into a more normal life.\n\nCongrats on this exciting moment for both of you",

            "This is a sweet update. Actions definitely speak louder than words! It took my husband over a year of dating to tell me he loved me, but I stuck around because his actions told me everything he couldn\u2019t. If he didn\u2019t care deeply for you he wouldn\u2019t do all those sweet things!",

            "So cute! I miss this stage in dating. Your story is bringing it all back to me. Enjoy it. I'm now happily married but one of the girls I dated before my wife really pressed the L word. I wasn't ready and she continually said it. It made me start feeling guilty like I was doing something wrong or was using her or something. Hard to explain. It ended up ruining that relationship. Maybe other factors were involved in the ending of that relationship. I can't say that's not a possibility. As a word of advice from a man, though? He knows how you feel. At this point, I'd probably hold back on saying it again until he catches up. I know I'll probably have an unpopular opinion about this, but I'm sincerely interested in your success of this relationship. Please don't take this the wrong way. I don't think you've done anything wrong either. You're golden at this point. If you really like this guy as much as I think you do, pull back a little on the L word. Trust me. I'm a 40 year old father of two from a previous marriage.",

The guy is a 39-year-old widow with 2 kids and was probably devastated for a long time when he lost his wife. You are in your 20s and you said I love you after the first time you had sex with him. I\u2019m honestly surprised he didn\u2019t see that as a red flag and stayed with you. Not trying to be mean, but jeez that reminds me of the overly attached girlfriend meme.\n\nHe obviously has positive feelings for you, but seriously don\u2019t suffocate him. That\u2019s not fair to him. Don\u2019t pressure him into saying the L word and honestly for your own mental health stop putting so much stake into him saying it. Just relax and enjoy the moment.

My older brother P (48M I think) who I no longer have any contact with, my younger brother J who is no longer with us, and my youngest sister K (44F). Recently P\u2019s children (2 girls and 1 boy, all in their late teens and early 20s) reached out to me and expressed a desire to have a relationship. I have zero contact with their father and swore that I would beat him black and blue if I ever saw him again.\n\nA little back ground:\n\nMy oldest brother P was always the golden child. No matter what he did, my parents always had an excuse for why it was not his fault. Bad grade? Teacher had it out for him. Cheating on every single one of his relationships? \u201cGood thing you did it to her before she did it to you\u201d (That one was my personal favorite). He also used to torment J and I constantly when we were smaller than him, until in high school, when I hit a growth spurt and sprung up to about 6\u20194 and 230lbs worth of muscle. After that I became the typical jock type. Played football, partied, bunch of friends, etc. Well, my younger brother, J, didn\u2019t get as lucky and stayed pretty small and scrawny throughout high school and college only getting up to about 5\u20198 and didn\u2019t have a super active social life. Despite the difference in our schooling experience I was always very protective of J, especially since we were always having to put up with P\u2019s bullshit. Which stopped once he realized I could pound him into the ground and not break a sweat, as he was also a lot smaller than me at only 5\u201910. Not much to say about K. She was a great younger sister and P didn\u2019t dare mess with her or he would incur the wrath of our mother.\n\nSo, in the late 90s, J met his first real girlfriend, A and was over the moon about her. He spent every spare moment with her, and when he wasn\u2019t with her, he would do nothing but gush about her. I had never seen him so happy. Well, one day, he comes to us, all smiles, and announces that A is pregnant and they are expecting. The mood quickly turned however when a week later it came out that A had been cheating on J for the duration of their relationship with our older brother P. This broke my brother, and of course P, being the golden shit that he is, didn\u2019t even get a disappointed glance from our parents. To this day I have never seen someone look so broken as J had looked the last time I saw him. I believe his heart ache was only compounded by the fact that my parents basically told him to get over it and be happy for our brother. Well about a week after this revelation came to light, J took his own life. I had never been so sad and angry at the same time in my entire life. Sad that I would never see my brother again, and the pure rage of knowing that this was my brother and parents\u2019 fault.\n\nDuring the funeral, P walked in with A and I saw red. Thankfully I had other family there to stop me from doing anything stupid, but I told P that if I ever saw him again, I would kill him. Shortly after that, I cut contact with 90% of my family, with the exception of K and a cousin I had always been close with, because everyone except them wanted to make excuses for my parents and P.\n\nFast forward to present, I never had any kids and truth be told, I never wanted any. I much prefer the role of the fun uncle. K met a great guy and had 2 daughters, who I absolutely adore. P had two more kids with A before cheating on her (shocker\u2026) and splitting and I\u2019ve never met any of them. My parents have tried to make contact a handful of times but I always told them to kick rocks. So last week, I\u2019m chatting with K\u2019s daughters (19 and 17) and they mention that their cousins have wanted to meet me for a long time and were hoping I would be willing to meet them as well. I don\u2019t believe they know everything that transpired between their dad and I, but I would be lying if I said I never had any desire to meet them.\n\nSo everyone, I\u2019m hoping to crowd source any ideas/suggestions on how I begin/maintain a relationship with P\u2019s kids while also keeping him and A out of my life. Any suggestions are welcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: 20+ years ago my older brother caused my younger brother's suicide. Now his kids want to meet me and have a relationship but i don't know how to have a relationship without my brother getting involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: One commenter just brought up a good point that kind of changes my question. The reason i wanted to meet with them soon is because they are all back in town at once from college due to covid, but someone gave me the idea that maybe meeting them one at a time once they return to their college campuses/old living arrangements is the better option. Thoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2: I've had multiple people ask me why K still talks with the people i cut contact with so i'll just copy/paste one of my replies here.\n\nEven though my sister was just as crushed about J's death as i was and was angry for a long time. She and her then boyfriend (future husband) hit a financial rough patch after graduating college and were forced to move in with our parents. Due to unrelated drama at the time, they couldn't stay with me. So my sister stayed with them for several years and over that time their relationship improved and even though i wasn't thrilled at the time, I understood. She still doesn't really have a relationship with P but is cordial if they meet. I don't blame her, because our parents did a lot for her and daughters love their cousins, so i didn't want put her in that kind of position of choosing.",

            "Did you already ask K's daughters if their cousins know the truth? Since it is very important for you then maybe K's daughters could help you figure it out as they seem to be in a good relationship with them",
            "This is probably too late and but sharing my personal experience. My dad slept with my uncle's wife and growing up I didn't have a whole lot of contact with him due to living with my mom. However I spent summers on the family property and growing up I didnt know about what had happened but my uncle's were always cold and angry with me and my siblings and to be honest it kind of hurt especially since they were nice a kind and understanding with my cousins. I knew it was because if my dad as he was banned from the property but it just kind of sucked it got taken out on me. My mom never really talked bad about him and it wasnt till I was in my late teens/20s that I got answers to my questions from the family whether it was siblings aunts or mom and each time it came with the warning that it would change the way I saw him and once I knew there wasnt going back. \n\nSo tldr they arent thier father and from thier point it probably hurts a little that theyre held responsible and you dont need to go into details at first just a statement of you're not speaking to your brother and when theyre older and really want to know y'all can talk about it then would suffice.  But maybe a small get together with your other nieces and maybe sister might help if possible. Ultimately there's not a whole lot to lose and you could gain some family. Just my opinion good luck",
            "I think this situation needs to be handled with care. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any harm in meeting them, but you do need to be clear with them that you have no intention of seeing or interacting with their father. From your earlier comment it sounds like the kids are all adults, but since they\u2019re still living with their father it might be best to hold off on the specifics of why you won\u2019t talk to their dad until they\u2019re a bit more independent. Your brother definitely sounds like the type that would blame you for \u201cturning his kids against him\u201d, and knowing the truth could make their lives more difficult while they\u2019re still under his roof.",

            "Maybe you could start with a discussion with K to make sure her daughters know everything or that it's okay for you to tell them everything.  Then if it's okay, tell them everything.  Then ask them why they think their cousins have been asking to meet you.  My sense from dealing with narcissists like your parents and brother is that this is something coming from your parents, not from P's kids themselves, and if K's kids have the right info they can push back on it.\n\nI'm very sorry for the loss of your brother.",
            "How old are they?  Because one option would simply be to send word back through K's daughters that you would love to have the opportunity to get to know them, but for reasons you don't wish to discuss, you don't want to have contact with their parents, so once they are adults, they should reach out to you and you would be happy to get together with them.\n\nEdit:  Reading back, I see that at least some of them are already adults.  So tell them that you are willing to have a relationship with them, but not with their parents, for private reasons.",
            "I actually think it might be a better idea to not meet with them until they\u2019re full fledged adults. That\u2019s the only way you can really have a relationship with them separate from their parents. Or even not meet with them at all if you prefer.",

She\u2019s just as bad as he is for cheating on J and letting him think he was going to be a dad.\n\nI remember my late teens and that was not a timw\nIn life where I was thinking about a long lost uncle that I had never met.",
            "Don't have a relationship with those kids unless it's gonna be based on honesty. Your older brother is, indeed, largely responsible for the needless death of your younger brother. I have no words for your parents. Your estranged brother's children played no roll in your brother's death so a relationship with them, to a point, becomes possible. However, I don't know how you can have a relationship with them unless they know the truth. It's time for your older brother and your parents to own their dishonesty and  dysfunction. I'm so sorry for your heartache here OP.",
            "Had there ever been a blood test on the oldest? I'd be curious as hell. \n\nTough situation man, the desire to tell them how big a piece of shit he is would be high but i believe it's more important to not tell them and let them discover for themselves, they probably have an idea anyways. If asked try to remain level and keep it brief. Focus on them and you in the now imo. If they want to meet you, i think thats fine, just keep it light and have a laugh.",
            "Since all three siblings sudden;y reached out together, I think this might be initiated by your parents, or there was some significant event involving your brother. There's also a possibility that they didn't know about you until recently, or that they only heard about your younger brother recently and they're typically curious teenagers who want the gory story.\n\nYou could start by asking them, or at least one of them, why they want to get to know you. Remind them that you are not unwilling to communicate, but that you have absolutely no interest whatsoever in meeting with, or talking to your parents, or their father. See where it goes from there.\n\nEdit: I think it would be fair to also point out to them that you're not their mom's biggest fan, either.",
            "Not to be pessimistic, but could there be ulterior motive for wanting to finally meet you? Like maybe your brother wants to get back in touch and is using his kids to do it? Or are you wealthy and they want you to share the love?",
            "It's also okay to respond \"I understand that you're reaching out. However, the event that ended my relationship with that part of my family is too traumatic for me to revisit or reopen. If that ever changes, I will let you know.\"\n\nYes, the kids are innocent, yes, and if you WANT to get to know them, by all means go ahead, but it's also okay for you to prioritize your own emotional wellbeing here.",
            "The kids are not their father and you don\u2019t have to view them as an extension of him. The same as how you are not your parents. \n\nYour issues (though valid) with your brother and parents are between the 4 of you - not your nieces. \n\nYou can develop a separate relationship with them that is not connected with your brother.",
            "OP I found your story interesting and I can't dismiss the thought that P is someone with a personality disorder. He lied, cheated and bullied his own blood - this is not normal.\n\n1. Transfer of guilt:\nI am somehow curious about the first kid, X. If you tell X about what lead to J's suicide, X might have all kinds of things in the head.\n\nIs P my real father? Or am I actually J's?\nMy parents caused J to take his life.\nMy existence caused J to kill himself.\nWhat if X is indeed J's, then it's P and A fault that...\nMy mother is a s***\n\nThe kids probably know that P is an ass but don't really know the extent of it.\n\nSo you need to really think wether or not telling them everything. If you think they are matured enough for such conversation, proceed with care.\n\n2. Transfer of information:\nKnowing how your parents have always been on his side, probably they have painted some nice story to explain why you have been out of touch. \n\nP might have added some colours to it. \n\n3. Why the need to get in touch:\nWhy would they care to reach out? Maybe for financial security. \n\n\"Our nice uncle might be able to help.\"\n\nMaybe because they need a fatherly figure in their life because what they have is a problematic big kid not a father.\n\nIf you decide to meet them, please meet them elsewhere not at your parents' home or anywhere close to where they live.\n\nYou did a great job - you cut all the toxic elements in your life. So I guess if you are willing to try to have a new connection, probably set a boundary. A boundary that define you don't want to be involved with things related to P and A.",
            "You don't need to have a relationship with them.",
            "Is it possible that the oldest one is J's child?",
            "To be honest, I'd be very reluctant to meet them. It sounds like their college-aged and are probably in need a of financial support to pay for college/cars/housing or whatever. You're single, established and probably have a healthy bank account.\n\nIm single, 40, no kids and have nieces and nephews around their age.\n\nI've learned a few things over the years.\n\n1. The Apple Doesn't fall far from the tree.\n2. Children's loyalty is first and foremost to their parents. Children, even adult children crave their parents attention, love and approval. No matter what you say, I highly doubt they will believe your side of the story and given your brother's nature, nothing would make him prouder than to have his kids weasel money from you.\n3. In all my years of been a teen and young adult I never wanted to hang out or get to know people in their 40s. I was too busy having fun, being independent and hanging out with my mates. Especially in my late teens and early 20s.\n\n\nIf you were to go ahead and meet them, Id suggest a coffee met up somewhere neutral that you can walk away from quickly and quietly if you need to. No different than a Tinder date. \n\nYou've lived your whole adult life, independent from your family and relatively free from drama. You know from growing up in a chaotic household, the true meaning of having a peaceful and contented life. Its the most valuable thing in the world. If it was me, I wouldn't invite trouble to my door.",
            "I would pass on the\"opportunity\".  They have been out of your life for 20+years.  Best to let sleeping dogs lie.  Neither you nor they are missing out on anything. Your brother and his ex's actions have consequences.   It becomes an avenue to hurt you again.  I would avoid it and reiterate my message at the funeral.  But then again I can be a real AH.  What P and S did is unforgivable. So is what your parents did.  Tell them it's keeps their father out of the cemetery and you out of jail.",
            "So these kids want to lay the foundations of a relationship with their single (possibly financially secure) uncle just before they \"might need a little help\" during their college years?\n\nNope. That whole scenario sounds like social engineering at its finest.\n\nTo directly answer your title question? You don't start that relationship!\n\nAt a guess your older brother's kids hear how you treat your sister's kids and want in on the action.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss of \"J\". Nothing your older brother or his wife can do could ever make up for the loss.  I don't think you should give even a tiny part of yourself to P & A's kids. I know they're innocent in the situation, but the tiniest chink in your armour could be exploited for financial gain (which could ultimately benefit P) if you let those kids into your life.",
            "This isn't a classic case of the sins of the father  etc. What ever your brother did, its not the fault of your  Niece's and  Nephew .\nIt took quitea lot of guts  in reaching out to you \nAnd they are also  the innocent victims in this.",
            "If the kids are over 18, there's no real reason you would need P or A's permission to have contact or meet up with them. So avoiding them should be easy enough. If they still live with P or A, this might be trickier. I'd get that info before starting anything.\n\nI guess what I'm wondering is: are you prepared for these kids to ask for money, try to broker peace between you and their parents, basically: what if their intentions aren't strictly about getting to know you and developing a separate relationship? I would prepare for that possibility and lay down rules like they are not to involve their parents or give out your contact info. Whatever boundaries you need in order to feel OK.\n\nCan you talk to K's kids about why these niblings are interested in getting to know you? Not to put them in the middle, but get a sense of what's sparking the interest? That might help you gauge if this is worth pursuing.\n\nAs far as being honest with them about J and P/A's roles in his death and your estrangement... I guess if they push and press I'd be honest but I think that's gonna kick off WW3. Because I'm pretty sure they don't know any of the backstory and whatever they've been fed is not what actually happened.",
            "I\u2019m the estranged kid from the family due to my dads actions and I have to say, please don\u2019t listen to the people who are saying not to meet them.\n\nIt\u2019s tough being those kids. You don\u2019t understand why you don\u2019t get the amazing uncles (or cousins, etc) that others get.\n\nMeet them, be open and honest that you don\u2019t speak with their dad, but they don\u2019t need to be burdened necessarily with the full truth. Just that you do not wish to have a relationship with their father.\n\nAs you mentioned in another post, they\u2019re stuck living with him now so giving them ammo to make them hate that even more than they probably do (their parental situation sounds really sad) won\u2019t help anyone.\n\nYou can be the fun uncle. If they\u2019re anything like me, it\u2019ll mean the world to them.",
            "Have you been to therapy? About all this?",
            "start that relationship out of love for those kids, not anything else. \n\nIf that emotion isnt there, then dont force it. If you need more time, then take that.",
            "Your two nieces and nephew reached out and said they want a *relationship* with you, right?   \nNot \"*We want to know why you and my parents don't get along*\" right?\n\nDon't jump the gun on this. Be with them as family and as an uncle. If you want them in your life, then whatever comes with that can be dealt with. Is it going to bring up interactions and memories that you probably would not like to deal with? Likely.\n\nBut this isn't about family drama, this is about your family that you've never known wanting to get to know who you are. Cherish that. If you meet them and decide you want to tell them why you'll never see their parents again, that's your decision. \n\nI'd just say, whatever choice you make, ensure that it's coming from a place of understanding and not an attempt to \"tell them the truth\" about everything, upending your relationship with them, and likely resulting in them either never wanting to talk to you(because they don't know how to process it) or causing a lot of drama between them and their parents(who they still live with). Whatever you choose, make sure you have their benefit in mind, short and long term.",
            "If you'd like to speak to them, you can make it clear that you are not interested in speaking to or about their father/parents. That is a reasonable boundary. They're not responsible for his mistakes and are likely QUITE aware of just what he's like. It's possible it's part of why they want to meet you.\n\nIt's also reasonable to speak with them, see their intentions, and not want to continue a relationship. Speaking to them initially is not a promise from you, you can revoke this at any time.",
            "I slightly disagree with those saying to make sure the kids know the deal with their dad. You can't expect them to see things how you do,  their relationship with him is their own and no one else's concern and breaking it to them that their father is a narcissistic piece of shit is pretty full on. \n\nFrom personal experience, I have completely crazy parents and disconnected from my extended family for many years over my teens. In my adult years I was able to reconnect with a lot of my family and have really nice relationships with them now completelyseparate from my parents who are never invited anywhere. We do not discuss my parents and stay away from those sensitive topics. If you decide to meet them I would suggest going in with an open mind but clear boundaries, only by meeting them and getting to know them will you discover if they'll be a good impact in your life or not. Just be prepared to fade away if it doesn't feel right.",
            "Yes, meet them (tentatively), no, please don\u2019t tell them that one of their births caused their uncle to take his own life. They\u2019re at a very tumultuous age of a lot of change and just starting to break free of parental bullshit. I 1000% suspect that\u2019s why the interest in meeting you. Now that they\u2019re all in college, they\u2019re getting a feel for the world outside their bubble and probably realizing they don\u2019t deserve their shit parents (god knows that\u2019s when I figured it out). \n\nIt\u2019s okay to put down a firm boundary: \u201cI do not talk to your dad due to something very bad that happened in our past, and it\u2019s very hard for me to talk about. I am happy to get to know you, though.\u201d",
            "The kids are all old enough to do what they want, provided that the current situation eases enough to allow it, you should try your best to get to know them without any bias from their father's actions. \n\nIt might not be possible without your brother knowing, but unfortunately for him he can't tell his adult children what to do anymore. \n\nObviously there is associated risk due to their COVID arrangements, hopefully they'll not last too long.",
            "I wouldn\u2019t meet them.  If you do the chances of you running into your brother increase and by the sounds of it you are still angry/upset with him and honestly who wouldn\u2019t be?  Tell your sister to tell them the truth when they ask about you so they know the reason.  And if they are still interested in meeting you when you are ready then they will know not to be in a situation where you will run into their parents.  \n\nPersonally I just wouldn\u2019t want to meet them.",

This situation is so sad and I'm very sorry for the loss of your brother.\n\nI think you can move forward with a relationship with your nieces and nephew and play it by ear.

It\u2019s interviews with various folks who have had secrets kept from them, have kept secrets about themselves, or have been complicit in keeping secrets for other people. Time and time again, the result is always that speaking the truth is best. I suggest listening to some of the episodes as they may resonate with you and you could pick up helpful language to use when talking to Ks kids and/or Ps kids.\n\nAnother thing to contemplate that I haven\u2019t seen mentioned outright is making sure that you think through giving the kids an opportunity to \u2018consent\u2019 to hear the info. I saw discussion about how you ought to ensure that any relationship is built on truth. And I was convos about not wanting to make their lives hard while living with their dad. I find it is easy to get caught up in trying to figure out what is best for others feelings, emotions m, etc; oftentimes, we can save ourselves from mental ping-pong by just asking direct questions.",
            "This is some heavy stuff man. Sorry for everything. There is some excellent advice here but you should definitely talk to a psychologist (if you haven\u2019t already done so). This is a lot to hold down over 20 some odd years. I really hope you find answers.",

That doesn't mean that you shouldn't tell them ever. They also have a right to know. But learning something like that about one's parents can be very challenging for a child. So keep that in mind and even though it's challenging keep the children out of harm's way that your parents apparently put you and your siblings in. If they are already reaching out to you, I for one would see that as a chance to put some good back in there.

They never got a choice to be born or be in the environment theyre in. \n\nYou have to ask yourself this: is your grudge against your older brother or is it because you felt as if you, as Js older, failed to protect him/felt powerless in his moment of need. \n\nWe have a tendency of being hard on ourselves, especially when we feel as if it\u2019s was our responsibility to something important but failed. When you look at or think of Ps children, do you feel regret about your inaction or do you see your P and what didn\u2019t do to protect J? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t really know the full depth of your unfortunate experience. Losing J had a profound impact on you and you\u2019re still possibly grieving over the lost of your younger brother.",

            "Holy fuck just use fake names this was impossible to read",
            "No offense, but why couldn't you just use fake names instead of letters?",
            "They probably want something from you. I would probably decline an invite. If you really want to meet them I would start with a coffee/lunch meet up with your sister and her kids. I would be candid about their father/late uncle/grand parents. If things develop naturally keep in touch via email and social media. Good luck OP.",
            "I feel like this is a good screenplay for a movie.  And then the niece and nephew get along great with their new uncle and then the bad brother gets fat and runs away never to be seen again.",
            "what was your parents reaction when your brother committed suicide? did they STILL make excuses for P? \n\nno one should kill themselves - regardless of whats happened, he could have had another girl, got her pregnant etc etc.. (not blaming just all the what ifs etc)..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for your dilemma you could see the kids together or separate as i see pro/cons with both and as they are older they dont need permission from P or w/e so i dont think that should be a big deal..",
            "First off, no don\u2019t tell them what their parents did. At least not right now. Idk why people keep saying that, it\u2019s starting a dumpster fire on a part of your life you don\u2019t even want to revisit. And it\u2019s selfish. People are saying they want to \u201cexpose\u201d P, but that\u2019s at the expense of the kids and really just feels vengeful. Yea you want honesty in a relationship, yadda yadda. But that can be done by clearly stating it\u2019s not up for discussion and staying very vague with what you want to share. And honestly you don\u2019t seem interested in revisiting those painful memories anyways. \n\nNext I want to address the people saying the kids must have ulterior motives like money or parents manipulation. When I was in high school I started understanding more about my dad\u2019s estranged family. Very little, but I was very curious. If I\u2019d been in contact with a cousin who knew these estranged family members, I\u2019d most certainly have mentioned I\u2019d like to meet with them. The fact that they\u2019ve only mentioned it to their cousins, not reached out directly tells me they\u2019re not actively working to get something from you. \n\nLastly I would watch for the red flags and dip ASAP if it seems to be going sideways. No pushing for you to meet their parents. No puppy dog eyes or begging for the truth. They\u2019re adults and they understand \u201cno\u201d. They need to clearly respect your boundaries from the get go. Anything that breaks those or makes you uncomfortable, you\u2019re well within you\u2019re right to leave. Good luck",
            "\\>One of those kids is the baby the suicide was over...\n\nThis comment was way too buried. This is the fact. You can't tell those kids because it could really mess them up. Inadvertently, \\*they\\* are a major reason your brother died.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Maybe just email them. I wouldn't meet them in person tbh, it will probably lead to you seeing P again and I 100% do not blame you for not wanting to do that. You do not know what they do/do not know, you don't want to get in the middle of them and their dad's relationship (because that just puts you in a mess). This is dangerous territory. And the kids didn't do anything wrong... so it would be a shame if they got embroiled in this fight just because they wanted to meet you. You will probably never have a good relationship with them, and that is no one's fault but your brother P's fault.\n\nSo my final recommendation is just email. You will probably never feel comfortable around them and that is 100% understandable. Like P will always be just around the corner and they will be loyal to him in the end anyway. \n\nI get why they would want to meet you though. I didn't meet my dad's one of my dad's sister and one of his brothers until I was in my teens. I was very very curious. It felt odd saying to people that I had never met some of my dad's siblings before. What they are thinking/feeling makes total sense to me because I was once in their shoes. But that doesn't mean you are under any obligation to meet them.",
            "Firstly, you are an awesome brother. Protecting J\nWhy do those kids care about having a relationship with you? Something tells me they are doing it due to your parents involvement?",
            "I think brother P is long overdue and absolutely brutal beating",

            "Don't punish them for things they didn't do.",
            "I would write them a letter in which you relate the whole story, much as you have done here. Tell them you'd still love to meet them, but this is the back story. If they are still up for it, then sure. \nMaybe that's bad advice but it's the best thing I can think of, and it's what I'd probably do.",
            "What if... K hosted a hang out for all the kids and you went as \"a coworker\" or \"friend if K's husband\" something weird,  even to borrow a tool or something innocuous? \n\nYou'd get to meet them in passing,  get to know their personalities a little,  but have no formal obligation to stay or talk or have any of these hard conversations.",
            "Have you confirmed if your nieces and nephew wanting to get in contact with you is their own idea or if P is trying to get to you through them? I'd be suspicious of this. Why would these kids have any reason to want to talk to you if you were never involved in their life?",
            "I don\u2019t have any advice in terms of if you should meet them or not, but I will say I\u2019m not sure telling them what happened is a great idea. Telling some young adults that their parents are responsible for the death of their uncle is a really heavy burden to place on them. It\u2019s going to turn their entire world upside down. This isn\u2019t a movie where everything will be magically fixed through the power of family. I\u2019m about the age of your nieces and nephews and if I found out my parents had caused a suicide, it would break me.",
            "I have a very messed up extended family. If it were me I'd meet the Kids they are as of now innocent in everything. Worse case they doing their Father's bidding, best case you just gained more Nieces and Nephews.",
            "Fuck, imagine finding out you are that baby that caused a suicide....\n\nI dunno, OP, it might be best to stay no contact until someone else breaks the news.",
            "Knowing that I caused my younger brother's death, would leave me mentally insane. It breaks my heart how someone could do that. I sometimes feel like he is the oldest. How his extroverted energy is compared to my introverted self, and how he draws people closer to him. I really admire my younger brother, so I would never want to cause him any pain or harm.",
            "Scorched Earth reveal the truth to them about who their parents really are and tell them what they did and how horrible people they really are but that you don't blame them for who they come from and you are willing to have a relationship with them as long as you never have to see the despicable disgusting trash that made them",
            "You should have put P in the hospital and had your sister whoop the other chick",
            "If they are adults I would get into contact t with them via email or social media, probably through their cousins. Let them know that you cannot have any contact with your brother or A but you would like to meet them. \n\nI'm so sorry for everything that happened to you. I'm not really sure how your older brother is responsible for the other passing. Don't get me wrong, he's a piece of shit and I would keep him out of your life. But I don't understand keeping that grudge. Granted, easier said then done and it's easy to throw blame.",
            "It really depends on how you feel about it. Do you want to meet them? Will it bring you pain and make you unhappy? It\u2019s possible they are old enough to decide for themselves what they think about their parents, but without the cheating they would not have been born into the circumstances they were. Said differently it\u2019s not their fault, right? They will care most about what you think about them as people and not the circumstances, so if you can separate that in your dealings with them, I\u2019d say meet them. If it ends up being a ploy by your brother, his ex, or your parents you will find out soon enough. You are in control here, you don\u2019t owe anything to anyone.",
            "Damn.  That's rough.\n\nOne thing that I would think about in this situation is that kids tend to embody many different relatives, not just their parents.  My oldest nephew operates more like me than he does his mom/my sister.  \n\nChances are that parts of your deceased brother are alive in your nieces and nephew, even though they never met each other.",
            "If you go to meet these kids, and for whatever reason, since the chances would be higher, you do actually see your brother P, walk away. Just walk away. \n\nNot sure you've backed off that old threat or not. But I'm guessing you know now that that would be a bad path. If this is some setup, your parents and P get involved, you know what to do. Walk away. \n\nWishing you the best in whatever you decide.",
            "\"Sins of the father\" is such a heartless adage.",
            "Sometimes the only advice to give is to see a professional (a therapist).  I think this is one of those times.\n\nSometimes DIY advice can make things much worse.",
            "That's pretty rough man, I'm sorry shit went down like it did. I have two brothers, a fraternal twin and a younger one. Yeah, they piss me off sometimes (at one point my little brother and I refused to talk to one another for about two years, but we're pretty good now) but at the end of the day we're family. I consider myself pretty lucky. \n\nI'm much younger than you so giving you advice seems strange haha, but I think there is one thing I have learned in life that is honest truth;\n\nWe regret the things we didn't do more than the things that we did do.\n\nIf you never established any meaningful connection with your nieces and nephews, and heaven forbid, before it became too late, then you would regret it far more than meeting them but it not going well. \n\nGo meet them. And as far as how to handle the meeting, well, you're all adults. You can tell them the truth and they'll just have to work that out on their own. It would at least give them an understanding as to why you had been absent from their lives - that it wasn't anything personal against then. They'll understand, and it's not like they have to bring their father into the equation too, I'm going to assume. So it couldn't hurt. \n\nOh, and fuck P. Hope he comes to accept and correct his shit behavior someday, otherwise watch everyone he cares about leave his life.",
            "Your elder brother is a POS. That being said, those kids are innocent and they deserve to know the truth. If they do know the truth and still support their folks, then yeah no need to have contact",
            "Dont. Tell them that while youd like to, their fathers done things that are so unforgiveable that you cant. (This redirects karma back on him without explaining why, and lets him suffer his kids wondering). What an evil P.O.S... (p.s. idk if this is the best advice so maybe dont take it but, yeah i want some sort of cosmic justice without the kids getting hurt). If contact will reignite these bad feelings for u and cost u its not worth it IMO.",
            "Kids don't have to turn out like their parents. You are living proof of that. You're curious about these little humans so I say go ahead and meet them...if you can do so without hurting them. You have a lot of *totally justifiable* anger at their parents. You'd have to completely shield them from that, they aren't old enough to hear that kind of origin story. If they look you right in the face and ask why you hate their dear dad you'll have to be level headed enough to say you're not going to talk about that. If you can do that, I say meet them! Good luck! Everyone deserves a cool uncle.",
            "Man, I'm sorry for your loss. Every bit of hatred you have against that piece of shit is more than justified. I can't say I could have stand out of doing stupid shit, when that motherfucker would have been around.",
            "If you start a relationship with the kids of your brother, be aware that this will most certanly leeds to open up the reason of the breaking of the family.\n\nThats why i would, seek out to meet your sister, and ask what she is thinking about it. And what she is thinking about how much the kids know about the truth. And what she expects, what will happens if your telling the truth. I would ask her for advice, because you seems to trust her, and she know much more as you about the situation and the relation the kids have with there father.\n\nYou shoould not lie about that in anycase. May be, only maybe if you feel alright with it, you can simplify it to a degree that you are comfortable with it.",
            "Just gonna throw this out there, but since you are so much taller than your brothers, and your parents are ok with cheating, maybe your mum cheated and you and your deceased brother and sister are all affair babies, hence why the one brother is the golden child",
            "It probably won\u2019t\u2026\u2026\n\nBut if the subject of money, student loans and/or \u2018help\u2019 comes up, please get out of there quickly.",
            "The thing that stands out to me here is that P split, he sounds like the type of person who drains the happiness from other's lives and doesn't sound like the type to be a great loving father? I don't know, maybe he was fine? \nPoint is, his kids may not have received a loving male father figure from him and then find that there's this amazing fun, loving uncle they don't know from their cousins, why wouldn't they want to meet! \nPersonally I'd go for it, these kids didn't do the torrent of abusive behavior from your brother and parents so why should they suffer? Meet them, spread the love and if your brother shows, one punch and walk away, but don't take it out on the kids",
            "As someone with experience in developing a relationship with the children of an estranged sibling (for me it's 2 cousins. 1 is adored by my family but I've excommunicated him from my life with 0 interest in tolerating any positive mentions of his life. The other is despised but I can completely justify his reasons for lying to the entire family and breaking up 2 marriages. He pales in comparison to the former, but is slowly being accepted back into the family), I will tell you that the first meeting needs to be a low stakes environment. Granted the kids in my story are significantly younger, and more impressionable, I think you should be more cautious because the kids in your story have already formed their thoughts one way or another. \n\nYou mentioned K's kids are the ones who tell you the other kids want to meet you, but I didn't see any mention of K mentioning hearing the same or having thoughts on the matter. If you're this close to K's kids, you're close enough with K to have her be involved in this arrangement. And deliberate with her on intent. Do these kids want to meet you because K's kids talk about you and gush about their fave uncle? Or do these kids want to meet you on their own volition?\n\nIf everything adds up (logically, not emotionally), then go through with a timed social event. Either lunch at K's, or some kind of outing/event where you happen to be there. That's all it should be. Don't set these kids up with \"OK I'll come meet you and talk to you\" since that sets expectations. This is important. You don't know each other, and have all these assumptions about each other that you've learned through 3rd party (no matter how close you are with K and her family, their assessment is not yours and vice versa) \n\nOperating under the assumption that K's kids know the truth and K is part of the arrangement, you can be \"stopping by\" on a Sunday afternoon type of thing around lunch kind of thing while they're visiting. You get some time alone with them for their questions in a safe and familiar space for both parties.\n\nCounter to what many people are saying, you do NOT need to be dropping the truth bomb on them on your first meeting. Some are adamant they deserve to know, which is true, but your first time meeting them is not the right move. They know you're estranged, but will likely think P is the one who cut you off for something you've done. It just makes you look bad if you try to explain it, even if they ask. Decide if developing a relationship is viable, and reassess telling them only if (and after) you do develop a relationship with them. If they ask, you tell them it's a long story for another time.",
            "I can feel the hostility still raging through your texts, that guy seriously is a POS and I understand why you don\u2019t want him in your life. \n\nMaybe just meet the kids at their dorms, hang out, get to know em. Since they\u2019re teens that\u2019s easy! If they drive meet them at a restaurant or hang out someone fun like the mall! Just keep the conversation light. \n\n\nJust remember the kids had 0 to do with the situation so don\u2019t bring it up to them, because I feel like that might hurt them when it\u2019s literally a situation that happened before they existed. They might already kinda know anyway and not wanna talk about it. \n\nGood luck!",
            "Posting for updates. But very rough situation.  Sorry to hear. Hope you\u2019re able to be that cool uncle for them as the kids are innocent of your brothers actions in past.",
            "Honestly I don't is be ok seeing the result of that betrayal so that's the first thing you need to determine. The second is, even though they're adults is consider waiting till they go back to college or even after they finish up college to ensure they are independent and there's no chance of seeing him again. Gl.",
            "Upon reading this, I feel what would be considered a mere modicum of your rage; your brother P is an asshat, to say the very least. I'm glad you have no relationship with him.\nThe first thing to say is that through having a relationship with P's kids, you're inevitably going to meet P one day. I'd say step one is anger management. It'd be unfair for you to flip out at P in front of his kids, who have no hold on the situation and are unfortunately estranged from you. As much as P deserves unhappiness, you can't tell his kids every detail about the situation until they're adults and mature enough. They'll have questions as to why you guys are no longer in contact, and until they're mature enough, you'll need to dress it up. Alternatively, just tell them not to ask that question. They'll need to understand that this is an issue between you and P only, and that it's your situation to be angry about, not theirs.\nTake them on days out; have dinner with them; discuss your life after dropping P completely; do 'cool uncle' things. As another commenter asked, do K's kids know about what happened?\nI'm sorry you're in this situation. I have aunties whom I'm not close with but they'll always love me and vice versa. Even if you don't become close, let them know they can come to you for support.",
            "Dont let the kids suffer for what their parents did. At the end of the day, you are their uncle, and you guys deserve to meet at least once and see where it goes. If not, you will always think about this until the day you die. And they will too. Just do it",
            "Say yes but make it very clear that they are not to report back anything to their parents.  And let it all out.  They are old enough to know just what went down.",

            "Please at least consider this, if the oldest doesn't know the truth it could be pretty devastating to hear not only your dad may not be your dad. He also cheated on your mom with your maybe biological dad. And the guy who raised him caused your potentially bio dad to kill himself. That's quite a bone to chew..",
            "This situation all around sucks.  I'm not sure what you should do, but I obviously fully support you never having anything to do with your older brother P, who is a huge piece of trash.  Your parents also suck for basically defending P when they should have been supporting your late brother J.  Sleeping with your brother's girlfriend or wife is one of the worst acts of betrayal out there.  I could never forgive any family member or friend who got intimate with my girlfriend or wife and I would never forgive myself if I did that to family or friends.  It's beyond me how P lives with himself.  A is also a garbage human being for not just cheating, but cheating WITH a family member of her boyfriend.",
            "I wouldnt do it. I would not see those kids because that would put you in an awkward situation with P and infact, re create trauma. Do not do it! NO. Save yourself. Children will open old wounds and frankly, you MUST protect yourself. I am in a similar situation with no contact with my sister and Mother. I used to be close to her two boys but I Can not do it, as much as it was initially difficult because the thread that tied my sister and I will come together and that would be fatal. You must cut all ties with a toxic, toxic family! Please And that means turning your back on his children!",
            "I\u2019m probably the only one who thinks this, but I\u2019d not engage, not saying you should or shouldn\u2019t, but I wouldn\u2019t. If I were those young adults, learning this information about their parents will be more rHan traumatizing. It will validate all of the minor issues their parents have had in their childhood with them and more than likely take away most positive thoughts of their childhood and their entire perception on life. \n\nDo they deserve to know? Yes\n\nDo you and them deserve to have a relationship? Yes\n\nThe question you have to answer, is it worth it for you, and is it worth it for the kids? Is your potential relationship with these family members important enough to you and them to jeopardize their entire future? Whether or not you say yes or no does not make you a bad person, but putting things into perspective might help"

I think you can read it here\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/3ldcjd/322777772_i_f28_kicked_my_husband_out_of_the/\n\nI filed for divorce after a few conversations with my husband.  He blames J for our divorce and became very threatening.  At one point he said he would turn walk away from me and our two kids if I didn't stop the divorce process.  I called his bluff and told him \"good, go, we would be better off.\"  In my state it takes six months to finalize divorce with children involved.  I have sole custody and he never filed for joint custody which is good.\n\nNow on to J.  There's so much but I'll try to be brief.  He's in therapy and lives with my parents.  He's sticking it out with school even though he has anxiety and depression.  He's fighting really hard to heal.  Sometimes he has setbacks and is just like a broken down little boy.  He has a very strong will and spirit and sometimes I wonder how far he would have gone in life even now at 19 if the animals hadn't totally broken him.\n\nHis siblings and mom still try to contact him and guilt him for not staying with his mom to \"take care of her as she ages.\"  They all agreed that J's life would be to be the mother's caretaker as they all go on have live their own as they wish.  He actually feels guilty about not fulfilling that shockingly.  He has a long way to go before he realizes that his life is his to do as he wishes.  They don't have his phone number anymore but they email him.  My dad got him a new phone cause his mom would call him and berate him and guilt him.  It seemed like every conversation with her set him back two steps.  She still knows how to crush him sadly.  I wish she didn't have that power over him.  I've never wished a death penalty on somebody like I do on her.\n\nHe's dating a girl and I'm scared she might hurt him (break his heart) but my dad is more encouraging of that and has to remind me to not over protect him.  J has become very close with my mom.  He drives her grocery shopping and enjoys doing that stuff with her.  My dad taught him how to drive in like one week.  He is about to go take his driving test for his DL, he's still on a learner's permit.\n\nThere are a lot of positive things going on but progress is very slow and sometimes it's like watching a clock.  It just seems like he's standing still in terms of anxiety and depression.  I can't say too much about all that's going on but I can say that my parents have an attorney and are going through the adoption process.  \n\nI wanted this to be a more upbeat and positive update but honestly J struggles a lot.  Law enforcement is now involved because some of the physical abuse is more recent than I thought, just from his mom.  He has a few scars and he has broken bones that never healed properly cause he never got medical attention.  Protection orders are likely to be granted.  If they are, then according to the investigators charges will almost be inevitable.  That part of it I can't say much about but can say that J is willing to go forward with that process for now under the guidance of his therapist.  But we have been warned that he may choose to back off later.  Though one cop said there is a point of no return for the DA even without J's cooperation.\n\n**tl:dr**  **My divorce and full custody is likely.  J is fighting hard to turn things around for himself.  He has a long way to go.  It's so hard for him.  He's like a superhero the way he pushes forward.**  ",

It sounds like J went through some American Horror Story shit, and his family just straight up gives no fucks.

            "Wow OP thank you for helping him so much. If you didn't do what you did that night, he would still be getting abused by his mom. You and your family are great people, keep up with the updates if you can :) \n\nIt's good you divorced because if that's your husbands mentality, i can't imagine what justification he would have if he hit your kids in the future. \n\nTell J to make a new email!!!! Just so he can start fresh. Don't delete the old one in case the police need any emails from his family. \n\nI still can't believe how everything can change so quickly! Happy Halloween OP :)",
            ">There are a lot of positive things going on but progress is very slow and sometimes it's like watching a clock. It just seems like he's standing still in terms of anxiety and depression.\n\nI know it may be frustrating but please be patient with him.  You've only been at this *for a month*.  Realize that **99%** of his life has been that toxic environment of servitude and abuse.  What you're trying to do for him and these experiences of independence are maybe 1% of his life experiences.  Actually, at 1 month out of 228 months that's closer to 0.5% of his life. It doesn't matter that these changes are better; they're still *different* and change, even good change, is sometimes uncomfortable and difficult.  You do not want to push too hard and undo good work.\n\n>That part of it I can't say much about but can say that J is willing to go forward with that process for now under the guidance of his therapist. But we have been warned that he may choose to back off later. Though one cop said there is a point of no return for the DA even without J's cooperation.\n\nThat's fan-fucking-tastic.  I can say as someone who was socially isolated for a while that you almost have to relearn what it's like to be a proper person.  The progress tells me that not only is therapy consistent but that it's working.  I would talk to the therapist about their advice for what actions you should be taking.  But it sounds like he's making slow and steady progress that will be **permanent**.  That's the important thing.\n\nYou're doing great work.  Be patient and don't push too hard.  People like this can sometimes act like wounded animals.  You might not believe it, but he's actually progressing pretty fast for this timetable.\n\n**Edit:** Just to be clear, I think you are doing an AMAZING job OP.  What you've done for this young man cannot be put into words.  Hell, you sacrificed your marriage because you recognized something bad in your partner from this.  That's something not many people are brave enough to do.  So I want to stress I never meant to criticize you.  I simply want to stress that, as others below wrote, there are some internal struggles happening from this that you won't be able to see.  Never do anything to break the trust you've earned with this person and understand that it may sometimes be a three steps forward one step back type of process.  But you've given someone their freedom and life back.  Not many people can say they've done that.",

No teachers, school counselors, friends, friend's parents, neighbors... nobody.  Every time I told someone and asked them to help me you know what they did?  RATTED ME OUT TO MY ABUSERS.  \n\nYou go!!",
            ">They all agreed that J's life would be to be the mother's caretaker as they all go on have live their own as they wish.\n\nThat's just an awful situation.

The victim can, however, sue for financial damages in a civil suit whether the criminal case goes to court or not.\n\nI hope there's a criminal case. It'll be really hard on J because his brain is wired to never fight back and to bow to the family's wishes, but if he has the support of someone like you, I'm confident you'll find the best thing to do.

I wish you, your kids, your parents and J the best of luck and to steer clear of your ex's family whenever possible.",
            "Whatever you do, never let the ex-husband back in. Abuse is a cycle and if he treated his brother as a kid like that, he will be likely to treat his / your kids in that fashion too. I would press hard for sole custody to keep the father out of your kids' lives too; his form of victim-blaming (blaming J for you deciding to divorce him) is the type of behavior that could in the future manifest as him blaming your kids for what happened too. \n\nI know some people who are in this tier of ugliness as human beings, but it was always obvious from afar. I am curious as to how you didn't see a zillion red flags with this family from the beginning? I hope that doesn't come off as me blaming you for marrying this guy, but was he completely normal and kind and caring? Did the family seem completely normal from the outside?",
            "That your ex husband would threaten to turn his back on his own kids as a way to threaten you, and then has shown no interest in continuing to be in their lives should be enough in itself to remind you that you've made the right decision.  You're protecting your grandchildren from his family as well as J.\nGood luck, I'm sure your journey won't always be easy, but you have absolutely chosen the right path.",
            "I remember this post. Good for you and your family for standing up for J and helping him out. Great that your husband didn't file for joint custody. He might have done anything to your kids but maybe because he's never had a chance.\n\nBest of luck with the divorce and legal proceedings for J. I hope his mom gets the punishment she deserves.",

J is out of the horrible environment that very well could have been his fate had you not stepped in along with your parents, OP. You and your parents are such beautiful people. We need more people like you all in this world. You guys are helping someone out who had nobody and giving him the tools to succeed. He's getting therapy. You've divorced your horribly abusive husband and cut contact with your even worse MIL. J will take time to a long time to heal, though he will always have scars (metaphorically speaking), but at least he has the opportunity to get better. There are many children in his place that don't have that chance because they don't have compassionate and patient people like you and your parents in their lives. As someone who experienced an abusive childhood/early adulthood and is still dealing with the consequences of my upbringing, I wish I could more than thank you and your parents for what you've done for J. You guys are so amazing and I wish nothing but good things to come your way in life. Thank you so much. ",
            "I'm so happy that things are looking up for J. You really did the right thing by taking him under your wing as much as you could. \n\nSome people are saying that they feel bad for your (soon to be ex-) husband because of the environment he was raised in, and I agree. While its likely that he could have been \"brainwashed\" to an extent by growing up in that home, and that's why he doesn't see the abuse as a problem, the fact is that he would have been in his late teens and early twenties for a lot of the abuse, and probably should have known better. Also, although a case could be made that the abuse in general wasn't his fault, the fact that he doesn't see anything wrong with that now worries me. Those views may have started to emerge in the attitudes he had toward parenting your own children, if you had stayed married. \n\nI think overall it was a very good idea for you to run and run away fast.

Also, please let him be where he's at with this. Of course he feels guilty about not being there for his mom- he was raised this way. It's what he knows, it's what he thought his life was. He is allowed to love and miss his family. They are his family. In time, at his own pace, he will tackle the contradictions of loving, and feeling indebted to, people who hurt him so badly. \n\nAgain, I know you and your family are acting out of love. But he is not a project, he's not broken, and you are not his savior. The more you can treat him like a capable, resilient, complex human being the more you will \"help\" him. Listen. Reflect back what you hear. Make sure he knows that *anything* he is feeling right now is normal and fine. Don't get angry *for* him. Don't get all weepy or indignant. That is not your place and you can't burden him with that. It's his story to define and he doesn't need to be worried about your feelings. Deal with them in your own therapy. \n\nHe is more than what has happened to him. It is probably good that he's no longer attempting to ignore it or accept it as normal. But you kind of catapulted him into this and it would be healthy for all of you if you can back off now, focus on your own life, and *be his friend.*\n\nAnd, good on your for dumping your ex!

The fact that he's gotten out, is accepting help, and working on himself means he's not broken. What he's doing takes a lot of strength.\n\nTelling an abuse victim that they're broken just further entrenches the idea that they're worthless and defines who he *is* by what *happened*. I know you mean well and it's gotta be really though to see someone you care about hurt that badly, but the best thing you can do for him is to treat him like a normal young adult who just needs some help. He doesn't need your pity, just compassion and support.\n\nBeyond just the way you talk about things, try re-framing the way you think about things as \"J is a person who was abused,\" instead of \"J is a broken boy.\" Idealizing him as a superhero isn't very helpful either.\n\nTry not to stress about him \"standing still\" in terms of the anxiety and depression. The fact that he's dealing with all of this really difficult, awful shit and not going catatonic is pretty good evidence that he's not just standing still in terms of his mental health. For a lot of people with anxiety, a \"bad day\" looks like not acknowledging the things that are terrifying and letting them slowly eat at you and destroy your life. People think it looks like constant panic, but your body and mind can't sustain that indefinitely and you'll eventually learn to cope by hiding from stress, even when it makes your situation worse. A \"good day\" is when you're facing your shit head on and still standing. If he's moved from one to the other, that is amazing progress.\n\nAlso, if you don't mind passing on a message to him, let him know that there's nothing wrong with taking time off of school to take care of your mental health. I took two years off after I got out of my abusive relationship (which was nowhere's near as extreme as what he went though) and spiraled into depression. The first year was spent just being depressed, but I used the second to really work on myself and my shit. I'm now back in school, finishing up my engineering degree, and I know I made the right choice. That year working on myself was just as, if not more, important than a year of college.\n\nThat said, for some people the best thing to do is to keep busy and living a \"normal\" life, so don't push him either way. Just make sure he knows that it is an option and that you'll support him either way.",

            "> sometimes I wonder how far he would have gone in life even now at 19 if **the animals** hadn't totally broken him.\n\nI have to say this since it may get lost in the shuffle of positive comments otherwise.  Remember your (ex) husband is the father of your children.  If you refer to him as \"an animal\", that makes your kids 1/2 animals themselves.  And using language like that in front of the kids might have a negative impact on them or your relationship with them.  You don't need to be super upbeat about the guy, but denigrating him around his own children won't end well for anyone.",
            "This whole story is terrible. The guy clearly is fucked up, the situation  is fucked up, and I can't think of a worse way of handling this than what this lady is trying to do. How the hell did the wife not know about this before now? Clearly, you should have never gotten married if this was as serious as you claim it to be. \n\nI don't absolve the guy, he is clearly in the wrong. He gew up in an abusive family, OF COURSE he will feel no remorse, its not a big deal to him. THAT needs to change, he is wrong. But if this is was situation where the guy was a drug addict because he grew up in a house of crackheads or if he was an alcoholic because his a parents were drunks, the response would be the same. Would you abandon anyone in a different situation? You are MARRIED (through thick and thin, good and bad) - yet the first reaction is to completely turn on him? Where is the attempt to help/remedy the situation? Where is your attempt to get this guy some help? The right course of action is to help the guy. Get him rehab, get him therapy, whatever. What does this woman want to do? Immediately leave him, threaten to take away everything from him, take his kids, and hope he goes to jail? Someone she is supposedly in love with just a few moments prior? How does this do anything but make the situation worse? \n\n\nFuck that. If I marry someone, you better believe i would first know every skeleton they have hiding before I make the commitment. If something comes up and she tells him something horrific, I wouldn't turn on them on a dime. I wouldnt abandon them and force them into a corner with threats. Fuck this lady. How can you love someone and commit your entire future to a person and thencompletely reverse course? This wasn't a marriage that was going to last anyway. \n\nIf she had made attempts to help, to address problems and try and be there for the man she supposedly was ready to spend her life with, and THEN he still feels nothing, ok - i get it. But this is her literal first reaction. This place is not helping anyone, all it does is stroke the ego and place each other on a high horse. Why even bother posting - you know what the response will be. \n\nI hope each and everyone of you that immediately jumped on board to praise her for divorce have nothing terrible about your past that comes up. If you do, then you apparently deserve being turned on and abandoned by someone you thought would be your partner for life, you deserve to have everything taken from and you should die alone and miserable. ",
            "So you broke up your marriage because of what he was accused of during their childhood? Wow, glad marriage is turning into a fad and not relevant if you find it inconvenient.\n\nFor better or worse, love and kids - all just words. This is unreal and all these people jumping tp tell to get divorced is hilarious. Good luck I guess lol",

We traveled to the west coast to see his family and he proposed to me there.\n\nMy issue is that the trip was awful. His family judged me and nit picked me the entire time (telling me I wasn\u2019t cleaning their house right or that we shouldn\u2019t drink when we wanted to have a glass of wine on vacation). \n\nThey had also offered their home as a place to stay while we were on vacation (and it\u2019s his parents so he accepted and we brought them gifts) since he really wanted us to visit anyways for the proposal which was a surprise, but they insisted on doing every single thing together. They don\u2019t like to go out for food or drinks, and we didn\u2019t get to do much sightseeing.\n\nAll in all, it was the kind of trip I consider something I do for my boyfriend, not the kind of trip I would have chosen to have a proposal on. Of course I was happy when he proposed to me, but it felt heavily tainted by his family and the fact that he totally kept mine in the dark (and refused to even tell them he was proposing which again I didn\u2019t know about).\n\nI really love this guy. He\u2019s caring and we\u2019ve built an entire life together over the last 6 years. I don\u2019t know what happened here because it\u2019s very unlike him, but I do know that he in theory wanted the proposal to be amazing, which is why he went through the trouble of planning and paying for the trip. It\u2019s just that for me, it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThis feels like it has tainted things for me. It\u2019s not that I really care about the proposal, but it feels like the start of our marriage was around all of this. How do I get past this on my own? I really don\u2019t want to bum him out more than I have (by expressing I wish my family was involved). I just have this constant anxiety over it that I need to somehow work through. \n\nTL:dr; boyfriend proposed on vacation to visit his family and the trip didn\u2019t go well. Now I can\u2019t stop feeling weird about it\n\nUPDATE: I spoke to him and he has agreed to try therapy. So, we have our first appointment next week. I\u2019m also making some lists of things I feel with the in-laws to try and identify boundaries I can set. Thank you all so much for your help! Will update how it goes.",

            "You just got a sneak preview of married life with your in laws. If his parents are nasty to both you and him, and he's not going to defend you or want to back off from visiting them, this needs to be taken into consideration.\n\nHow much have you two talked about marriage? Did he know it was important to you to have him talk to your family before proposing? \n\nIf this is giving you an icky feeling in your gut about actually marrying this person, you need to listen to that and deal with it. You need to talk to your fiance. You need to do pre-marital counseling (everyone should TBH). And you need to take note of how he handles these conversations; is he wanting to just stick his head in the sand, or actually talk about it and deal with it?",
            "IMO, you don't wish to bother him, but his family will be a huge issue throughout the marriage.  You won't have a good relationship with your in-laws.  So I think you need to talk to your fiance about this, because it's a large issue that could lead to breaking up.\n\nSo obviously he loves his parents, and he needs to take off his rose-colored glasses a bit.  He needs to realize that they've been kind of awful to you, and this won't work if they continue to be so.\n\n*Don't tell him what to do* about his parents / about the issue.  But pay attention, because if he doesn't immediately take your side and try to mediate with his parents / admonish them for judging you and picking on you / try to get them to like you more, then this relationship will not be \"amazing\".  \n\nSo that's the test.  Do discuss in detail how they judged you and picked on you, and how that made you feel, but present it from the point of view of \"I just want to let you know\" because he's your fiance.  Don't tell him what to do to \"fix\" the issue, but pay attention to how he reacts and to what he does.  Give him a few days, his reaction may not be immediate; it may take some time for the rose-colored glasses to come off and for him to feel awful about his parents.  But you are looking for the reaction where he takes your side, not his parents' side.\n\nGood luck, and congratulations by the way!",

This is where you find out if you can work through things together as a team and operate on the same page.\n\nSo far he has made the proposal all about him.  It was in a place that meant something to him, surrounded by his family.  *He* thinks it was amazing because it was what he wanted.  It sounds incredibly one-sided.",

In that moment, did you feel excitement, happiness, anxiety, dread?\n\nMy first fiance, I felt dread as soon as I realized he was proposing. He did it in a way that did not reflect me at all, and was much more of a grand romantic gesture. It was sweet, but not *me.* \n\nAs time went on with the engagement, and I got closer with him and his family, I kept feeling anxiety and putting off setting a date. Eventually I listened to my gut and left.\n\nI realized I didn't want my future kids to be anything like him or his family. I realized if someone treated a friend/sister/etc like my ex treated me I would tell her to leave. \n\n5 years and some therapy later, I  much happier and married to a man that takes me into consideration (not all of the time, nobody's perfect).",
            "This isn\u2019t a \u201che didn\u2019t propose exactly how I imagined\u201d bratty reaction. This is a monumental moment in your relationship being filled with red flags all at once and you feeling off because of it. So far I see:\n\n* Him considering himself more than you when planning the proposal. Not where you\u2019d want it to be. Not around people you\u2019d want to be there. Not including your loved ones in the planning process. Not doing things that you\u2019d want to do while on the trip.\n\n* Him not standing up to his parents\u2019 behavior. If he\u2019s not doing it now, he never will. If you don\u2019t like how these people treat you and he\u2019s close enough that you will be spending more than the occasional holiday with them, this does not bode well for the future.\n\n* Him not discussing marriage with you before the proposal. Proposing is not when you start talking about marriage. It\u2019s what you do after you have thought it through and decided it\u2019s something you want to move forward with. Have you discussed kids? Where you\u2019d live? Anything long term and concrete? If not, do you really know what you agreed to when you said yes?\n\nI would think long and hard about what you\u2019re signing up for here and remember that breaking an engagement is a lot easier than cancelling a wedding or divorcing.",
            "You need to talk with him about his family. If you marry him, you are going to.end up visiting them even more, and it will not be enjoyable for you. You should make it clear that for you visiting his family will always be an obligation, not a vacation for you and also make it clear that the way they treat you is not OK with you. I do t think it has to be a dealbreaker, but he needs to learn to put you first.",
            "To me, the bigger issue appears to be that he had his family all clued in on what was going on, and not yours, and that they still treated you guys like that. I don\u2019t think a proposal should determine how a marriage will end up being, because proposals get screwed up all the time. But, your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family didn\u2019t seem to have treated you, someone who is supposed to be a part of the family soon, very well. \n\nHave you spoken to your fianc\u00e9 about this? The proposal happened, it can\u2019t be changed now. But, if you still want to go through with marrying him you NEED to bring up how you felt about his family\u2019s treatment of you, and how uncomfortable the whole situation is. If he can\u2019t see that, might be time for some couple\u2019s counseling before proceeding with wedding planning. And this is something I would make non-negotiable, if he\u2019s opposed to therapy.",
            "My fianc\u00e9\u2019s proposal was god awful, and I actually mulled over it for 2 days to practice what I would say when I expressed my concerns to him. He even got me a ring that contains a metal I\u2019m highly allergic to. Everything that could\u2019ve gone wrong did. I then had the hard conversation with him. While he was initially infuriated and offended, he later thanked me for having the balls to tell him how I felt, and he apologized for the terribly planned proposal. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine holding in those concerns for the rest of my life. Now we are able to joke about it! And now we\u2019re looking into a replacement ring lol",
            "Boyfriends idea of a romantic proposal trip was to stay in his parents home and do all activities with them?  Serious enmeshment issues on his part.  And his parents behavior confirm the relationship with him is seriously abnormal.  Add that you were a target of their misbehavior as well.  You did not clean things correctly?  WTF you are a guest. His parents made your proposal vacation all about themselves and your boyfriend allowed it.\n\nHave a serious talk with boyfriend and ask him about his childhood, how his parents treated him and any other siblings.  Ask him how he sees his and your relationship with his parents in the future.  Are you both to be treated as independent adults, given respect and space to be yourselves?  Be aware that your fianc\u00e9 may not recognize his parents are overbearing and disrespectful, it is the only parental relationship he knows and he may not have a healthy example to compare it to.\n\nAsk him how he felt about the most recent trip and if he though it was appropriate that a recently engaged couple got no alone time and likely awkward adult time in his parents home. Ask him if he realizes his parents were awful to you. Ask him if he realizes his parents monopolized what should have been your engagement vacation and made it all about what they wanted.\n\nIt is the cliche but I suggest couples counseling and if fianc\u00e9 is needing and wanting it perhaps some individual counseling, he has some harsh upbringing to overcome.\n\nConsider not ever staying in his parents home again and developing strong boundaries with consequences when they overstep.  Not allowing wine in their own home is OK, attempting to keep you from having a glass of wine ever is not acceptable behavior.\n\nEDIT:  just read where your fianc\u00e9 refuses therapy.  Hard stop on the engagement.  This is your hill to die on.  If fiance cant or won\u2019t deal with managing his overbearing parents, won\u2019t develop boundaries and consequences, won\u2019t discuss how you and he build an independent life together then the marriage is doomed.

His family lives on the west coast, far enough away from your family that you had to vacation there. How were you expecting your family to be involved when they live so far away? He couldn't have both your family and his involved, he chose his because... it's his family, obvious reason. It's his proposal too, it's not just about you.

If they're part of a pattern of behavior, then definitely rethink accepting the proposal.\n\n* He should have asked your family and didn't. Is he generally respectful to your family? Is he frequently thoughtless, or oblivious to customs that are important to you?\n* He should have geared his proposal toward things that make you happy, not things that make him happy. Does he frequently do this? Do you get to do your favorite things with him, or just his?\n* He should have noticed that his family wasn't being nice to you. If you bring this up to him, does he take their side? Does he start criticizing you? \n* He should have noticed you weren't having a great trip and postponed his proposal plan. Does he notice when you're having a miserable time? Is he in tune with your emotions?\n\nIf none of these things are part of behavior patterns, you've got yourself a husband, a rocky start to your relationship with your in-laws, and an engagement story that someday will be funny.",

He proposed on the last possible weekend before I had to quit my job to move for him, at a Phish show. Also, he had our friends come out for a surprise party, which was 2/3 his friends and 1/3 my friends. The catch is that my friends are not into Phish, so I didn't get to spend much time with them because we had paid a lot of money for show tickets all nights. He also proposed with his mom's old, scratched, worn out piece of costume jewelry, and then couldn't understand why I didn't want to wait 8-12 months when it was the most convenient time for him to buy a real engagement ring. We are married now, and this man never bought me a ring. While the ring doesn't make the marriage, it was REALLY hurtful and I still feel bad about it. He didn't mean to hurt my feelings, but he sure did. \n\nAll in all, he did something he thought would be a good thing. He really really really tried. I have struggled lately to hold both things as true at once. He can both have done his best and tried really hard and it could also be not what you needed. Talk to him.

Since he didn't know that you'd want him to alert your family that he was planning to propose before the event, I wouldn't ding him for that but I *would* ding him on cutting off discussions about getting married before the engagement.

Getting married doesn't make a relationship better or worse. Trust your instinct and if you are feeling hesitation for rightnow trust that. It doesn't mean it all has to end but maybe just hold off on taking any more giant leaps forward. And whatever you do make sure its because you want to.

            "It sounds like both of you have a culture of having family way involved. Having family involved in a marriage proposal as you wished yours to be and as his was is a sign that you and he are not thinking about marriage as a thing between the two of you as adults that is strictly your business. He is not drawing appropriate boundaries with his family or protecting you from them. Maybe I\u2019m way off base, but I encourage you both to think a lot about stepping into your adult lives and taking charge of how you will love them separate from your parents. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love, honor, and respect your parents if they are good parents and ask for advice when you want it, but your major decisions and your marriage are between you.

            "As someone who just got out of a multi-year engagement to a man I probably shouldn't have said yes to....yikes. Red flags. \n\nAs someone below commented, the proposal should be a surprise - but the marriage shouldn't. That means not just the fact that you're getting married, but also the details of your life together. Are your expectations compatible? Does he expect you to stay home and raise kids while he works? Or vice versa? Does he even want kids? Do you? What are your expectations of what each of you will contribute in the relationship? You should have answers to all those questions before you marry, and they should be compatible. Otherwise it's a recipe for disaster. And it sounds like your relationship up to now, and the proposal itself, are indicative of the problems you'd have as a married couple. \n\nAnd, the hard part to accept about this is: you may love someone, and get along great outside of living together, but then crash and burn once you get serious, marry, and move in together. My fiance and I got along relatively well when we lived apart. Once he moved in, however, I ended up cleaning up after him nonstop. I had trouble getting him to pay his share of the rent. He refused to talk about finances even though they affected us both. He just did not want to have serious, difficult conversations about our future - one that affected us both. Thankfully, I'm out of that relationship now. I understand the investment you have, both emotional and the six years you spent building a life together.

Your fianc\u00e9 will eventually have to set some boundaries with how they speak/treat you or they will walk all over you/your marriage/your parenting.",
            "You need to talk with him about his parents, about the proposal, and about your future together since he would not allow that discussion before engagement.\n\nI would recommend that you have a series of conversations with him to both allow yourself time for reflection between the talks about what he says and to avoid overwhelming him or making him feel defensive as you bring up a series of potential problems.\n\nThe first thing I would do, if you have not already, is ask him something along the lines of \"How did you feel things went at your parents?\" Just gather information about his perspective, and feel free to ask follow up questions like \"Is that a normal interaction that you have with them?\" \"Have you stayed with them before on vacation? How did it go?\" \"Have you ever brought a girlfriend home to meet them before? How did they react?\" Not like an interrogation, but just try to really listen to what he says and ask follow up questions. If he asks you questions back about your experience you can answer them, just try to focus more on the interactions with his parents in this discussion than the planning of the proposal. After you feel that you understand what his perspective was you can either end the talk there and take some time to think about how you feel about what he said/what you would like to say, or you can immediately transition into describing your own feelings, opening with something like \"Thanks for letting me know about how you felt about it and some background. It was an unusual experience for me because... XYZ. There were times when I felt like I was not welcome, like ABC..\" Talk about your own experiences there, and give him time to reflect or the opportunity to react to see what he does/says. Hopefully that discussion leads to you feeling validated in your feelings (as opposed to him telling you that you are \"overreacting\" or \"ungrateful\" or \"too sensitive\" or \"reading into things\") and like he is in your corner (like he wants to make sure you don't feel that way again, be it standing up for you more in the future or minimizing contact with his family.)\n\nThat discussion would probably at least add nuance to your feelings about the plans he made for the proposal. If he expected the problems but did not care that says something different than if he did not expect them or notice them/your unhappiness, which again says something different than if he did not expect the problems, but noticed them and did not know how to back out of the plans he had already made and still wanted to propose. Reflect on the prior discussion(s) before broaching this topic, but assuming that he validated your feelings about his parents then it should not be hard to start this discussion with something along the lines of \"I really love you - you are caring and we've built an entire life together over the last 6 years. I know you went through a lot of trouble planning and paying for the trip, but given what I was experiencing with your family, it was a very hard moment for me to receive a proposal from you.\" See if you can cover the ground of your own family's involvement (but reflect first, would you actually want your own family involved, or did you just not like that it was unbalanced favoring his family?). The goal here is to help him see the proposal through your eyes while letting him know that you do not vilify him for it. The approach should also be collaborative - Is there a way that you can plan an engagement party near your family, social distancing permitting? Or a fresh proposal trip with just the two of you? Or maybe just sitting down and making lists of all of the reasons you both want to marry each other and reading them to each other in the privacy of your own home? There is no right/wrong answer here. The thing is that you both have the right to communicate your feelings, and both of your feelings have the right to be respected.\n\nFinally, he has been putting off discussion of things until you are engaged. Okay, now you are engaged. Now is the time to look up lists of things that should be discussed prior to marriage. You need to let him know that you both will be working through those lists to make sure that you align on what you want out of the marriage and that you will not get married before that work is done. That is a very reasonable boundary to set, and it is super important. Don't let him move the goal post to \"we will talk about it when we are actually married.\" Sure, you can get divorced if it does not work out, but divorce is a legal hassle on top of a breakup. If he is trying to hide a dealbreaker (or who knows, maybe you have a dealbreaker that he does not know about!) then getting married makes it more \"expensive\" to break the deal and thus more likely that you will accept something that would have been unacceptable before. Just don't. The fact is that these talks need to happen if you are still interested in marrying him. He would not be doing you a favor by taking the time to talk these things out, so don't allow the fact that you are having the discussion at your behest to count as a compromise that he has already made on the subject at hand (ex: He wants four kids and you want one, he drops to three and you go up to two, but it does not look easy to move forward from there and so he says \"look, we are only having this talk because of you, and you have already got me to say that I will accept having only three kids, what more do you want?\" as if the very fact that he has to compromise is a compromise, while your compromise is something you offered by initiating the talk.)\n\nAnyway, good luck, it sounds like you have a lot to work through. Should you stay engaged with him I can see you needing to post some follow up questions here. Remember: Your feelings are valid. It is not just okay, but healthy to have boundaries. A healthy relationship generally features clear communication. You need to know what a marriage will look like in order to know if you are interested in entering into it.",
            "\" I really dont want to bum him out more than u have (by expressing i wished my family was involved)\"\nYou expressed your feelings and you don't have to hide how you feel about his family if they make you feel disrespected. He's bummed out? what about you? how come he doesn't care how you feel on this trip?\n\nI personaly think proposal isn't something to be taken extremy serriously, but the way his family made you feel should be of his concern. your family matters too and if you feel like they've been left out, talk to him about it. maybe carefully tell him that you apreciate his work for this trip, but point out the things that madr you feel weird.",

            "I'll share something that might help you.  After I graduated from college I was accepted into a rigorous medical doctorate degree program that had me about three hours from the college I graduated from and my girlfriend.  We did long distance for a couple of years where I got to see my girlfriend about once every two months.  I was ready to propose and she was about to graduate from college so I thought the timing was right for us.  I planned a trip to our home town during Thanksgiving.  I only had a few days there but wanted to propose on Thanksgiving because I was so thankful for her.   Cheesy I know.  I arranged the proposal and proposed to her in a special spot that took a good bit of walking through a rural wooded area to get to.  I had asked her father and mother for their blessing and told them I wanted to marry their daughter.  They were excited and really encouraging.  They are the best in laws anyone could ask for. But my girlfriend picked up on their excitement and put together that I was preparing to propose.  So she didn't tell anyone that she felt terrible and that she was running a fever.  She had the flu. She felt terrible while I walked with her to the proposal spot.  She wanted to go home a go to bed.  She hurt all over. She didn't want me to know that she felt bad.  So I proposed and she said yes. Then she said to take her home and that she felt very sick.  So I took her home where her family had gathered to celebrate our engagement and my wife walked through and says hello to everyone and then went to bed where she felt terrible for about a week.  I had to go back to my doctorate program after a couple of days.  So my proposal didn't feel magical or really great for either of us.  I felt bad for dragging her to the proposal spot and the timing was bad for her.  She felt awful because she couldn't spend any time with me after we were engaged and felt bad that I had to entertain her family that gathered while she went to bed.  We got married the next year and have been together for over twenty five years. \n\nThe proposal matters only a very little bit on the story of your lives together.  Don't allow his family to continue to have that kind of control of your thoughts.  Now you should be excited planning your future and hopefully his family won't be a big part of that future.  My family is toxic and that's why they aren't part of my story.",

If their family \"micro-aggresses\" towards you, like a little snippy comment, they need to be the ones to say \"hey, that's not acceptable behavior.\" Their pushback needs to be immediate, and they need to make it crystal clear that the two of you are a team. They have to have your back first and foremost, and you have to have theirs.

It sounds like the vacation was to show you off to them for approval more than a vacation for you two to remember. And it sounds like he just defaulted into a super passive mode where his parents dictated everything about your \"vacation\".\n\nWhat is troubling is that he is either 1) ignorant to how you would perceive this and couldn't predict/see how things would go or 2) Didn't care enough to not be passive to it even if it did bother you. Either way has it's own problems for the future.\n\nI'm further confused that you mention that he has apologized, but did he offer any insight or explanation? Did he notice at all during the time that you were uncomfortable? Did you express that you were while you were out there? Did he explain what he had planned in his mind and was it different than what happened?\nThere's just so many questions that should be addressed and it seems like you both might not be confrontational enough to get through it.

            "His family is a bigger issue than the proposal situation. \n\nSo long as they live pretty far away, then you know they won't be a constant issue. Never agree to live closer to them. But did he stand up for you at all? Is he understanding about it being a bad trip for you?\n\nAs for the proposal, express to him that his family made you feel bad on that trip. \n\nI asked my fiance to plan something more romantic because he proposed right as we finished having sex in the bedroom hahaha. I said yes and it was emotionally romantic, but a couple of days later I felt a bit weird that I didn't get a planned romantic thing. The quarantine stuff meant that we could not travel to a nice spot to do a picnic or anything. The ring was burning a hole in his pocket so he proposed when we had a nice normal connected day at home. But I still felt a bit like... hey, where are the candles, where's the effort? So I mentioned that I felt sad about it but blamed it on the quarantine. But then I said, but there are lots of things soneone could do at home to make it romantic with the bells and whistles.. I just... thought it might be like that. He explained that he had another bigger plan which was totally cancelled due to restrictions, that he considered doing something romantic at home, but thought it'd be even more lame to do something in our crappy back yard or loungeroom. I said no I would have thought that was really cute. His plan was propose before it could be too late (we were going through a lot of shit and scary health issues etc) and then go somewhere really nice when things re open. I said it's the thought and effort that counts and I would have liked sonething cute and special at home. \n\nSo a couple of days later, I slept in and when I woke up, he asked me to come to the loungeroom and he'd totally rearranged it, got furniture from downstairs, put candles and fairy lights everywhere and had cooked breakfast like a restaurant. Even though I hinted at doing something, he had told me quarantine was easing so he will plan for us to go somewhere soon, so I believed that. So when he did all of that, it was truly a surprise again. He proposed again with the ring because he was holding onto it as it needed to be made smaller before I could wear it. \n\nI thought a re-do would be shitty but it was really cute and romantic. It also showed me that he will always listen to me and adapt for me because he cares. I mean let's face it - you want a proposal to be a surprise and men aren't always the greatest at romance/aesthetics/specific things that women care about for a romantic scene. Men tend to view romance as how you're feeling towards each other and forget about the candles and the random things. So even the best guy can fumble up a proposal. \n\nBut I'd be super super concerned that he's not standing up to his family, letting you clean their house etc. When we stayed with my fiances family, of course I cleaned up after us and offered to help with more, but his mum said no it's fine and my fiance did the extra stuff himself and told me to go relax.",
            ">How do I get past this on my own? I really don\u2019t want to bum him out more than I have\n\nThis alone shows you are not ready to be marrying this guy. I'm not saying break up but you should be with someone you can be you full authentic self with. Don't marry someone if you don't feel like you can have a productive conversation about how he hurt your feelings. How can you vow to love someone for better or for worse if you can't resolve when you hurt each other.",

I was pissed. \n\nHis family can be, to put it kindly, extremely challenging. And his folks being out here was the first time his parents and my parents were meeting. It was a high stress situation for me as I wanted it to go well and be good for everyone. I didn\u2019t know that they were all out to dinner with us for the proposal so it all ended up making sense but I won\u2019t lie, it was stressful hosting and worrying about if our families would click. \n\nHowever I will say, he and I working through the challenges presented us by his family have been a huge and wonderful opportunity for us to grow as a couple. We\u2019ve had a lot of really frank, honest, and fruitful conversations that have come from issues regarding his family. He has demonstrated to me that he listens to me so well. He\u2019s shown so much strength in standing up to his mom and setting boundaries on my behalf in a caring and loving way. All in all, this challenge has been an incredible learning journey for us and I have zero regrets about entering this family.
