Then he asked me what the lobster thing was- he thought I'd tried to make him lobster but I explained the Friends quote and he said it was a good thing I was pretty. \n\nAnyway, I asked him if we need to make an announcement or anything but we agreed that we wouldn't say anything unless people brought it up or we need to introduce each other. Alan also said, he liked the term partner better than boyfriend and I agreed, it does sound more serious but I guess that's what this is.\n\nTLDR: Made him dinner, the actually dinner part didn't go so well but the talk did and we're \"official\". Thanks for the suggestions people, I'll be back if I need proposal ideas.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold! You guys are amazing! ",

            "You know, you're story is extremely similar to how my SO and I started dating. We had a FWB relationship for a few months while she was too afraid of commitment and didn't have romantic feelings for me. \n\nWell, after 3 months of living together and 6 months of casual sex, she ended up developing them. At that point, I was head over heels in love with her, and I had been honest with her about that. She actually broke it off a few times because she didn't want to hurt me! \n\nWe started dating because she was in the ER(I drove her) and a nurse asked us what my relation to her was and at the same time I answered \"roommate\" she said \"girlfriend.\" It threw me off super hard, and later that night I brought it up, and she admitted that we were practically dating already, as we both had never been with anyone else during our FWB relationship, and so we started dating. A year and a half later, and we're still together. Best of luck to you and Alan!",

Been divorced twice and have only been with 3 women in my life. I'm 38. It's been a year since I had sex and I never look for it. She made me feel so comfortable and relaxed that I can see how easy it is to fall in love. With that being said she left for Washington this morning (I live in Louisiana) but realized we sort of have feelings for each other. We promised to keep it just friendly and hang out when she gets back. Long story short, this story makes me feel that there is hope after being broken so many times.",

            "The answer is: you DON'T ask him.\n\nGirls are the ones who need to put a label on everything. As a woman, I will have to say it's annoying and pointless. I have never asked this question about \"what are we\" because it just shows a lack of appreciation for the actual relationship, like being with the love of your life but rejecting their proposal because they can't afford a big ring. Who the fuck cares about this shit? Guys are more go-with-the-flow, and don't like to be pressured into something. This is why I just don't have \"the talk\". What the hell is the point? If he's spending a lot of time with you, and you're happy, why the fuck do you need to call it something? Just enjoy his company, stop worrying about what you want society to think you guys are, which is what these labels are really for. So OTHER people can know. This whole story you just told makes me feel like you overthink a lot and are a little high maintenance.\n\nEDIT: But also, I'm glad it went well. It really usually doesn't, and it's good that he actually likes you and wants to commit. Good luck, I wish you both the best. ",

Last night, during a conversation about our future, he disclosed that he would never marry someone that didn't believe in God. He is Muslim and, although I grew up in an extremely religious family (i.e. cult), I am an atheist. Although I'm not sure if I want to ever get married or have children (both of my parents have married 3+ times), I do want a long term partnership. BF admitted that he would not be willing to be in a long term relationship without eventually getting married. Which obviously will not happen with me. \n\nI really love my boyfriend and thought we were in this for the long haul. I actually quite love his commitment to his religion as well, because I ask too many questions to have that type of faith. However, I'm now feeling like a bit of a placeholder until someone \"suitable\" comes along. Is it time to jump ship?\n\nTL;DR: Religious BF admitted he will never marry me because of my lack of belief in a higher power. Should I leave?",

            "Hi OP! Here's a really long story about the time this exact thing happened to my best friend. Spoiler: It ruined her fucking life. \n\nBasically she dated a Muslim guy for a few years, and then one day he dropped the bomb that he would never marry her. But it wasn't a breakup... just \"information.\" She stayed with him a while longer and it absolutely KILLED her self esteem. She kind of rotated between \"he can't really be serious otherwise he'd break up with me, so maybe if I change all these things about myself we can be happy\" and \"he's been using me for these last few years and never loved me, so I guess I am pretty unlovable, and I guess this is probably the best I'll ever do.\" \n\nHe then strung her along for THREE FUCKING YEARS, just like he'd been secretly doing for the first two. But now that everything was out in the open, he'd throw in tidbits about kids and moving back home and all sorts of bullshit that seemed like he was imagining a future with my friend, but if she asked him point blank about it he'd gently remind her that she was just a placeholder, but a placeholder he cared for very much. \n\nEventually he moved back home and got set up with a girl, but he kept texting her and calling her and making plans to see her that always somehow fell through. My friend was *destroyed.* The way that he treated her as a placeholder like it was a *completely reasonable thing* convinced her that she was completely worthless and therefore deserved this. \n\nThere isn't really a happy ending. It's five years later and now she's dating another Muslim guy, because as far as I can tell she's trying to redo the first relationship but have it come out *right* this time. But because she feels like she's completely worthless, this guy is also a piece of shit, just in different ways. She's desperately unhappy, consumed with anxiety, just turned 35, and is starting to get worried about having kids. She used to be *so fucking cool.*\n\nSo like I get that my friend is pretty much the worst case scenario, but this is a road that nobody should ever consider starting down.",

If I just based things on what I felt his comments to mean, I would have been wrong even though his comments were very explicit. If he really doesn't see a future with you, it'll help for closure to hear it directly rather than to wonder if you were right. \"I don't see us working long term\" is pretty easy to remind yourself you made the right decision in leaving.",

            "I'm not seeing this in any of the comments so I'm going to put it here just to add perspective. \n\nYes he's telling you that he won't marry you - but what he's also indirectly saying is your only chance to be with him long term is by converting to Islam. Religion is and should be a personal choice - whatever you choose to do should be because you believe in that choice and never solely to be with a man. I've known Muslim men who have stated quite clearly they won't marry a woman who doesn't believe in God and I think it's usually because they're trying to scare them into \"converting\" (even if it's only in name) because it appeases their conscience that they did the \"right thing\" by marrying a woman who is Muslim and if she's lying about her faith, well, \"that's on her.\" \n\nIt's bullshit and anyone who does this ends up miserable and the marriage doesn't work out. \n\nMy short answer is to agree with everyone else. Get out of this relationship because if he's using you as a placeholder he's a hypocritical jerk and if he's trying to set a condition on what it takes to be married to him he's a manipulative hypocritical jerk. \n\nNot a great choice either way.

I broke up with her the same day. I won't be treated that way by a religious bigot and why waste time?",
            "You know the answer to your question. It\u2019s hard, but leaving now will allow you both to lead happier lives with someone who shares the same ideals as you. You can find someone who wants a long term partnership without marriage, and he can find his future wife.

Had a very religious upbringing but I couldn't keep up with it and it's actually one of the reasons I don't date seriously religious guys. \n\nHowever in my family/Muslim community there are quite a few people who refuse to marry unless their partner converts to Islam. So he could be hinting at you to convert rather than shoving you off entirelyl. That being said it's your choice and I mean, in Islam it is actually not permitted to have premarital sex so if you guys are doing that technically I dont know what grounds he has to be hypocritical.",

I left him after being with him for 4 years. 6 months later he came back to me and had realized that he wanted to be with me and get married so we did. We have been married now for 7 years.

            "He doesn't respect you. Move on.",
            "There are so many red flags here between both of you.\n\n1. You don't even know if you want to get married or have kids. He's *Muslim* and that means he most likely needs to get married to be with you full-time, in the long-term. And having kids is a big thing in his religion, so most of the men who adhere to it do want kids. You two want different things. Also, you should probably start going to therapy to figure out your root issues with marriage, because it sounds like you're putting it on your parents rather than making a decision based on your own needs.\n2. You see religion as a cult and are an Atheist, and he associates with a religion. There is already a problem here. If you just said you didn't believe in a religion, fair enough, but to call it a \"cult\" when he disagrees is an issue. Also, if you were agnostic, maybe, but Atheism is quite far off the other way. It's different if there's mutual respect, but sounds like both of you have issues with it. \n3. He's a Muslim man, and while a lot of them will date non-Muslim girls, they usually want to marry a girl who is either converting into it or a girl who's already a Muslim. A lot of men will also try to sway their non-Muslim partner into believing in it, whereas Muslim girls who choose a man of another faith are far less likely to do this.\n\nYou two are not compatible, and that's okay. Just end it.",
            "> BF admitted that he would not be willing to be in a long term relationship without eventually getting married. \n\nSo why is he in one with you?",
            "> Should I leave? \n\nYes.  At this point, he's told you what one of his big criteria for a longterm committed relationship is and it doesn't sound like you're it. I agree with others that it sucks he took two YEARS to tell you this, but now that he's told you, it's time for you to move on and find someone with whom you are compatible for the type of relationship you want.  It's not him unless you plan on changing something that seems fundamental to who you are (as it sounds like he's not planning to change). Think fondly on the time you've spent with him, but move on.  It's better for both of you in the long run.",
            "> I'm now feeling like a bit of a placeholder until someone \"suitable\" comes along. \n\nSadly, this is exactly what you are. He's told you this.\n\nShould you end the relationship? That's your call, but realize he is almost certainly not going to change his mind. He's been with you for 2 years & knows he's not going to marry you. If that was going to change, it would have by now. \n\nSo, if you stay with him you need to accept:\n\n* He will leave you as soon as he decides he wants to get serious and marry. And it will not mean much to him, he does not love you as much as you love him. He likes you company & the role you're playing for him, but as soon as he wants to get married, he will discard you without too much bother on his part.\n* You cannot build anything long term with him (no shared ownership of a house, no children, no pets etc.) - because he **is** going to leave you at some point. \n\nYou certainly can stay with him if you accept those things. That''s fine if it works for you. But realize that you're spending **your** time. He's losing nothing by being with you till he finds his marriage partner, as a man in his religion, his opportunities for finding a bride don't change with age, he could marry an 18 yr old tomorrow. All he'd need to do is go to his go to his imam or parents & announce his intention to marry and ask for help finding a bride. You're spending time with him you could be looking for a good long-term fit, which is what you actually want, and your opportunities get harder to find as you get older (unfortunate reality for women). \n\nIf that risk is acceptable for you and you're getting enough personal gratification out of the arrangement as it is, then by all means keep enjoying it as long as he allows it to continue. You're not wrong if it's ok for you. \n\nBy giving you this information hes allowing you to make the choice and prepare to detach from him with as little pain as possible when he's done with you. Do not fall for the attractive idea that if you just love him enough etc he will change his mind... that is a trap. It doesn't work like that. He's clearly a man of strong convictions, convictions stronger than his feelings for you. Do not think he'll change his mind for you, ***you're replaceable***.\n\nIf you want a long term relationship which you feel secure in and can fully invest your time & emotional energy into bonding & love & building an intertwined life... then this guy is not for you. \n\nWishing you the best, whichever you choose.",

Staying with him and believing I could change his mind was like picking a scab over and over until it left a horrible scar. 7 years later and I still have flashbacks (today, even) about how stupid I was, how much time I wasted and it haunts me."

I apologized if what I said misled her into thinking it was okay for her to propose to me.\n\nI listed my timeline. I said I'd like to be engaged around the time I graduated university and I wanted to get married the same year. I mentioned I was open to having children with her.\n\nI gave Sarah the letter when she came home from work. She read it and we had a discussion about everything over dinner.  \n\nMy girlfriend apologized for mistaking my words as a green light for her to propose. She expressed regret for withdrawing physical intimacy and distancing herself from me for 3 weeks. \n\nSarah explained to me how she never wanted kids or marriage at the beginning of our relationship, but seeing all her friends get married made her question that. My girlfriend realized she wasn't content anymore on staying child free and not getting married for the rest of her life. \n\nMy girlfriend told me my timeline was acceptable for her. Sarah asked if I could be the one to propose to her this time - I told her I would. I\u2019ve never seen my girlfriend so giddy with excitement before.\n\nI\u2019m glad we could come to a happy solution. I\u2019m excited to spend the rest of my life with this woman.

I know I\u2019m young to get married, but I\u2019m absolutely ecstatic to start a family with my girlfriend. \n\nOur relationship is back to normal, we have sex everyday and she\u2019s comfortable initiating with me again. She doesn\u2019t cry in secret anymore and we\u2019re back to our regular levels of physical intimacy. \n\nI deeply regret rejecting her proposal because in reality this is what I wanted the whole time. I just needed a few days to seriously think about it. I'm glad my girlfriend has forgiven me for this. I know both of us are equally at fault because of our lack of communication but it really did suck having to reject her. \n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** I wrote a letter to my girlfriend explaining to her when I\u2019d like to get married and that I was open to having children with her.

            ">I've made up my mind. I want to marry this woman. I appreciate your concern for me. I'm obviously hoping that this works out and we're still together many years down the line.\n\nOP, the advice people are giving you is reasonable and good, and make no mistake you should take it into account as it does provide you with some level of insight into future events.\n\nHowever, there's always going to be some statistic about how people's brains or personalities continue to change well into their 90's or whatever. Someone with an anecdote about how they thought they would be with their partner forever at one point but then people change, things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, life happens.... \n\nThese things are all true. The person you are now may not be the person you are 5 years from now, and 10 years from now you may not be *that* person either. But putting off your life, waiting until you reach that point of equilibrium or stasis is going to have you waiting forever. The reality is you can only guard against future mistakes so much. You do what you can to prepare yourself, aware yourself of common obstacles etc, but at some point you just have to pull the trigger and let the chips fall where they may. \n\nSure, there are plenty of people who got married young and it didn't work out, there are also plenty of people who did the same and are together 50 years later.\n\nSo good luck.\n\n*Side note: if you're in the U.S. you have about a 50/50 chance of being in the former category. Personally I prefer better odds, but that's a discussion for another thread.",
            ">I mentioned I was open to having children with her if that\u2019s what she wanted.\n\nSo you don\u2019t really want kids, but you\u2019ll have them just to keep her happy ?  I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s a terrible reason to have kids.  \n\nYou are 21.  Your GF is six years older than you at 27, and has only a finite amount of time to have kids.  Of course her hitching her wagon to a 21-year-old when she wants to have kids isn\u2019t the smartest idea, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.  What I\u2019m getting at is, don\u2019t stay with her just because you don\u2019t want to break up, don\u2019t get married just because of pressure, and don\u2019t have kids just because she wants them and you don\u2019t want to lose her.  Making all these choices because of what *other people want* and not because of what *you want* is a perfect recipe for resentment later on.\n\nThe person you are now at 21 is not going to be the same person you will be at 25, or 30.  Meantime she is 6 years older than you and her bio clock is ticking.  Please just move forward cautiously and don\u2019t commit to things for the wrong reasons, ok ?

Making a promise this specific is basically like proposing already, in her eyes - and if you find yourself needing to change your mind, you could really mess with her timeline for having kids.\n\nThink twice, honestly. She's putting a lot of eggs in this basket, pardon the pun. If you need the room to change - and you probably do - that's the situation she needs to realize she's in. Right now it just seems like you said exactly what you needed to in order to get the sex-tap turned back on.",

            "/u/InTheYearOfTheLord, I know you don't want to hear this and I know you likely won't listen, but please be careful. Please just read my story and see for yourself.\n\nI was in my first real adult, long-term relationship (meaning living together) in college too. My partner and I were only a year apart in age and we got together in college. We were madly in love, lived together, and talked about marriage and kids and all that good stuff and we were both on the same page. By 21, **I knew I wanted to be with this person for the rest of my life and couldn't picture being with anyone else.** Time continued to pass and life was pretty damn good. My partner graduated undergrad and then started law school. We moved to the city where the law school was and life continued on. I was working and my partner was in law school and also had an internship at a law firm. We were just living two completely different lives and eventually grew apart and broke up when I was about 26 years old. I thought my world couldn't exist without my partner and I thought we would get married and start a family, but it didnt end up happening. I'm still here and after a few years of being single, I've moved on. I still have a special place in my heart for my first real adult relationship, but I'm no longer in love with that person and have moved on.\n\nMy point is that we do so much growing and changing during our twenties (and even into our thirties) that although you're in love now, things can and will change after you graduate college and throughout your twenties, especially after you start working a regular job. If you want to get married that's your choice but please wait to get married or even start trying to have children until your late twenties. That way you can grow and learn about yourself. \n\nEither way, I wish you the best. You sound like a great dude.",

            "Just to give you something positive, because of all those saying you are too young or the age gap to large. My dad met and fell in love with my stepmom, she was 20 and he was 30. He was very concerned about the age difference at first, but love won. She was only 22 when they married, yet they are one of the most incredibly happy couples I\u2019ve ever seen, and have been for nearly 20 years now. I am only 2 years younger than my husband, but I was 18 when we met and quickly fell in love. I was 21 (and one week, exactly) when we married. We have been very happily married 12 years, together for 15, and are still going strong. We also have a 9 year old son. So it can and does work, you seem much more mature than others your age. As long as you are willing to work together through life\u2019s ups and downs, then you should have a happy life together!",

Many of us (myself included) tend to gravitate towards long-term commitment from our late 20's and onward. \n\nI'm glad things worked out for you both, though. At least you are being smarter than I was at your age. I got engaged at age 21 and found out within a year that my then-fiancee was a violent alcoholic kleptomaniac who ended up diving head-first into meth. She's spent the last decade in and out of jail for various charges.",
            "If y\u2019all are happy I genuinely hope it works out! 22 and setting a timeline to be married is so alien to me though.

Everyone is so negative and the gut reaction is \"dump him/her\" even when there is evidence of good communication skills and the people in the relationship love eachother and are happy. People are always saying that people are so young and it will never work out, oh no the age difference etc yet i constantly see people who got together young or at different ages staying together so it can't be that uncommon. You guys think you are fucking relationship gurus but most of the time you are making conclusions about an entire relationship using one post that explains one issue and using highly emotional reasoning.

            "Did she try to physically gift you something in her proposal?\n\nI proposed to my now husband with a personalized Christmas ornament (it said \"will you marry me?\"). He told me it was too soon and that even if it was the right time, he really wanted to do the asking. He later asked for the ornament back. Since I offered it unconditionally, I felt like if he wanted it he should have it. Much later he got down on one knee with the ornament and a ring. And I could've given a shit about the ring. \n\nGetting the ornament back was much more meaningful. I felt so shitty when he turned me down originally. But when he gave the gift back it was an acknowledgement that even though he couldn't say yes then, he was saying yes now. \n\nIf she offered a physical gift, ask if you can hold onto it. If she presses, let her know that you want to return it to her when you're ready for the commitment she currently wants and you are looking forward to. ",
            "I\u2019m surprised by some of these responses. I\u2019m glad you two got back on the same page. Marriage is a big step, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think about it plenty before you actually get engaged. And that is great. I think you did an excellent job handling this and it speaks to your maturity. Don\u2019t let the people naysaying your decision get to you. We only know part of the story. You know all of it and you know yourself. If this is what you want, go for it and give it your all. ",
            "Just wanted to say, screw all the naysayers. I'm in a relationship currently with a much larger age difference than you two, with a younger  man -and cringing at all these people calling her a creep. I can't imagine what they'd think of my situation, but I never went looking for my guy - he pursued me, while we initially were just friends and artistic collaborators. If you're happy, you're happy, and people mature at such vastly different rates. My previous relationship was literally twice his age but half his maturity, and I've had similar maturity gaps with other men around that age so screw it! If you guys make each other happy that's what matters, and hey, even if it doesn't last forever, isn't a few happy years with someone better than a lifetime of sadness/settling? I'm trying for the former and if it turns into forever - bonus. But people put way too much weight into the future sometimes and not enough into the present. The present is all we truly have. I wish you two all the happiness in the world!!",
            "Good for you. And don't listen to all the people saying you're too young \u2013 you're almost 22. It's on the younger side, but you're not a kid any more and you're entitled to make these decisions for yourself. I got engaged at 24 and married at 25 and definitely made the right choice.",
            "You're more mature than most people at 31! Good job :) And, while I'll mention that I changed a LOT between 21 and even 25, I am still changing and growing, and that doesn't mean that you're too young to gt married. With your ability to calmly communicate when hurt (and she seems to be good at it too, though I understand it can take time to put your thoughts together and communicate them well) I think if you both want it it'll work.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "Congratulations you've figured it out! I don't think it was your fault. Sure she misinterpreted that and sure it sucks to get rejected, but you told her your timeline and talked about this and that's the most important thing. Communication is indeed the key to a happy and working relationship.",

            "> My girlfriend apologized for mistaking my words as a green light for her to propose. She expressed regret for withdrawing physical intimacy and distancing herself from me.\n\nWow. You've really done a number on your girlfriend, haven't you? You twisted her up to the point that she apologized for asking you, the man she wants to marry, to marry her, and for having exactly the reaction you would expect someone to have after being told they aren't marriage material. To be clear: nothing she did is apology worthy. \n\nIt was perfectly ok for her to propose to you. That's what you do when you want to marry someone and they have agreed that marriage is in the cards. Your wording definitely indicates that you don't understand that.  Let me repeat: it was ok for her to propose to you.\n\nWhile it may not have been ideal for you, people, not just women, tend to withdraw sexually when they've been rejected. A rejected marriage proposal is about the biggest rejection you can give someone. If you seriously thought you could turn down a proposal and have the relationship remain unchanged, well, I guess you are only 21 and are accordingly dumb. If you haven't learned your lesson, let me spell it out: You cannot reject a marriage proposal and expect to keep getting the same level of nooky. You're lucky she didn't break up with you completely.\n\nI'm glad you worked things out and settled on a timeline. Use that time to mature a little. A therapist will be able to help you see the effects of your words on your SO and what to reasonably anticipate during adult relationships.",
            "In regards to people in this thread or the previous one scrutinizing the ages and/or age gap, I gotta say that although they are correct in terms of people developing differently and typically being in different places at 18 vs 21, 23, etc., it\u2019s such dog shit to paint an individual relationship with the broad strokes of one\u2019s own personal experiencing in judging it. \n\nI\u2019m in a 6-year-strong relationship and we met when I was 23 and she was 18. I felt a little \u201ccreepy\u201d at first but I realized that was only because of shitty people on Reddit saying stuff like \u201cthat\u2019s creepy.\u201d There were definitely indicators of our difference in growth as people, but we\u2019ve both grown in a convergent direction since. \n\nSo good on you OP. And to all you judgmental folks who clearly have no interest in the health or improvement of OP\u2019s situation but would rather instill him with some sense of wrong over the age/growth difference, you should really open up to other people\u2019s experiences and realize maybe you\u2019re the one who\u2019s wrong despite your own experience telling you otherwise.

        "selftext": "So my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4tia40/i_30m_made_a_huge_mistakeoversight_and_really/) didn't get a lot of attention, but I did get a bunch of hurtful truths that I needed to hear, and some good advice. I figured now that the honeymoon is over I should probably do an update.\n\nThe TL;DR version was that through a huge error, I accidentally left my cousin Molly out of the invites for my rehearsal dinner, while inviting all of my other cousins, making me and asshole, and hurting her feelings.\n\nAnyways, on to the update.\n\nI was still trying to figure out how to apologize to Molly for my oversight and make it up to her. I had pretty much decided to grovel at her feet, and had planned to give up my plate at the rehearsal so she could come and eat and not be left out, and was bouncing ideas off of my fiancee on maybe taking Molly out for lunch a few times after we got back from our honeymoon, because I really did want to repair the relationship.\n\nAnyways, I was out running some last minute errands on Wednesday (had to pick up the tux) and when I came home, I found my fiancee sitting on the sofa, chatting with Molly like they were old friends. (They had only met on Monday at the family get-together my parents threw.)\n\nMy fiancee (let's call her Emily) stood up and said \"So I told Molly the truth about the rehearsal dinner, and that when I was going through the guest list to bring the numbers down, I didn't recognize her name, and didn't realize she was your cousin.\"\n\nEmily had gone behind my back, called Molly and invited her over to explain why she didn't get an invitation, took the blame and told her how bad I felt when I realized it the other day. She even told Molly the truth about me planning on inviting her anyways and giving up my plate, because I didn't want to hurt our relationship.\n\nShe had apparently also called the venue and (in her own words) \"went bridezilla\" to get Molly a seat. (Emily is the most chill person I've ever met, so her going anything-zilla must have been huge, and I'm almost sorry I missed it.)\n\nShe also invited Molly to go with her and her bridesmaids when they went to go get their hair/nails done as an apology for \"her screwup.\"\n\nGuys, if I didn't already have a whole wedding planned, I would have eloped with her on the spot.\n\nMolly gave me a hug and told me she appreciated me being willing to give up my plate at my own rehearsal dinner, but to \"quit being such a whiner\" and enjoy my wedding.\n\nSo the rehearsal and brunch went great, and I was really glad to have the whole family there, and was finally able to enjoy myself. Molly didn't end up going with Emily and her bridal party because she didn't want to intrude, but was grateful for the invitation.\n\nThe wedding went perfect, I married the most awesome person in the world and we all had a blast at the reception. I did end up confessing to Molly towards the end of the reception because part of me still felt guilty.\n\nThe only thing she asked was if the \"Blame Emily\" thing was Emily's idea. I told her it was and I had no idea she was going to do it, but I was serious about giving up my plate to make sure she could still come.\n\nShe actually laughed at me and told me I was an idiot, but I'd picked a good one. Anyways, she forgave me completely, even though I don't really deserve it. I asked her if she was coming to the after-party (yes, we had an after-party for our wedding reception after the \"adults\" and \"younger kids\" went home) at our apartment. She said Emily had already invited her and she wouldn't miss it. (Which she didn't. We all hung out, drinking and playing board games until about 4am. She kicked my ass at both Settlers and King of Tokyo.)\n\n**TL;DR-** I married an awesome person. Molly came to the rehearsal dinner. I fessed up. She called me an idiot. We're good now. Molly's coming by for another board-game night this weekend with our mixed group of friends.\n\n**Minor Update to the update-** \n\nSo... it turns out \"Molly\" reddits, and because of the number of upvotes this got, it hit her front page and she called me yesterday to call me out on it. She was pretty mad. I think her exact word were: \"Dude, did you seriously name me after your mom's cat?\"\n\nSo going forward, please replace \"Molly\" with \"Princess Mollificent Bananahammock; the first of her name, Queen of Tokyo, Catan and Avalon, Lady of the Six Cousins and Protector of the Realm, the Unbothered, Mother of Pokemon, Breaker of Chains.\"\n\nOh, and sorry /u/1Timer1. Apparently she doesn't accept internet proposals on threads where she is named after A BELOVED SNUGGLY FAMILY MEMBER WHO YOU LOVE, BTW!\n\nShe's still coming to game night though. :)",

So I thought nothing of it. \n\nThis morning, my husband was in the shower and left his phone on *my* nightstand. I was half-asleep when his phone started chirping and woke me up. We both have the same phone and ringtone for text messages. Not knowing that he had put his phone on my nightstand for whatever reason, I thought it was my phone in my half-asleep state. Despite his black phone case (mine is green), I didn't even notice and I looked at who had texted. It said \"Mom\". Okay, my mom texted me, I can ignore that until I'm actually awake. But under that was a Snapchat notification. A snap from someone named \"Roxy\". I was like who the f is Roxy and why is she snap chatting me? I opened it and bam- it's a picture of a pussy. And not the meowing kind with four legs and a tail. The caption said \"I want your tongue inside me again\".\n\nNow. I immediately thought it was a mistake. But I was alert now after being awoken by a vulva. I pretty quickly realized that this was my husband's phone. I felt like I was going to crap the bed and started to sweat. I looked at his contacts on snapchat and she has a yellow heart next to her name. I looked up wtf that means and it means they are \"best friends\". **WTF**.\n\nI feel like I'm going to be sick. I didn't do any other snooping because honestly, I know what I'll find. I just don't understand how he could do this. We're happy. I thought we were happy. We have sex *at least* four times a week.\n\nHere's the real kicker, Reddit. I'm almost 12 weeks pregnant with our first child.\n\nHe's sitting in the recliner about 20 feet from me and I just can't find the words to confront him. How do I say what I need to say?? There is **no** way I am somehow overreacting or misreading this situation, is there? I'm heartbroken and don't know what to do.\n\n**tl;dr** Accidentally opened my husband's snapchat only to be greeted with a snap of some girl's vagina. I'm nearly 12 weeks pregnant and just can't wrap my head around this. Don't know how to handle this or confront him. \n\n**Update:** First and foremost, thank you all for your love and support. I feel it from here. Honestly, thank you- it's amazing to me that strangers care so much about my baby & me. Love back to all of you. So, husband knows something is up. I don't know if he saw that I opened a snapchat from Roxy and is afraid of what I saw and afraid to bring it up or if he's clueless and can just tell I'm upset about something. He's been asking me if I'm okay or if something is wrong about every hour. I told him my sister was having a hard time today (ironically, she just broke up with her boyfriend. Why? He cheated.) and I was going to go over to her place for dinner (I live in pacific time zone) and to spend the night with her. I'm here now. My sister is 20 and a whiz at the social media thing. She \"stalked\" his Facebook to see if this Roxy person popped up anywhere. She looked through his friend's friends. Bingo, we found her. Well, at least pretty sure. I didn't see her face in the snapchat. The screen was too full of her crotch. She's Facebook friends with my husband's good friend. She is listed as a receptionist at my husband's friend's law firm. My husband works a couple blocks from the law firm and he stops by often to grab lunch with his friend. That would explain how they met. Still formulating a plan on confrontation, trying to get as much information as possible first. My sister wants to burn his life to the ground, and honestly I do too, but I'm going to address this in the most adult way possible so that I can walk away from him with my head held high and be a deserving role model to my baby girl (not sure it's a girl, just a feeling). Good news? My uncle is a lawyer. Most of what he deals with are divorces. I've already contacted him and asked if we could discuss some potential legal issues (didn't specify what yet, feels like something I should do in person during our meeting). I told him it was urgent; we are meeting tomorrow morning. I will try to update as much as I can and from the bottom of my heart, thank you all again, Internet strangers!\n\n**UPDATE:** hey everyone, so because this was a throwaway account, I never linked my email. I am unable to post an update because the link to approve it requires me to re-sign in. So, I created another throwaway account to be able to send an update. The username for my new throwaway account is thisgirlisonawire121\n\nJust so you know the update is real and not someone else.\n\n**Another Update** nevermind what I said above, my update on this account was approved.",

Do not under any circumstances let him turn this around and accuse you of invading his privacy. \n\n\nBest case scenario - he got carried away receiving nudes from Roxy, but he never sent any back and nothing physical happened between them.\n\n\nWorst case scenario - it's a full blown affair and he already cheated.

If he tries to backpedal or make up some excuse, pack a bag and go stay with family or a friend for the time being. I'm sorry you have to deal with this at the start of your pregnancy.",

If he did do more with her or someone else, is that enough to make you file for divorce?  Again, you don't need to decide right now.  Maybe make an excuse and say you need to go to your mom's house for a couple of days and give yourself a chance to figure things out.  \n\nWhen you decide to confront him, just tell him \"I know about Roxy\" and see his reaction.  \n\nIf you decide that you are done with him, consult a divorce lawyer.  \n\nI'm so sorry this is happening to you, especially while you're pregnant.

            "I'm sorry to say it but if he's done it once he probably has done it before. Make sure you take care of yourself and your little one. I had the same thing happen to me only I wasn't pregnant. I kept forgiving and he eventually left me for the other girl he was sexting with. ",
            "Do you know his password? If you do or can figure it out I'd log into his Snap account on your app and read the conversation between the two of them.

FYI, the original post was posted before 5 pm PST and we are to believe she already planned to eat dinner with her sister and spend an overnight with her despite it being a weekday, and the fact she's married and pregnant.

Im sure this hurts like hell and it sounds like your well on your way to a divorce but please keep your baby in mind through all of your decisions. You are no longer making decisions for whats best for you but also your baby. Im sure you are already aware of that, but burning your husbands life to the ground will ultimately hurt your child in the end. Both parents present in a childs life is incredibly important. \nIm not saying dont separate just please allow every opportunity for him to be part of your childs life. I would trust that you would already have intended this but reading the part about burning his life to the ground prompted me to write this.\n\nI wish you good luck and swift healing from recent events.\n\n"
