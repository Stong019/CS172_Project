        "selftext": "Link to Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7gtlr5/me_21_f_engaged_after_2_months_of_knowing_each/\nOriginal tl;dr He was dating someone for 4 months before me and started dating me after 2 months of that breakup...is this a red flag?\nEDIT: After reading all the replies, I have come to the conclusion that I need to have a serious talk to him to slow things down( he set the wedding for April next year) I m thinking of giving back the ring\n\nSo I talked to him Saturday night, it took everything I got and I was scared. I eased him by starting to talk about what we each wanted in terms of career path, where we want to live, kids etc...found out that he wants four and I only want one lol.After the light talk, I expressed my concerns that we might be rushing things, and I gave him his ring back...he started to cry and at first I was starting to feel really guilty, he was going nuts and I was a little scared but I was able to calm him down. I told him that we should call off the wedding and that didn't go down well, he called me names and claimed that I didn't really love him. I told him I want to work things out, that we can be together but not married for now, not engaged. He said that he needs space and time to think, it has been almost 3 days now and he won't talk to me, won't answer my text and he won't see me. His mom has been posting stuff on his facebook wall about relationships and stuff. I reached out to the girl he was dating for 4 months before we started dating 2 months later and she told me that he had proposed to her and that is why the broke up, with the same ring he claimed to have bought for me using his savings...needless to say, I feel gutted, should have probably contacted the ex-first but I didn't want to be that guy and I was in love. I still have feelings for him, just can't turn them off but I now know that being with him will bring me tears, I am tempted to try to salvage the relationship but I won't be, going to take time for myself away from everything.Thank you so much to everyone who answered on my post, this has been a very sobering experience and I hope to grow from it. I really appreciate all the replies, it made me feel like I was not crazy for all the concerns I had been having.\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Gave back the ring, told him I still wanted a relationship, he hasn't talked to me in almost 3 days and I found out he had proposed to the ex which is why they broke up.Going to take time for myself",

            "You did the right thing, and you know it. Break-ups suck, but if you're not already be proud for not falling into something that was bound to have a (more-dramatic!) end date. Imagine if you had children with this person and then had to deal with custody..! The horror.\n\nGlad to hear you're taking time for yourself, OP. Best of luck!",
            "Bullet dodged. You're 21, you'll have plenty of time to meet and develop relationships with other guys.",
            "If you haven't, yet, OP, since it's clear you've now checked out of this relationship, I suggest removing both your now-ex and his family from all social media and blocking them. The best way to work on yourself is to distance yourself as much as possible.",
            "His reaction suggests to me that he just wants to be married for its own sake, and whom he's married to is only a minor consideration. Not a very solid foundation to build a life upon. \n\nOf course you are grieving the loss of the relationship, but I think you'd be wise to stick to your guns on this one. I'm sorry this happened to you.",
            "Don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but the red flag in this situation isn\u2019t that he was dating someone 2 months before you... it\u2019s that he proposed after 2 months. That is waaaaaay too rushed, and 2 months isn\u2019t nearly enough time to know you want to spend your life with somebody (shit, it should be a couple years at a minimum). I really don\u2019t mean this in a judgmental way, but honestly saying yes in the first place was a really bad idea. His response to your very reasonable request to take things a bit slower certainly confirms that he has some emotional dependency issues of his own to work out. I don\u2019t doubt your feelings for the dude, but you definitely dodged a bullet there. ",
            "Jesus christ this guy is a train wreck. Definitely good call on not marrying him, but how does that even work, you meet someone hey let's get married and have a future!, it's like... I don't even know you bruh. ",
            "I had a feeling that the ring was originally meant for someone else when I read your first post. Who knows, maybe he's used that ring with girls before her too. Anything is possible and I wouldn't put it past someone like that. You learned a valuable lesson from all this, it's to trust your instincts no matter what. I feel that his family is kind of strange to keep watching him do this, but maybe they're used to it or they're hoping someone else will take care of him.\n\nIt's a huge red flag when someone tries to rush into major life events like this. Sure, there's an exception to the rule, but it's rare. We normally see posts about someone marrying or moving in too fast and now they're stuck in an abusive situation. Guys (or even girls) like him will rush to pin someone down so that way the other person has a harder time leaving when things do start to get out of hand. Of course they're not going to be abusive at the start, how would they keep someone that way? You got lucky that you saw his true colors when you had that talk with him.\n\nI predict that he'll be proposing to another girl in a few months and hopefully that one is smart not to do it also, then his mom can post more inspirational relationship stuff on his Facebook wall.\n\nAnyway, he's gone now. He may come back or he may not. If he does, ignore him. Actually, block him on everything now for your own sake. I know it's hard right now, but he wasn't who you thought he was. Also, please use what you've learned when it comes to your next relationship.",
            "Bullet dodged op,  bullet dodged. \n\nGood on you and the ex gf who also knew to run when faced with a proposal after four (and two on your part!) months. \n\nYour ex sounds deranged,  mentally unstable and potentially violent.  You're seriously better off as far from him as possible. ",
            "Also you dodged the JustNOMIL trainwreck as well. ",
            "This guy is not ready for marriage with *anyone,* evidenced by the fact that he's consecutively proposed to girlfriends after only knowing them a few months.\n\nHe clearly has some issues.",

            "This is all so scary, OP... I know you feel something very strong for him, but every hair on that guy's body is a red flag... \n\nI hope you stay away from him, and I hope you let yourself move on from him. Grieve, and move on. Jedi hugs.",
            "*Huge* credit goes to you, OP, for making a tough call and doing what needs to be done - even though it was painful and you still have feelings for the guy. I think that future you is thanking you massively. This guy is *not* mentally stable, and is *not* ready for a relationship. Write that down for yourself, and take a look at it whenever you consider getting back together with him.",
            "OP, I don\u2019t want to be mean but you should really hear me out.\nIt is very worrying that you would even be open to savaging that relationship before you spoke to the ex. He showed you who he is, a childish, immature, manipulative, emotionally unstable guy with no sense of responsibility when he proposed to you. You still wanted to be with him. Then he went nuts because you confronted him with your reasonable doubts in the kindest way, and he called you names and gave you the silent treatment. And you still wanted to salvage that relationship? You need to reevaluate what you want from a guy. Think long and hard about why the hell you would want to stay with a guy who showed you that he is an unstable asshole. \nI wish you the best and I am glad that you got out of this relationship :) ",
            "So his last relationship broke up because he proposed after 4 months, so he proposed to you after ... 2? \n\nDude doesn\u2019t learn does he? I wonder how many proposals his family have to fake cheer at every year.",
            "If you were unsure what to do before, at least now you know from his reactions that you did the right thing. \n\nYou did great!",
            "This dude is fucking nuts. Run, don't walk.",
            "Yeah impulsive people who try to jump the gun like that scare the shit out of me. I had an ex who tried to ask me to marry her when she was tipsy and I shook it off because we were like a brand new relationship. Turns out you can be impulsive in other aspects also and she was caught shoplifting multiple times and lied without regrets.",
            "Congrats on getting out of that. \n\nBut, please be cautious in the future. Being ready for a lifelong commitment after two months, then setting the wedding for six months later is a giant red flag that should have sent you *running*.\n\nAlso:\n\n> he called me names and claimed that I didn't really love him. I told him I want to work things out, that we can be together \n\nWhy in the hell would you tell him that after he's called you names and tried to further manipulate you?!\n",
            "Pro tip: when someone asks you to marry them after only a few weeks/couple months, 99% of the time it is NOT romantic/fate/kismet. Rather it's a giant flashing red sign of immaturity/instability/unhealthiness ",
            "I\u2019ve called off an engagement and wedding before. You\u2019ll be fine. When your gut says \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d, don\u2019t do it. You did the right thing for the both of you. ",

            "One of my friends is in like the exact same situation as you (I was honestly hoping that you might be her lol) they met and were engaged after like a month and he\u2019s such a piece of skit ",
            "Run, don\u2019t walk, out of that relationship. ",
            "Holy smokes you dodged a bullet! He obviously has some need to get married so soon! Your both so young enjoy life don\u2019t get tied down after such a short relationship!  ",
            "Creeped me out, because I actually had a boyfriend in 10th grade who gave me a promise ring and I accepted it. At the time, I thought \"How romantic,\" but he was a total manipulative creep-o. He took the ring from his mom, apparently, and turned around to do the same thing w/ the girl he cheated on me with. Different ring, at least. Total red flag. Not the first ring I'd received from a boy for the same reason at that point in my life, either! Now that I'm married, I realize how bad things could have gone if I'd honestly expected them to follow through on the promise.",
            "There are a few red flags and strange items.  The biggest being that it seems he is desperate to get married.  I am just guessing that he hasn't had much experience dating long-term.  Is he or you \"saving yourself for marriage\"?   I don't understand his motivation to quickly marry someone so quickly.  All relationships in the beginning are intense and with the added euphoric feelings it can cause you to have thoughts and impulses. Maybe he is a very impulsive person.  If you have feelings for him and he doesn't change after you declining the engagement, let the relationship mature.  Although i have a feeling he will be a little bitter.  You are young so you have options....many options.   ",
            "You both are still very young. What is his rush to get married so soon? ",
            "He\u2019s looking for someone to marry because he thinks that\u2019ll make him happy, but he isn\u2019t too bothered with who it is. He doesn\u2019t even know you.",
            "You seem like you have a good head on your shoulders. Not only that, you\u2019re kind and were willing to explore your feelings with him more. He threw that in your face and called you names. That\u2019s abusive behavior. \n\nPeople show you who they really are when they are put in a position of letting go. The people that are worth your time will express how much they care, but loosen their grip and understand. \n\nI just want to say that you don\u2019t have to get married young or even have a romantic relationship to have a life.\n\nI think that it\u2019s really good that you are taking some time for yourself. You are still a kid pretty much. You\u2019re just now able to drink legally! Have some fun. Think about all of the things that you want to do and the places that you want to see.\n\nTo put things in perspective, I\u2019m a guy in my early 30\u2019s. I\u2019ve never been in a long term relationship. I have dated here and there, but I refuse to settle. I\u2019ve learned a hell of a lot and I still continue to learn about life and people.\n\nJust don\u2019t worry at all. My love life was a mess at 21 and it still is! Seriously, those feelings will pass and there will be other people that are worthy of your time.\n\nFind your passion(s) in life. It\u2019s the one thing that makes life worth it to me. Not just a degree or a career that will \u201cnet you an income\u201d. Something that you really get geared up about. \n\nMost importantly, love yourself! As cheesy and clich\u00e9 as that sounds, it\u2019s absolutely true. Take care of yourself, be kind to yourself, even spoil yourself a bit sometimes. As we get older, friends and family come and go. \n\nIn the end, you\u2019re all you have and hopefully you have a good relationship with yourself. Nobody ever told me when I was growing up that you either become your best friend or your biggest enemy. \n\nBe open to other people and don\u2019t have any expectations. You\u2019ll be just fine. \ud83d\ude0a",
            "That\u2019s crazy. 2 months and he gave a ring? There\u2019s some serious issues here to be explored. Run, do not walk.",
            "Children shouldn't get married.",
            "Girl leave this the fuck alone. He called you names when you said \u201chey babe, let\u2019s slow this down, get to know each other etc\u201d that\u2019s a problem.\n\nHe proposed after 2 months, that\u2019s a problem.\n\nHe sounds unstable and (probably) manipulative. Just delete and block and thank God you escaped ",
            "You dodged a bullet. It seems like this guy has issues, both based on his reactions to your decision and his desperate need for validation. 2 months is nowhere near long enough to get to know someone well enough to marry them, let alone truly love them. Seems to me like you both experienced extreme infatuation, but thought it was love. He needs to learn to calm down and stop taking things so fast. \n\nThis is not a stab at you btw, but it sounds to me like he has a habit of being desperate. It\u2019s as if he can\u2019t bear being single and he feels the need to rush into long term commitment in order to feel validated. Again, that isn\u2019t anything to do with you, and the proof is in his relationship history. He needs to learn some self love and appreciation in order to stop feeling worthless unless he\u2019s in a relationship, which is why he tries to tie his dates down by rushing marriage. That\u2019s his own problem, and it shouldn\u2019t be yours too. ",
            "Wow. Youve dodged a bullet. Now focus on cutting him out of your life, he's not stable. ",
            "So he called you names just because you wanted to take things slower? You weren't even breaking up with him... Yeah, he sounds legitimately psychotic and you definitely dodged a bullet. Block him on everything.",
            "> he called me names and claimed that I didn't really love him.\n\nThis is not something good people EVER do in a relationship.\n\n>  she told me that he had proposed to her\n\nChrist almighty this dude has major, major issues.\n\n> with the same ring \n\nHAHAHAHA\n\nGood! bullet seriously dodged, well done.\n",

            "It sounds to me like he proposes because he is afraid of being alone. It is a normal fear but a person is not going to fill a void in his life. He needs to be a whole person, not a person with a hole if he wants to be in a healthy relationship. You did the right thing. It's clear you care about him more than he cares about himself but in the end you also look out for you, which you did. Good luck OP!",
            "This guy  is red flag central and is not ready for a relationship or marriage. You did real good OP. He honestly needs some sort of therapy. 2 months and wants to get married at 20? Holy hell. ",

I've been in relationship that have lasted years before things went south; personally I would never get engaged without dating for at least 2 years, preferably 5 plus. I had a similar issue when I was 18 and my boyfriend proposed to me (after 4 months), and when I told him I wasn't ready to make that decision, he accused me of not loving him. ",
            "Do not rush or be engaged. It sounds like he has a dependence with having to be with a girl, that is his attempt to be filling an emotional void, something from his childhood could\u2019ve created that which deep down is a fear of abandonment.... use your head, not your heart!! Don\u2019t be reluctant to be without him!!!",
            "You're so young to jump right to marriage and the guy sounds like a Level 5 Clinger so you'll do better than him here.  I hope he can learn to have some self-awareness and see that this kind of shit doesn't fly and even if it does it's flying shit and no one wants that either.",
            "You did the right thing. A guy like this cost me a 10 year friendship. His Timeline was slightly slower, (moved in with her 3 months in, engaged in 6, married around a year) My friend was a late bloomer in the dating world, he was her first boyfriend and she really clung tight. \n\nI was suspicious of him hitting her (long sleeves in dead ass heat of summer) but We parted ways due to him doing some illegal activities and her not thinking it was a big deal, 2 years into their marriage I read in the paper thag he went ballistic, choked her and attempted to pull a gun on somebody. ",
            "Gahh! Girl you definitely did the right thing!\n\nMy hubby and I decided during our first week of dating that we were both looking for marriage, but then we spent the next 2.5 years really getting to know each other before we finally tied the knot. Heck, we discussed personal finances before we even officially became a couple. You barely knew this guy when you accepted the ring. Not a good idea, ever!",
            "Is he religious? Is his mother religious? Are his mother and father still married? \n\nHis mother sounds like a narcissist (posting relationship shit to his FB) and has drilled it into his head that if he doesn't marry like soon, he'll be undesirable (male spinster) and if he doesn't have many children, he'll have been a waste of oxygen.\n\n\nI may be in the minority on this, but I would just let it pass and move on. There is so much baggage he's carrying and all signs point to something not so good within his family. \nWhen you told him that you wanted to slow down, he had a tantrum like a child would with their mother. \n\nI won't discount how you feel about him because some people love fast, and some take a long time, but while it hurts, there's a huge chance his impulsive nature will be a huge road block or even danger later on in your lives. He's too unpredictable, OP.",

        "selftext": "Edit; I\u2019ve decided to talk to him. I know I\u2019ve been avoiding this since months but after reading all the responses, I feel it\u2019s time I rip that bandaid out. I\u2019m going over to our house. I\u2019ll update on what happens. \n\nMy husband and I (both 35 rn) met in college. We fell in love and got married 8 years back. I gave birth to our daughter in 2020. My husband is a professor at this med school (he\u2019s a doctor himself). My friend, Sarah, also works in the same college and she\u2019s in the same department as my husband. \n\nFew months back(in December), Sarah took me out for lunch and told me that she suspected something\u2019s going on between my husband and this med student (25f). She claimed she\u2019d seen both of them give \u2018yearning looks\u2019 to each other. She said that she\u2019s known my husband for so long, and she\u2019d never seen him talk to any other woman like this, that he\u2019d been so aloof around women all these years, but it\u2019s just different with this one girl. \n\nIn that moment, I had laughed at her face. I remember telling her that she\u2019s jumping to conclusions based on these supposed \u2018yearning looks\u2019.  \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn't tell you before\", she had said,\"I was confused too. It's not like he goes out of his way to talk to her but whenever they do talk, it\u2019s like watching a slow burn romance movie. She looks at him like he\u2019s Brad Pitt and he looks at her the way he used to look at you.\u201d  I remember the exact word\u2019s because they stung. Internally I was breaking down, externally I just smiled and told her that she\u2019s probably overthinking. \n\nThat night, I casually mentioned this my husband. I was laughing at the absurdity, and I expected him to join in. And deny the wild possibility that he\u2019s in love with a student. But he didn\u2019t. Instead he looked at me, all teary eyed, and said \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019.  \n\n\u201c I can\u2019t get her out of my mind. I\u2019ve tried, trust me. I should\u2019ve told you sooner. But I thought I could save our relationship, I really wanted to.\u201d \n\nI asked him if he\u2019d cheated on me. He said no. He said he didn\u2019t even talk to her, nor did they have any contact outside of college and that he completely understood how morally depraved it is to try and pursue a relationship with a student. She wrote him a letter about an year back, confessing her love for him  and he had told her that even tho he was into her, nothing would come out of it. Aparently that was when the \u2018yearning looks\u2019 had started.  \n\nI honestly don\u2019t remember how I reacted then. I think I just started packing and came to live with my parents along with my daughter. I\u2019ve been living with my parents since then. Half of me wanted him to come and beg for forgiveness. But he never did. He comes by sometimes to spend time with our daughter but that\u2019s it. He never talks about the elephant in the room nor do I bring it up. \n\nI keep checking that girl\u2019s social media. She\u2019s insanely beautiful, almost doll like, and intelligent. I can\u2019t help but think that someone like him should be with someone like her. He\u2019s always been very good looking and I\u2019m more of a plain Jane. She\u2019s the Meredith to his Derek. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. What do I even tell people? I don\u2019t even know who I am without him. Some part of me still wants him to come back. \n\nTL;DR husband just admitted that he\u2019s in love with this young woman who also his student. She loves him too. \n",

            "Jeez. He\u2019s flattered and infatuated (and so is she). What a dumbass.",
            "Bruh if she\u2019s Meredith to his Derek that makes you Addison, I\u2019d be happy with that",
            "Let's say he comes back and asks for forgiveness and do all that you want. Then what? Will you accept him and start something new with him knowing that he did this?\n\nThink about your time and you happiness. What prevents you from finding the right person? Don't let the fear of the unknown ruin your future of being with someone perfect for you. And try to maintain a respectful relationship for the sake of your daughter. You deserve better than this. Let the past go and move on to see where it takes you. Holding on to this feeling will only make you bitter and close many doors.",
            "Assuming he told you the truth and nothing happened besides that letter and these \"looks\". It is not love. On either side. It is infatuation. \n\nImo you cannot truly love anyone until you have actually been with them, and even lived with them. It is very normal that a 25-y-o girl would believe infatuation is love, but at 35, your hubby supposedly knows better. He does not love her.\n\nHowever, and that is going to hurt, that does not mean he still loves you. He told you \"I thought I could save our relationship, I really wanted to\" PAST TENSE. He did not beg for forgiveness, as you said. It honestly sounds like he does not love you anymore and will not make the effort for you.\n\nYour problem is not that he fell in love with anyone else, it is that he does not love you anymore. Your husband, like many men, did not have the courage to tell you just that and instead waited for you to find a reason to leave him, this way he will be the wronged party, because after all he \"did not do anything\".\n\nYou need to have a talk with him, and try to be as civil and respectful as possible. Tell him that even though nothing happened with the girl, you feel like he wants out of this relationship. Tell him that you deserve to be loved, truly, 100% loved, and he is not giving you that. I would also tell him that if he wanted to leave you he should have done just that instead of exchanging looks with a 25 y-o.",
            "The fact that he never came to talk to you to fix your marriage means he's checked out.",
            "Damn, it\u2019s stuff like this that makes me never want to love someone *too much*. Just enough to be happy with them, but not so much that I\u2019d be crushed if they do what your husband has done - so I can just walk away and say \u2018thank you, next\u2019",
            ">He said no. He said he didn\u2019t even talk to her, nor did they have any contact outside of college and that he completely understood how morally depraved it is to try and pursue a relationship with a student. She wrote him a letter about an year back, confessing her love for him and he had told her that even tho he was into her, nothing would come out of it. Aparently that was when the \u2018yearning looks\u2019 had started.\n\nHonestly, I don't know that this makes sense. That she could get to the point of writing a letter that confesses love off what he claimed was such limited contact just seems kind of absurd. Worse, when she did choose to confess he chose the most cruel and self indulgent response possible. In that moment he chose to ruin his life, that's the sad reality of it, and whether it ever manifested as anything more intense he did enough damage there that things would never go back. He failed as a husband, adult, and educator.\n\nDon't idealise his dynamic with her. The reason people frown on teachers hitting on students is because the power discrepancy makes any emotional connection compromised. She was enamoured with him but part of that means ignoring the dissonance of all the bad things he did to humour it. In the end she's just naive. As for him, well, he's a creep.\n\nTime to find out who you are. Part of that will involve stop putting yourself down. Even if he came back it wouldn't undo the things he has done and that's the sad reality. He will understand what he lost with increasing clarity but that's his burden to face.",
            "There\u2019s a part of me (the drama king in me) that wants me to advise you to ask him point blank: \u201care you gonna start the divorce or me?\u201d But the pragmatic side would advise you to contact a lawyer and have them handle it from here, starting with working on a visitation and custody arrangement. Start getting that shit done. Grieve when it\u2019s finalized.",
            "I got divorced 10+ years ago, and it was the best thing i've ever done. My sister told me something, and i'll tell you the same thing - because it helped me. \n\nLive in the truth\n\nWhatever the truth is, that's where you should be. The truth here is, he's checked out and lost your trust. That's it. Now at least you know. Start a new chapter in your life, he isn't the one for you, it's painful now - but years from now WHEN you're with the right one, it'll all make sense. \n\nGood luck, stay strong.",
            "I suspect part of the reason he doesn\u2019t want to talk about the elephant in the room, or push for a divorce is that \u201cMy wife is divorcing me because I\u2019m hot for one of my students\u201d generally doesn\u2019t go over well with the med school. It\u2019s not just \u201cmorally depraved\u201d as he put it - it can be grounds for disciplinary action all the way through to getting fired. Even just the appearance of impropriety or favouritism is enough.",
            "Read your comment about you living with your parents for 5 months & he hasn\u2019t come to fight for the marriage but to see his daughter\u2026.I\u2019m sorry but it looks like hes done with the marriage & probably been in contact with the student! \n\nYour friend works with your husband is she still giving you updates about him?",
            "I truly believe that in the best interests of your mental health, you really need to walk away permanently from this. It\u2019s unfortunate that it happened but there is nothing both of you can say or do to come back from this. To want him back or to try to fix things is simply delaying the inevitable and you have a child in the middle of all this.\n\nYou also really need to sit down with him and have that serious conversation about the big elephant in the room that you are both trying to ignore. No one is winning points here for procrastination. You have a child and your mental health to think about here.",
            "I remember that a psychologist friend of mine at some point told me that it\u2019s normal to have crushes on someone else even if you are married. \nThe important thing is whether you act on it or not. If you don\u2019t they will fade in time.\nDon\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true or not, but it seems your husband had chosen you and your marriage until you moved out. \nPerhaps it\u2019s worth exploring couples therapy?\nMost people think having a child will strengthen their relationship, when most times it\u2019ll put a strain on it and especially the first years it\u2019s easy to grow apart. And I would guess that makes it easier to fall for someone else. But sometimes you can work through that and rekindle.",
            "I'm sorry you've had to go through this and this really sucks, but it's baffling to me that your husband would jeopardize his job for this considering that this just seems like limerance.  They don't know each other and are only seeing (or imagining) idealized versions of each other.  This reveals a lot about your husband's character - it's incredibly inappropriate for him to involve himself with a student like this.\n\nI think you should only tell people the truth - this is his mess.",
            "I think if you haven't already you need to file for divorce.  You need closure on this relationship so you can move on.",
            "When he tells you he is in love with someone else, believe him. \n\nPretty obvious.. But hearing yourself say this out loud makes it less complicated to make decisions that are best for you and your daughter. You can't make him love you or be with you. The only thing you can do is work on yourself and be the best parent you can be for your daughter.  This is your opportunity to be able to show her how you can overcome something so heartbreaking by being able to dedicate more time loving yourself and growing to be a better person while still respecting her father and his decisions. \n\nIs what he did and said painful? Yes\nIs what all he said true? Yes\nDo you want to stay with someone who is in love with someone else? I assume not.\nDoes a part of you want him back? Yes... But you probably miss the idea of him.\n\nIf you're asking what to do... I would say divorce him amicably, learn to live your life without ever having to find yourself asking, \"I don't know who I am without him,\" and enjoy the journey of self discovery without having a partner to fulfill the void.",
            "He hasn't even come to try to win you back which tells me it was over before you said anything it just was going to be a slow death had you not mentioned it. People don't usually end a relationship when it's dead they wait till it starts rotting and although you weren't aware that the relationship was dead probably because you were so focused on child rearing in your own career doesn't mean it wasn't dead. I think it's best that you choose radical acceptance and move forward through your life knowing that this man is not going to be anything but a co-parent to you.\u00a0\n\n\nWhy would you want to be with somebody who you're always going to wonder when he's gonna cheat on you again and who hasn't even tried to fight for your relationship? You might be a plain Jane but I think that that's the wrong way to look at this because are looks really that important? Does good looks make up for somebody being a liar cheater a thief a murderer? A deadbeat Dad? A man who doesn't love his wife and then let's her leave and doesn't even fight for her or his family?\u00a0\n\n\nI mean the relationship is dead but I still think you need to work on how you're framing this because it seems like you're making it about yourself worth when it has absolutely nothing to do with that. Go see a therapist and get your head straight call a divorce lawyer and move forward.",
            "I think I can weigh in on this a little. I developped a tiny crush on a coworker a few months back, for about a week. He's really nice and intelligent and all that. You know what I did about it? Absolutely nothing. I have a partner that I love more than myself, that I would never cheat on. And I would also not sabbotage my professional relationship with my coworker. So what if he's attractive, he's my coworker, I'm a lot younger than him and it's inapropriate. End of story. \n\nThis is what you do when something like that happens. You can't control your emotions, but you can control how you react to them, and the moral thing is to do absolutely nothing about them and move the fuck on. Not to destroy the lives of everybody around you because your lizard brain wants something.",
            "Just go to therapy for yourself to help to figure this out. His lack of action says everything. Start to focus on yourself that\u2019s where you will find your healing and start to look for a divorce lawyer. If he would want to save your relationship he would do everything to cut her off. (Changing jobs etc.)",
            "This is so hard. I don\u2019t have an answer besides therapy for yourself, and maybe suggesting couples therapy to your partner if you\u2019re both interested in saving your marriage.",
            "I highly recommend you also consider posting this on AskWomenOver30, you\u2019ll get a lot of mature advice and probably hear from people who\u2019ve been through similar experiences",
            "I think the fact that your friend was able to sense it despite not having enough info is pretty telling. That means other people can sense it, too. Idk I have some suspicions about him being completely honest especially considering he supposedly said this:\n\n>But I thought I could save our relationship, I really wanted to.\n\nI mean clearly he does feel something strong for her. The fact that he hasn't really tried to contact you since you left makes me wonder if he's kinda checked out at this point. I was wondering if he was maybe waiting for you to contact him when you were ready, but the fact that he doesn't really take the time to talk to you while he's visiting kinda just makes me wonder if there's anything left of your relationship to savage at this point....\n\nI'm sorry OP. I wish you luck and hope that you find someone who truly just wants to be with only you.",
            "It just takes that \"ONE\". Maybe he didn't cheat physically but emotional cheating is also a thing. I wonder what would have happened if your friend never brought it up and you never mentioned it to him? Maybe the emotional cheating could progress to something physical someday with you being unaware of it. \n\nThe most surprising thing is he hasn't done anything to apologise to you. Maybe you should address the elephant in the room. If you think time will sort this out, trust me it won't. Both of you speaking about it might sort it out. Don't put this under the carpet and forgive him, is all I would like to say. This was a huge breach of trust, even though it wasn't physical. All I understand is when it comes to any kind of cheating nobody gets the right to say \"I don't know how it happened.\" \"I don't know what I was thinking\". Cheating is a choice not an accident. Always remember that. Also you deserve better than someone who thinks a new fling triumphs marriage vows. Excitement fades in all relationships, that doesn't justify what your husband did. \n\nSorry you are going through this OP! Good luck to you.",
            "Hire a divorce attorney and tell them about this student and his claim to be in love with her.  He will either wake up and try to fight for you and your marriage, or not. But you can't stay in limbo and if he is infatuated with this student, he should report himself to his hr so that they are aware before any aligations of inappropriate behaviour or special treatment is reported by other students.\n\nUpdateme!",
            "It don\u2019t fit. People don\u2019t fall in love with and make declarations after nothing but work-appropriate conversation and longing looks. Either he crossed a bunch of lines and cheated, or he is a nitwit indulging in a career and family threatening fantasy with a much younger woman. Either way, he was in a position to put a stop to it, and instead chose to groom her and lie to you.",
            "This can\u2019t be real \ud83d\ude02.\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cin love\u201d but they hardly know each other? And at that big grown age? \n\nFake or they\u2019re both ridiculous.",

            "It\u2019s been months, he just let you leave and comes to visit his child, while never even mentioning what happened. He\u2019s done and so should you. I\u2019m sorry this is happening but he\u2019s taken no steps and shown no willingness whatsoever to repair anything. Obviously you\u2019re never going to beg because self esteem so maybe someone should file for divorce, settle assets and above all, establish custody of your young child. I\u2019m glad you have your parents to count on, I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through.",
            "I don't believe your story. It's too smoothed around the edges. You say you \"don't know what to do\" but all your replies are saying that you've already come to terms with it. Your story reads like a piece of fan fiction. You walked out 5 months ago because he has a crush? Marriages are built of much much stronger stuff than this. People talk and work things out. It's completely ridiculous to not have talked about this in all that time. It's laughable that people on here believe that.\n\nNot sure why you are fantasizing about this. Using the relationships sub as a place for fantasy fiction isn't a new thing, but it never gets less weird when I come across it.",
            "I'm sorry, you feelings are valid. You feel inferior because the you love, choose love another. And he even want try with you, is a punch on ego, and self-esteem. Focus in yourself, in heal in do thing for you, discover who you are without him. Try to be happy without him. Focus on that an everything will be fine.",
            "He checked out. Sorry. \n\nIt's time to move on. It will only get worse",
            "I\u2019d say this is something you could get past if you both wanted to continue the relationship. It sounds like he\u2019s blown it out of proportion tbh, I find it hard to believe he\u2019s fallen in love it\u2019s more likely a crush and if they actually got into a relationship it would be short lived as it\u2019s all based on fantasy. Anyone can develop feelings for others even in a relationship. If you could work past it then you could get to a stronger place after. If there\u2019s any chance this could work I\u2019d consider trying to have a really honest conversation with him. Is he really willing to give up your marriage for this? He hasn\u2019t actually done anything, so it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to change the narrative around it. \n\nBut if he believes he\u2019s in love and you can\u2019t trust him the relationship is unfortunately over. Take time to grieve and get the practicalities sorted out. Don\u2019t feel like you have to rush, focus on what you and your daughter need now and you will get through this and heal. Please don\u2019t blame yourself for this situation, it\u2019s nothing to do with you at all. There is nothing wrong with you, it\u2019s all on him.",
            "That\u2019s not love from either of them lol. That\u2019s lust, and the only thing potentially saving this marriage is because he loves his job more than you to be caught cheating with a student.",
            "Maybe Im young and naive but isnt it quite possible that people have crushes a lot? This got correctly stopped before anything really happened, actuall at the first sign of stuff getting out of hand, and there was honest confession and now he's keeping minimal contact to noto to bother his wife who is probably done with him and also he seems to know there's no point in talking/begging about it since it's all over. All of that simply due to strong emotions which he was not able to stop at the time.\n\nI'm not sure I would have been a better person and stop myself entirely from having a crush.",

            "What's most depressing about this is that it was so obvious that someone else (your friend) noticed and knew something much deeper was happening, and you needed to know. The husband should've told you. The 25 year old knew about you. She's a home wrecker doesn't matter if it didn't go beyond she should've backed away when she saw a ring ? Does your husband  have social media? He should've actually never let it go beyond attraction. You deserve better.

            "I\u2019m trying to understand how people are downplaying her husband\u2019s crush on this woman. The woman wrote him a letter professing her feelings. He responded that he feels the same way. The moment he did that, he crossed a line in his marriage. Full stop. Following up with nothing will ever come of it doesn\u2019t absolve him from crossing that line. Why didn\u2019t he talk to his wife about this? Why is he trading yearning looks with this other woman in public so obvious that other people notice? How are they having no contact yet still looking at each other like that?  Even his verbal response of not getting the other woman out of his head and trying to save his marriage speaks to him be farther gone than some fleeting crush. Her husband did not do enough to squash this. \n\nHe\u2019s didn\u2019t cheat physically but his actions are a betrayal of trust and his marriage. Some people may be able to move on from this but OP is under no obligation to do that. At the end of the day OP needs to have a conversation with her husband about next steps. Is it simply separation and maybe some couples counseling? Or is it completely done and they both need to seek out divorce attorneys? Maybe move back into the family home and work out out from there? But there needs to say least be a conversation about the elephant in the room.",

            "And why did you leave the family home, instead of him? I am so sorry that you are going through this, OP. This state of limbo is probably going to remain untenable for you and your daughter in the long term. Your daughter\u2019s life has been completely capsized and she will need a long term stable routine to feel secure. She needs to know that you will be ok without him, so she can relax and know that she will be ok. \n\nI advise speaking to an attorney pronto. You may be forfeiting valuable rights that you may not even know about, such as abandonment of the family home, interim child support if you need it. Toys, books, your daughter\u2019s access to beloved items and friends. I screwed myself into future generations by being intimidated into not pursuing an equitable division of marital assets and have forever regretted that choice. \n\nRight now your husband is living in a romantic bubble of inconsequence. Choosing when and how he sees his daughter, without worry for her emotional wellbeing? A visitation schedule could help visits to be more consistent and your daughter will know what and when to expect it. A 25? Year old student and a Professor with an abandoned wife and child is a terrible look. It is obvious his concern has more to do with his employment, based on his current sporadic time with his child. \n\nDepression is not only expected, it is more alarming if you weren\u2019t!

            "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re an amazing beautiful person and If he fell in love with someone else so can you, if that\u2019s what you want. At least go out have fun with someone maybe it will ignite a spark in you.",
            "Wait a min. He didn\u2019t cheat on you physically. I think you should not have just left. Tried some counseling first since you have a kid.",
            "Op i am a bit worried too cause a guy who is willing to pretty much give up his whole family for a person he\u2019s barely known is reminding me of cases similar to Chris Watts. It just sounds like a lack of empathy.  Please be careful.",
            "Many people are calling out OPs husband for not coming over to talk to her.  I think this may be a misread of his intentions.\n\nMy thought to his behavior isn't a lack of wanting to try -- rather, he may be respecting her choice to be alone.  He could be waiting for her to be ready to talk. \n\nI say this because this is exactly how my husband would react. In his head, he'd think he was doing the right thing by giving me space.  In my head, I'm waiting for him to make a move.  When one of us finally comes up and says something, we realize we wanted the same thing all along.\n\nOP, this is painful... of course it is.  But I don't know if I'd say your marriage is over.  Crushes happen. It sucks, but it happens.  Your husband should have been able to talk to you about it, but I'm sure you can appreciate how embarrassing it is for him.  You can also understand why he would want to hide it from you in the hopes he would deal with it himself and spare you any hurt feelings.\n\nIt seems to me like OP's husband has chosen his wife, but is struggling on how to move past this crush.  He needs to completely remove the crush from his life.  Whatever that takes needs to happen NOW.  You need to both work to rebuild your relationship.  I highly recommend the book by Dr. Gottman, \"The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work\".\n\nThis will be a shit time but I do not see this being a marriage ender.  He could have handled it a lot better, for sure. But unless he is telling you outright that he is choosing her (or you decide for certain you cannot reconcile), then your marriage can survive this.\n\nWhat I know for sure is that you don't have to make those hard decisions now.  In fact, you shouldn't make such huge life impacting choices when your emotions are a battlefield.\n\nFirst and foremost, you need to talk to your husband.  You need to figure out if both of you want to try and make it work (this is a \"both in\" type of situation-- all of marriage is).  If you both do, counseling (couples and individual) is a good idea.  I suggest the Gottman method again because it is excellent at reminding us why we fell in love with our partner in the first place.  I can see how this would benefit both of you currently -- him to move past his crush, and you to forgive (in time).",

Marriages are not like in movies, marriages and satying in a marriage is a CHOICE.  And also one that requires a fair amount of work.

That's my official diagnosis but what you really see is I walk with a limp. I'm a software developer so job wise, I don't have any issues. I knew when I was a kid that using my brain is the best way for me to survive on my own without relying on other people. I haven't had the chance to get my driver's license but according to therapists and doctors that shouldn't be an issue. That's the background about me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for a year. We met back in April 2020 of last year and we decided to get together in May 2020. I told her about my disability before then but she wanted to try and make it work. We video call on discord every day almost always when we're awake and recently we've been going on dates. She's more then happy to lend me an arm and she notices things about me that even I miss myself. Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.\n\nThe problem is is scared that, in the future she will have to take care of me or most of the work will fall onto her. To make matters worse her mom has been telling her for the past few weeks to break up with me because she can find better and she doesn't want her to have the burden of caring for me. She's also really afraid that I will get arthritis early due to my cerebral palsy and if that happens, a lot is going to be on her.\n\nI've tried doing things like stretches and exercises to maintain and improve my muscle tone but she is still afraid I'll get worse. \n\nReddit, please help. I'm an introvert I don't know a lot of people and honestly I don't even know the options I've got to look at. I want to prove that I can be independent and that if things do go wrong, it won't just be on her. I'm in Ontario Canada. Are there things I can look into and do to assist with my disability or things I can look into so if things do go wrong, I won't be a burden on her?\n\nPlease Reddit, I'm at the end of my wits. I've never really hated my disability but I've always kept myself going by being tempering my expectations and thinking, \"my disability is going to make it really hard to find someone\" and she's the first person to make me feel like \"ya, it doesn't matter\". I want to do anything to show her that I won't hold her back in the future but I'm out of ideas. Is there anything I can do?\n\nI don't want to worry anyone I'm with with these issues but I'm at the end of my wits. Please Reddit, I need ideas. I don't even know if my relationship is lost but I don't want this to happen again and I want to know what I can do myself so I can reassure my partner so they know I won't hold them back in the future.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences? Maybe there are resources that I can tap into? I don't know if there are things I can look into to better plan my future so it's not a concern \nfor my partner. I really need help. \n\nThe worst part is, I've always thought my disability doesn't matter. But with all of this happening it's really hard to convince myself otherwise. \n\nTL;DR I've got a permanent disability and I don't know how to reassure my girlfriend that I can handle myself in the future.",

            "Ok I can see I'm gonna be the outlier here but I'm not sure this is actually about your disability at all, at least at the core of it. I'm reading a lot of things that tell me you are overly dependent on her emotionally. \n\n\n>Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and she's my motivation to do better and improve myself. Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems. I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.\n\n\nThis can be great but if she's the only person you are sharing your negativity with it can also be a lot, and just because she's a caring person doesn't mean it doesn't affect her. You have said stuff like you don't have your license (why not? Who drove you places before? Does she drive you now?) And that she's the reason you smile (being responsible for someone else's happiness is a huge burden). I suspect that she's already feeling some caregiver fatigue from the emotional stuff and having her mom whisper in her ear that you may someday need physical help as well is just a bridge too far for her. Hypothetically getting arthritis early because you have mild cerebral palsy which manifests as a limp just doesn't sound like a serious deal breaker to me if someone is really into you. \n\n\nI would say that in addition to being proactive about your condition, you need to get a larger support network so she's not your only emotional outlet. If you can't talk to anyone else about your problems, hire a therapist. I also think more independence (getting your license, moving ahead on buying that house, etc) will show that you are and will be capable of handling your own shit when the time comes more than taking her to talk to a specialist or something like that.  Besides my gut feeling is that this particular girl is probably not worth chasing after (not that she's not worth it but that chasing after someone who isn't into it anymore is a losing game). These lifestyle changes will make you much more attractive to the next person that comes along and less desperate to keep them.",
            "Are her fears valid? If these are real possibilities, and she is unwilling to take that on, then there is nothing you can do.\n\nIf you think her fears are unfounded or unlikely, then maybe sit down with your OT or SW and have them explain prognosis, occupational potential, etc. \n\nI also wonder if your negativity might be giving her doubts. If you unload on her a lot, cool it. You might be making her feel like more of a nurse maid than a gf, which may be priming her anxiety about looking after you. If she sees that you are independent and resourceful in having your emotional and physical needs met, then she might be less anxious about it all falling on her. Otherwise you are making it impossible to see your disability as anything but limiting.",
            "My husband is 28 and has mild cerebral palsy, all four limbs are affected but like you, he just has a limp and can do pretty much every thing I do except from running and climbing ladders. He drives, swims, works out, goes on walks and takes care of the house... His disability doesn't affect me at all. \nI would say, the first thing I would do would be getting the help of a stroke specialist to make sure you're getting cared for. Husband is getting supportive care to minimize the effects of his posture on his joints : physical therapy to stretch the muscles he doesn't use, and he's going to get botox soon. If you can, swimming is probably one of the best things you can do. Cerebral palsy itself is not going to get worse as it is not a progressive disease but the joints might be painful as time passes.\nHonestly caretaker burnout is a real thing but I'm not sure this is the scenario here. I'm guessing you were born with it, and from what you're describing you sound absolutely functional and not relying on her for anything as of now. I had some disability related anxieties before marrying husband and maybe I'm naive but it seems like the worst case scenarios for the future were just that, worst case scenarios. I'd rather spend my time now with somebody I love.\nIt's not because you have a disability that you aren't capable of being a great, valued life partner. I would be cautious of anyone who would make you feel like you are less than...",
            "Specialists are great and all, but I would also look for support groups for people with cerebral palsy (and maybe see if there is one for partners of people with cerebral palsy). Specialists can give you an opinion based on the literature but other people with your condition can give you actual lived experience, and that may be even more valuable.",
            "Hi, fellow disabled person here who has been through their fair share of relationships. So trust me when I say that there are plenty of people who see your disability and love you anyway. And I say see your disability and love you anyway because it is a big part of your life and it should matter to you and to your partner. You are still so young, there\u2019s a lot of people you haven\u2019t even met yet who will love you platonically and romantically, if you allow them in. As for your situation, it\u2019s complex to answer so I\u2019ll do my best to be succinct.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to consider other than developing/maintaining independence as a disabled person. I always say everyone has their shit. Anyone you get into a relationship with has some kind of baggage whether it\u2019s health related or not. The sooner you (and maybe your girlfriend) accept that a caring role is part of all relationships, the better. Everyone needs help sometimes whether it\u2019s because of a disability or just because life is hard. \n\nA good starting conversation might be about why she is so concerned about the potential decline in your healthy right now and the potential of taking on a heavier load of caring. And more important than that, what can both of you do to keep a balance in your relationship. For example, you are a software developer, you said job wise you\u2019re fine. Long term, should your health decline, would you be able to hire a personal/care assistant to remove that pressure of requiring care from your girlfriend? Or are there other areas of the relationship you could take on larger responsibilities to \u201ceven it out\u201d?\n\nRelationships are difficult to navigate on a good day, but the added complexities of a disability are not things that people necessarily consider when getting into a relationship. You said you met in April and got together in May. Having done that same really fast turnaround from meeting someone to being in a relationship, it\u2019s really hard to know someone well and to know the intricacies of a disability and what it entails. Also, a lot of research says it takes 2-3 years in a relationship to really know someone, and I imagine it\u2019s the same with someone\u2019s disability and how that is going to affect life and the future.\n\nThere are a lot of questions you need to ask yourself as well, and it\u2019s really hard to look at your own situation through an objective lender and take a pragmatic approach, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary. Why are you clinging to this relationship? Fear of never being loved again? That only happens if you allow it to. Where do you stand on loving and accepting yourself fully? How does the future look if you remain in this relationship? Consider how it would look if your health/independence declines. Would you be happy to be with someone who is so focused on your disability and potential long term health issues? Would you be happy to be with someone who may resent you for needing care?\n\nMaybe a therapist or local support group for other people with cerebral palsy would be a good place to start. I think the support group would be the best place to start, make some friends, hear from people in similar situations, hear from their friends, families and partners about how they\u2019ve worked through issues. There may be some online resources if you search hard enough but I know myself that disability and relationships are a hard topic to find information on. A starting point might be a local hospital, they may have resources or specialists that can help.\n\nI wish you luck on the journey of figuring this out, it can be a lot to unpack, so I hope any of this resonates or helps.",
            "It\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9 that men find their sole source of emotional support in their partner. You\u2019re experiencing why that\u2019s a bad idea: you\u2019re terrified to lose her, you put her on a pedestal, you seem to think she\u2019s the only one capable of giving you that support. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be an introvert, it\u2019s quite another to be \u201cterrified of meeting people\u201d, as you mention in the comments. I\u2019m an introvert myself, but I\u2019ve got plenty of friends whom I can rely on for all kinds of support, and I actually like to go out and meet people. Is it possible there\u2019s some social anxiety there?\n\nYou\u2019re thinking about ways you can manage your disability in the future in a medical sense, and it\u2019s great to be informed, but imo it\u2019s equally important that you widen your support network in other ways. It\u2019s a lot to put on just one person and it\u2019s going to be tough to maintain a balanced relationship if one party always bends over backwards to prevent losing the other. \n\nI\u2019m speaking from experience - I used to date someone who was incredibly clingy, because apparently I was the first person he felt he could really be himself around. He claimed he\u2019d been to therapy but that it \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d, then proceeded to treat me as a therapist! It was exhausting. Try not to be like that.",
            "Heya, I'm normally not a quote loving type of lady, but I read this one last month, and it really stuck with me:\n\"You'll never have to negotiate your way into a heart that wants you there.\"\n\nIf she feels like breaking up, break up. Try to investigate why you want her so badly, is it because she is truly an awesome person, or is there a part of you that is afraid to never be in such a relationship again? And try to be critical on both reasons too! Are they really true?\n\nI truly believe you are deserving of a partner that chooses you 100% No doubts, no \"I love you, but...\"s\nShe is not and will never be the only girl that will want to be with you and provide emotional support. That's a girls thing.\nHer breaking up with you also does not mean you are worth any less, it says something about her, not you.\n\nSo good luck. I hope you will keep on taking care of yourself, and realize you deserve the best. X",
            "Would it be possible, or worthwhile, visiting a Dr/specialist with her who can explain better your disability and what is/is-not likely to happen as you get older? It sounds like a lot of this is coming from her Mother who is almost certainly ignorant and has no idea what she's talking about yet is influencing your daughter with worst case scenarios.",
            "I'm so sorry you're going through all of this. You should let her go if she wants to go. Being a carer is... draining, in not ways than one. \n\nBecause this is a you thing, you NEED to be 150+% proactive in your care. You can't coast this. You have to think if this will impact you 10, 20,, whatever years down the line. If you have kids, to you wan them to be your carers? Do you want your partner to be your carer? \n\nI know you're worried about her right now, but I'll counter that you need to worry about yourself instead. Take steps now, be fucking proactive in your healthcare, right now, to make sure you are comfortable in the future. And that hopefully that your (future) partner will also be comfortable.",
            "There is a lot going on here. Just some basic things to establish first:\n\n1.) Having a disability does not make someone any less \"valuable\" a human or a partner. It is not something that needs to be forgiven or excused or made up for. Sometimes it needs to be worked around or can block certain paths, but doing so should not imbalance a relationship.\n\n2.) Some people are not up for the work of navigating disabilities. Or they will not accept the closing of certain paths. That is okay and does not mean that they are assholes. There are millions of different configurations of disabilities and work-arounds, however, so part of the work can actually be figuring out what the work-arounds are and if there are acceptable options.\n\nIt seems to me like, on the surface, your girlfriend is increasingly aware of the work of navigating the disability and taking on the burden of figuring out possible future work-arounds. Simplistically I could tell you that you should take over the work of figuring things out for her. You can research care options where professionals would care for you should you become more severely disabled later, etc. You could provide clear instructions for her in terms of what she should do to help you and to not worry about the rest. \n\nHowever, I suspect that the issue is not just the logistic/care problems that do/might result for your disability. It sounds like you have had ample opportunity to bond without the relationship being very serious yet. You are now meeting and moving the relationship to the next stage of seriousness while your girlfriend simultaneously encounters the reality of your disability for the first time (from my understanding you just started seeing each other in person). My interpretation is that she already cares for you a lot, which is why she is so frightened. She feels pain when she sees you struggle now and is afraid of increasing her commitment to you and committing herself to pain for life. She is researching your future because she is thinking about what her future will be like by your side. And she is imagining caring for you because she does already care for you. However, the reality is that everyone grows old. And men usually die before women. Many men go suddenly with a heart attack. But any partner she has could get cancer or Alzheimer's or even be in a disabling car accident. She cannot opt out of that type of pain by choosing a partner who is seemingly healthy when young. This is the pain of commitment, and your disability is simply making her confront it earlier on. While it is totally valid for her to not be up for the day-to-day reality of your disability, I would personally want to talk with her about the idea that her anxieties actually stem more from fear of commitment than from a specific aspect of your relationship. If she feels that is possible then she should explore the subject further with self-help books, a therapist, TED Talks, her religious council, or whatever else she uses to make sense of herself/the world.\n\nOn your side, I see a lot of language that suggests to me that you have self-esteem issues with your disability/discomfort with it. The phrases that jumped out at me were:\n\n> I knew when I was a kid that using my brain is the best way for **me to survive on my own without relying on other people.**\n\nBut everyone needs to rely on other people. It is okay. It does not make you weak or a burden. No man is an island and all of that. And accommodations do not have to be other people, and even when they do, it does not have to be in a social context. Deaf people sometimes hire interpreters. Are they a burden to those interpreters? Certainly not. They are their employers. Do they rely on them? Yes. Does that make them any less valuable as human beings or any less worthy of love? Heck no! But even if you have to rely on your friends or family or coworkers in some way it is okay. Do you look down on people who rely on you? I doubt it. My guess is that you are holding yourself to a different standard.\n\n> I told her about my disability before then **but she wanted to try and make it work.**\n\nThis sounds like the default assumption is that the relationship could not work because of your disability. It also suggests that the mere fact of the disability would be a satisfactory reason for anyone to not want to have a relationship with you. Again, it is totally fine for someone to not be up for the work that comes along with a given disability, but the mere existence of a disability is a shitty reason to nix a relationship.\n\n> She's more then happy to lend me an arm and **she notices things about me that even I miss myself.**\n\nShe has only seen you in person a couple of times, right? You have been living in your body for 26 years. Do you try to distance yourself from your body/the world around you? You should be well-integrated with your body and the physical world. Physical, social and emotional pain might have all encouraged you to live inside of your head and avoid your body, your disability, and the world around you. But that is not being a healthy/well-adjusted adult. It is probably time to start doing some hard work getting to know your body and disability and loving yourself with your disability/body as an integrated part of your identity.\n\n> Outside of my family she's the most loving and caring person I know and **she's my motivation to do better and improve myself.**\n\nIt seems to me like you care for her and she cares for you, and that is what is enabling you to care for yourself. You should work with a therapist who specializes in self-esteem and disability issues to figure out how you can love yourself for yourself instead of for someone else.\n\n> Honestly, I never thought I could find someone I trusted enough to share my more negative thoughts and problems.\n\nI don't know how negative your thoughts and problems are, but if they are very bad, then you should be working on them with a therapist. If they are not very bad, then you should be working with a therapist on trust issues. A girlfriend is not a mental health professional (even if that is her job, because her relationship with you would mean that she should not treat you). If you have emotional baggage that you have been carrying around then you need to bring it to someone who has training and whose job it is to help you unpack it.\n\n> I always tried to seem happy so I don't worry others. \n\nStop doing that. Go watch Inside Out and see what sadness is for.  You deserve actually happiness as much as anyone else. And the people who love you *want* to worry about you when they need to.\n\n> The emotional support she gives me is really irreplaceable.\n\nIt is actually replaceable. It might be unprecedented in your life, but even if your relationship continues it needs to be replaced/augmented. You were trying to be your own support system before, and you have now found someone else who you are willing to let support you. But that is still not enough for you, and it is not fair to her. What happens if you break up? Is she not allowed to break up with you or you collapse? Or what if she dies? It is okay to rely on other people, but it is not okay to only rely on one person. Replace her support by 1.) stopping pretending you are happy and let other people in your life know when you struggle and 2.) working with a mental health professional on letting go of emotional baggage 3.) trying to love yourself so that no matter where you go or what happens to you you will have someone who is in your corner (bonus! People who love you don't have to fight against you to take care of you!)\n\n>  To make matters worse her mom has been telling her for the past few weeks to break up with me because **she can find better** and she doesn't want her to have the burden of caring for me.\n\nDid your girlfriend tell you this wording, or did you supply it? Whoever created that phrasing is being very shitty about your disability, and if your girlfriend repeated that phrasing to you then that was very shitty of her. What does \"better\" even mean? Your girlfriend could probably find a boyfriend who does not have CP, but that does not mean he would be \"better\". You should do a quick sanity check in terms of who believes that, including yourself. Try to avoid having people in your life who believe that, and if you, yourself believe that a boyfriend without CP is synonymous with \"better\" then I again point you to therapy.\n\n> \"my disability is going to make it really hard to find someone\" \n\nJust a word of encouragement here - Lot of things make it harder to find someone, including being gay, having a high IQ, living in a rural area, being into kinky stuff, not wanting kids, wanting 15 kids, and on and on. You are a unique person just like everyone else. It is hard for EVERYONE to find that one special person. If what you are in the market for is a committed monogamous relationship then it does not matter if 75/100 would be viable candidates or 1/100, you would only be in a relationship with one of them anyway. If you have a smaller potential pool of matches it just might take more time or online dating etc. So, you are a little bit late getting started with dating compared to your peers? It is not a race. Most of them are still sorting through a bunch of bad matches that only seemed good on the surface. Maybe you are lucky that the surface stuff weeds out a lot of shitty people from your life.\n\n> I don't know if there are things I can look into to better **plan my future so it's not a concern for my partner. **\n\nYou should plan your future for yourself. You owe yourself good healthy, safety and security. Whether or not you have a partner. I am sure that there are many resources for disability support in Canada, but r/relationships can't help you with that directly. You should look up forums specific to that or community groups near you.",

            "I dated a woman with cerebral palsy for about 6 months. We broke up for reasons unrelated to that particular disability (she later told me she was dealing with undiagnosed and untreated bipolar disorder at the time I knew her and that was why we had so many arguments/why she treated me the way she did). \n\nShe was about your age, used a wheelchair most of the time, and occasionally would use crutches. She could not walk without support. Her mobility aids allowed her to be completely self-sufficient. I didn\u2019t manage her disability and she didn\u2019t involve me in discussions about her medical history or appointments outside of teaching me how to break down and reassemble her chair. Quite frankly, it never concerned me, outside of things like making sure to consider accessibility whenever I took her on a date.\n\nShe was more physically fit than me and got around faster than me. She was extremely intelligent and a talented writer. She had the most beautiful smile I\u2019ve ever seen. She laughed at my stupid jokes and watched my silly superhero movies and shows even though she couldn\u2019t have cared less. Those are the things I admired and cared about her, not the fact that she had a physical disability.\n\nYou deserve to be with someone who loves you as you are. Who when they think of you, they think about your charming personality and how they love spending time with you and how handsome they think you are. Who doesn\u2019t look at you like a looming burden. Who admires you and loves your body and your mind. Who is prepared to go through whatever challenges the future may or may not bring.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to want to hear this, but you need to distance yourself from her and probably end the relationship altogether. It\u2019s not working for either of you and your level of codependency is unhealthy. You should not be using a girlfriend for the emotional support you should be getting from a therapist. I\u2019m not saying you have to hide your problems and be fake, but if you\u2019re talking for hours a day and unloading all your negative thoughts on someone else, that\u2019s too much. Get some talk therapy.\n\nAnd don\u2019t use other people to make yourself feel motivated. You need to cultivate some intrinsic motivation. My goodness man, you are important! The only person in life that you are guaranteed to spend the entire rest of your life with is YOU. That is by far the most important relationship you will EVER have. Develop it!! Learn how to be okay emotionally and mentally outside of a relationship. Make other friends. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re an introvert so it\u2019s too hard. I\u2019m an introvert too. I put myself out there and got uncomfortable and let myself get hurt sometimes in my vulnerability and eventually over the years I met a couple of really amazing people that are as close as family. You have discord and internet access and can leave the house too, so no excuses. \n\nTake care of yourself for you. Engage in hobbies. Go to meetups. Get an education (there are free classes online on places like edX and Coursera). Work. Volunteer. Exercise. Eat food that makes your body feel good. Get fresh air. Get a therapist. Stop faking happiness and learn how to improve your mindset. If you have a mental health issue, like depression, see a psychiatrist. \n\nWhen you are in a good place, you will be more able to discern what relationships to keep and which to ditch. You will no longer cling to unhealthy or toxic situations out of fear. You will know that if someone isn\u2019t enhancing your already fulfilling life, you don\u2019t actually need them. You will be able to choose people to be around out of a place of love and joy, and not desperation or loneliness.\n\nYou seem like a really good guy who just needs to prioritize himself more, disentangle from what looks on the outside like a codependent relationship, and seek out new people who don\u2019t see his disability as a burden. Those people are out there. Don\u2019t waste your life clinging to someone who wants to leave.",

            "Hi OP, I'm really sorry to hear you're in this situation. One thing that occurred to me is that you're only in your mid twenties, and this is your first girlfriend.   \n\n\nIf she wants to break up with you because she's worried about having to become your carer in later years, there's not really a lot you can do about that. I agree with the poster who talked about 'finding your way into a heart that wants you there'. When (not if) you meet somebody who loves you, they won't let anything stand in the way of the two of you being together. That's what we do when we love somebody, we accept them alongside whatever else they come with - whether that's the fact that they have an ex-wife, children living with them, or a disability. I'm not denying that it may be harder to meet someone in you have a disabiilty, and I think that's part of what's driving your fear here. You're worried that if she leaves, you may never meet anybody again, right? But you've already had love once, so why wouldn't you be able to meet somebody again? That's the thing about relationships: relationships teach us to have relationships. Sounds weird, I know. Now that you've had a good relationship once, and have experienced what it can add to your life, I think that when you have your next relationship you'll have learned how to open up, and what that adds to your life.   \n\n\nYou sound like a great guy and a good catch for anybody. I think you deserve somebody that will accept you as you are. I think in a relationship, if you're seeking a lasting relationship that is, you want somebody who's 100% in for it, not somebody who's maybe 60-70% in for it and who has quite significant reservations about you or what the future may hold.   \n\n\nWishing you all the best OP.",

I am leaving my partner because he wouldn't get therapy despite existing trauma that doesn't let him open up to me. I know I don't wish to handle the secretiveness and lack of communication in my life ahead and similarly, she might be realising that taking on the role of a caretaker is not what she wants down the road. You are probably the love of her life but she gets to choose what she wants. If this was after years of marriage, my views would've been different. Considering both of yours age and relationship period, it's okay. You focus on yourself for now. She'll stay when she sees you're capable of ensuring her peace of mind.\n\nYou can look into buying a health care plan that will ensure homecare in the future.

            "Everyone is giving you great advice, but there is one thing I see that\u2019s missing and that\u2019s you getting a clear understanding of your prognosis, that is the likelihood of different scenarios when it comes to your disability. For example, what are the odds of getting arthrites early? Is it manageable through medication? What are the odds of you losing mobility? At what age? Does lifting things and standing for long periods of time feel painful? Will it become so over time? Your neurologist should have approximations or at least ideas on these different likelihoods. \n\nHaving this kind of knowledge and understanding how much care you will need from a care taker in the future is very important, because otherwise you\u2019re leaving it to the future caretaker to figure it out. For example, not knowing that you are likely to get early arthritis or what that means for you and only finding out because she did that work is a sign that you\u2019re already letting her carry the invisible labour around caretaking for a disability. Even though she doesn\u2019t have to do anything now, planning for the future is part of the work, and if you had already done it it would be proof that in the future when bigger care-taking tasks are needed, she won\u2019t be the one doing all of them. \n\nAnother point I want to bring up is that in the large large majority of heterosexual couples women do more chores than men, I think it was 90min on average every day or something like that, even when they both work a day job. If the man has a physical disability,  I imagine odds are that this becomes compounded and the women have a bunch more chores and care-taking duties to do instead of enjoying their free time. Maybe this won\u2019t be the case for you, but maybe she\u2019s worried about that. Maybe she already has to do all the mental labour of planning dates, and figuring out when to chat, and finding new food places and it\u2019s showing her that she\u2019ll be \u201ccarrying the team\u201d disability or not.

She may go through hardships of taking care of you for the rest of her life but if she can find enjoyments in other aspects of the relationship who is to say that it won't work out? There is no one else other than you two that can say it won't work. If you work hard on yourself to improve your capabilities, do your stretches everyday, provide some income for her, make her smile and laugh to lessen her burden. I think she will be okay with that. I don't know her personally so I can't judge. If she sees the effort you are putting in to make this work, there will be a much higher chance that this can work out. You both have to be prepared with the physical and mental limitations that come with this but I believe that you two can make it work. Granted, you have only been together for less than a month.

Your comments about not having  a chance yet to get a license, GF is your motivation to better yourself,  your  emotional support, etc., imply you may have been putting a lot on her shoulders already, especially for such a new relationship.  \n\nDon\u2019t ever try to convince someone to stay with you, OP. Let her use her Mom\u2019s advice as her out if she wants. The transition from an online relationship to real world doesn\u2019t always work out. And walking away from your first love is tough. But even considering yourself an introvert, you found someone, & you will again. Your first relationships will help you get to know yourself better, identify what you want for your future.

I agree with most of the things that others have said - it does seem that perhaps therapy would be useful, etc. However, I just wanted to add that I just got out of a relationship with someone with cerebral palsy, and his sounds relatively similar to yours. It didn\u2019t bother me even one tiny bit - the way I see it, everyone has something, everyone has their shit. He told me about it right before our second date, and that was that. I loved all of him, which definitely included his cerebral palsy. So, I hope you know that this kind of love is possible for you. Furthermore, I (22F) have several chronic illnesses that amount to a disability (including arthritis!) and ultimately he ended the relationship at least partially due to my illnesses. So, I know how absolutely devastating it can feel to have somebody say that they cannot love you and have that be linked to your disability. This was also my first real relationship post-disability, so I understand feeling like you won\u2019t find someone again.

When I was dating I told my now husband very early on how it would be to be with me. There's no promise it won't get worse. And he accepted that.

This doesnt give me a free pass to act however I like, however there are some things he does have to deal with, which he wouldn't have to if he was with a more 'competent person'.  \nYou do not deserve this treatment, i think it is noemal for you to have low self esteem and this is the reason why you are contemplating her behaviour.   \nI hope things work out and you are young. Know that there will be someone for you wich you do not have to 'convince' you are not going to be a burden.   \nFurthermore, let's face it as you grow older, maybe you will need more help with certain things, this should never be labelled as a 'burden' of all things. This is life and if someone loves you they will not view your disability as a burden. thats horrible.",
            "My husband is 19 years older than me (together 7 years) and was disabled by heart attack and stroke (and then chronic vertigo) before we even met.\n\nPart of being together means being honest about future care taking needs. He knows that I don't really have any intention of being his primary caretaker should he become completely incapacitated. It sounds harsh, but what does that mean in real life? \n\nI'm **physically** not freaking strong enough to lift him in any meaningful way. I don't feel comfortable changing his future diapers (and he doesn't want that either; when he had the heart attack, his gf at the time insisted on playing nurse and cleaning his shit despite him saying **NO** and really mortifying him). Whether a nursing home or in home care, we'll play it by ear, but I don't plan to be his primary care giver.\n\nIn an emergency, though? I'll do whatever needs to be done. If he's in a nursing home, I'll be as moved in with him as possible. I'm not going anywhere because til death do us part. \n\nWe've already gone through a couple medical issues (diabetes diagnosis, defibrillator change) where he's had to depend on me to translate his wishes and make sure he gets the care he wants. I'm currently pregnant and severely constipated and he's literally on his way to the store to buy me fiber rich foods and Dulcolax tablets. I hope we don't have to go the suppository route, but I know he'll do whatever he needs to do to ease my suffering.\n\nBeing in a committed relationship *always* involves care taking. Whether it's a major amount necessary of a person with someone permanently in a wheelchair or just running to the store to buy pads/tampons, you both will always be caring for each other.\n\n**Young and healthy people DON'T stay young and healthy forever.** So, both of you need to talk about the absolute worst case scenario. A car accident that leaves you quadriplegic through no fault of your own. What are your expectations? Compromises? When it comes to your actual disability, what are things likely to look like when you're 85? Any different from a normal 85 year old? Is there dementia in your family?

She could leave you, meet someone who is a Poster Boy for physical fitness and then he has an accident or develops cancer or has an aneurysm and still end up being a carer for him while you are still living a healthy and productive life. *Nobody can see into the future!*  My mum and stepdad were both fit and healthy when they met. Neither of them could have anticipated that he'd have a series of strokes that would leave him completely bed bound or that his appendix would literally disintergrate to the point where the surgeons would be scooping it out in handfuls or that the strokes would trigger dementia. But she adored him to the end and never felt that the bad outweighed the good. My own SO is a brittle T1 diabetic (meaning he can go high or low without warning even though he's vigilant with his diet/meds), has a whole host of associated complications and sleep apnea.

If she she\u2019s you get desperate and try and convince her to stay, it will make it worse.  She either wants to be with you or not.  Honestly you are better off by yourself then with someone who doesn\u2019t truly love you for you.  \n\nShould she break up with you, just focus on being the best version of yourself.

You are actively trying to maintain your disability, but you or her could get in to a disabling car wreck next week or develop Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s disease 50 years from now. No one knows. Not everyone is willing to do it but when you truly love someone you do what you have to do. What if you had kids and one was special needs? Would she just leave you to deal with them yourself when it gets hard? The answer to your question is there is nothing you could do differently. One day something might take a turn for the worse, but it might not. You need someone who is willing to be in a relationship through all the bad parts and this girl isn\u2019t.

            "OP, it sounds like part of the problem here isn\u2019t your disability \u2014 it\u2019s that you aren\u2019t taking care of yourself. If you don\u2019t have a regular doctor who you visit annually, who is familiar with your condition and is monitoring you and advising you on health developments as you age, then there are lots of things that could get missed. You say that you\u2019re not aware of your disease prognosis or what aging would look like; that\u2019s something I would definitely look into if I were you. \n\nFor most chronic health conditions, the choices you make throughout your life will effect the severity of deterioration later in, and can improve your overall life expectancy. Medicines and therapies are continually being developed. Diseases are being researched and understood. \n\nYour disability does not have to define you, but it most certainly does matter. The quality and length of your life may depend on you catching developments early and preventative measures, all of which need the guidance of a knowledgable physician and medical care team. \n\nIf you were more knowledgable about your own health and could show that you\u2019re serious about your body and taking care of it by being able to point to your relationships with your doctors, then potential partners would be less likely to need the Internet to explain your condition to them. You could explain it. You could guide their understanding, so that they aren\u2019t just falling into horror stories and worst case scenarios on web forums and cooypasta medical articles that may not apply to you at all. \n\nI think that\u2019s the real issue here. It may be that this woman is not the right one for you, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s super painful to go through a breakup like this. Welcome to the world of dating.

Your disability doesn\u2019t make you un-dateable, it sounds like you\u2019re a great partner. \n\nTo avoid this particular concern in the future, I think you need to take more control of your healthcare and be proactive about your disease. Understand your prognosis fully. Be ready to help others understand what life with you would be like, and makes sure you\u2019re planning adequately for your future by setting enough money aside, eating right and exercising, and just generally taking care of your body and mind.",

You can't promise your gf or anyone that you won't get worse. Even able-bodied people could become disabled at any time. Either she can deal with it or she can't. You obviously need to do sensible things to take care of yourself, but it's not on you to magically become less disabled in order to make things easier. \n\nIf you are going to be a couple you both need to be prepared to learn and adapt.\n\nCheck out vlogs on YouTube with couples where one or both is disabled. You might find Squirmy & Grubs (Hannah & Shane) interesting because he is severely disabled and she does all of his care and sees it as a normal, even enjoyable part of their relationship. There are other couples where the disabled partner hires carers, as they feel it would negatively impact their relationship if the partner did the care. Both approaches are totally valid and workable, and it just depends on the couple. The point is that they have all figured out ways of making it work that don't result in burnout or resentment. The right person will work with you to find solutions. \n\nYou can't make her stay if that's not what she wants. And you don't deserve to feel under constant pressure to be well \u2013 no-one can live under that type of pressure long term.\n\nI hope there is someone out there for me \u2013 who can handle my physical limitations.

            "I  would suggest thinking about your disability and relationships in a different perspective. Your cerebral palsy acts as a filter to future partners. Everyone, disability or no, has the potential to require extra care from a partner whether due to aging, injury, illness or disability. Laying out the fact that you have cerebral palsy from the get go helps to filter out potential partners who would not be around for difficult times anyway. \n\nDoes your girlfriend have the right to worry about this? Sure. She can worry about anything she wants and anything can be a deal breaker for her the same way that someone not willing to risk the possibility you might require extra care can be a deal breaker for you. All in all, I would suggest having a very candid conversation with your health care team about what you might expect to happen as you age. I would then have that conversation with your girlfriend. \n\nIt would also likely help to find a therapist to help provide tools to manage your feelings about your disability. At the end of the day your are much more then your disability and a good partner will see that.",

Especially if the information she found tend to focus on more severe cases without giving a reasonable idea of how common those are.\n\nI would suggest talking it out with her to really understand what her fears are focused on. Find out what it would take to address her concerns and make her feel comfortable about what lies ahead.\n\nI would also suggest looking for a cerebral palsy support group in your area where you can meet some older people and see how they live and cope.\n\nLastly, you say you\u2019re a software developer. I assume that means you earn reasonably well. I would strongly suggest you pursue financial independence seriously. Work out how how much you need to be able to continue living comfortably and come your medical/related expenses, include paying for a carer. Then save and invest life depends on it. /r/financialindependence and /r/fire has some good info (i think there are CA specific ones too).

            "In addition to what others are saying about finding more outlets of support (to reduce your dependence on your girlfriend), you may want to investigate social service options should your disability get worse. Your gf is really young and the idea of having to take on so much is overwhelming. If you can tell her that it won't all fall on her because, if your situation degrades, you can get help/support from people who are paid to assist, she may feel less pressure. I don't know if such agencies exist in Canada, but they do in the U.S. \n\nYou may find it hard to do this, but I would look at it from a pragmatic point of view. And, if you need any assistance now, get it if it is available. This isn't just about your current girlfriend, but about your whole life ahead of you.

            "Hello OP, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a hard time right now. \n\nSo, my husband and I both have invisible disabilities. We love each other and care for one another and enjoy each other\u2019s company more than anyone else\u2019s (we do have outside support, do not worry). But there are days that it is HARD. For me as a person with a disability, I think we have to accept that there are days that things are going to be hard and there are days that you are going to have to go to other people for help. When I have those days, my husband does his best to support me. When he has his, I do my best to support him. Care taking is part of a partnership and is especially important in a relationship involving disabilities. \n\nThat being said, I do not think everyone is cut out for it. Looking back on past relationships, I can see that my issues were overwhelming for some at times. The way I see it, if they don\u2019t feel like they can handle that then they need to be free to leave. They deserve to feel comfortable in their relationship and you deserve someone who is willing to provide what you need in a relationship. If the relationship isn\u2019t a fit and your needs are not in alignment, it\u2019s best to let it go. We are overwhelming for some people. I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s right, but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s part of our experience as disabled people and we deserve people in our lives that don\u2019t see us that way. \n\nThere are other people who will want to be in a relationship with you. Be patient and work on yourself in the meantime. As others have mentioned, it can be very overwhelming if you feel like you are all your partner has. It sounds like you might be putting a lot on her emotionally and she may not be equipped for that or be comfortable with it. I was previously in a relationship with someone with a physical disability. He wasn\u2019t the most independent, much less than what you\u2019ve described for yourself. While I was able to manage that part of the relationship, it was the emotional pressure he put on me that I couldn\u2019t deal with. I was his one and only friend, support person, and emotional outlet, and every negative feeling he had was mine to deal with (not saying you are that way but just to explain). I was his first real girlfriend, so he tried elderly hard to cling on when there really wasn\u2019t much of a relationship left to cling to. It was too much and I was too young to navigate it at the time. So, while you look for a partner, make sure you are keeping your emotional expectations in check and try to cast a wider support net. \n\nSorry to continue rambling but I also want to add that the mom being so concerned and so involved is a huge red flag. I\u2019m not saying that can\u2019t be overcome but you\u2019re in for a rough time with that. You deserve someone whose feelings about you are not changed by other people\u2019s opinions of your disability. \n\nRemember that true partnerships are not found and clung to. They are built with intention by two people who deeply value one another. Do not look for someone you feel like you have to hold on to for dear life. Find someone you can build with. Good luck, friend!",

            "So I was with my ex for 9 years and even though sometimes I was bothered by his disability because he couldn't do stuff (he limped and his left arm didnt work) most of the time I forgot about him being disabled. Sometimes I did worry about my future because he was on disability and trying to become a streamer (but you sound like you are really trying and you have a good job), so I think honestly it might be that perhaps she is not attracted to you? Or something emotionally. I don't think it necessarily has to do with your disability.",

            "So I met my partner when I was more far functional with my disability. He knew about it from the get go. He knew it could get worse or it could not. He didn't run or doubt me or hint at breaking up if it did. Then it did get worse. He didn't run or say he was going to leave me because we love each other. It's tough on us both and I still do as much as possible for myself. I'd honestly be an anxious mess afraid to admit anything was wrong with me if my partner hinted at leaving me if my disability got worse. That would be a source of constant fear and anxiety in the relationship which isn't healthy for either person. \n\nAlso does she understand CP isn't degenerative and most people with arthritis lead functional lives? It's also rare that you get arthritis as a morbidity and that's what fully disables you. Plus there are a lot of arthritis treatments these days. \n\nI would explain this about CP and arthritis and if she's still acting like this, then I'm sorry but she isn't the right fit for you.

            "I'm married to a man with CP who is mobile but has balance issues. He's been through arthritis, orthopedic surgery, injuries, workplace discrimination, just a whole bunch of crap related to his condition. Also, when we were first dating, my mom tried to get me to break up with him because she was afraid I would end up being my husband's caretaker instead of his life partner. None of these things matter in the least as far as whether I want to stay with him. He is a great guy and I'm not going to break up with him because of anything related to his CP.\n\nHere's the thing: a woman who loves you for you won't care that you have CP. But it's also important to acknowledge that your CP may affect your ability to do stuff -- not just what you are personally capable of doing but also the things you can do as a couple, because of distance, accessibility, etc. Communication is key. Talk about how you both feel. A medical condition can affect all aspects of your life but your partner can be your greatest ally in finding ways to live your best possible life.",

            "So I have chronic health conditions and was diagnosed with allergies. I'm in support groups, people who live with the conditions or have other conditions. My ex was very supportive in the beginning but towards the end there was a shift and he kept commenting on future hypothetical situations that may or may not ever happen or how his family would feel about my health. It got to the point where he said something very mean and hurtful about my health and we broke up. Recently he reached out and told me that he was feeling stressed and overwhelmed by other things, and lashed out at me about my health but the problem wasn't my health. The problem was he couldn't talk about his emotions and he didn't want to talk about his problems. My advice to you is for your girlfriend to join a support group for family members and friends and for you to join a support group too. Sit down and talk about what the actual issues are. And remember, sometimes people can say they are really caring, but can't put the effort in to actually be caring. So if you do breakup, it's not because there is something wrong with you.",

            "It's going to be okay, so try not to let your anxieties overwhelm you. \n\nIt sounds like you are very capable, and that is awesome. That means you are capable of paying for and arranging home support work should you need it in your later life. In Canada there are many programs to help you receive care in your home privately if you need help with some tasks as you get older. You could pay for private home support for only a few tasks a day if you like, like helping you get up out of bed and helping you get dressed. We do that for a family member, he is independant so we pay for 2 hours of support a day, to help him get up, and to help him get to bed. He can handle the in between stuff with devices like those chairs that stand you up with a motor, and we are just a call away if he needs!\n\nMaybe start a fund specifically for your medicle needs that won't be covered entirely by ON Health, like private home support and medicle devices that may be able to help you if you reach the point of needing them. Your doctor should be able to give you the best advice for your individual situation since CP is such a variable disorder. You could be this same level of ability into your 60s, there is not telling exactly how it will play out as you age. Your doctor will be the best help there.\n\nI know a woman with CP,  her case is more sevear than yours it sounds like, with needing a speech device and a motorized chair to get around and communicate effectively. She has home care and family help. She is a university graduate, has a boyfriend, goes shopping with her girlfriends (both regular and differently abled), goes out to restaurants, and has a taste for expensive champagne lol! \n\nPut yourself out there and make some more friends while you are at it, if you can. Your girlfriend sounds like she loves and cares about you, her mother sounds like she might have some problematic biases against people with disabilities. Having more friends around is always a blessing and helps with the loneliness. Also it may alleviate some pressure on your GF if she is feeling like she is entirely responsible for your emotional care. Not saying that she dose, just if you are concerned about burdening her too much that could be a consideration. \n\nAlso a therapist is not a bad idea. Someone who can help you work through your darker thoughts in a constructive way, someone that understands the burden of living with CP. It might help. \n\nHave a think on these things and I hope it helps in some way! Good luck!",

He responded with 'poor girl' and nothing else.\n\nThis morning we video call him as was planned during breakfast for our kid to say hello to daddy. He answers without video which is not normal. We call frequently with video. I asked when did you get home and he kinda hesitated before saying 3am. He offered nothing else.\n\nI found this morning he took a lyft to Chinatown at 1120pm PST and didn't cab back to his hotel til 3am.\n\nHe messages me nothing, says nothing so I message him after breakfast about being out all night and he says he needed to take a walk. Says no cheating happened.\n\nThis man has a terrible sense of direction. Cant read a map etc. But went for a walk in a city he doesnt know from 1130pm-3am... Huh?\n\nAnd mentioned nothing about it even though he knew I was awake here at the same time changing sheets on the east coast. Why not mention that he cant sleep and am headed out? No pictures or comments about his walk. Says he was going to mention it in the morning.\n\nThoughts? My nerves are shot. He has a major history of being dishonest. This was our time to be transparent and open to rebuild trust for our family. Why leave his hotel (which is already on the water with a fantastic view) in the middle of the night?\n\nI'm ready to pack up and leave him.\n\n**Edited to add (after suggestions from commenters): He started living sober in December but also has a deep history with gambling and prostitution.  I made some serious and stupid concessions to forgive and rebuild because of history, hope, having not many options of my own and a small child. Seems he is possibly making the same choices and traveling the same path anyway.  He makes a lot of promises and I wanted to believe we were building but is apparently allergic to truth and loyalty. **\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend out 1130pm-3am when he said was going to bed.

I discovered my ex taking out $200 @ a time, late night and discovered he had a regular escort he hired while away on business. That put my health at risk and I had a right to know this info and he surely wasn't going to tell me.....im a normal female, not crazy or a lunatic, I have a real grip on reality, have normal healthy relationships but I had a need to know and the guts (because it was nerve racking to \"snoop\") to find the truth for myself. \n\nSo yes, you basically know what he was doing but you deserve to know exactly what and by any means necessary.....\n\nI know what you're feeling and basically it is the worst, it's so consuming to wonder, once I knew the truth then I confidently left him.\n\nBut only you know what you need to be at peace so be comfortable in whatever it is you decide ...xoxo",

If he makes you feel trapped, he can escalate the cycle of abuse by doing whatever he wants and knowing you can't leave.\n\nNow comes the hard part: leaving.  There are several concrete steps to take.\n\n1) First, you need an order of protection. Contact the local courthouse.  State you are pregnant and being abused and you need an emergency order of protection.\n\nYou will likely qualify for a free attorney. Explain that your husband is gambling away the money you would use to leave him, mocking you when you try to leave him, using drugs, and exposing you to STDs through prostitutes.  You are afraid of him and his lies are escalating.  You fear leaving him.\n\nIf you are (very likely) granted an order of protection, he will not be able to enter the house.  This will give you time to pack and safely plan your escape.\n\n2) Go to the social security office.  Tell them your entire situation.  You will likely qualify for several benefits that can help with food and housing costs.\n\nPM me if there's anything I can do to assist.",

Even if he was going to tell you in the morning.\n\nEven if all of those things are true, its still okay for you to not be okay with the things that he says are actually true:\n\nNot mentioning it even though he would have known you were awake.\nGoing out for four hours in a new town in the middle of the night.\nA total lack of transparency.\nHe admittedly took all of these actions knowing that he has a history of lying - and there are probably agreements between you guys for no sneaking around.\n\nIt\u2019s okay for just the bottom list to be true, and for that to be too much to stay in this relationship. You tried to make it work and gave him a second (or more) chance. He failed it.",
            "I understand your feelings, but damn! Can't a dude just go out and explore and do things without having to log and check-in with someone else? It sucks how we lose all of our individuality in a relationship and can't simply do things out on a whim. I can see why you're upset, but i can also see why he just wanted to do his own thing for a night on his own before he goes home to his monotonous life.",

            "I live in SF bay area and vices he likes are available in that area but could be said for many places.  7 months sobriety, sole (?) support of family with 2nd baby on the way, obvious relapse, considering a major geographic move - recipe for a spectacular failure or success for you both.  It requires planning and preparing for any and all situations, whether together or not.   Seek legal advice, consultations are free.  If you move you have to establish residency before you can file for divorce, usually 6 months, that's a lot of time he doesn't have to give you a penny, pay rent, buy food, etc., if you're not together.   Prepare to get a job, go back to school - childcare is expensive especially for infants although there are daycare centers and low-cost programs for this situation.  Get help for you both - individual AND couples counseling, AA, NA meetings for him and ala-non for you.  Seek programs for low-cost and no-cost help, food, clothing, shelter, child-care, health insurance, legal help -  there may be  residency requirements before you're eligible and waiting lists for some programs.  SF has great resources.  I've been where you are, and with brutally honesty towards myself and the  situation I picked myself up, weathered the shitstorm and succeeded to build a great life with my 2nd husband (22 years now) and 3 kids but I researched, found help, built my self-esteem and set boundaries.

I would even go as far to check the lyft app contact the driver and ask him what your boyfriend was up to (make up a story of course) but that's just me being petty and wanting to slam it in their face before I leave and go make a better life for myself.

            "None of the activity you described is particularly guilty looking in and of itself. SF is a great city with a lot of shit to do at night and a wonderful place to just wander in. I've done the same in those areas of town. The problem isn't what he did, it's that you don't trust him, and he isn't giving you reasons to trust him.\n\nFrom what you've said in other responses, the guy has a history if being a louse. And if he's really, truly reformed, he needs to be working his ass off at helping you trust him. And he clearly isn't doing that.\n\nEven under a best case scenario, if he isn't doing anything wrong on his side, he's still being evasive and that's leading you to have trust issues, which leads him to feel hen-pecked, which leads to him being more evasive and it's just one giant spiral down the toilet.\n\nSo yeah, even in a best case scenario, there's a lot of severe obstacles here with regards to not having enough trust and open communication, and you've gotta evaluate for yourself if that's something you want to keep dealing with, or keep turning a blind eye to as things spiral out of control. And that's a best case scenario.",
            "Im so sorry OP,\n\nI know my comment is going to be lost at the bottom, & you prob wont see it, but I still wanted to add my voice to the chorus of others trying to be honest & supportive of you....\n\nI wish I could say something that would help alleviate your pain - im sorry i cant \ud83d\ude14\n\nIve notices lots of ppl focusing on the fact he was out so long at night, taking a lyft, 'walking' pondering on drug/alcohol / cheating behaviour- & that is *all* important stuff-....\n\n BUT- the thing that ***really*** stood out for me , was the fact he didnt answer your videocall with your child... im a mom & a step mom, so i understand complex family dynamics- but i also understand how big /important video calls with a parent are- especially to very young kids.... *especially* when that parent is usually around, but isn't home tonight.... \n\nThat set off like- the fireworks of red flags for me,  coupled with his \"poor girl\" reply- .... Im so sorry he has treated you/your family with such callous disrespect. ....\n\nIf he was having trouble sleeping, & knew you were awake, why not just lay in his hotel bed alone, talking to you until he was tired enough ti drop off to sleep?? \n\nI know if i was away from my family overnight,  for any reason- i would have trouble sleeping too- but the thing that would bring me the most comfort, would be talking to / seeing them in a video call. .... (esp if thats already an established thing within your family!)\n....\n\nIdk what his past indescretions were, but if this was meant to be the time for your family to rebuild trust- i believe it was serious stuff- & he is not taking it seriously enough.... ..\n\nI dont knkw you or your family, but I do know what it is like to be up all night with your nerves & anxiety in hyperdrive,  while your oartner is off fucking around, & not even bothering to videocall the kids.... at a minimum, thats some serious selfishness.... but i feel like you already know what was *really* going on.... -& now its time to work out what you want your next step to be, for you & your child....\n\nThis is heavy, serious stuff, & he needs to treat it as such, bot gaslight you &make you feel like you're being unreasonable - i promise- you are not....\n\nYou need to taje care of your child, & sometimes what is best fir the child, is for the parents to seperate, rather than trying to keep a relationship together 'for the kids' - \n\nTheres - so much wrong here....\n\nI couldnt recommend seeing a counseller high enough- having an outside, objective person who you can be completely honest with, is absolutely a huge help..... sometimes it can take seeing a few ppl till you find someone you 'click' with,  but when you do, it is totally worth it!!\n\n(& if he suggests couples counselling, thats great! Go along if you feel you want to, just make sure its not your personal counseller that he wants to come see.... if he shows *any* sign of not wanting you to see a therapist on your own, that is another huge red flag.... )\n\n....\nIm sorry if i have written too much, or spoken out of place, if you've read this far down, thank you-\n\n(I promise i didnt take time out of my day to write all this just to waste your time, or for no reason- I did it because i have been in some really shitty relationships, & I simply didnt know just how bad they were until i was out of them, ... -& because i want you to have a happy, safe, peaceful, honest home to raise your child in)\n\nOnce kids are involved, everythimg becomes a billion times more complicated - but as a mom- I know you will do the right thing by your child, even if it's incredibly hard & painful for you - being a mom gives you super powers! Dont be afraid to use them!!\n\nI wish you all the very best - with much love & hugs!\n\n\u2764\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9b",

I'm sorry I didn't reply to any of the comments on the original post, it blew up a bit and you guys seemed to cover all the bases. I read all the comments two or three times, thanks Reddit. The only question I remember seeing is how did she get my contact information, the answer is that while I have my ex blocked on Facebook due to repeated attempts to contact me a couple of years ago, I am still easily searchable by others and have an uncommon name. Also, a couple people thought that she was only 20 years old, but what I meant in the title was that I assumed she was in her 20s but wasn't sure of her age. She was not that young.\n\n\nI did write the girl back and essentially said that I was sorry she was going through such a hard time, that my relationship with my ex was a really hard time in my life, that she must be in a rough spot to reach out to me of all people, and that I'd be happy to talk with her any way she was comfortable if she needed.\n\n\nShe wrote me back and asked to meet in person. My SO (like some of you) was a little paranoid that it was some kind of set up or that my ex would show up so I made sure it was in a public place and he was nearby in case I needed help. Nothing dramatic like that happened, sorry /r/relationships :P\n\n\nWithout going in to too much detail of her personal life.. The short story is from what she has said, he hasn't changed a bit. Some of the manipulation tactics he used he must have found from a script somewhere or something, it was word for word. He had been gaslighting her BIG TIME and that is essentially why she reached out to me, to see if she was really crazy and a bad girlfriend or if he was like this to me too. I tried to keep it to the facts, told some stories that I felt like she needed to hear to compare our situations. I had no intentions of telling her what I thought she should do, just to give her the information I had and let her make her decision, but that kind of went to the wayside. When she told me that things had started to get slightly physical, I told her in no uncertain terms that she needed to get out as soon as possible and that it would probably get worse. I told her that if one of my girlfriends came to me with something like this we wouldn't be sitting there anymore, that I'd be packing her shit for her. She admitted that he had isolated her from a lot of her friends and that none of them knew how bad it really was.\n\n\nShe seemed resolved to get out of the situation. I know it's easy to say these things in the heat of the moment but she must have known that the prognosis of their relationship wasn't good considering it had already reached a point where she was sitting across from his ex from three years ago. I told her how relieved I was when we finally broke up for good, that aside from some initial anxiety about running into him I felt really free and that the relationships I've pursued since then have been night and day and made me embarrassed that I put up with him for so long. She asked me what she could expect when she leaves him, which I thought was very smart of her to ask, and I told her what he had been like for me. I advised her to use her support system to get out safely, and to go no contact immediately. I told her some of the things he used to say to me to get me to think he was going to change and not to believe a word of it.\n\n\nMy SO was extremely sweet, while he initially raised an eyebrow at the situation and said he wondered why I'd get involved, he supported me once I said that if there was a chance I could help someone who might really be in a bad situation I should do it. \n\n\nI hope she can get out of this situation and never look back.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: I met with my asshole ex's current girlfriend and got her version of the events. We shared similar experiences and I advised her to RUN.",
