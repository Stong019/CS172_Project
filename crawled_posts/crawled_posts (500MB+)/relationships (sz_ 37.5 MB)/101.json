This was a very hard time, my father and I were close and it was just horrible to see him this sick.\n\nMy best friend and I are friends since we were both 4 years old. I thought real, lifelong friends.\n\n My best friend was on a trip in New-Zealand for most of the time when my father was ill. She did not have much internet access so we did not speak much. I informed her about my dad often but since there were some internet problems we didn't talk much.\n\nMy father died 1.5 months ago. My best friend was back in the country for a month when it happend. \n\nHer reaction when I told about the passing; omgg i am so sorry are you ok? I said; well, not too well but what can i do.. I was obviously very sad. She then started talking about a fight she had with a friend of her.\n\nI was quite shocked but just talked along with her.\n\nMy father had a small funeral, only the closest family members were allowed.\nAfter the convo where I told my friend that he passed; she never asked about him again.\n\nThis is 1.5 month ago. Not once did she ask about the funeral, how I feel, nothing.\nI am so baffled and sad. I always have her back when she had troubles. Now I feel like she does not care at all. What can  I do? She is basically my only friend..i have social issues that's why.\n\n**TL;DR my father died and my best friend doesn't seem to care. It hurts. **\n\n\nUPDATE; \n**Wow. I am so overwhelmed by all the sweet comments. Thank you so much, it really makes me feel a lil better in these difficult times. I will politely discuss my feelings with my friend and then see how she reacts.\n\nThank you reddit \u2764**",

            "I am so sorry that you've lost your father at such a young age. I lost my father when I was 16. I've been exactly where you are so I hope I might be able to help you out here. Unfortunately, it's not all good.\n\nTeenagers tend to be fundamentally self-centered. No offense meant. It's just kind of a fact of nature. Most kids your age are completely unprepared to deal with something as serious and impactful as this. Their typical response will be to just ignore it. It's awful, but they're really not equipped to do much else. I'm sure you've noticed this in other areas. You probably feel that most of your peers are still living in a na\u00efve, childish world where everything is easy and the biggest concern is who is dating who. While you have been forced to grow up and face the real world.\n\nWhen my father died, I also lost my best friend and our small group that we hung out with. They stopped calling, stopped inviting me out, and I eventually quit trying. It was hard. It hurt a lot and it honestly still hurts a little bit. But as a result, I was forced to seek out new friends (I had social issues as well) and become much closer to the couple of acquaintances that didn't push me away. I found much kinder, empathetic, and overall better people to be friends with. Those people are still my best friends.\n\nI think you should reach out to your friend and tell her how you feel. Try not to be accusatory or attack her. Tell her that you're having a very hard time, you miss her, and you could really use her help getting you through this. Don't make it about the fact that she's been neglectful because that will just make her defensive. Make it about the fact that you need her help right now. She may step up to the task or she may not, but you should let her know that you need her help.\n\nIf it doesn't work out, you should know that there are so many other great and worthwhile people out there to make lifelong friendships with. Most people don't end up staying best friends with the friends they made at 4. You're going to make lots of new friends as a young adult that will be in a mental place to empathize with you, cry with you, and love you.  \n\nAgain, I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. Please do not hesitate to seek out grief counseling and other forms of therapy. \n\nEdit: I'd like to add a little more to give some insight into your friend's headspace. It's very hard to know what to do in these situations. My best friend just lost his father a few months ago and even with my experience, I still struggled to figure out what to say and how to reach out. I love the dude, but I didn't know what he needed from me. It may just be that she's scared of saying something wrong and making things worse. If you reach out to her and let her know what you need from her, she might be happy to help you out. It's very possible that she's just scared and doesn't know how to approach the situation.",
            "Honestly she's probably trying not to bring it up in case it unravels whatever composure you've gained since it happened. I know that if my friends dad died I'd never mention it for fear of upsetting them\n\nEdit: and I'm 18 also so it could well be an age thing ",
            "First off, sorry for your loss. Can't imagine how that hurts to see your father die at such a young age.\n\nBut to your friend: I don't think I would know how to react at age 18 if my father had died, much less how to react if it weren't my father, but the father of a friend had died. She could very well be thinking \"the best thing I can do right now is get my BFF's mind off of the death of her father.\"\n\nSo if you want to talk about it, it's going to be up to you to bring it up.",
            "I mean, in all honesty she's just a kid. And kids aren't great at consoling others when things like this happen. Losing a parent is probably so out of her realm of understanding that she literally doesn't know how to handle the situation. She could think that avoiding the issue all together is best because brining it up might be reminding you of it. She could definitely still care about it.\n\nYou should just speak to her and figure out what she's thinking, and why she doesn't seem to talk about it more. If you're such close friends, this should be how you handle these things. Communication is a two way street.",
            "My best friend's father died a few years ago, and I can tell you it's REALLY hard to know what the right thing to do is. Do I bring it up? If I do, am I making her more sad because I'm reminding her of it? Or should I talk about other things to distract her from the pain? \n\nI think your friend probably just doesn't know what you want/need from her right now. I would send her a message or (if you can) talk in person that you want her to ask more often about how you're doing, or ask you about your dad, or encourage you to tell stories, etc... See if her behavior changes, she is probably just super uncomfortable with the topic and doesn't want to bring it up for fear of upsetting you.",
            "Honestly, most people don't really know what to say in these circumstances. Especially if they've never been through it themselves. *Especially* if they're only teenagers and have barely given any thought to the hardships of long term illness and mortality. It's a difficult thing to get your head round.\n\nWhen I was going through my biggest family tragedy, my best friend at the time tried to 'cheer me up' instead of simply consoling me. At the time I thought it was a bit insensitive but we actually spoke about it and he said that he was embarrassed that he didnt know what to say and thought because we always joked around that's what I wanted from him. Honestly, maybe having a friend cheer me up really was the best thing at the time so I didn't dwell in the grief.\n\nI don't think it means she doesn't care about you. But she has no idea what to say or do so is just avoiding it. I'm not saying that makes things OK, it doesn't, but maybe we all shouldn't expect our mates to automatically know the right thing to say. They're not going to have professional levels of great advice, sadly, despite how useful that would be.\n\nMy advice is to do what me and my friend did and make the first step to talk about it. Maybe talk about the heavy stuff with a professional and let your friend be a friend and try to distract you and cheer you up.",
            "Wow. I am so overwhelmed by all the sweet comments. Thank you so much, it really makes me feel a lil better in these difficult times. I will politely discuss my feelings with my friend and then see how she reacts.\n\nThank you reddit \u2764",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. My father died when I was 21 so I have some experience here.\n\nI remember feeling so hurt that my friends weren't asking me if I was okay. There was the initial \"I'm so sorry, if there's anything I can do let me know\" and then they'd start talking about other things. I got really drunk one night and went home alone crying, didn't tell any of them I'd left (we all lived together at uni) and was furious at them because I'd built up all this anger that they didn't care. One of them came and spoke to me in the morning, and I was hungover and calmed down, but still upset. I explained it to him, and he said to me \"No one wants to ask you how you're feeling about your dad, because none of us want to upset you. We thought we should distract you and talk about other stuff and keep you happy, because we didn't want you to feel sad. We thought if you wanted to talk about it, you would and we'd be here for you. But we're all scared to mention it and ruin you day.\"\n\nI understood after that. My friends were all 19-21 at the time, and at that age you don't know how to act in emotional situations. You can't really grasp loss and grief unless you've been through it, and I'm guessing your friend hasn't. It's likely she doesn't want to mention your dad, because she knows that will upset you. Her talking about the fight is her trying to distract you and make you feel normal.\n\nIf you want to talk about your dad to her, do it. If she's a good friend she'll listen. She probably won't bring it up, and I know that sounds heartless, but she doesn't want you to be sad. ",
            "I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, and I want to give you some advice because I\u2019ve been in the same situation. I was 12 when my mom passed away 10 years ago and my best friend at the time was the only one out of all of my close friends that didn\u2019t attend the funeral. Even my soccer team came. She never once asked how I was and never wanted to bring it up. Granted we were younger than you are now and it\u2019s more awkward at that age, but it hurt a lot and I never forgave her for it. I broke off from her a year later, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken me this long because she had already proven she was a toxic friend in other ways before that. \n\nI\u2019m not saying do the exact same thing, but take a step back and see whether this is the only discrepancy/bad part of your friendship. If it is, she may just be unsure of how to talk about it with you and doesn\u2019t want to make you upset, as this happened to me with most of my friends at that time. It\u2019s easy for people to seem insensitive about your situation because each survivor wants people to react a certain way. Some of us even prefer not to be asked about it while others do. \n\nHowever, if this isn\u2019t the only discrepancy that\u2019s happened in your friendship then I\u2019d take a long look and the pros and cons of your relationship and figure out if it\u2019s worth it to continue. I also know from experience that it\u2019s easier to stay in such a long friendship only because you don\u2019t want to cut off x years of knowing each other until all you have in common is the past.\n\nI would just go up and ask her about it because if you don\u2019t, it\u2019ll turn into hidden resentment that will affect the relationship. Ask her if she\u2019s afraid to talk about your father\u2019s passing with you or if there\u2019s another reason. Don\u2019t make it a yes or no question. Good luck, I hope you can find peace. ",
            "I am so sorry that you are going through this. It is devastating and traumatic. While I haven't lost a parent yet, my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year. \n\nThis is what I've learnt: people, especially very young people, just don't know how to act around you. It's scary for them too because you're an example of how their own lives could be suddenly disrupted by the death of a parent. They don't want to think about it and they don't know what to say to you. They might justify it by thinking that they want to take your mind off it and talk about other things, so many will never say anything at all. \n\nEven worse, people often say that you can always talk to them, but of course they don't really mean it because they don't know how to react when you do. \n\nMy advice here would be to be honest and open. \"Friend, I'm really struggling at the moment. I miss my dad a lot and I feel like ___\". Don't wait for her to ask, just talk. Be aware that it might make her uncomfortable, but grief is an uncomfortable thing. \n\nIn the mean time, see whether you could get some bereavement counselling - your friend is not your therapist and she has already demonstrated that she doesn't know how to cope with this news. ",
            "I lost my father at 16, just under 2 weeks before my 17th birthday so I know where you're coming from. Similarly, I have been in the exact same position -- people I had known since I was 5 stopped talking to me, or ignored that it even happened.   \n\n\nPeople are wankers. There's no two-ways about it. What I found was that during this time, I realised a lot about those I knew and considered friends -- people I had known for less than a year came to his funeral, but people I knew for over a decade didn't even send their condolences. In fact, you should use this as a turning point to re-evaluate the relationships with those you know, though each case is subjective. \n\nIt will hurt. It will always hurt. People will always consider their own problems before other peoples'. You have a number of options in how to proceed, generally - either you continue to talk to this problem and bring it up, live in ignorance, or cut off everything completely quietly or have a full blown argument -- though you're more than likely going to see their true colours in doing so. \n\nTime. More than anything else, you need time and your immediate family. Friends come and go, but your mother/siblings are your best support system. Equally, you should focus on how they're coping with it and make sure you all come out of this stronger. This hurts, and not all families are the same, but believe me -- everything for the next few years will be tender and a lot of things are going to change. ",
            "I just lost my father this year (though I'm much older than you). My two best friends came to the funeral but only stayed a few minutes. Only one of them has bothered to check on me (a single \"how are you?\" text) since. I was a bit hurt by that but I'm trying not to be angry. I know it's hard to know what to do or say when someone you care about suffers a loss. Since we're older and I feel like they should be better equipped for things like this, I was still kind of appalled (especially when they popped in to the funeral lunch, barely spoke to me and left minutes later; they didn't even stay for lunch, and I felt like it would have helped me to have them there). Part of it, I wonder, is their fear of losing their own parents. One of my friends' dads is significantly older than the rest of our parents, she could be thinking about losing him and not able to cope with the reality of a parent dying. I can't blame her for worrying about that so I'm trying to be understanding. The other friend \u2014 well, she's always been a bit immature and selfish, not in a mean way, but she just kind of doesn't get things like this.\n\nIt sounds like your friend is a bit immature and basically doesn't know what to say. Even though there's no \"right\" thing to say. But I don't blame you for being upset. It hurts to feel like someone who's close to you doesn't care.\n\nI'm really sorry about your dad. I think it's rough no matter how old you are. I miss my dad and think of him constantly. The one thing that consoles me a little is the knowledge that I was really lucky. I had an awesome dad and he got to see me through a lot of life milestones. I'm proud to be his daughter, and I'm really grateful he raised me and instilled his great values in me. I feel like I was really lucky in that aspect since so many people have crappy parents. It sounds like your dad was really great too.",
            "Most people don't know what to say regarding death. Even adults avoid seeing friends who are grieving.  ",
            "As it\u2019s been said in previous comments it\u2019s hard to consolidate someone. I\u2019m 22 and a friends uncle died recently and I still struggled with what to say. \n\nYour friend probably thinks the best idea to help you grieve is make you think of other unrelated things. When my friends are going through rough patches I know they would much rather I continue behaving normally towards them rather than changing my behaviour because of what they are going through. ",
            "I\u2019ve been on both sides. I did this by accident to someone and it\u2019s one of my biggest regrets. She didn\u2019t wait around for me to \u201cget it\u201d and I don\u2019t blame her. It\u2019s not excusable but just note people are not always predictable/reliable and this was a big mistake whether she recognizes it or not. \n\nOpen your net wider because there are people that will be there for you...people you may not expect. I\u2019m so sorry all of this is happening at once. ",
            "When my best friends dad died last year, she took off school for a month. (We are college students.) Half of my friends didn\u2019t even contact her. They didn\u2019t know how to respond to a tragedy like that. Naturally, my friend cut them out of her life for not being supportive, but even 20+ year olds can struggle with addressing issues like this. \n\nYour friend may not want to bring it up because she doesn\u2019t know how to talk about it, or maybe she doesn\u2019t want to bring it up so she isn\u2019t constantly reminding you of it. \n\nAll I know is that people deal with these things in different ways, and her way may be ignoring it all together because she is emotionally immature. ",
            "It's possible I'll get downvoted since I'm going against the rest of the comments but hear me out. I've had something similar happen to me as well when I was 16. I came out of my bedroom one day and my mom was laying on the floor having a massive heart attack. She couldn't speak and could barely move. Luckily before she went down she called my grandma who then called 911 so only many a minute after I found her my grandparents come rushing through the front door. My best friend (also 16F) at the time was on a trip to Disney in Florida. When we arrived at the hospital my grandparents were able to go back to be with my mom but I had to stay in the waiting room. I called my best friend crying and upset telling her what happened. I had known her for almost 10 years at that point. She asked me \"is she alive?\" And I said \"I think so\" and honestly I had no idea but she was still moving when the ambulance picked her up. She then started to tell me about the amazing time she had at Disney. So I know what you feel like with that. I decided to completely cut the friendship after that . I'm 26 now and I'm glad I did because I've seen and heard of different examples where she had been selfish with other friends so it wasn't just an age thing with her. I'm not saying you need to cut the friend too but you know your friend and you know her behaviors. If you don't want a friend like her that can't be there for you the way you need her to be then be done. But if you feel the friendship is not over and she does care about you then talk it over and try to fix it. We can't tell you what to do you have to do what feels right. I'm very sorry for your loss. \n\n(Sorry for any spelling errors or formatting I'm on mobile)  ",
            "My dad has terminal cancer and it's surprised me that people who know about it haven't really asked about it, including very close friends. It would mean a lot to me if they mentioned it, but I remember how I felt in situations where people were dealing with extreme grief. Some people are worried that anything they say will make it worse, like picking a scab. Some people just don't know what to say. Death is just really frightening and confusing for a lot of folks and they don't really know how to handle it.\n\nIf you need specific support from your friend, you need to make that clear and guide her as to the kind of support you need. Otherwise, you should cut her a little slack. You're both also super young and people your age often don't have the skills to negotiate emotionally difficult situations like these.",
            "She is self involved. maybe she will grow out of it and maybe she won't. I would do a slow drift.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss, it truly is devastating. I hope you know he'll always be there with you and look out for you. \n\nIn terms of your friend, I understand that death is hard to deal with for all of us. However, I genuinely don't think there's an excuse for your friend's behavior. Losing someone who meant so much, really changes your outlook on life and IMO you deserve love and support from the people around you. I don't think your friend is a bad person, but I just don't think it's right... ",

When I brought up my dad, they somehow turned it into a conversation about their ex. \n\nTake this as a reflection of their true colors. I still talk to my friend, but I don't depend on her for anything and see her maybe once a year, if that.\n\nUse this change in your life to find the true people who are worth spending time and energy on.",

She didn\u2019t even come to the celebration of life service, which was a few months after her passing, and she had plenty of notice, and promised me she would be there.\n\nMy best friend had lost her father to heart failure several years prior, and I was always there for her. I would put everything on hold if she needed to cry, vent, or someone to come be with her. I didn\u2019t expect this in return, but at least thought she would understand this kind of loss to be there for me. I was sadly mistaken.\n\nSorry for the long post. All of this to say that I completely understand what it\u2019s like to lose a friend in the midst of grieving the death of someone so important. It\u2019s incredibly heartbreaking, but it\u2019s actually beneficial in the long run. You now know the kind of person you are dealing with, and can decide whether you want that type of person in your life.  \n\nHere\u2019s to attracting better friends in your life who care, and can be there with you through the good, the bad, the ugly, and the beautiful.

            "This happened to me with a best friend at 20.  I was so shocked and devastated by the lack of care and concern from a person that I thought was my best friend.  It opened my eyes to selfish people and selfish friendships.  \nI obviously stopped talking to this person as they were not there for me in any way.  About 5 years later, we met up and went to a concert.  I asked her about it and told her how disgusted I was by her behavior.  She said she was scared and did not know what to do so she just stayed away.  That excuse is just an excuse that explains her selfishness.  Yes, your friend might be scared and feel like they don\u2019t know how to deal with you and the situation because it is hard, but disappearing or not acknowledging your hurt is a character reveal.  A true, good friend would not put their feelings ahead of yours during such a hard time.  They would deal with the difficult situation and realize that it is even more difficult for you.  \nI know this is very hard for you and losing your friend on top of things makes everything so much harder.  But, there are so many people out there that will be real friends to you.  They will be there not just for the good times, but also through the bad times.  It sucks to learn this life lesson, but you are lucky to learn it now so you can choose the right people to surround yourself with in life.  \nTime is the only thing that will ease this for you, but I promise, it does get better.  Surround yourself with good, caring people that will actually care about you.  Don\u2019t be afraid to lean on them and ask for help.  Real friends want to help and will not consider anything a bother.  Let them be there for you.  \nI am sorry that you are going through this.  You WILL get through this and you will come out stronger and wiser on the other side.  Stay strong.  ",
            "When I was in eighth grade a close friends father died. I was in emotionally imature teenager. I had no idea what to say, or how to respond. I had not been through loss at that point, and I had no idea how I would handle a death like that. I didn't say much to her because I didn't want to make it worse, and our friendship dissolved. Years later she confronted me about how I abandoned her. I thought I was giving space, but she felt totally betrayed. I was dumb, I didn't realize that. If this person is close to you, tell her that you need her support. You are going through something unimaginable. Let her know you need to talk, and don't let it ruin a good friendship like me. She will support you if you ask.",
            "I'm so sorry about your dad. My own dad died just over 2 years ago and we were also close. It was devastating for me (and I was already a married, adult woman with a child).\n\nIn American culture, today, many people are uncomfortable with death and grief. Unless you have experienced those things, it's hard to empathize with people who have been there. Frequently, friends will feel paralyzed by \"not wanting to say the wrong thing\" and accidentally upsetting you more, instead, choosing to not say anything about it unless you bring it up or mention it. \n\nLots of people actually do the other thing, too. They will say the world's dumbest shit, thinking that it'll make you feel better and it actually DOES make you feel worse. Those folks obviously don't mean to hurt you, but it will hurt just the same.\n\nShe also might have changed the subject because she felt like the distraction of normal interaction might help you feel more normal. What she doesn't understand is that nothing is normal, anymore. For at least a while, everything will have this cloud hanging over it.\n\nFor what it's worth, you will never feel quite \"normal\" again. But you will eventually start finding a \"new normal\" (which actually comes with it's own set of problems because you will likely feel guilty that you are starting to feel \"okay\", when your head tells you that you are a horrible person for starting to live your life again).\n\nI don't think your friend is trying to hurt you; I think she's just afraid that anything she says about your dad or your grief could make it worse.\n\nI would tell her, \"Friend, I'm really struggling with the loss of my dad. I don't expect you to say or do anything that can make the situation better, but I sometimes need you to ask me how I'm doing. I also might just need to talk about it and have you listen; again, there is nothing you can say or do to fix it, but just having someone listen while I talk about him/what I'm going through helps. Can you do that for me?\"\n\nI give you permission to feel however you feel. It's okay to be sad, mad, laugh, cry, feel numb, feel happy etc. Grief is a long, hard road. While the burden of losing a parent never really gets lighter, it's like going to the gym.  That 25lb weight doesn't get lighter; you just get stronger and it becomes easier and easier to carry that weight as you excercise those muscles.\n\nGood luck, OP. Please PM me if you ever just need an ear to listen. I've been there and I know how heavy your grief feels. \u2764\ufe0f",
            "I had a father die when I was much older than you (26) and the people around me still didn\u2019t really know what to say or do. I think people are so worried about saying the wrong thing or committing some grave mistake that they avoid it all together unless you bring it up, which is actually an even bigger mistake. She may think she\u2019s doing you a favor by not asking you about it. If you\u2019re close, you can explain to her that you actually like to talk about it, it makes you feel better, and then bring it up. I would not expect her to ever bring it up. People assume it\u2019s so painful that it\u2019s not their \u201cright\u201d to bring it up and cause you pain. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your father, btw. ",
            "When my two best friend's fathers passed we held each other in mourning. Only time I saw those gents cry. I attended both funerals. Be more open about communicating, some people don't handle consoling others well. It might just make her feel awkward, like *\"what do I say!\"* It's also possible that she's just trying to take your mind off of it. I'm sure your friend cares, maybe just not expressive. Try opening up, like *really* open up to her about his death and how your feeling and see how she responds. Much love to you and your family OP.",
            "This can be a tricky situation for your friends. On the one hand, they want to be supportive, on the other, they may not want to press the matter too much in order to get your mind off of things. People grieve differently, and while some would like the support that you're wanting, others would be appreciative that their friends don't keep bringing the matter up. My girlfriend would lean more toward what you would want, while I would rather people not say much more about the issue after their initial comment. \n\nIt's also difficult to figure out what to say in general, especially at y'alls age where something like this probably doesn't really enter the consciousness unless it's happening to them. I think it could be worth your time to come out and tell her that you're having trouble and would like to spend quality time with her to talk through things. \n\nIt's possible that she's kind of a self-centered, poop friend, but we don't know her to really say.",
            "A lot of people don't know how to deal with grief. If you're not weepingly openly in front of them, they just don't know what to do--and even if you are weepingly openly, half the time they *still* don't know what to do. It's also terrifying--I can't imagine she didn't think immediately about her own father dying. Which is scary, and a feeling that she probably shoved down, and she assumed you wanted to shove it down too. One of the big tactics is, look at all this bright and shiny stuff to distract you from your grief! Which doesn't always help, but rather than assuming she's selfish, I would assume she means well.\n\nAsk for what you need. Do you need her to listen while you talk about your memories of your dad, or the funeral? Do you want her to come to the cemetery with you? Do you want to just talk about how you feel, and death? Do you want help getting out of the house? Ask for those things. \"Hey [friend], I'm still really in a horrible place from my dad's death. Can we [do this thing that I hope will help me]?\" When you tell people how to help you, generally--unless they are very very selfish--they'll say yes. If she's as close a friend as you consider her, she'll want to help. If she isn't..... well, she'll show you by her response.\n\nYou also may want to consider counselling, to help you with your grief. Everyone deals with grief differently, and everyone has different needs while they're going through it. Your needs will change over time, too.\n\nIt might be tough for her to be there for you--she isn't a therapist and you can't just dump all your feelings onto her--but you *should* be able to expect support and listening from your friends during this tough time.",
            "First, I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad when I was 28. And even then, I lost 2 friends over it. They didn't care. They cared at first, and then when I didn't just \"get over it\" they didn't understand. Their callousness and self-centered behavior really changed how I saw them. I had acquaintances who showed more compassion and care than my \"best\" friends were able to fake. And so I started to focus more on the people who were there for me. Those bad friendships faded away and now, 7 years later, I'm happy they aren't in my lives. I really thought about their personalities and how this wasn't a one-time lack of care.\n\nIt's not personal. I bet if you look back on the last 14 years, she's probably made a lot of things about herself or not really shown an interest in things that only you cared about. You can try to tell her how you feel, but honestly, does it matter? She's shown you who she is. She won't be there for you in life when shit gets real. That's her. Your choice is the level of involvement you want to have with her. You can dial down the friendship, dissolve it completely, or stay friends but remember that she is a fair weather friend.\n\nI'm sorry you lost your dad and now you may be losing what you thought was a close friend. Just remember that what you are feeling now WILL get better over time. Your sadness over your dad will never go away, but it DOES get better. Take care of yourself, make sure you are eating right, getting enough sleep, and spending time doing things that make you feel good. Those are the things you have control over. You can't control her, but you can control the impact she has on you. It might be helpful to seek grief therapy as well, whether that is with a group or a personal therapist. I know you said at the end that you have social issues, but there's no reason to walk through life with only 1 fair weather friend by your side. You deserve better than that. ",
            "I'm sorry for your loss.  I lost my mom to lung cancer 3 years ago.  It really sucks.  But I promise, it does get easier.\n\nTalk to her about how this is bothering you.  I remember when I was a senior in high school a good friend of mine's dad died and she didn't even tell anyone.  She just didn't want to talk about it and we eventually found out through the parent grapevine.  Teenagers aren't the best at vocalizing their feelings and often just do nothing when they don't know what to do.  I'm sure she means well, so tell her how you feel.  Best of luck to you!",
            "Everyone deals with grief differently. But that's not always obvious, particularly to a young person. And sometimes, we don't know what OTHER people want from us when it comes to greiving because we don't yet understand that everyone is different so we respond to their grief in the way that we would want people to respond to us. So, for example, when I am greiving, all I want to do is talk; someone, anyone, listen to me, console me! But my friend grieves differently. She wants to be distracted: a funny story, an anecdote, a joke, she wants a reprieve from the sadness, a refugee from the pain, so that's what I give her; and then my other friend doesn't want to talk about it at all, except with black humor so I laugh along.\n\nThis may be the kind of thing your friend would want if it was her father: she may think you want a sanctuary from the pain, that your friendship is a place where your can go to forget it's happening and be happy for a little while. She may be doing for you exactly what she thinks you want, without realizing that you grieve differently and need different support. She may actually care a great deal and this may be a simple matter of  misunderstanding your needs.\n\nMaybe tell her: \"I need someone to talk to about my dad.\" If she knows that's what you need, she may be better able to support you.\n\nEdit: this is not to invalidate feelings, it sucks that she didn't ask more about your dad.",
            "Losing your Dad is the worst feeling. A great loss. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. \nEveryone is different about death. Some avoid the situation because they don't have the social skills to handle it properly. Don't judge her too hard. Now you know she is not one to go to for personal issues. Maybe only for going shopping and lunch with instead. ",
            "Same thing happened to me, my mother died and I did not hear from the one person I considered a best friend. So we aren't friends anymore because I realized that she only cared about herself and gave no shits about anything else. I'm better off with her not in my life, and am much happier now. It's not easy to get over such a loss (parent, not the faux-friend!), you don't really ever do. It just gets easier to deal with as time goes on. Cherish your life, it's really short, don't waste time on people who don't care about you. There are much better things to spend your time and energy on. Good luck! ",
            "My dad died when I was 19 and honestly, people don't know how to handle that. I ended up closing myself off from a lot of my friends. I started reconnecting with them recently (I'm 25 now). They started telling me that they felt so bad about what had happened and they had no idea how to help me or be there for me. Do I want them treat me like usual so I can get back to some semblance of normalcy? Do I want them to console me constantly? I have no idea what I could have done to help my 19-year-old self and I'm talking about ME. Everyone is different with how they cope and how they grieve, and it's hard to know exactly how to console someone who is going through something as serious as a parent dying when you're only a teenager. It doesn't necessarily mean you don't care, but it could just mean you don't know how to show it. ",
            "I was 17 when I lost my Dad.  Happened in Easter so we were on Spring break.  Nobody said anything when I went back to school. Friend s did attend the wake. \n\nPeople often don't known what to say so they avoid it. so sorry honey. They don't know until it happens to them...\n\n",
            "My dad died right after I turned 19 from a short battle with terminal cancer. Feel free to pm me if you want support. \n\nI'm sorry about your friends. Most of mine did something similar. It's important to reach out and tell people that you need support. Most people and especially younger people don't know how to handle family member death. If you two were as close as you said, it might have been scary for her as well to lose a significant father figure. ",
            "I remember doing something like this to someone when I was around 17. I found out the Father of my middle school best friend had died, but while I was surprised, I didn't reach out. We hadn't been talking/close at the time it happened and I just pushed the reality of it to the side. I realized later how much of an asshole I was (for several reasons) and reached out to her to apologize. \n\nIt's super shitty she hasn't followed up about your feelings, but maybe she's not just mature enough to realize it. It's also a lot harder to relate with something you've never been through - it wasn't til I lost the first close person to me a few years back that I realized how devastating grief really is. \n\nI'm so sorry that happened, my condolences ",

I\u2019m 48, though, and a lot more people my age have been through this or something similar before; people closer to your age typically don\u2019t have such extensive experience and are more likely to step on toes. I\u2019d be inclined to attribute any apparent slights to immaturity and the awkwardness of inexperience.",
            "I'm going to possibly give her the benefit of the doubt and say maybe she doesn't know how to ask without it being overly sensitive. Maybe she doesn't want to bring up the reminder that you father has just died, or simply has no idea how to talk about it. If she has never experienced death or very little of it she may not know how to go about it. I experienced this first hand when my mom died a few months ago, she had a big family and lots of friends so many many people constantly on my ass. After all that I'd rather have someone to just listen, not pry. \n\nIt can hurt if she just shrugs it off and doesn't ask how you're doing, how you're feeling. If that's how she really is I would 100% talk to her about it. I wish you the best in the rough times.",
            "Im so sorry for your loss, and for going through this at an age where it's really hard to make sense of anything. \n\nTo me, it sounds like she really doesn't know what to do, and landed on trying to take your mind off it. I'm sure she does care, but doesn't want to bring it up in case it upsets you. I was in a somewhat similar position at 16, where my best friend's dad had a heart attack. I didn't know what to do to help and didn't want to upset her by talking about it, so I tried to keep her distracted and talk about school and friends and movies. I think we all get lost in needing to be able to \"fix\" a problem, but grief is not a problem to solve.  \n\nIf you need to lean on her and talk about how you're feeling, I don't think you have any reason to be afraid of doing that. Just be straight up and say \"hey I'm not doing too well, mind if I just vent?\" to open up that conversation, instead of waiting for her to ask in case  she's not sure if she should. ",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss. My dad died from lung cancer when I was 17. I was a daddies girl, and it broke me in so many ways. I called my three best friends after he died, two told me they had to go and they'd be at my house soon, and they brought snacks and stayed with me for as long as they could. My other best friend said \"oh, sorry, I have to go\".\n\nTwo of my friends proved themselves when I really needed them. I didn't ask them to come to my house, but they knew I needed them. The other friend and I no longer talk. She was selfish in many other ways than this and I just didn't see it until I really needed her.\n\nShe isn't psychic so it may be worth mentioning that you're having a hard time and you feel like she hasn't been there for you, but when something as awful as losing a parent happens and the people you need aren't there for you, it shows their true colours. She seems pretty selfish. ",

Empathy takes effort for him, some people are just like that.  It sucked at the time, but he's still one of my best friends.  He's just not the first person I go to when I need to talk about difficult emotional situations.  Unless I need a frank conversation. \n\nBest of luck to you.  I hope you can similarly work it out.

I can't say what made your friend seem distant and emotionless to you, being as she is a female, but it's not necessarily that she didn't care. Some people grieve privately, some grieve publicly.. My friend in highschool was always at odds with his mom for years before, but  she  came down with cancer and she too died of cancer near the end of our highschool careers. He was a super \"never show response\" type so I just tried to meet him how I thought he would want, which was to tell him I don't have words to make it change, I don't know how it feels, but I'm here if he wants to talk. I wasn't sure how much he was feeling the loss but I imagine it was as much as anyone super close would feel, and maybe more because now there was regret of time lost. I don't feel what I said was adequate but what is when you lose a parent? Edit: it was breast cancer...*",

He messaged me the night before our scheduled hangout and asked to postpone because he was tired. That really hurt.  \n\nSome people fucking suck. As another response said, young people are inherently \"selfish\". Try to have a conversation with your friend about how this is a monumental event in your life, and you really need support. ",

It's good for me.  It's not good for you, and that's okay, but you need to communicate to your friends what your needs are.\n\n\"Hey, I'm not in a place where I'm ready to joke around or talk about other issues right now.  I'm just too sad.  Can you just be with me while I'm working through this?\"\n\nThat's obviously not a complete script - you'll add in your own touches - but it should be a start to help you figure out a way to properly communicate your own needs to the people in your life.",
            "(reposting b/c I swore and it was removed)\n\nI am so, so sorry for your loss. Losing your father at a young age, at any age, when it\u2019s to something such as lung cancer\u2026 to me it felt like everything inside me had been compressed into this ball of anguish inside my chest. I lost my father to lung cancer two years ago. He had been diagnosed a year previous, but even from a young age I had this sense of inevitability that he would be the first close loved one to die. When he passed away, it was like this horrible nightmare that I\u2019d been having for years actually coming true. \n\nI went through something similar to you, a person who I thought was a good friend turned out to be completely self-centred and didn\u2019t care anything at all about my father dying. When I went back to work after, I was still very much in grief and not in an upbeat mood, as you can imagine. She came and sat with me at a table in the break room and when I mentioned my father had died, she said (and this is a direct quote) \u201cDamn that sucks.\u201d Then she went on to babble about how she was worried I was mad at her and that she was trying to figure out what she\u2019d done or what I was upset about. No further mention of my father or of condolences at all. Slowly, over the next month, she got progressively more upset with me as I didn\u2019t seem interested in conversations or in listening to her constantly whine and moan about the interpersonal drama she was caught up in (and causing) in her work group. I had a bbq planned about a month afterwards just for people to come over and hang out. She said she was camping that day and she couldn\u2019t come, so I said it was fine. That pissed her off a lot, I guess, perhaps because I didn\u2019t seem upset or didn\u2019t beg her to come? I don\u2019t know, all I know is that after I said it was fine, she got angry and then we never spoke again.\n\nI feel so much sympathy for you, for having to go through the same thing, but at a much younger age (I\u2019m about 10 years older). Some people don\u2019t know how to react in the face of tragedy. They may never have been faced with a hard time in their life, they may not yet have had the opportunity to develop a sense of empathy yet. Your friend might be feeling awkward and unsure of what to say or how to say it. You said you\u2019ve always had her back for troubles \u2013 has there been a time when she\u2019s had a chance to reciprocate? Have you gone through anything majorly troubling before, where she could have had a chance to see what it\u2019s like to give, rather than receive, support? If she\u2019s never been in that spot before, she might just need a gentle wake-up call.\n\nI would advise you talk to her, and say you need her help and support, say what a hard time it\u2019s been for you and that you need your best friend. If she responds to that and is willing to be at your side and talk, then you should share with her how her silence or non-response over your father\u2019s death has hurt you when you needed it most. I don\u2019t think you should give her a free pass here, but don\u2019t get accusatory or angry over the phone/text. When you\u2019re face to face, that\u2019s when you should say something like \u2018My father died and you haven\u2019t been here for me, you haven\u2019t asked me about it at all, and that\u2019s hurt me very deeply.\u2019 If you want to keep this friendship, if she realizes you need the help and support and is ready to give it, then you need to tell her how her absence has made you feel rather than keeping silent and holding that in just to keep from \u2018scaring her off\u2019. Give her the chance to apologize and to understand how she\u2019s hurt you, rather than just keeping it to yourself because you\u2019re worried about pissing her off by saying she hurt you. If hearing that she\u2019s hurt you causes her to get angry, blame you and end the friendship, then she\u2019s not the type of person you should want to be friends with in the first place. \n\nIt sucks, but these are the times in one\u2019s life where you learn who your close friends are, and who is just hanging around because it\u2019s easy but aren\u2019t investing anything in the relationship. I\u2019ve been through a couple times like this in my life, once with my father\u2019s death and once when I moved a long distance away and practically every friend I had never spoke to me again. It can be incredibly hurtful to go through this, and I don\u2019t want to sound like a Motivational Poster or anything, but adversity shows the true colours of those around you, and of yourself. It\u2019s hard having to start over and find new friends, but you will come through the other side as a more empathetic person, and a person of convictions and strength to be the person to others that you wish you had beside you right now. Mourn the loss of your father with your family, you need them and they need you right now. YOU are what matters most at the moment, you focus on your needs and self-care right now. If your best friend isn\u2019t going to be there for you, then she\u2019s not. Don\u2019t attempt to minimize the struggles you\u2019re going through right now to her so that they\u2019re more palatable for her to digest. Don\u2019t be a doormat for her, if she\u2019s not willing to be the friend that you need.",
            "I can relate. It was exactly the same when my father died, all my 'friends' were like 'omg so sorry' and then some asked me the next day if I was feeling any better (no, of course not??) and then it was never mentioned again. Honestly I think most young people who have not personally lost anyone just cannot imagine what it's like and have no idea how to deal with it. ",

Even more, it was such a terrible thing to happen to my friend and his 4 younger siblings that forty-something me would struggle to find something to say that didn't seem trite or insignificant in the face of it.   16-year-old me froze up solid.   \n\nDon't blame your friend.

No one should lose a parent in the time where it's needed most.\n\nOn another note, your friend sounds like a pretty surface level person. Can you truly remember the last time you had a deep conversation with philosophical, existential, or extremely personal topics? I know when I was in my teens I had tons of friends but none of them were TRUE friends. Most were just partying friends. \n\nI know you have known her for a long time but it sounds like she's either just not a deep person, or she isn't a true friend who would support you like you'd support her through thick and thin. It's about your age when you start to realize who is truly there for you, and who isn't. \n\nIf you're okay with having a friend who doesn't like to get into the mud with feelings, that's fine. However, I get that it doesn't feel good to have such depressing feelings just brushed aside. I think you might benefit from taking inventory on who exactly is in your life, and who is there for you of those people.\n\nMaybe try and find some other girls who do want that sort of relationship with you and keep this girl as just someone to have fun with, if it doesn't bother you.\n\nEither way OP, keep your chin up. Take the time you need, but don't force your grief. It will come naturally, if you need to grieve the loss of a friend too, then take all the time you need for that as well!\n\nEDIT: Other people bring up a good point in that she may be trying to distract you, or just may not know what to say. Sometimes it's hard to find the words to comfort someone you love. Maybe confront her on it and see what she says. It might give you a bit of closure on that front.",
            "Its also possible that she just has no clue on how to handle that situation and is just trying to be there for you by giving you normalcy. I really have no idea though.",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss :( I lost my mum when I was young and I can understand how that feels.\n\nI'm also sorry your friend isn't reacting sportively. But it could be that she doesn't know how to react, so is avoiding the situation out of shame/guilt. Some people regardless of age & experience simply don't know how to handle death and grief at all. It doesn't make them bad people or even bad friends, but they're not the people you should rely on.\n\nPerhaps you can check in your school to see if they offer counselling, you'd probably benefit from some grief counselling, that way you can heal without all the pressure being on your friend if she's no good with this stuff.

            "I was about your age when my dad died.  Also cancer.  Friends, mostly, didn\u2019t handle it well.  Loss of a parent isn\u2019t even on most of their radar.  Grief isn\u2019t either.  My best friend at the time told me \u201coh I\u2019m sorry, it was so hard when my dog was out to sleep, I know how you feel\u201d.  I almost slapped her.  I didn\u2019t.  Being older now, she was trying to relate in some way.  A horrible and stupid way.  But she didn\u2019t know what to say or do.  She didn\u2019t really bring it up or ask, because she didn\u2019t want to upset me.  She didn\u2019t realize how much it was already on my mind.  \n\nCheck out some grief groups for people your age. One of the biggest helps for me was having people who had been there too.  That I could relate to.  Your friends who haven\u2019t experienced loss like this probably will never be able to be there for you like you need.  ",
            "I\u2019ve been through something similar, except when my dear one was told they have 6 months, my Bff ghosted me. When he died, people told me to grieve in silence because it\u2019s disturbing the chill vibe (I live in a dorm). \n\n\n\nSo what I learned from this shitty experience is the following: \n\n\n\n1. People are too selfish and self centered to put themselves in your shoes. \n\nAnd/or\n\n2. People feel too awkward to approach such a heavy subject. They might wait for you to open up about it. The only person who asked me how I\u2019m doing had lost her dad (she understood grief). Many don\u2019t understand or know the feeling of grief. \n\nAnd/or\n\n\n3. People avoid the subject of death because they live in a mental state that can\u2019t really handle harsh topics. They want to stay in their bubble where everything bad is distanced. And when you disturb their self made illusion, they retaliate. \n\n\n4. Your friend might have grown apart during her time away. She might not really be invested in the situation you went through because she was in a different country. It would be different if she actually SAW the painful process of deterioration of a terminal disease. It is hard to grasp the situation sometimes unless you\u2019re present \n\n\n\n5. She\u2019s too immature to realize how to interact in such cases. In that sense her immaturity could simply be defined as either lack of social skills for THAT kind of topic (death/grief), or in the sense that she\u2019s hoping you\u2019ve moved on (not reading your emotions better). \n\n\n\n\nPeople are not perfect, I don\u2019t know much about your friend, but it might be good to give her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe this topic should be openly discussed with her, gently confront her about his. \n\n\n\nRemember, those who didn\u2019t experience what you did, will have a different perspective on the situation. It won\u2019t be bad to show them your perspective ",
            "I'm going to be really blunt with you.\n\nShe might not know how to deal with that. She's 18. I found my father dead at 20. People have no idea how to act with that and kinda follow your lead on things. \n\nYour world may feel like it's ending but their world is as usual. You're going to have to realize that and it's gonna suck and hurt. It's okay to take a break and be around those who are actually affected by your father's death. ",
            "Hey my Dad died when I was 18, im 21 now. Most of my friends didn't know how to react and treated me as normal but they were definitely there for me, I just had to ask. Maybe try telling your friend what you need from them and what would help because 18 year Olds definitely struggle with how to deal with other people's grief.",
            "Unfortunately, one thing I\u2019ve realized is that people don\u2019t know how to handle grief and unless they\u2019ve experienced a similar traumatic loss, they also just don\u2019t understand the devastation. \n\nI include myself in that. I was young when my grandparents passed and hadn\u2019t had any other close deaths until my dad last year. I would have friends and coworkers lose a parent and know it was horribly sad but had no idea to what extent. I just want to say I\u2019m sorry to all of my friends who lost a parent before I did because I had NO IDEA. I also don\u2019t generally do well with emotional situations. \n\nI had no idea that I would never be the same again or that I would think about him every minute of every day. I didn\u2019t realize that the sight of a red pickup truck or the sound of the evening news would make my heart sink or that I would spend so much time just trying to imagine the sound of his voice or remember something he said. Don\u2019t get me started on the fact that my kids will never know him or that my 9 year old niece still texts his phone from her iPad saying she misses him and it is absolutely soul crushing. \n\nMy best friend is a pretty selfish/self-absorbed person so our relationship was already pretty rocky but my father\u2019s death definitely further damaged it. I can\u2019t pretend that she wasn\u2019t looking for sympathy about her mom\u2019s vertigo 20 minutes after I buried my dad or that the only times she texted to say \u201cthinking of you\u201d were times that she actually needed something.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. ",
            "Some people are very bad with tragedy and death and don\u2019t know how to cope with it, so they pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. If this is the case, then that is the type of person she is and you\u2019ll have to decide if you want to tolerate that and let her do her while continuing to be friends. \n\nOn the other hand, 18 year olds can be selfish, and maybe she is this person. Look at her past actions throughout your friendship and decide whether she is someone who doesn\u2019t deal well with trauma or someone who only thinks of themselves. You\u2019ve known her longer than any of us and only you can come to this conclusion on your own and act accordingly. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine how hurt and lost you are. If you need someone to talk to or scream at, then please don\u2019t be shy. Just take it one day at a time and I know you\u2019ll come out of this a stronger person. ",

            "I\u2019m so sorry about this. Your dad is in a better place now. I actually had a similar incident with someone I used to call a friend since we were very young.

Her best friend was the same -- didn't care. \n\nThey're adults now. \n\nShe didn't become a better friend. \n\nPeople you age may be self invested, but not to the extent that they don't care about their friend's father dying. IDK I'm kinda not buying all the reasons people are giving here to explain this...regardless, why do t toudirectly talk to them about how this is making you feel? Maybe it is simply them not knowing how to bring it up.",

She was climbing in my house while I wasn't home and she fell and broke her neck. I found her dead, in an awful position and naturally freaked out. \nShe didn't once ask if I was ok, and we live together. But she had plenty of time to screw guys and hang out with her other friends.\n\nLesson learned there? There are different levels of friendship and your friend just demoted herself to a lower one.

For myself, there were so many times I had no idea how to help my husband, either with words or actions. I often was hesitant to ask how he was doing for fear of bringing up all the difficult emotions that come with losing a cherished loved one. All I can suggest is to tell your friend you miss her and love her and that you're having a tough time without her. She may not know how to help no matter how much she wants to. You likely will need to tell her how to support you in your time of need.\n\n",

            "sorry for your loss\n\npeople react very differently to death, if your friend is like me(introverted, anti-social, and highly logical) she is probably just unintentionally blocking any urge to talk about it, to the point of not having the urge at all. my wife's mother just passed a week ago and as much as she loved her mother I was at a complete loss for words and thoughts on the subject, my instinct was to let my wife grieve with her family(8 siblings) and stay out of the way, distracting myself almost completely with my own hobbies. I loved her mother very much, as much as my own I thought, but I only shed some tears at the funeral itself and not much at that. it took me back to when my grandmother, whom i loved, passed when I was a teenager(i'm 30 now), I dont remember crying once, in fact I dont remember thinking much about it at all so I assume I had the same response then as I did now. I worry that when my own mother passes I will have the same reaction and people will think poorly of me as you are doing with your friend because of my apparent lack of emotions or need/want to discuss it. dont blame your friend, just because she isnt showing the same emotional response that you had, and expected her to have, does not mean that she doesnt sympathize for you. if you want to talk to her about it, i'm sure she will listen, even if the subject makes her uncomfortable(strong emotions have that effect on some people)",

I didn't want to make him have to relive the pain of losing her again, and I assumed that if he wanted to talk he would have been the one to start that conversation. Deaths in the family are very personal, and I would never want anyone to try to get me to talk about it when I just want to grieve alone. If you really feel troubled by this, you could talk to your friend about it. After all, if you guys are really as close as you say, she should be able to understand where you're coming from.",
            "I've been in similar situations with friends and they've usually asked to just keep everything as normal as possible to keep them from thinking about it. She probably assumed you'd want the same but didn't communicate that with you beforehand which made her seem like an asshole. ",

I\u2019m sorry but youth is not an excuse - you will find other people who will give you time and be more empathetic and sympathetic. You need time to grieve and you need time to process what has happened, I am so sorry for the loss of your dad. I developed a cut off rule when I was about 20, if you were Anne frank and you doubt your friend would hide you in the attic - cut them out of your life you do not need them. It\u2019s honestly one of the most valuable lessons I learnt - my other friend lost her dad at 21 and I did nothing but support her through it. She dropped out of university because she wanted to be at home and found so many of her friends at uni just did not want to deal with the emotional garbage. I think in situations like these it does nothing but show you who your real dependable friends are, and sometimes this is a gift in itself. \nYou can bring it up in conversation but if your friend does not engage I would distance yourself and find other people who do have that emotional capacity to move forwards with.",

The most important is that people in general don't know how to deal with death and grief, and teenagers especially REALLY don't know how to deal. On top of not knowing how to deal, teenagers are also insanely self-absorbed.

            "First of all, I\u2019m terribly sorry, I hope you have been managing to find strength in other places. \n\nThis is not somebody you should keep in your life. Period.",
            "The fault is with you mostly than her. You have a low self-esteem dear and if you chose your friends wisely this wouldn't happen. You shouldn't be socially awkward. My left side of my face is deformed from a life threatening AVM it's a birth defect of the arteries and I still carry on with my life to the best if my abilities, I can never allow anyone treat me like that.\n\nAnyway my point is you should dump your friend and move on if you still have a dignity or self worth. And I'm sorry about your dad be strong and leave that egocentric friend of yours alone. She knows that you acting like you need her so she's taking complete advantage of you, leave her now!!!! Best of luck.",
            "Please understand that some people have a hard time approaching someone about a death.  They can say that they're sorry and ask how you are, but often people don't know how to support you.  Some people avoid the topic and attempt to support you by distracting you from the recent death (or do they think).\n\nI am very sorry for your family's loss.",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. Sometimes strangers on the internet understands how you feel better than any friend ever could because of life experiences. Your friend has probably never lost anyone close to her or him before so she doesn't know how to react. ",
            "Firstly, I\u2019m so very sorry that you\u2019re going through this right now. It\u2019s not something that you should have ever had to dealt with at such a young age.\n\nA few people have said that teenagers are self centred, and while that may be true, as someone who also lost their dad in their teens, I\u2019d like to share my own perspective. When my father died I was in a haze. I didn\u2019t quite realise it, but as someone who was previously quite open with my emotions, I\u2019d completely shut down and my friends didn\u2019t know what to do. \n\nIt took a good few months, some beer and a trip away for me to open up to my friends. Turns out they\u2019d been super worried about my perceived non-reaction to my Dads passing. They were so worried about me that whole time, but being teenagers hadn\u2019t a clue how to bring it up. After we\u2019d talked, I wished I\u2019d shared my feelings with them sooner. This is all a very long winded way to say that I think your friend doesn\u2019t know how to deal with what you\u2019re going through, and has handled it badly. \n\nI think she might feel that trying to distract you might be the best course. I\u2019d encourage you to share how you\u2019re really feeling with your friend (or anyone else professional /non-professional you feel comfortable with). It will really help you in the long run. Either way, be good to yourself.",
            "Many people, even full grown adults, have no idea of the excruciating pain experienced when a much loved parent dies. If you say you are OK, some clueless, but loving,  people will believe you because they really have no frame of reference for the pain. None. In addition, many people have no clue what to say when they see another person in emotional pain. I think one, or both, of these explains your friend\u2019s response. Please tell her you would like to talk to her.  Tell her how you feel.  She might stay clueless, but that is not the same as not loving you.  She just doesn\u2019t even begin to understand,  Explaining it is sometimes barely helpful, so be prepared for that. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for all the levels of pain you are experiencing at such a young age. Many people here do understand. I hope you come back to keep talking with us. We are here for you. ",
            "When people tell me about their loved ones passing, i never know how to take the news. I always try to be there to support them, emotionally, but not having the connect myself its hard for me express the emotions i feel like im meant to. I also view death as a fundamental and inevitable part of life so when it happens, i usually just accept it. Maybe your friend is similar? I know it sounds messed up but people inherently selfish and because this situation isn't affecting your friend directly ahe might not be totally sympathetic, obviously upset that you're upset but still just doesnt know how to deal with the situation so may be trying to avoid it and get both your minds off it as best he/she can. ",
            "The sad truth is that friends in this situation that haven\u2019t been through it themselves don\u2019t know how to behave.\n\nShe obviously was trying to keep your mind off your Dad which for me works. But that\u2019s not for everyone.",
            "Death makes people extremely uncomfortable. You never know what to do or what anyone actually wants. You also never know what to say other than sorry. Some want to be consoled and talk about it and maybe cry it out. Others want to move on as soon as possible and for you not to bring it up at all. You never know so people just follow the lead of the other person. \n\nYour friend probably didn't know what to say and felt uncomfortable, so they changed the subject. You're so young that your friends probably haven't had major deaths in their life so they can't even relate. I'm almost certain she cares. You went along with it and haven't brought it up again since. No one wants to talk about dead people so if you're not being it up, they won't either. If it's important for you to really to your friend about your father's death, then talk to them about it. ",
            "Most people have a lot of trouble processing losses like you experienced. They just don't know what to say and how they are supposed  to feel.\n\nIt doesn't have a lot to do with how they view you as a friend.\n\nIt could or cod not indicate how much they vue your friendship. Other behavior is a better indicator.",
            "If it was me, I probably wouldn't ask either out of fear of like bringing it up and you not wanting to remember it or you going from a really happy mood to really sad just because I mentioned it. They might be telling you about other stuff to take your mind off it, just my 2 cents.\n\nAlso, I am very sorry to hear this, cancer took my nan at 8 years old and I always wished I'd gotten to know her better. Stay strong, and never forget",
            "It can be really really difficult to talk about this kind of stuff. Sometimes, when a friend is hurting in this way, it's hard to know what to say. It's hard to know if they even want you to say anything at all. If you're hurting and you need to talk to her about it, tell her. Tell her that you could really use her support right now. If she's a good friend, she'll be more than happy to comfort you. If not, then maybe you should look for better friends.",
            "I'm late to the game, but I feel like I have some insight so I'll respond to this. \n\nMy dad died of lung cancer when I was 22. I'm sorry you had to lose your dad to that awful disease, too. It's just a bastard. \n\nMy dad was my biggest supporter- he raised me and my sister mostly solo after my mom died. He was my biggest source of advice, comfort, humor, everything. Losing him was the most fundamentally impactful thing that has happened to me. And my friends had NO CLUE how to deal. When I told one of my best friends that they were stopping my dad's treatment and that he would die soon, she hugged me and told me I smelled good (it's been 8 years, we really have some good laughs about this now.)\n\nWhat you have to understand, and what I had to learn and what I'm still learning, is that people are very uncomfortable with grief. They don't know how to handle it so they just don't. They avoid it- they don't mention the name of your lost loved one. They don't ask you how you are. If you get visibly upset- they are going to be uncomfortable most of the time. But that is on *them*. You are allowed to grieve. You are allowed to do what you need to do to process your father's death. You can cry in public. You can laugh, even if people expect you to be crying. You can talk about your dad as much as you want (I talked about my dad ALL THE TIME right after he died, I had to make sure I'd have his happy memories front and center to get rid of those awful hospital memories.)\n\n\nIf you're in a city- look around for young adult group grief counseling. I volunteered with an organization that offered it and it seemed like a fantastic idea. You get counseling without all the pressure of a one-on-one session, and you get to be with people in similar situations to your own. It can be very isolating to lose someone so young- your peers won't always get it. As you get older, people get better at dealing with it because it becomes more common to have experienced a big loss. But at your age, it's rare. So you're going to be a little like a fish out of water for a while. Finding some friends who are in a similar place can be very comforting. A local church, counselor, or hospice should have information on things like that. \n\nAnd just take your time. Let your friend take hers. You can't force her to be what you need right now, unfortunately. You just need to focus on leaning on the people who are there. If she's talking to you about nonsense you don't want to hear about, just be honest with her. \"I'm not ready to hear about all this right now. I'm in a sad place and would rather talk about something different.\" Something like that. If she continues to be more damaging than helpful, might be time to create some distance. Grief is not a time to work on relationships. It's a time to focus on yourself and get yourself through in one piece. You can mend things on the other side of the tunnel. Grieve, because you have to, you're going to do it one way or another. In the healthy way where you acknowledge you're grieving and process it openly, or in the way I did it- where i bottled it up for 6 months pretending I was fine and then it exploded out in a near mental breakdown. I don't recommend the latter. \n\nGood luck. Life sucks sometimes, but a great dad was worth every minute of the pain of losing him.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry you have a bad friend. She might lack the ability to empathise... this isn\u2019t normal behaviour at all ",
            "I'm not good with greiving and shit so I don't blame her for not saying much.",
            "I am so sorry for your loss. I lost my dad two years ago yesterday to cancer as well. It\u2019s a horrible thing to watch. Plus what people also don\u2019t realize, if your parents are together, watching my mom lose her husband of 30+ years was probably just as hard as watching my dad get sick. I felt like I lost two parents because the roles completely switched and I had to be there for my mom who was completely lost and heart broken. \n\nAnother thing I learned is, in circumstances such as these, you REALLY see who your true friends are. Some people surprise you with how much they SUCK, while others can show up out of the blue and pleasantly surprise you.\n\nDeath is really awkward for a lot of people, they\u2019re scared of what to say/not to say. They\u2019re scared of being uncomfortable around a mourning family. It\u2019s hard but now having gone through it, I make sure that when someone close to me loses someone, I show up! It\u2019s not about me and what makes me feel weird... it\u2019s about the person suffering a profound loss and just needs to know you care. Your friend sounds very immature and possibly feels weird about the situation. I would call her out on it. See if it\u2019s circumstantial or if she\u2019s just an asshole.\n\nI can tell you, in-spite of it being clich\u00e9 as fuck, that time does help. It gets easier. Hurts a little less every day. I like to talk to my dad when I\u2019m alone or ask to see him in my dreams. I recently went through an old jacket and found he carried a tiny photo of me in his pocket. If you look there are things you will find that will both break your heart and make you smile! It gets easier but take your time, cry all the tears you need to and focus on yourself and your family. It\u2019s also nice to have the reddit community to support you when you need it. FUCK CANCER! I wish you a long life (South African saying when you lose someone in your family) ",
            "Hey, terribly sorry for your loss, I lost my father at the age of 12 so I can kind of relate to what you are going through.\n\nAs for your friend, there is a chance that she is just self-centred as others have mentioned, but given her age I think it is more likely that she just isn't capable of handling this topic right now. You are both very young, the topic of death and mortality is very scary to face up to. It's possible that she is blocking it out / withdrawing from the situation because it scares her so much, she may be afraid of her own loved ones passing away etc.\n\nThis isn't a valid excuse for her behaviour, if she really cares for you then she should put her own issues aside and be there for her friend through this incredibly difficult time. Again as already mentioned, try having an open conversation with her where you explain that you don't feel she has been there for you and you could really do with her support right now.\n\nAs for the grief itself, be kind to yourself and allow yourself some time to heal. Talking to your loved ones and your dad's friends may help with the process, even if it's painful to bring up those memories. It's not something we ever really get over, but the old clich\u00e9 is true, time is a great healer. You will feel better as time passes.\n\nHope this helps.",
            "It could be she just isn't sure what to say or do. She's very young, and she might think that by pretending nothing has happened she's actually helping. Or maybe she's just really uncomfortable. Maybe you should try saying \"hey friend, I really just need to talk about all this. Could I vent to you for support?\"",
            "OP when I was 19 my best friends dad died. I don\u2019t know how to react so I didn\u2019t. I still regret it. I apologised to her about 8 months after he died but I just had zero experience with it and was clueless. So I took the easy option. ",
            "As someone who lost their parent at 17, I hope you find light and strength right now in your healing. I cannot imagine reliving that part of my life, losing my mother, and I am feeling for you right now. Your healing is valid, you are worthy to have others who will be next to you no matter what.\n\n\nThe most resentment from that period of my life (regarding close friendships) is that I realized I honored those who didn't care. My closest friends at the time were sympathetic at first, but quickly lost interest in the \"busy-ness\" of my grief. I mean this by, right after the stage of receiving a lot of attention from outside of our friend group, they left. I cant speak of your friend(s) OP, but only invest your time in those who make that effort. I promise you they're there. \n\nThis grief will not be WHO you are, but it will be with you for the rest of your life. You will find friends who will show you extra love and support during times when it is the hardest. \n\nI am no longer friends with anyone from my HS friend group, though it was roughly 19 when I realized how shitty my best friends of 10+ years were. I didn't deserve that, and neither do you.\n\nOP, I know you asked for friend advice, but I truly wish the best for you and your healing. I focused a lot of time in worrying what I did wrong to have my friends lack the basic understanding of what this loss meant to me. How others act is no reflection of your recovery. You deserve an environment where you can remember your dad, and process the loss. \n\nI found a lot of solace in the internet. Please know there are so many people here that care about you. If you ever need to talk, I'm all ears. I know people say that sometimes with no intention of being there, but if I could help one other younger adult who lost their parent around the time I did, I would every day. \n\nRegardless of what you choose to do, I truly wish that those who surround you give you the lift you need in this difficult time. ",
            "Definitely talk to her about it...\n\nIt's possible she just doesn't know what to say. It's an extremely hard topic and she may be trying to let you come to her. If you have been BFFs for so long, I would give her the benefit of the doubt... But definitely talk to her.",
            "I hear you, and I know the kind of betrayal from her. As we get older, it becomes clearer that most, MOST, people are very self centered. They may hangout with you every week, you share interests from sport to vacation. The time you spend with them will not change the fact that they not only always put themselves first,  but also care very little about you. You don't notice that in the good days, until the coldness and heartlessness moment come at your down time. \n\nThen, we learn, accept, flip that page of friendship/relationship with that person, and we carry on. I know I sound very pessimistic, though I once thought friendships would last forever until most of them proved to me they only last for one season or a little longer until a storm comes.  ",
            "I\u2019m sorry that you are going through this.  I do not know what it is like to lose a parent; it is difficult to even imagine. \nMy daughter lost her father when she was 9...it has been 6 years. She is still grieving her father and that is okay.  I will give you the same advice that I gave my daughter:\nThat is you father, and you need to take as long as you need to grieve. You are entitled to that, do not allow anyone to determine how long it takes you to grieve him. \nHonor his life and his love by accepting and dealing with his death in a manner that is healthy. Seek support by processing your emotions with someone that specializes in grief therapy. And surround yourself with people that are supportive, respectful and understanding of where you are in the process. \nI want to tell you that your friendship will work itself out, but the reality is that it may not.  And that is okay. you deserve to have a friend that loves you enough to support you through this, and your best friend may not be that person. Now may not be the time to deal with the emotions that you are feeling about your friend.  Just know that you will need to deal with that at some point but for now focus on accepting and coping with the loss of your your father.  ",
            "I am sorry for your lost. you're not alone, no matter how strong that feeling can get. Take this as a learning opportunity, I hope you are able to establish some new friendships that are balanced and heathy. Sending good vibes your way, chicka",
            "I wouldn't want to bring up something like that in a conversation when I wasn't the one ging through it. I'd want to be fully available to talk about it if the other person brought it up, but I wouldn't want to say \"oh hi, let me remind you that your dad died and ask how you feel about the fact that your dad died and pressure you into talking about it and not let you have any distractions from it when I'm around\". I'd want to provide whatever they wanted me to provide, not what I think should be provided (if that makes sense). If they want to talk about it, I'll talk about it. If they want to use me as a distraction and not talk about it, that's cool too. So I wouldn't want to bring it up unless they brought it up first.\n\nI'm not saying that's good (it's probably bad tbh), but that would be my thought process. ",
            "No one knows what the right thing is to do when something like this happens.  We don't want to cause someone we care about further grief.  We don't want to say the wrong thing.  It is paralysing... So we try to just act as normal as possible.\n\n   My bet is that your friend cares deeply and just did not know what you needed from her to support you through this.\n",
            "I lost my dad when I was just 9 years old.  It had a huge, huge impact on my life.  I come to a deeper understanding of how it affects me to this day. Even now, 30 years later, I do not deal with death well.   I have lost a handful of relatives in recent years and it has been extremely difficult/impossible to face them in their last days as well as confronting their immediate families.   I want to be there for all, but losing my dad when I was young apparently scarred me for life.  \n\nSo it\u2019s possible that it is eating your friend up inside that she can\u2019t comfort you.  Death is something everyone deals with differently.",
            "Sounds like she lacks empathy..\n\nHas she ever supported you through something like this before?",
            "Firstly, you have condolences for your loss. Losing a parent is quite the crushing moment. \n\nNonetheless, regarding your best friend, perhaps it\u2019s time to move on. \n\nAs you have elborated upon, you have been there for her during her darkest times and yet she has shown you this troubling apathetic nature during this challenging time.\n\nThat is unless this is your friend\u2019s odd attempt at mourning that is. ",
            "she probably doesnt know how to react, if my friend came up to me and told me about thier parents death I'd tell them I'm very sorry but that would probably be it because I dont niw what to do in that kinda situation ",
            "My mum died when I was 15, and I got a similar response from some of my friends when I told them - I think it's just because it's not something you expect to have to deal with at that age, even second-hand, so you never really prepare for it in your head. 'How do I deal with it if my friend loses a parent?' - well, that's easy. No point thinking about it. But then when it actually happens, people realise it's actually a bit of a social minefield. Anything meaningful you could say also has the potential to offend or upset them more. People feel as though bringing it up might be a mistake, so they leave it alone. I'd raise the issue with your friend the next time you want to talk about it, and just ask if you can vent for a few minutes. \n\nAs for your father, I'm very, very sorry he left you at such a young age. A teenager with other stresses shouldn't have to go through that. I was in a good place when my mum died and was able to deal with it very well and emerge from it pretty unscathed, but I think most people carry the trauma in some form for years and years. Nothing unbearable, just something that might sometimes surface. There's no time limit on grief, and most people aren't going to turn you down if you ask to talk to them. \n\nGood luck x",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss.\n\nNot sure what advice to give, but I had this with my ex when my grandad passed. The only thing he did for me was watch my cats when I went for his funeral, never asked me how I was doing, or anything. So I understand how you're feeling.\n\nHave an internet cuddle from me and I hope you're doing okay <3",

            "I am sorry for your loss, my father passed away about two years ago. It still hurts, but it gets better with time. We\u2019re always here for you! \nAs for your friend, I had the same situation with my best friend(more like a brother than any of my brothers). He wasn\u2019t in the country when dad died. He came back two days after and only called me once. He never comforted me or even consoled me after that phone call. I was upset about it for a long time. I finally had the courage to talk to him about it, he said that he was never good in comforting people and he thought that if he brought it up it might make me sad again which is why he never did. Not much of an excuse I thought. And now I know who my true friends are, the ones that even if a situation is tough and not comfortable for them, they\u2019ll stick it out just for my sake! \nMy suggestion is that you should talk to her about it if you see her as your best friend, see what was her reason or reasons for not being there for you. \nAnd here is something that you might not want to hear but is absolutely true, if someone doesn\u2019t take the trouble to be there for you when you most need them, they\u2019re not worth one iota of emotions for you. Move on from the friendship, there are plenty of other people who will be so damn lucky to consider you as their friend/best friend! And remember that we, redditors, are here for you if you ever need it. You can also PM me if it ever gets to that :) \n",
            "(hint: she's not your best friend)    \n(2nd hint: she's not even a friend.)",
            "Hello! I had literally the exact same thing happen to me except I was 19. It really blows. I totally understand the social anxiety thing too, it happens. I will say that for me in the beginning I was very shocked and hurt and even angry at people around me, my peers seemed so blissfully unaware of the realities of life, and I was frankly quite disappointed that I couldn\u2019t be on that side of things with them. But in time you will recalibrate and learn that what\u2019s really important is finding your own path and taking care of yourself and truly putting your own best interests first.\n\nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you what your grief ought to look like. It\u2019s different for everyone and you are allowed to feel happy when you can and it\u2019s okay to feel deeply sad as well and everything in between. I told you for me there was a lot of anger for many years. But I\u2019m working through it and will continue to.\n\nDuring the initial fallout from the loss I think it\u2019s important to self preserve and practice good self care and that includes being in touch with the people who truly care about you, other family members. Talking to a guardian or teacher that you can trust can also be very helpful. Above all else remember to be a little selfish and don\u2019t neglect your health. I am probably overstating that point now but that was something I struggled with personally. I would not see the point in doing much for myself and so I didn\u2019t but that is really detrimental to healing.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m so sorry this has happened. I know how it hurts.. I know it\u2019s confusing that your friends seem to have no concept of the gravity of the loss you are suffering. The plain fact is they don\u2019t really because they have no similar experience to relate it to and until they experience great personal loss of their own they will remain in the dark to a large degree\u2026 I am in my 20s now and I still experience this but far less frequently. You will find in time that some of the people you will meet do you have the compassion and depth of understanding. That is just not something you may be able to get from your friendship with this particular friend. Something that someone told me when I was in your position but I didn\u2019t fully hear them at the time: you deserve to feel heard and understood, but try to understand that it is rare to be fully understood by peers, especially with such a great loss at such a young age. That doesn\u2019t mean that you should abandon hope that anyone will ever understand you (that\u2019s how I took it) in fact I would say keep your mind open to the compassionate people you encounter just remember to protect yourself from the ones who don\u2019t treat you with kindness and respect.\n\nMost important part of what I\u2019m saying and what I was told (but didn\u2019t connect with fully for me until very recently in fact) is that therapy and counseling is very beneficial. Any kind of therapy you can get access to, but ideally a grief counselor. Also try to spend as much time as possible with the people and things you love, even if it doesn\u2019t feel enjoyable like it once did, it\u2019s still important that you engage in some kind of activity, even very mild low effort things (and especially those when grieving tbh) will contribute to your state of well being.\n\nYou\u2019re going to be okay. If you want to talk at all please message me! I have lots of free time and I love chatting with people who \u201cget it\u201d. I also have a brother who is about your age so you could say I\u2019m pretty hip with the kids. Lol sorry, lame older side is sister coming out. Bad jokes help me deal with pain.",
            "I'm gonna come at this as someone whose father also died when I turned 18. I was 17 and had just graduated high school. \n\nMy friends were for the most part there for me. I had one friend who was a giant asshole about the whole thing and we no longer speak and are not friends. \n\nI think you are justified in telling your friend you feel she has let you down and her behavior is very disappointing. Death and grief are very hard and she may be shutting down because she also doesnt know how to handle the situation, or she actually doesnt care. You wont find out unless you confront her about it. \n\nIf you don't want to talk to her about how you feel, then I would say evaluate what is positive about your relationship. Are you really that close? Are you growing apart? That happens when we start experiencing new things as newly minted adults. And its fine if you are growing apart, but she still did not handle this well at all.",
            "I'm in no way trying to suggest that this is the same situation as your beloved father passing away, but when my father cut all contact with my mother and I at age 19, I was going through some really rough times. My friends really didn't know how to act around me. They wouldn't bring it up, and I felt like I was pathetic when I brought it up myself and wanted to share my feelings. In the end, people who have no experience with your situation just don't know what to say or do. Everyone goes through a different grieving process, and those who do care often don't know how to handle the friendship while you're in that state. \n\nThe thing to remember is that you probably don't want consolation and advice from someone who doesn't know what its like. Trust me. People say very stupid and offensive things when they don't know what they're talking about. Sometimes it's much better when they say nothing at all. ",
            "I know if I were in her position when I was her age I would probably have acted somewhat the same. Knowing what to say after someone dies is difficult, especially when the person you're talking to is very close to you. Like, do you bring it up? What if they want to move on? If I talk to them about it is insensitive?\n\nJust tell her straight out that you need her to talk to you about it. If she's just having an awkward reaction, she'll switch gears and give you the support you need. If she doesn't then she's not really your best friend.",
            "Some non-malignant narcissists are simply incapable of empathy. They don\u2019t feel it. Some people are terrified of death and avoid any reference due to repressed grief or panic attacks.\n\nJust tell her how you feel and ask  her about her reaction - or rather non reaction .\n\nSome friends are very good for some specific things and some are not. ",
            "It is sobering to realize your childhood best friend really does not care about you. I had something very similar happen around that age. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s sucks bad. ",

            "I'm so sorry for your loss. From what you've said, I would assume she just feels very uncomfortable bringing it up. She probably thinks it is constantly on your mind and making you sad, so she doesn't want to feel like she is making you think of it more or asking questions and invading your privacy at this difficult time. If I were you, I would ask to get together soon, and talk about it. Talk about what happened, how you feel, whatever's on your mind. If she doesn't sympathize in the moment, then you'll know she really isn't a friend you want to keep around. However, I'm sure she will be better face to face. Good luck <3",
            "Our two sons were killed in a car accident and I was appalled at some of some peoples comments.  I decided to write a book and call it, \"Stupid shit people say when you kids die\" .  As the list grew, I realized that people just don't know what to say or what to do.  My wife was driving and the comment,\" I hope you can forgive her for killing your kids\" actually took the prize.  Your friend has no idea of what to say or how to act, cut her some slack.",
            "Similar experience here. My brother died 7 years ago and it\u2019s taken me a while to forgive and understand how my friends acted in that time. I felt exactly the way you describe.\n\nPeople just don\u2019t know what to say and they\u2019re scared to bring it up because they don\u2019t want to upset you more by reminding you about it. \n\nStart by bringing your dad up in conversation, basically giving others permission to bring him up as well. That goes for your grief as well. Talk about it. Let her know that you want to/need to talk about it and that it\u2019s okay to ask questions.\n\nPeople aren\u2019t mind readers, sometimes you need to tell them what you need from them. And that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to be direct and honest about what you need. If you aren\u2019t and continue to be angry and hurt, it\u2019ll just build resentment and that friendship will turn toxic fast. \n\nYou may realize that she just isn\u2019t the type of friend to be there for you in this capacity. Maybe she\u2019s a \u2018let\u2019s have fun\u2019 friend. You can choose to accept that or let her go. And that\u2019s okay.  You can\u2019t change people. Accept her for who she is or move on. \n\nBe honest and direct about what you need and be ready to re-evaluate this relationship. ",
            "Just going to put this out there... This is sort of a hard concept to grasp when you're still a teenager especially if you've never lost anyone close to you. I wouldn't put too much emphasis on their behavior they likely just don't understand. There are a lot of things people just don't understand unless it's explained to them a dozen times; for some people, it takes physically seeing you break down before they show that they care at all. I'm sorry you have to go through this - a lot of people only care about themselves.",
            "Well, here's your tough life lesson: people truly don't give a fuck. You shouldn't expect anyone to care that your father died. \n\nThere's also the possibility that she just doesn't want to bring it up but remember, nobody truly cares that your father died except a few close people who he knew.",
            "I'm very sorry for your loss. Maybe she isn't good around those situations, so she tried to talk about other stuff to distract you.\n\n\nIt's immature, but it doesn't necessarily mean that she's a horrible friend. ",
            "Emotional maturity and empathy are learned behaviors.  Up until your mid-20's your brain is still developing.  Even after that you can still keep learning to be a better person! \n\nYour friend probably doesn't know what to say/can't relate and therefore feels like she shouldn't speak/is just a normal selfish teen.  If you need support and help from her, you could always ask!  Then her reaction will help you figure out if she's just uncertain of what to do or just self-centered.",
            "I don\u2019t think your friend doesn\u2019t care. Death is such a sore spot as you\u2019re feeling that it\u2019s hard to know, whether or not you should talk about it. I have multiple friends with family members who have passed and as horrible as it is, I have a little experience being on her end.\n\nI found it very hard to try and bring up conversation because I simply didn\u2019t want to remind my friend of the pain they might be feeling. I did ask how they were feeling. However, in my eyes, I\u2019d rather be distracted from that pain rather than have people constantly bring it up. Maybe she feels the exact same way obviously I don\u2019t know. \n\nI\u2019d just say there\u2019s nothing wrong with talking about it. Tell her you\u2019re really struggling and you need her to be there for you. I wouldn\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t been doing anything, maybe she feels not bringing him up is the best way to make you feel normal. That\u2019s how I\u2019d like to be treated.",
            "She\u2019s not old enough to process but I suggest putting this friend on rest at the moment and some self care and find comfort with friends who support you . I\u2019m so sorry you went through this. This is very brave of you and your father must be very proud to have such a loving daughter. ",

My boy friend really wants me to go with him, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the best thing for me, career wise. Currently, I\u2019m in school, going for my bachelor\u2019s degree. I only have two years left, and after that, I plan on getting into law school. He\u2019s in the Air Force, stationed in Texas. Which he\u2019s been here for about three years now. We have been together for 1 and a half. Knowing that he\u2019s going \u201coverseas\u201d, it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll be stationed in different countries for a few years. What\u2019s holding me back is my career. Law school isn\u2019t meant to be jumping around from country to country without knowing where you\u2019ll land permanently due to the bar exam. Also, we aren\u2019t married and I don\u2019t know if I should risk my career (which I\u2019ve been very committed to being a lawyer) for a future that\u2019s a bit warped. I did see that I can become a programmer and it\u2019ll be versatile, but that\u2019s not what I truly want to do. Sure, Hawaii seems amazing, but more of a 3 year long vacation with a questionable future. We both agreed that long distance wouldn\u2019t work since I would be all the way in Texas. Is it bad that I want to go but don\u2019t want to risk it all just to be put in a bad situation of misery? Also, if I do go, I\u2019d have to transfer schools, and go to school in Hawaii. That\u2019s already a very high tuition, that has to be paid by fasfa and student loans. Quite frankly, I\u2019m also afraid that I won\u2019t be able to sustain myself, separately from my boy friend\u2019s income. I like to feel independent, and know that I can fend for myself. Maybe that\u2019s a pride issue? I don\u2019t know, but I do know it\u2019s a high standard of living. That also adds to the jumble of thoughts. I will also admit, I am fairly close to my parents. In my Hispanic household, we have always been very united. I currently work with them in their small business because it benefits the both of us. I can go to school with a flexible schedule and still make good income and they have a stable employee. That\u2019s something my boy friend never really knew growing up. He\u2019s a Kansas boy, from a small town, with parents who split up when he was little. I feel like he doesn\u2019t understand how hard it\u2019ll hit my parents and I, being far away for three years. It also bothers them a bit that I\u2019m not married but willing to leave not knowing what\u2019ll happen in the relationship. \n\nTL;DR: My boy friend is in the military and is being stationed in Hawaii. We have been together for one year and a half. We are currently In Texas. I want to go to law school, but moving around will be difficult. i\u2019m trying to do what\u2019s best for the both of us, what\u2019ll benefit my career, how it\u2019ll affect my parents and what\u2019s the best choice since I\u2019m not married, In the long run. \n\nEDIT: I am very thankful for all the supportive responses. This generated more responses than I thought I\u2019d get, and I\u2019m speechless (in a good way). While, I couldn\u2019t respond to all, I want to thank everyone who took time out of their day to help me out. I am very grateful. I will keep you guys posted. In a few months or so, I will come back and update on what I\u2019ve decided. Also, to all the people who serve/served our country, thank you for your service. As well as military spouses/kids, for being strong and supporting the person you love. I really do have respect for you all. ",

(I don't know him, but I do know military culture, and while adultery isn't encouraged, it is pretty openly tolerated.)\n\nBesides, if the relationship can't handle being apart for only 2 years....\n\nAnd let's not forget that him being deployed to a forward area will result in separation anyway. Better get used to it.",

            "So, Im a military brat (both parents military) and grew up watching relationships like yours play out. One of my parents is also from Hawaii pre-service. My advice? Without knowing anything about you and the strength of your relationship, DONT GO. For the love of everything holy, don't go. \n\nIn this scenario, your bf has nothing to lose. Him asking you to come requires zero sacrifice and really no accomodation on his part. But it would require you to sacrifice alot and leave you extremely vulnerable. I mean, Hawaii has an extremely high cost of living and their schools arent exactly top class. The chance that things dont work out and youre stuck in an expensive af area that you don't really want to be in is high. Even if you guys don't break up, you may end up hating the area, your debt, etc and resenting him for it.  \n\nIs the military a career for him? Because, if so, you guys need to be able to handle long distance. Lawyers don't exactly travel well in their careers. ",

You may love him so much, and that\u2019s completely okay but if it\u2019s meant to be it\u2019ll work out. Long distance is hard but with Skype they seem so much closer, a lot of people do it successfully. \n\nYou don\u2019t want any regrets. If you move you don\u2019t want any thoughts \u2018of what could have been\u2019, you\u2019ll only end up hating each other because of it.

            "If you compromise your career path for your boyfriend, you'd be accepting 100% of the risk of later relationship breakdown for like 20% of the benefit of relationship continuation. Never ever ever do that. \n\nIf you got married first, and he agreed to pay the difference in your tuition from where you would have gone with the extra money soldiers get from being married and promised to get out of the military when his five years is up so you can pick a place to take the bar and stay, then it'd be closer to 50/50 and might not be a disastrous idea, but at your age and with your conflicting career situation I *really* can't recommend marrying someone you've been dating less than like six years. ",
            "Wanting to be independent and self sufficient is absolutely not a pride issue! Financial independence is extremely important and you should prioritize figuring out what your own career options are first. And you two might just have to be long distance for a while until you figure it out. I know entirely too many women who can\u2019t leave unhappy situations because they are dependent on their spouses. I certainly hope the best for you and your boyfriend but if things ever did go south in the relationship, you definitely don\u2019t want to be in a position where you\u2019re broke, isolated from your family, and have limited job prospects in a high cost of living state. ",
            "Is there guarantee he\u2019ll be stationed in Hawaii that long? For example, maybe you\u2019re there a year in but then he gets sent to another state or country, then you\u2019d have to pack your bags, scramble to transfer out of your current school, or quit your dreams and follow him.\n\nSo even if you move with him, there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll even be there long enough for you to finish school. And what happens if you find a job or school, but he gets sent somewhere else? Would you uproot yourself again?\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to follow someone if you have your heart set on a career and vision of the future already. Follow your career. Career is one of those things you don\u2019t want to mess up, and you\u2019ll have a lot more regret about what could\u2019ve been career-wise than relationship-wise.",
            "When you\u2019re married to/dating someone in the military, there\u2019s no \u201cwhat\u2019s best for us\u201d when you\u2019re the spouse/partner. There\u2019s his job, which is top priority because it requires deployments and moving, and then there\u2019s what you can do in those situations, making the best of it. \n\nYou\u2019re right in that his job isn\u2019t really conducive  to your educational goals. You can probably speed up the graduation date on your bachelor\u2019s degree but that just gets you closer to law school. As a girlfriend, you\u2019re more of an added expense because the military doesn\u2019t pay to move you, your boyfriend doesn\u2019t get increased funds to help cover the cost of living for a two person family, and you are sort of left on your own for insurance, getting a job, or any other sort of benefit a military spouse would get. I know what that means because I moved cross country with my military boyfriend and had none of those resources. We were supposed to be in California for 2 years but after 9 months the military decided they needed my boyfriend somewhere else and changed his orders. The US military doesn\u2019t say \u201chey, how do you feel about a transfer?,\u201d they say \u201chere\u2019s where you\u2019re going, you\u2019re due there by _____.\u201d There\u2019s no guarantee that if you move to Hawaii, he\u2019s there the duration. We ended up moving back across the country to somewhere completely different. I put my own life on hold for several years because of his career. I\u2019m not sorry I did it because it\u2019s been 20 years since and we\u2019re still together, but it was a really tough time. It\u2019s hard being alone in a new area without your friends and family as a support network, dependent on someone who may or may not be able to be there for you because of their job, while you\u2019re trying to get your own job or education lined up. \n\nFor someone in your situation, given your career goals and educational aspirations, going to Hawaii doesn\u2019t make sense. A bachelor\u2019s degree can be picked up from anywhere or even possible finished online but a law degree, internships, and profession? That\u2019s not a \u201cmobile\u201d possibility, really. Only you can really answer for yourself if this is all worth it. Does your boyfriend plan to stay in the military for the duration of his work career? \n\nFWIW, being married doesn\u2019t assure things go right. Being a military spouse is still hard and a deployment is a deployment. ",
            "First and foremost if you moved you are moving as a girlfriend. So you get no benefits. You will be responsible for your own housing and food and all that. The cost of living is a heck of a lot higher than where you are now. So the obvious thought to that is to get a job. but can you? You would be moving into an over saturated job market. Where workers can be found left and right (military spouses). If your schedule doesn't work for them, they have 10 people behind you to chose from. \nThe military doesn't care about how long you might be there. There is NO guarantee he will be there 3 years (even if his orders say so). He can get there and the deploy somewhere (that you can't go to) 3 months later. I have PERSONALLY watched this happen. Also, he could be there a year and then get transferred to a new duty station.  Which means you would be in the middle of school work while trying to pack a house and ship it. Plus unless you get married the military won't pay to move all your belongs. They will pay for him 2 sea bags and give him the option to drive his car or pay for a plane ticket. \n\nMy opinion is that you stay where you are and finish school if that is truly what you want. He is getting to follow his dreams. Don't sacrafice your own.",
            "\"Some women chose to follow men and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you it doesn't love you anymore.\"\n\nHonestly, 21 is too young to give up your dreams for a boyfriend. You have so much time to pursue your goals, set yourself up for success and happiness, and meet a man who will support you and love you. Dropping your education to follow a guy who will be stationed all over isn't your dream and you know that.",
            "OP, I'm former military and grew up in a military family, and imo you should NOT put your dreams on hold to follow him. Sooo many military people start out in love and young and get divorced. I know you aren't married, but two of the only ways to make a relationship with an active military member is to go long distance or get married. And many, many military marriages are plagued by adultery, abuse, and general dysfunction. \n\nIt sounds like you're ambitious and want a big, awesome career. Now a military spouse can get educated and have a career, but your career will always come second to your bf's and the whims of the military. I don't know what your ambitions as a lawyer are, if you want to move up to a judge position or politics, but that would be hard to impossible if you became a military spouse. Also, many spouses, especially those who rarely travelled or spent time away from their families, can't deal with the moving and being away from their loved ones. Your bf will likely deploy and for stretches of time you will be alone in whatever bfe base you guys get stationed at.\n\nIn the end it is your decision, but I strongly advise you to put you and your dreams first. If something is meant to be, it will be, and if not, you have had some good memories you can cherish.",
            "I'm giving you this from my perspective, so it isn't completely unbiased. I met my husband at 18, got married at 20 and he was deployed before our first anniversary. We had a small child that I was left alone with. I didn't have goals like you do, but I ended up resenting him. I was single mother that had financial assistance (his income) but I felt so alone. He wasn't mature enough to deal with aspects of being deployed, possibly dying, being away from me so he couldn't have sex, being away from family. Your bf likely won't miss family, but if he can't do long distance while you pursue your goals of becoming a lawyer, then there is no way you'd last with him being deployed for a year. \n\nWhen he came back he used his deployment as an excuse for every shitty thing he did, when really he was just ignoring his duties as a husband and father. The chaplain stated before he was deployed that 80% of marriages end in divorce after deployment. Of the 5 guys he hung out with we were the only couple still married after 2 years post deployment.  We are divorced now because I finally grew a back bone and didn't want to be emotionally abused anymore. \n\nDon't move for this guy. I don't regret anything from my past, because at some point it was what I wanted, and you know that you want to be a lawyer and being in Texas is your best bet for your future. If you move you'll only delay your chance for the future you want. And it is very unlikely that you guys are done growing as people, and you'll find that he probably isn't what you want in a husband. ",
            "Never make career decisions based on someone you've been dating for under two years.\n\n(Scrolling down into the comments, the fact that he's indifferent is a red flag that he doesn't love you and care about your life enough to be worth uprooting it for him either.)",
            "You can't go. Going isn't even an option. You're too established where you're at. Finish your education and see where things are at then. ",
            ">  Is it bad that I want to go but don\u2019t want to risk it all just to be put in a bad situation of misery?\n\nNot at all! In fact, that's an excellent way to look at it. Moving for an SO and realising that it'll mean some huge compromises in your life is a very good thing to be clear about. It sounds like you have a lot of reasons not to move, and they sound incredibly important to you. From what you've said, the decision to stay where you are on your current track sounds like the right one for you.\n\n> My boy friend really wants me to go with him\n\nOf course he does, there's no downside for him if you do. However, there are a lot of downsides for you, and it's not at all wrong of you to acknowledge that. One other factor to consider is how easily you would be able to test the situation. Say you did move with him and loved it: great. If you didn't enjoy it, resent him, miss your family too much or don't enjoy the alternative career options, would you still be able to move home and continue with the career you wanted, or would the move be a huge cost and set you back a lot? If the cost is high and the risk is high, I can appreciate that moving with him isn't an attractive (or sensible) option.",
            "You're only 21. The chances that you two will be together in the long run are very low. Don't change your educational plans for a guy. I know it feels super serious, and breaking up seems awful right now, but there will be others.",
            "Don't do it. A year an a half is way too early in a relationship to uproot your life, your education, and your family dynamic to follow some guy especially at your age. My SO is military and never once did I consider following him around when he enlisted - we agreed that my education needed to come first, and that we could deal with the distance for a few years. \n\nIs your boyfriend wanting to stay in the Air Force for a full career or just round our his current contract? If he wants to stay in then you need to have a serious conversation about what you both want out of the relationship, because this is far from the last time he will be blindsided by a sudden PCS which affects you. If he wants to separate within the next few years, it might be worth considering if the distance is really all that bad. In my experience, being in an LDR during college has actually been quite a blessing.\n\nAlso, this may be an unpopular opinion, but if you guys already know that you can't handle a little bit of distance, what the hell are you doing together in the first place? Does he have an AFSC where he's guaranteed never to deploy or TDY? If not you will have to be separated at some point during his career anyhow. There are definitely challenges involved when you're in an LDR but it is NOT that bad and I strongly believe that if you can't cope with a bit of distance, you're really not equipped as a couple to cope with the challenges and surprises that life will throw at you in the future. The \"it's not even worth trying\" mentality is really flaky and not what you want to hear from someone who expects you to literally pack up your life and move off the continent with him without even giving you the commitment of a marriage first. \n\nHonestly, my suggestion would be to stay in Texas, whether or not that means losing the boyfriend, and finish law school. If by any chance the two of you are still together by then, you could look into becoming a JAG and applying for Joint Spouse. Every AF base needs a lawyer somewhere, so your job would be highly portable and you'd be very likely to get stationed with him every time he has to PCS. Or, depending on how portable HIS AFSC is, he would get stationed with you every time you PCS (you would be the higher ranking member, so assuming his job is also very portable, yours would have priority).\n\nWhatever you do, don't move with him right now. You'll destroy your education and career prospects and no reasonable partner would let you do that. ",
            "Now, depending on if your boyfriend intends to make the military a career or not, you should also keep in mind that you have the potential to be separated from him further when he is deployed in the future. Given you're already held up pursuing a degree in college, it sounds like it would be unwise to follow him to Hawaii. Ultimately it's up to you and him, but the military girlfriend/spouse lifestyle tends to be quite rough on most people -- are you and him prepared to do a long distance relationship?",

            "Had a friend (19F) who was married to a guy (20M) who ended up getting stationed in Hawaii. She ended up hating Hawaii. Small island, super expensive, and she described it as fun place to be a tourist but not exactly a fun place to live. She has been stuck there for years with him, but she did it because they were married and it was what was best for their marriage.\n\nI would ask yourself this: if your relationship were to end for some reason, would you regret having moved to Hawaii?\n\nEDIT: Clarification with wording",
            "As someone who\u2019s very stupidly put my life dreams on hold or whatever for a guy, please don\u2019t. Please. None of the relationships worked out. It\u2019s not worth it. Do whatever you feel is best for you, but don\u2019t go just because you want to be with him. You\u2019re so young. I just got out of an engagement and I regret a lot! So much missed out on for a relationship that failed in the end, which has a pretty high probability of happening. \n\nGood luck with your choice! You sound smart and will make the best decision in the end. ",
            "The military doesn\u2019t pay for girlfriends to follow their boyfriends to duty stations. \nIf you were married, the military pays to send wives, children, and home goods/belongings to duty stations. \nThey will also provide military housing or a stipend to find housing out in town. \n\nYour boyfriend is going to be placed in the military barracks and they don\u2019t allow permanent overnight guests. This means you are going to have to pay to fly yourself, find an apartment on your own, and find your own job. \n\nI actually live on Kaneohe marine base at the moment as a married male spouse. My wife is the military member serving in the navy and we have a house on-base. \n\nThe job market sucks out here. Groceries are expensive as fuck out here. Rent is expensive. The separation from family and old friends is pretty hard. You will end up broke and barely getting by working for minimum wage at a retail store or fast food joint. \n\nMy recommendation - try long distance for a while. If you guys can\u2019t do the distance/separation, you won\u2019t be able to last a deployment. Stay in school or work on enriching your current career. \n\nI know too many young couples stationed here that got married so the girl could be with their high school sweetheart. They tend to end up miserable and stay inside their house all day with no socialization while their husband is at work or on deployment. \n\nPlease please reconsider. Don\u2019t move out here as a girlfriend. DONT GET MARRIED JUST TO GET MILITARY HOUSING.  ",

But you need to do you and allow yourself to be open to new possibilities. And he needs to be open to the same. You guys can always revisit the whole relationship and living situation once school is over. LDR set ups are hard (and mine was during 99-01, tech dark ages). Best of luck to you both :)",

            "This happened to my mom, sort of. She met my dad at university, where she was close to finishing her program for nuclear medicine and he was going off to the Federal police academy. They got married, and after they both finished their respective training, they promptly got stationed in the middle of nowhere for my dad's job....in a town without a large enough hospital to have a nuclear medicine department. \n\nThey lived there, then a string of similar small towns, for about 20 years. My mom never worked in her field; she started working for the government so that she would be able to get some type of job wherever they went. When we finally moved back to a big enough city, it was too late. After 20 years, her training was out of date and she would have had to go back to university all over again. \n\nI've never asked my mom how she really feels about all that. Was being married to my dad, and her subsequent life, worth giving up her career for? I don't know what she would say....but all I know is, my mom is hella smart, too smart to be working some boring government job. ",

            "I am the same age as you but slightly different circumstances. First off I recommend cross posting this to r/USMilitarySO to actually get a military side view of this (no offense but civilians don't really fully know what you'd be getting yourself into). \n\nI also met my boyfriend about a year and a half ago while I was still in college. I'll be graduating this semester and moving to be with him. The difference with you is that you still arnt graduated yet. I personally recommend staying and finishing your bachelor's. If you guys can't stand 2 years apart I'm not sure it's ment to be. \n\nDistance is one of the strongest things that can make or break a relationship. Hawaii while does have a shitty time zone from Texas, isn't unreasonable to have a long distance relationship. \n\nWe have similar career futures. I am a financial major so it works best for me to stay in one place and grow my client base. However, my boyfriend is more important to me than making money. I know there are jobs I'll be able to get that are reasonable for my education, and eventually when we come back to settle down I'll have years of government work that I can have on my resume and I can continue my education overseas if needed. \n\nIt is fully possible for you to move to Hawaii and finish your degree before he would be sent to another station (normally it's 2 years for OCONUS) however you must be willing to accept that you will rarely be in one location for more than a few years. I see this as an amazing thing to see the world with my loved one. However I understand that some people like building a home and a future in one location. \n\nOverall nobody can make this decision but you. Make sure you think over the pros and cons well so you don't regret it later in life. I recommend long distance for the next 2 years to build a closer bond together and to finish up your degree.  Again I recommend coming over to r/USMilitarySO to get more spouces views. Alot of us have been in your footsteps already. ",
            "I am a lawyer. My husband is also former military, as I am. But we met when I was 28 and finishing up my last year of law school (I worked a few years after undergrad and returned to school as I really wanted to pursue law). He was also on the way out of the military via an early retirement and was out a few months after we started dating. Honestly, if he was still planning to stay in I likely would not have even had a first date with him, because of my own experiences and my own goals. I was not interested in \u201cmarrying back in\u201d to the military. Glad it did not work out that way as it turned out he is my person, but that is how much I did not want back into that lifestyle.\n\nWhen we moved once I was done law school it was for both of us, but we stay where we are because of my career (which he is fine with by the way, but the reality is my career - in order to develop and maintain my practice in which I am now a partner - does lack mobility).\n\nMy opinion is not to move. Not at this age, not for someone who in light of your age you have been dating a very short time, not when you are currently pursuing your own important career goals. When you have no idea at this time where you might be able to find a junior position even or be kept on, or even necessarily where and what you want to practice (and the market can be tough for new lawyers, and often you need to start off taking what you can before you can move into what you want)\n\nYou are right, your future law career is not very portable unless you are prepared to deal with new bar exams/entry requirements/re-education/retraining depending on where you are - and in some places you may not be able to even do that as your education is not equivalent to whatever requirements it is in the country you are posted and it is not even an option. You may get to find work as a legal assistant or something if he gets posted somewhere like that (I have seen it happen with people moving countries) but that is not what you went for school or busted your ass to develop your career after for.  \n\nIt is also incredibly hard to develop a strong reputation and healthy legal practice if you are moving every few years. If this is your path, and you plan to stay with your boyfriend you both have to acknowledge that you would not always be able to move with him if you wanted to keep\nworking. Ultimately, you may just have incompatible life goals and paths, and that is okay, this is part of dating and so on. Figuring this out, breaking up with those who are incompatible including in terms of life goals, etc.\n\nAnd yes, you would need to figure out a way to earn income as his income at this level won\u2019t go too far on Hawaii even for him, never mind a girlfriend (and you won\u2019t be on his benefits etc as you aren\u2019t married).\n\nEven if you were not planning to go into law I would be telling you to be very cautious at 21 to move to another state entirely for reasons of a boyfriend. ",
            "Please don't move just for him, you have your whole future ahead of you, for yourself. What would you do if you guys broke up while you were in Hawaii, or later on another move? You might feel like your life was ruined. There's always a way to make long distance work, always something to figure out, unless he or you feel like you absolutely need the physical aspect in order to not fall out of love. I'm doing long distance myself, and I'm always happy to help/answer questions. ",

Now 8 years and 4 bases later, she has a great career and we have two wonderful children. But it wouldn\u2019t have been possible if she hadn\u2019t finished her degree.

I had to find a new job, make new friends, etc. That ended up being the deciding factor for me joining the military as well. \nIf you\u2019re truly committed to your future career, I\u2019d honestly say to keep on with it. ",
            "Don\u2019t go. First off (and I say this as a girlfriend of someone that was in the Air Force) the military will NOT view you as a spouse unless you are legally married. So you don\u2019t have any of the \u201crights\u201d of a spouse that the military would help him and his family with. Second, if you aren\u2019t damn sure you can\u2019t support yourself, he\u2019s not getting married pay. He\u2019s only making a bare minimum the military has decided based on marital status and rank (you don\u2019t get rich in the military, so you are sort of at the bare minimum you need to live). And second, (my \u201cboyfriend\u201d are struggling with a semi-similar scenario, and it sucks but I know it\u2019s the best and only way, if you want some support and want to talk, feel free to message me or however that works) you will always regret and turn out resenting him for preventing you or making it harder to finish school and your dream of being a lawyer. I know it\u2019s hard, but maybe agree to just be friends that flirt or whatever you want to say, but not really dare and say you\u2019re both free to date whoever, but if you\u2019re both single when he gets back or you finish school, then that\u2019s awesome and go and do it. But you\u2019ll end up resenting him or maybe worse, being stranded in a state (that you also can\u2019t just drive cross-country) with no money or way to support yourself or anything, totally reliant on him.",

If he got deployed somewhere else at a moments notice, you would be left there along for however long he is gone.  The military is a very rough life on relationships and only people that are seriously truly committed and willing to walk through fire for each other make it.  Sometimes even they don't make it.  \n\nYou have a plan ahead for you.  Don't compromise your dreams and goals for a huge what if like that.  You don't want to leave your family, uproot your life.  The military life can be very nomadic because you move around a lot.  While he is in, you won't be able to set up long term roots anywhere or make a long term plan for a job.  Think hard if that is the kind of life you want, then I think you will know the right decision for you.  Good luck. ",

I was blown away. I live in a mid-sized city with average cost of living; in Hawaii (especially on Oahu), everything was 3 to 5 times as expensive as back home. Milk was like $7 per gallon, my $2 shampoo was $6, bread was like $5 for a loaf. Eating out was about double the cost of what i\u2019m used to. These things added up and really drained my bank account faster than i would have thought.\n\nThat said, if you can pursue an *actual* career there, once you\u2019re ready to take the Bar, go for it. It\u2019s an amazing place if you can afford to live there. The lifestyle is incredibly seductive.

See how you feel without him nearby and finish your degree. If he's still important to you, you can go to law school wherever he is (though I doubt you'll want to). The fact is, as a military spouse, your career and relationship with your family  will always take a backseat to what the military demands. No matter how nice he is, he'll have no control over that. Do you ever want kids? You have to be cool with being a single parent for a year at a time with no control over when the time comes (like when you're close to making partner and he gets deployed). Don't become a military spouse by default, only do it if you really want and understand the sacrifices that entails. \n\nThe only other option I see if you decide your relationship to him should be the priority is to go ROTC, have the military pay for law school, and have your own military career. That way you'll at least be working as a lawyer no matter where you get stationed. \n\n&#x200B;",

Nope, brotherhood before all. I'm not saying all military individuals are like that, but it's a very high percentage that are. \n\nDo not give up your law degree and passion for someone who has shown these tendencies just a couple months into your relationship.

If hes not going to make a career out of it and will leave in a few years then I would say go for it if you're okay with putting yourself on hold, but if hes going career I'd say leave now.

The company did have a work from home policy, and allowed for remote work - which will be relevant in a moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI weighed all options carefully. I was not in school at the time but I looked at every single option. What schools are available to me and the degree I would pursue in Boston? What is the cost of living like compared to LA? What opportunities are available to me in Boston? And then the long look at the relationship. Did I see a future with him? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSure, we all romanticize a future with each partner we've been with. It's just part of being human. But you really need to ask yourself this question, and analyze every single angle. Do they want kids? How do they respond to stress and pressure? How will they respond to kids/pets? Do your families get along? How will this move impact your relationship with your family? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me, moving across the country meant going from seeing my mom roughly every week to 2-3 times a year. It also meant giving up Disneyland (all jokes aside, I'd go a few times a month). It meant giving up all of my friends, for something unknown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd for me, it was worth it. I embrace the journey and I am always willing to take on change and challenges head on. We also did a 3 week cross country road trip. However, halfway through the road trip the company I worked for decided that they did not wish to keep me on as a remote employee for reasons that aren't relevant here. The company put me through hell and back with all of that, and it further solidified I made the right choice with the move. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter being in Boston for 2 years now, I have a great career, have finished the first year of my BA, and have a few friends (finally). Oh, and we're engaged! No one can tell you what is right for YOU to do. This is a HUGE change, and the sacrifice you'll make is literally life changing. I personally would make the move again in a heartbeat. Each highlight, each low, it all taught me so much about myself and strengthened our partnership. But you also cannot compromise what you want out of life, or put it on hold if you are not CERTAIN where your relationship stands. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice, take some time to reflect on what you really want both out of life and out of this relationship.

            "You have to prioritize yourself. It\u2019s a harsh reality to recognize that you may not be forever with this guy. You always have to put yourself first and take care of your own life. How would you feel if you did uproot your life and then the relationship ended? You\u2019d live with a lot of regret for not having made choices for yourself. If y\u2019all really love each other, you\u2019ll survive the distance and make the most of your time together. You\u2019re young! You have your whole life ahead of you. Build that life you want for yourself. If he\u2019s meant to be in your life, y\u2019all will work through it. Our partners are supposed to be people we live alongside of. Build your life while he builds his. Both of your careers are important. Finish your education and pursue your passions - he should be insanely supportive of that while recognizing how hard the distance will be. But it can be done! Stay strong. ",
            "They didn't just barely tell him, orders take time, he's full of crap. Break up with him and move on.  I was military for 10 years. You'd have to marry him, go with your gut. Your Instinct is telling you something is amiss. Trust your gut.",

            "I cannot begin to express how much I thank God that I didn\u2019t follow my Air Force boyfriend of 1.5 years at the time to CA for 2 years when I was in school in the southeast.  I had initially planned to, but decided to end things.   THANK GOD.  I love my life now, and I couldn\u2019t imagine any other path for me.  \n\nIt\u2019s okay for the military life to be a dealbreaker.  It\u2019s far better to be honest about it on the front end.  It\u2019s okay to want stability, to focus on your own career and education, to live near your support system, to not want to be at the beck and call of the government.  \n\nThere are women who won\u2019t view that as a dealbreaker, and that\u2019s the kind of person he would be more compatible with.  You need someone with similar life goals as you.  \n\n",

Yours is law. I don\u2019t really see why you have to give up yours in order for him to fulfill his. Like you said, you can\u2019t be a traveling lawyer. \n\nAre there any branches in the military that don\u2019t move  as much? Is moving temporary and can you two get through it? Can you do long distance?\n\nIf none of those questions were met with a \u2018yes\u2019 then I honestly think you two should consider going your separate ways. :-/",
            "Noooooooooooooo.\n\nI am both former military here, and former military spouse. Either your relationship is strong enough that it can survive some serious long distance time apart, or it isn't. If it is strong enough, it will withstand you finishing the law degree without you moving to Hawaii and you can finish your law degree where you are at. \n\nIf it isn't strong enough to survive the separation, then you're unlikely to do well in a military relationship long term anyway. Even when I was a dependent spouse and living with my husband overseas, for a while he was deployed 6 months a year and we were still separated as much as we were together. So I see the risk here being that you move to be with him because you're afraid your relationship will fail if you don't live together - meaning there's a good chance it will fail anyway. So you're risking ruining your career dreams plus potentially hurling yourself into a lifetime of debt that you may never crawl out of for a relationship you aren't confident can survive. That's a stunningly bad plan. \n\n",
            "A lot of good advice already here. I wouldnt uproot my life in your situation. I'd stay the course (which you've planned really well and it sounds like you really know what you want to do).\n\nIf it was meant to be it will last long distance. If it can't, then it wasn't mean to be. Not that you can just be with anyone, but I think there are a number of people out there. Finding the one is all about timing. And it sounds like the timing just won't work with this one. \n\nI'm now married, and I spent several years in a long distance relationship with my husband.   And who knows, it might look back again...I went to the same high school with my husband, then moved to an entirely different country, and it wasn't until years later that we finally got together for good.\n",
            "There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" decision.  There is only what you choose and how you justify it to yourself afterwards.  It's your ability to predict how you will feel about it afterwards that can push you to do the \"right\" thing.  Good luck.    \n\n\nI think that the stress from uprooting and changing your life would definitely cause strain on your relationship.  Its whether your relationship is strong enough to power through that strain and how worth it it is to you to go through it that determines how happy you will be.  You know yourself better than the rest of us do.  Again, good luck.  ",

I\u2019m so happy I waited. I\u2019m sure the first guy would\u2019ve made a great partner, but timing is EVERYTHING. Especially since you\u2019re so committed to your career. Best of luck with whatever you decide!",
            "Military wife here. My background: my husband did ROTC in college, so we dated for two years then, then he had two years of training in various places while I worked in the Midwest and we did long-distance, and then we got married and I moved out to Hawaii with him. We\u2019ve been married for five years now, together for nine years total. \n\nI would strongly advise you not to go. You\u2019re in the middle of getting your degree and school (heck, life in general) in Hawaii is expensive as hell. You\u2019re 21 years old and basically unattached; this is the time to put yourself first. You want to finish your degree and go to law school; moving to Hawaii will make that insanely difficult. Also, your boyfriend is going to be incredibly busy with work, and he\u2019d be the only one you know out there, so you\u2019ll essentially be figuring out this new, expensive place all by yourself, which can lead to lots of relationship issues. If you move and then y\u2019all break up, you\u2019ve set yourself back with school and wasted a lot of money, plus then you\u2019re kind of stuck out there for awhile. I saw so many relationships end on my husband\u2019s boat because these girls had moved out there for their boyfriends/fianc\u00e9s/husbands but they got bored or resentful and everything went to hell. \n\nIf you two love each other, don\u2019t be so quick to dismiss the long-distance relationship. Hawaii is far from Texas, no doubt about it, but it\u2019s doable if you\u2019re with the right person. ",
            "I feel like if you have to think about it this hard you already know what the answer is deep down. If it was my boyfriend, it wouldn\u2019t even be a question- i would be going with him because i wouldn\u2019t be able to bear being away from him. If you\u2019re not at that level, i wouldn\u2019t do it. ",

            "GIRL please do not go with him!! Look, I\u2019m sure he is great. But at your age, you shouldn\u2019t sacrifice your career plans for a relationship.\n\nWhen I was 22, I went thru a similar dilemma. I had the opportunity to go and live in France after college but I seriously considered not going because I didn\u2019t want to leave my boyfriend behind. It was seriously one of the toughest decisions I have ever had to make. I ended up going, but I cried a LOT and when I first got to France, for months even, I wasn\u2019t even sure I had made the right decision. But that year changed my life in the best way possible and I would regret it so much if I hadn\u2019t gone for the sake of a man.\n\nIt was very difficult. And it will be difficult for you as well, but seriously at this time in your life your career and life are more important. If you go to Hawaii with him that may mean you never reach your goals, and how will that feel 20 years from now? \n\nIt\u2019s gonna be a hard time for you to go through with this but I really recommend breaking up and perhaps looking at the relationship again maybe in a few years. He will be far away, you\u2019ll be busy with school, and I promise it will get easier. But please don\u2019t stay. Be selfish and put yourself first here.",

Working hours can range from 5am-12am...many times they are \u201cin the field\u201d for days or weeks at a time.\n\nMy SO deploys every 18ish months. Deployments last anywhere from 9-12 months. In between deployments, there are generally 2-3 thirty+ day training type missions to complete at various training bases across the country (usually Fort Polk, Bliss and Irwin). There are also 1-2 week field training exercises at their current base (but it doesn\u2019t matter because they\u2019re gone that entire time). Bottom line, they belong to the military and the military dictates where they go, what they do, how long they\u2019re gone.

You sound very independent and have a career path of your own...which is good. You\u2019ll need that. At the same time, will you be able to find a new job every 3 years?

But it\u2019s good that you\u2019re taking the time to consider your future...and if he fits into that. Really smart!\n\nEdit: My SO is Army. Air Force is different.

If there were benefits to you going to Hawaii, and you had your degree then go for it. But it seems that there isn\u2019t. You can\u2019t afford it, you haven\u2019t finished your degree, you have family here in Texas. I am also Hispanic and my family and I are very close. And it would be hard to uproot my life but I would uproot my life if I felt there was a chance for me to thrive somewhere else and become more independent. If there were good solid opportunities elsewhere, I would pursue it because you need to be selfish sometimes. There are right circumstances to leave with a guy; I don\u2019t feel this situation is one of them.\n\nDon\u2019t go. I think you will regret it and resent him.

I noticed in one of your comments, you said, \"I hope I make the right decision.\" Something that I've struggled to learn over the course of my life is that when it comes to these kinds of situations, there is not one \"correct\" decision. Once we make a choice, we have the power within ourselves to make it the right decision. It all comes down to keeping a positive attitude and looking positively toward the future. It's okay to feel sad, but it's not okay to spend your time wondering what could have been. Whether you choose to go with your boyfriend or not, know that whatever you decide WILL be the correct option. ",

Also there\u2019s the reality that you\u2019ll be making way more than him which studies show cause a huge strain on relationships.

Remember that you should always put yourself first and always put your future first.

You\u2019re just looking for support on what you already know is the right decision for you.\n\nYou are very young and have not been with him long. Relationships that start at your age often don\u2019t last. They can, but mostly it\u2019s just because neither of you is at a point t where you really know what you want out of life. You might think you do, but with a little more age and experience out in the real world, it will change. And there\u2019s a very good chance you two would simply grow apart anyway. Also factor in the harsh reality that even someone who seems to love you with all their heart now, could absolutely betray you in the future. It happened to me, it\u2019s happened to many others.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say that the two of you don\u2019t have something special that could last forever...you certainly could. But I know very well that I\u2019m not the only person who put their own personal goals and development on hold for a relationship...then got screwed over. And let me tell you, the aftermath is horrible. Especially if like me, you end up unable to support yourself when you split because you never could pursue a career that would be able to make the income to provide for yourself.\n\nPlus, let\u2019s say you go, and you don\u2019t end up doing law school because of it. You get married. You\u2019re going to be resentful of him someday, because you\u2019ll feel personally unfulfilled. \n\nYou are absolutely right to go with your gut here. Finish school, become a lawyer.  Fulfill your dream, become that fierce, independent, educated, awesome woman you want to be.

That\u2019s when I found out she had cheated but I was determined to fight for the love I thought could work. I got my assignment a few weeks into tech school and sure enough I got an overseas assignment in England. I think this factor is what truly made things worse for us.

We actually even got back together years later because we had such a bond. \n\nBeing in a relationship with someone in the military is never EVER easy - but it is possible to provide love and support from a distance. I know you said long-distance wouldn\u2019t work, but does that also mean you would break-up if/when he was deployed?

            "I actually faced a similar situation, but I\u2019m an archaeologist and not a lawyer. I stayed and finished school and it was the best decision of my life. By the time I finished though, I was aching for adventure and all my professors told me to take a break before grad school because in their experience, everyone who went straight in faces serious burnout and either didn\u2019t do as well or dropped out. I did end up taking a gap year between undergrad and grad school and did move out to be with the guy and got an office job. It was amazing. I had almost two years of freedom from school and was able to travel the entire American Southwest and saw amazing things I never would have if I didn\u2019t go. I also was able to grow into my relationship and see how supportive he was of a career that I admitted I loved more than him. It was also good to take that break because now that I\u2019m in grad school I\u2019m so focused and will stop at nothing to get my doctorate. i did have to move away from him and it was hard, but we both knew I was not giving up my career and this was a temporary break to have fun in my early twenties. I ended up marrying the guy too and it was a great decision. If he\u2019s worth it, he\u2019ll wait for you to finish school and do whatever it takes to support you in your pursuits. Our relationship is built on trust and building the other up to achieve their goals. We also joke that the other one wants achievements more than the person getting them. I pushed him to apply for great programs in the navy that would take him away from me and he pushed for me to accept jobs at digs that took me away from him. Hes deployed currently but he even has me spending his first four months back living in a different country to work on a great dig because he couldn\u2019t bear to see me miss a career opportunity because of him. Phones will always exist and we can always find a way to talk. The military is unpredictable too and he may end up leaving the service sooner rather than later. My husband loved being in the navy and our love of our jobs was what brought us together, but two short years later he\u2019s decided to leave the military after 8 years and pursue a career as a police officer. Your boyfriend may face something similar. My husband was going to spend his entire life in the navy and has achieved so much in a short time, but he\u2019s realized he can help more people being on the ground. It happens. \n\nAs for the age thing because I see you getting a lot of hate about that, I met him at 15, we got together officially at 20, married at 22, and still together and happy as ever at 25. It\u2019s not that long, but I don\u2019t think your age is necessarily a problem",

            "Maybe too much of a stretch - but would you consider joining the military too and, if so, could you still be in Hawaii with him? I went to law school with several vets - their tuition was largely paid for by their benefits and you can become a JAG, which would make your career more compatible and transportable.  I have a feeling this ultimately wouldn\u2019t work,  but just thought I\u2019d put it out there as an option for you to look at.  I was really impressed by the opportunities the armed services gave its members who decided to go to law school and wish I had known more about that before I went.  Law school debt can be crippling.\n\nIf that\u2019s not an option, do not go to Hawaii. You are absolutely right that outside of a few specialties, law degrees are not that easily transportable.  And if you want to take the bar in Texas ultimately, you really should go to a Texas law school as I believe that is one of the last few bars that is state specific.",

Either choice may leave you regretting forgoing the other.\n(Personal thought:  you\u2019ll reap tremendous rewards by finishing your studies and going on to achieve your dream of becoming a lawyer.)\n\nIt may be possible to achieve both.

Employers can look at your resume and tell that you\u2019re a military spouse and most don\u2019t want to hire you because they know you won\u2019t be there very long. They aren\u2019t allowed to ask but they know. I never took my CPA exam because like law it\u2019s not a field designed to be portable. In the long run I have a successful career in education but I ended up in this field because it worked with my husbands career. I have to say I absolutely loved living in Hawaii but it was easy for us because I was a spouse. I had housing and medical insurance. It will be challenging to live off the economy on your own. \n\nMy advice to you would be to pursue your career. Love really doesn\u2019t abide by boundaries so it will either work or it won\u2019t no matter where you live. Follow your dreams so that you won\u2019t have any regrets.

Not to say this will be your BF\u2019s story, but you guys don\u2019t sound ready for marriage and now is not the time to put your career and dreams on hold for a guy that could potentially move on in the blink of an eye if you weren\u2019t there.

Would you really be in shape to maintain your independence with their high cost of living?  Or, lets imagine that it does work out.  You're three years down the road bouncing around the country, with student loans you're paying off, working a job that has to be flexible to accommodate your moves...Perhaps I'm more in favor of stay where you're at and finish your school.  You should probably do a pros and cons and be open and honest with your boyfriend about it all.  You can maintain a relationship long distance initially, if it works out and you decide you'd like to try it then go ahead and move.  But...if you're still second guessing and hesitant, stay where you're at and keep your options open.

I don't know if this would be your experience, but her husband was often deployed on ships for months at a time.

            "Lawyer and military here.  Let me address your school and career concerns.  \nBottom line up front:  you have some options now, and that breaking up is not inevitable. It just will take serious communication between you. \n\nFirst, you have time.  You're admittedly five years away from sitting for the bar, so I would say that, to the degree you want to go with him and are able to make it work, your law career won't be affected too much.  Yes, transferring can suck and be more expensive sometimes, but law school transfers are common.  Also, where you graduated from *geographically* doesn't matter as much as the *quality* of law school you graduated from. Finally, you can sit for any bar exam once you have your JD in hand - so you can graduate from U Hawaii's law school and sit for the Texas bar. So it seems like you have some ability to go with him, continue your education, and figure out if you guys can and want to make it work.\n\nSecond, the military and moving aspects.  Those are totally valid concerns.  But you guys will need to think about, what are *his plans* come six years or so when you are a practicing attorney.  True, it's very hard to move as a lawyer and set up shop in a new jurisdiction every few years.  What are his career plans? Is he planning on staying active duty or willing to leave the air force before 20 years, maybe go in the Reserves / NG?  If not, are *you* willing to be together but live apart for extended periods?  \n\nFinally, your family. That's a valid concern, too. Have you ever contemplated moving away from them?  If so, this may be the opportunity to test whether that's a long term possibly, or if you're more inclined to stay local to them. If the latter is the case, you need(ed) to be up front with your boyfriend about that, so he can weigh whether there's a long term future for you guys from the perspective of his career aims.\n\nAll this is to say that you have some options now, and that breaking up is not inevitable. But do think it over, and to the extent you can make moving (perhaps just for the next few years while you finish your education) work for you both, don't be discouraged to give it a shot because of where you want to be in 5-6 years.  Good luck. \n\nEdit:  a lot of people are saying \"don't give up on your career goals.\"  I definitely agree.  But don't think that transfer and relocation now means giving up on your dream.  If you're able to transfer and financially make it work (a valid concern there, too) living in Hawaii for 3 years doesn't mean that your dream of being a lawyer in Texas is over and gone.  ",

Inside I found pictures of her clearly having sex with someone I have never seen before. I can barely type right now, let alone speak. She is at work right now, she won't be home for another 6 hours. I don't know what to do, reddit. I can't think, I can barely move, I feel so... lost.\n\nI don't know how I am going to recover from this. I can't afford to move out, but I would rather be homeless than spend one more second here.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed or even just some kind words would be appreciated.\n\n---   \n**TL/DR: Found pictures of LTR girlfriend cheating. Please help.**\n\nSlight update: Once I felt like I could breathe again, I looked at the EXIF data from the pictures. They're from last month, taken by her phone. \n\nUpdate 2: Thank you, everyone. I still feel like I want to throw myself in front of a bus (less so than before), but I found somewhere to stay until I get back on my feet. If anyone has any suggestions about how to stop feeling like there is a weight slowly crushing my chest, I would really appreciate it. I have some packing to do, but I will try to respond to the thread when I can.\n\n**Update 3**: I'm not vomiting or crying anymore, so I will consider that an improvement. Now I just feel empty. Like, somewhere between my belly button and my ribs is a space that used to be occupied and now is vacant. Time heals all wounds, I suppose. \n\nFirst, thank you all for responding to this thread. You have no idea how much it means to me to know that others, even if they are halfway around the world, care about this. Your collective advice and words of encouragement have helped me immensely. \n\nSecond, to update the situation, my things are packed and in my car. I found someone to stay with temporarily, although I'm not sure for how long. I took the things that were sentimental to me or reminded me of her, drove them out of town, and burned and smashed it all. It was cathartic. I suppose littering the outdoors with my mementos isn't very eco-friendly, but I'm hoping Mother Nature will give me a pass on this one.  \n\nThird, as per a number of requests in the thread, I changed her desktop background to one of the pictures. Having to look at it again while I did so was even harder than packing, I think, but it is done. It was unnecessary, as I have already asked her via text to never contact me again, but it is satisfying to know that she will have to come home to that. \n\nTo answer some of the other questions posed in the thread: \n\n* EXIF data from the pictures said they were taken by her phone last month.\n* I have racked my brain, and surprisingly, I cannot come up with any red flags about the relationship. She is a redditor, so I am trying to avoid specifics, but they were taken while she was on an extended trip. Perhaps she thought that she could have some sort of fling with someone she met and I would be none the wiser.\n* I can't explain why she left a folder containing these pictures on her laptop. It seems incredibly stupid to me, but it isn't like they were in plain sight. They were among a number of other, seemingly benign pictures.\n* I do not believe she wanted me to find out; she seems very upset and has been begging me to talk with her about it.\n\nFinally, I just want to reiterate: Thank you, Reddit. The support, the stories, and the kind words have meant more than any of you could know. ",

            "Thought my story of when I was cheated on and caught them in the act might help... or at least help crack a smile. I know how crushing this feels but trust me, you'll get over it and realize how much better off you are... Anyway.. story time...\n\nI had actually come home a week earlier than I was supposed to from the air force (this was a good 15 years ago) and figured I'd surprise her since she'd always talk about how much she misses me, would always send me pictures of her in the mail and write these long letters talking about our future together. Naturally I assumed she would be more than excited to see me walk in the door a week early. \n\nPulled up to the house and figured she was home because her car was there so I was as quiet as possible. Even parked my car down the street a little so she didn't see me pull up and ruin the surprise. Quietly put the key in the lock and slowly twisted...opened the door and the living room was dark. I thought... hm. Maybe she got picked up by some friends and went out somewhere. Oh well even better! I'll set up our room by going to get some flowers and making everything look all romantic and irresistible.... (hey it's been a few months, I was a bit pent up at that point). Start walking towards the bedroom and I hear this rhythmic squeaking noise followed by a deep grunt. My instinct reaction was someone broke in and trying to rip something off the wall, so I went into ass kicking mode until a few seconds later I heard a high pitched moan of a female. Yeah... I recognized that sound pretty well and knew what was happening. Being in the military I knew the worst possible thing I could do was anything violent so I wanted to fuck up whatever \"moment\" they were having. I walked towards the room very quietly while they went at it... of course they didn't hear me because they were far too \"deep\" in their actions. Luckily the door was halfway open so I got down and started crawling towards the bed out of their line of sight, slithered over to the edge of the bed they were closest to and started slowly inching my head up the side until just my eyes were above the edge. It took her a good minute (she was on the bottom) before she looked over and saw angry eyes staring at her. She freaked out so bad that she kicked the dude in the face and he fell off the bed and hit his head on the wall, she screamed louder than I've heard anyone scream in my life and bounced off the bed in a flailing, sweaty mess and I heard her ass hit the ground with a satisfying thud. I stood up and the guy was in a heap on the floor scared shitless at this dude in full military garb standing over him with crazy eyes. She finally realized who it was and started bawling her eyes out saying \"i'm so sorry! I was lonely!\" blah blah blah... who cares. I started laughing hysterically and all I said was \"Well dude, she's your problem now. Hope you don't mind herpes\"\n",

Bring in a couple friends, a moving truck, and take out all your stuff as quickly as you can.  Put it in storage for a month until you know where you'll be living.  I would not tell her why you've gone.  Leave her completely baffled.  Leave her with zero closure.  Leave her with no way to contact you.  Disappear like you've gone into a witness protection program.  There will be a time in your emotional processing where you feel like getting heavy revenge, and the purest form of this is to move on and not give her one second more of your time.  Do not seek to blacken her reputation on social media because it's a reflection of you.  Remain a class act.",

If you really need to, you can make an excuse for tonight and spend the night elsewhere. But if you hurry and just run off today, you might end up forgeting something important.\n\nI fully understand that you need to move as soon as possbile, but consider that an extra day might help you better prepare for your departure.",

            "First thing's first, you need to get out of that house.  It seems you've already sussed that out, which is good.  Call up any friends or family that are nearby, tell them why you're looking to move out and ask if they'd be willing to help you out for a while.  I'm sure there will be plenty of people willing to extend a sofa to you at least.\n\nNext, you need to get rid of anything that may remotely remind you of her.  Those are just things waiting to trigger negative emotions later down the track.  I'm not saying ignore your feelings, but it's never fun to come across a picture and find yourself balling your eyes out, or putting your fist through a wall.  These could be physical items or non-physical ones, such as facebook photos and social media content or contact information like phone numbers and skype contacts.  Get her out of your life and keep her out.\n\nFinally, the rest is really up to you.  You can choose to tell her why you're leaving if you wish, or you can be gone without so much as a word.  Personally, I'd leave something to let her know why you've made your decision - something like changing her desktop background to one of the photos.  Block her number in your phone if you don't want her to call or text you incessantly, because once she knows you know she'll \"be sorry\" for what she did.  If she does say things like this, remember that she's not sorry for what she did.  She's sorry she got caught, and if you didn't catch her (basically) in the act it would've kept on going.\n\nThe foreseeable is going to be tough for you, make sure you surround yourself in people who care deeply for you.  Make the effort to reach out to your support groups - whether that's your family and friends or a sports team you play on - and let them know that you're going through a tough time in your life.  People can be assholes, but they can also be the best thing to ever happen to you.",

I didn't want to give him the chance to try to blame me or to make excuses. That's one thing I hate about cheaters-they try to act innocent and try to blame everyone else. To  this day I doubt he really knows why I \"disappeared\" (and never contacted him again). \nI moved on. I didn't think I could at first. But a year or so later I met someone and fell in love. We've been together over 15 years and are very happy. I know it's hard to trust again, but we need to learn not to sabotage future relationships with distrust due to our pasts. ",

If I were you I would want to tell her face to face that it's over. Don't let her give you excuses and endless apologies. Get your shit and leave things so you don't have to go back.

Stay with your friends/family until she leaves, do everything by the book. If you're both on the lease just make sure to handle things with your landlord. This is important.

Allow yourself to feel sad, angry, betrayed, etc, but don't burn bridges. You'll always end up wondering why it happened.\n\nInfidelity, by definition is a betrayal of trust, and this is the worst of what has happened to you.

            "I'm grieved to hear your situation, OP.  I was in a relationship with a girl for five years that ended with her cheating on me. I know exactly what you're going through--the pain, the utter disgust, the self contempt...\n\nI found out about it shortly after she dumped me (on her birthday, after I invited her friends and family over for a surprise party).  I have been living with it for seven years. \n\nLet me be clear: IT GETS EASIER!  It takes time. Unfortunately, lots and lots of time.  I went through therapy, depression, anxiety attacks...I couldn't sleep for two weeks straight, and when I did, I'd wake up in the middle of the night crying.\n\nI feel I was a bit fortunate at the time.  Before the breakup, we had just adopted a rescue dog.  She was barely a year old at the time.  Thankfully I kept her after the breakup (we had been living together for two years...moved back in with her parents after the break up).  My dog became my best friend. We were buddies. I fondly remember many moments during my subsequent bachelor years where I'd be chilling at home, watching TV, with my dog laying her giant head on my lap, hanging out with me all day.  She helped greatly with my recovery.\n\nI remember thinking that I'd never meet anyone else like her. That she was one in a million, and I was lucky to have her as long as I did.  As it turns out, considering there are over six billion people on the planet, one in a million is not a bad odd.  After a few months, I was back on the dating wagon again. I wasn't looking for anything serious.  I met two very important women since then.  One of them became my best friend, and the other became my wife.\n\nHere I am, seven years later, married to an amazing woman, am a step father to an amazing kid, and am expecting a little girl this July.  My wife is leagues above and beyond my ex.  She helped me through the years cope with my pain, and showed me just how awfully she treated me, when for years I thought that I was an awful boyfriend.\n\nIt gets better. I promise. You will heal in your own way.  My dog, my wife, and my best friend were the ones that helped me through mine.  In the mean time, don't be afraid to ask others you trust for help. Seek therapy if you suspect you need it.  If your situation can handle it, consider adopting a pet. The unconditional, non-parental love you receive from a pet is amazingly therapeutic.  Don't spend too much time grieving or dwelling in what she did.  You didn't drive her to cheat. She did that on her own. If you ever talk to her again, don't accept anything but an earnest apology.  Don't let her try to convince you that she had the slightest of merit in doing what she did.  Cheating is one of the most deplorable things anyone can do.  There is no excuse for it.  If she tries to convince you that it was your fault, just end the conversation. She is wrong and is poisoning your mind.\n\nGood luck to you.",
            ">Now I just feel empty. Like, somewhere between my belly button and my ribs is a space that used to be occupied and now is vacant.\n\nIt may be entirely tangential, but I heard about some research that discovered that there were some feelings and neurological stuff going in a part in the upper stomach, and that's why feelings of hurt could be felt there, and that they were actual pain (pain receptors in the brain were being fired)\n\nSo yeah, what you feel is real.",

Loyalty is huge, and it is VERY hard to recover from something like this.   It has always been hard for me not to follow the instinct to follow the heart into tragic drama, that spirals into more depression and sadness. Before you commit to any decision regarding your future dealings with her, try to consider the outcome of it.  Don't meet and talk to her, if you have no desire to reconcile. Don't start texting, emailing, etc, and let her pull you back in if you have no desire to reconcile.  Don't involve mutual friends, her relatives, etc, if you have no desire to reconcile.

I can never recover trust with them after, so it's always the end for me. Frankly, they're some of the lowest of the low. Whether it's lack of self esteem or just pure selfish desire, it is one of the most devastating and disgusting things people can do. I lose all respect for them, and move on. As others have said, they're usually only upset because they realise how horrible they are when the consequences and emotions become real. Although I have been with people who have just laughed it off and been a dick about it after. \n\nYou're better, you deserve better. Key: don't stop trusting other girls because of this one, they don't deserve to be cast in that same shadow. Give them a chance to prove your trust right, or break it. Don't let a few scumbags ruin future relationships. \n\nTake care man, stay strong. ",

A little far fetched if you ask me. \n\nBut if it is true, good luck. And the revenge thing of putting one of the pictures on her computer? Not needed. She knew they were there. A letter or note would have been more than enough. I would have written that you found the pictures and it was over. Then I would have deleted them. ",

It's been a while, but I remembered this post by chance yesterday and decided to follow up.\n\nA lot of people in the original post said that he would likely lose interest within the next couple months. Well, here we are 7 months later, and he's still playing. The thing is, he got my mom to start playing with him! I pretty much never play now, but they have a great time playing together. My mother started in December, but she's already passed me in level and I think she has more Pokemon registered in her pokedex than my dad. I also haven't heard her complain about her foot pain in a while, so I don't think that should be an issue now. He has also stopped asking me so many questions and wanting that to be our only conversation topic, but that's probably also because he is now as experienced in the game as I am, if not more.\n\nOver the weekend, we all went out for dinner, and were walking around the outside mall while waiting for our table to be ready. My mom whispered a little \"Omg!\" and showed us that there was a Tyranitar right across the street. For those who don't know, it's an extremely rare pokemon, and I think the most powerful one in the game right now, barring a legendary. We were all able to catch it :)\nThat's really all there is to say, and I think I was just worried that it would devolve into something addictive and unhealthy. But I see now that it's a fun little activity for the both of them, and I am glad we are all able to bond through it.\n\ntl;dr: Dad still plays PoGo, got my Mom to play too.

Chronic musculoskeletal pain is such a pain in the ass (figuratively, but sometimes literally), because our instinct is to rest and reduce the pain. That's great for acute injuries when repair is needed, but it's usually the opposite for chronic pain with old injuries. With me, it wasn't my foot, but my back. The more I rested it, the worse it got. It only got better when I finally got my ass into PT and started being more active again. I like to call it \"going on offense\", like if my back starts feeling funny, I'm like \"Well, Mr. Back, that pain isn't going to stop me from getting my stretches and exercises in, you stand aside now.\" and I always feel better the next day. I used to have multi day bouts of crazy back pain, but haven't had them in 7+ years now.

Against my better judgement, I decided to give him another chance. \n\nAnyway, I'll get to the incident which was the straw which broke the camel's back. \n\nLast Sunday, I enquired whether we could spend the coming Friday night together so we could get an early start to the weekend. He replied that he would let me know how his schedule worked with that.\n\nThe following day (Monday), I received a dinner invite for Friday from a bunch of good friends. Since X hadn't confirmed with me on his schedule yet, I assumed things were still up in the air with him so I accepted the invitation. \n\nI informed X that I would be doing dinner with my friends, so I would be meeting him a couple of hours later than I had initially suggested. He FLIPPED OUT on me. \n\nHe yelled and screamed at me on the phone, cursing me out and demanding to know who was so fucking important I was going to meet. He asked me if a frivolous dinner with mere friends meant more to me than spending time with my SO. \n\nI responded that of course I valued my SO's, however there were other people I also liked to have in my life. He told me I could go and date those people then.\n\nHe went on at how I was incredibly disrespectful towards his time and that I was jerking him around. I told him that I didn't see how that counted as being disrespectful of his time since it was only Monday and the invite was for Friday - I was keeping him updated of the dinner way in advance so that he could plan his time for those couple of hours ; it wasn't as though I was pushing plans back at the very last minute or even cancelling on him. \n\nI told him that in my perspective, since he had yet to get back to me on his schedule I had the impression that we weren't confirmed hence accepted the invite.  I also told him that from my point of view, when I make plans with someone for the whole weekend and they push things back a couple of hours (for whatever reason) it wouldn't be a big deal to me so I didn't see why he was being so drastic. \n\nHe then said to enjoy myself with my friends and that he hoped the dinner would be worth the cost of our relationship. I responded 'ok'. \n\nThere's still some stuff that both of us have at each other's places though so we're meeting up later this week to return things. \n\nTl;dr - he made things easy by breaking up with me.\n\n",

He also behaved like a fucking child (too pwecious to apply his own sunscreen) and an all-around terrible partner.\n\nI\u2019m almost certain he will try to get back with you, and sooner rather than later.

            "I dont think the problem is in who was right or wrong about how to arrange dates. That is not the real problem here.\n\nWhat is so completely unacceptable, is his extreme, abusive reaction (yelling and screaming). How are you supposed to have a respectful and growing relationship with someone who reacts like that? He really has anger and insecurity issues, and he is incapable of dealing with these issues by himself without attacking others. That is terror for any partner. \n\nAnd I say this while I myself have reacted like him often enough in the past (I am working hard on it in therapy). I think I know pretty well what is going on inside of him. But yeah, dont accept that - abusers do not heal (learn to not be abusers, and heal the wounds of their own past abuse) by their victims letting them get away with their actions. I would say, it is ok for him to feel hurt in this situation maybe, but to attack you like this for it is just a simple NO. \n\nI hope this teaches you to trust your guts better in the future. And for any heartbreak that might be lingering ... keep reminding yourself that there simply was no way you could have been with him without suffering his abuse. He obviously needs therapy - longterm therapy - this is completely out of your control.",

Yeah you guys are broken up now, but even then, *you* didn't break up with him. Instead, you called his bluff, and I'm worried that when he comes back with something like, \"I was joking,\" you're going to be passive once again and accept this jerk back into your life.\n\nLook. The issue here isn't miscommunication and mismatched ideas of how you guys should plan around your social lives together. The problem is that you are an independent woman and *he wants someone he can control.* \n\nGo reread your previous post and this one. Every instance he got mad is an example of when you were asserting your independence or not bending to his desires. If you stay with this guy, one of two things will happen: You will either begin gradually bending to his every whim in order to avoid confrontation until you loose sight of who you are and your personal values, or you will continue to butt heads with him until his temper escalates and he begins physically abusing you. \n\nSo please, do not get back together. \n\n> both of us have at each other's places though so we're meeting up later this week to return things.\n\nDo you have to meet up?

And next time you have similar red flags (while I hope there isn't one) trust your gut enough to listen to them and ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuun.",
            "I agree with the vast majority of comments here. To me, this comes down to maturity. He's too mentally and emotionally immature to be able to have a healthy relationship at this point in his life. A mature person would be able to at the very least say \"Hey I'm upset that you made plans because I wanted to see you\" without flying off the handle and over-reacting. In addition, a mature person will understand and encourage you to have friends and spend time with them. This is a very small, insignificant situation - if he's blowing up now, what happens when there's a real issue? Take this as a blessing that he's showing true colors early on. ",
            "I dated someone 7 years older for 3 years and trust me, it never gets better. That convo was almost like every convo we had about plans. Not sure if it was because he was older (read: controlling) or because he didn't trust me because I was younger... but he always wanted to do whatever he pleased with zero respect for my plans. He would play golf and go out every other day and if I ever voiced disagreement it would blow up and he would shut me down. But if I dared makes plans on my own with friends it would be accusations of cheating instantly, then once he understood that it wasn't cheating, he would then belittle my plans as being lame. You're dodging a bullet. ",
            "fuck that guy.  You deserve better.",
            "You know, it's sad to think that this guy might actually have friends out there who he's probably going to rant about this to and somehow paint OP in a bad light. Glad OP's getting the heck out of dodge.",
            "Attempting to control your personal life and trying to guilt you out of maintaining valuable friendships... Emotionally abusive. Get out!",
            "He sounds like he has Borderline Personality Disorder. My fiancee does and although I love him it is exhausting and really hard to deal with. You are likely better off not get attached to someone who is like this in the first place.",
            "Yeah, the dude's a fuckwit. I pity the poor person he ends up with.",
            "Yeah you made the right decision in the end. He will try to get back with you though since it's all part of his little abuse grooming. Grab your shit from his place and tell him to fuck off. If he pulls one of his little kid temper tantrums with you while exchanging personal belongings then just be honest and say he acts like a little child having a tantrum and then gtfo. Men like him aren't used to women turning it around on them.",
            "Wow that guy is a huge asshole, if that stuff at your places isn't significant just say bye to all of it.",
            "i can\u2019t believe how much that situation reflected one of the first fights my ex and I had. thinking back, i always regret not seeing that as a red flag, but i\u2019m glad that it made things easier for you because you deserve someone so much better that doesn\u2019t react like that to you. ",
            "Abort mission. He\u2019s sounds like a controlling pric& ",
            "R E D   F L A G S \n\nget out while you still can. before he starts barricading the doors at night so you can't escape.\nsource: experience",
            "Hi OP I couldn't write on your first post. Honestly I have experienced this kind of situation with my ex except he didn't have much money at all and had a really bad upbringing. Anyway it still brought back memories reading this story, this is definitely the start of emotional abuse. Your bf/x sounds extremely controlling, manipulative, spoilt, possessive and abusive. It will only get worse as time goes on. I don't mean to sound blunt but it's true, he will suck the life out of you if you go back to him. I'm so sorry you are going through this and I do hope you can find someone who will treat you the way you deserve to be treated, it's a horrible situation to be in. One good thing about having been in an abusive relationship, it makes you more observant of these kind of red flags. I wanted to break up with my ex about 6 months or so before I actually did. I was so scared as he would completely flip out (as he did everyday). I was with him for 2 years, I went completely off the rails after I broke up with him. I hope you are okay \ud83d\udc8c\ud83d\udc8c",
            "After reading both of your posts I think you swapped the numbers in his age on the post title",
            "Crud. A lot of the things you posted remind me of my relationship with my ex. It's better that you guys ended it. It was on its way to becoming a full-blown abusive relationship. ",
            "Why oh whhhy didn't you break up earlier with this narcissistic, abusive human? His ego will inflate and he will go on to treat another woman this way. ",
            "It's always nice when people make breaking up with them super easy and obvious.\n\nI mean, obviously it'd be better if they weren't jerks, but if they are, at least it's nice of them to make it so crystal clear.",
            "You dodged a bullet there sister.",
            "wow, this guy is such a loser! You're better off",
            "Sounds like he's 14 years old",
            "Wtf! I got to incident three on your previous post just now and stopped reading. You were only together for three months and you had to deal with ALL that!!!??? Good riddance... he acts like a crazy person. This is not normal! Maybe you are both from a different culture where it is normal? But to me he was acting like a 12 year old girl! Maybe it would be different if you were together for 10 years and some big major life change just happened to you both... but you barely knew each other and he was acting so controlling and horrible! You should be happy to be out of such a toxic relationship. What would happen if you had a serious disagreement (not over going to the gym or an expensive toy)? How would he cope with that? Who knows how much more abusive he would get"
