            "Good for you. GOOD FOR YOU. This is great news!\n\nMy ex was a medic in the marines and touted his bedside manor from time to time. But the two times I saw it up close and personal, I doubted everything he ever told me (or realized he was totally delusional). \n\nOnce, I had terrible cramps and couldn't walk to the corner store to get Advil. When I pleaded for a hot water bottle or pills, he finally lobbed a bottle of aspirin at me then turned around and left the room without even bringing me water (any medic will know that aspirin is the wrong tool for that job). The second time I slipped on ice and cut my knee. I sat on the side of the tub while he cleaned my wound and put a bandage over it, admonishing me for how it happened, then slapped my hurt knee \"to get the band-aid to stick\". We broke up not too long after. He was a bad person, and those were the ways it came out, among others.\n\nIf you get a pit in your stomach thinking about how your mate will behave when the worst parts of life come up like cancer, job loss, tragedy, etc, move on.

My throat was covered with cold sores - I couldn\u2019t eat or drink and I was sick like this for two weeks. All I had was ice. \n\nWhile I was effectively dying, my friend with benefits made me come to his house. He put me up in his room and nursed me.

When we met 7 years ago I had very limited sexual experience. He had plenty. Right from the beginning, he was very take-it-or-leave it towards sex. I asked him several times if he was attracted to me. He always said yes, but that he just was on medication that dampened desire / exhausted from work. We had very little sex and I was insecure and never initiated. I figured he'd had SO much experience that if he wanted sex he'd initiate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were like best friends who had sex sometimes (like maybe every 6 weeks). This was not enough for me but I accepted it because I loved him so much and I was too shy to have a really frank discussion. Nor did I want to make him feel bad. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc). He really grew to rely on me because he suffers from ADHD and depression and often needed my support in many ways (which I was happy to give).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were many hiccups. I caught him texting other women a few times. He watched porn a lot. I figured he was intimacy avoidant or something. But I truly loved him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got married. Once we had a huge fight and during it our lack of sex came up. He was always suggesting it was my fault but I didn't think it was. He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top. I always feel awkward on top and it doesn't feel good and he never told me he liked it so I didn't think it mattered. I brought up the fact that he always wanted oral but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once). We were fighting and it was escalating and he told me \"*if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually*\". I was hurt and shocked but he later told me he didn't mean that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe've had several more fights over the years and once he told me he loved me deeply but wasn't attracted to me. He took that back too and said he didn't mean it. But our sex life never improved at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently he got angry at me and called me fat. Later I asked him why he called me that and he said he was sorry for being rude, but that I have to admit that I'm fat. I am overweight (BMI of 27) but so is he. I honestly didn't think he viewed me as \"fat\". We talked a lot and he said he loved me very much and I was perfect for him because he fell in love with me, but that no, my body type is not his type at all. He has always preferred petite athletic women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt just all hit me. Our sex life has always sucked not because of medication or depression, but because he never was very attracted to me at all. He was with me because I provided companionship and love and support and he grew to rely on me and love me. But he's never felt any passion towards me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe says it doesn't really matter because he truly loves me and he's willing to work on having a better sex life with me. He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just hurt and freaked out because I've been living this lie thinking we both felt the same way about each other when we clearly do not. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does \"lust\" matter? Does it matter if I'm not his physical ideal? Can we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love and committed to each other even if he apparently doesn't have any real sexual feelings towards me? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so confused and I'd hate to make a mistake and get divorced from someone I really love just because he doesn't find me hot. Can anyone help me view this more clearly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntldr: husband has never been \"into\" me and I'm unsure if I should continue the marriage.",

            "So I\u2019m asexual, meaning I\u2019m not into *anyone* sexually. I\u2019ve dated people who weren\u2019t asexual, and so there was a sexual incompatibility. These can be solved with patience and communication (or at the very least, a amicable breakup if the issue\u2019s insurmountable).\n\nYou have a very different problem, though. Your husband *doesn\u2019t respect you*. He belittles you. It sounds like he *literally* cheats on you. You\u2019re afraid to communicate with him (likely because of the issues above). The foundation of the relationship is broken, so there\u2019s no way you can try to work out the compatibility.\n\nI\u2019m not a saint or something, but I literally *hate* looking at genitalia. Hate it. But I would *never* call a partner disgusting, *because I care about them*. Some of my partners have been bigger people, but I wouldn\u2019t call them fat, because again, *I love them*. It\u2019s a basic form of respect. I think you need to do some soul searching around if you want to stay in this relationship, because it\u2019s not good.",
            "\u201cCan we still have a happy marriage if we are both in love\u201d\n\nGirl...he said you disgust him and called you a fat prude\n\n\u201cAnd committed to each other\u201d\n\n...He cheated on you...multiple times...\n\n\u201cJust because he doesn\u2019t find you hot\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t find you worthy, respectable, or loveable either. You disgust him, in fact!\n\nSex is a very important part of marriage. He refuses to work on it, leaving you feeling frustrated, unloved and terrible. Do you want to spend the rest of your life feeling terrible about yourself while he sexts other women and jacks off to porn?",
            "People can be happy in a relationship without lust if there is genuine affection, respect, friendship and care between them and if sex is not a huge deal to either party. You and your husband seem to argue quite a bit, he has insulted you multiple times and that is disrespectful towards you and the relationship.\n\nI don't think you should continue in this marriage. His behavior is cruel.",
            ">but never once had returned the favour (still hasn't...not once).\n\nOh hun. \n\nI just don't see the point of staying in this relationship. Your partner doesn't respect you, and I want to say he doesn't love you but I don't know if you'll believe me. \n\nHe has cheated. The texts to other women. I suspect it's gone further but still, that's enough.\n\nI was in a passionless marriage. The issues where slightly different from yours but I still see myself in you. I'm better divorced. I had a very sexually filling relationship after my marriage ended. I experienced what it was to be desired and to desire. I'm single now and it does really suck to a certain extent but I'm very happy to not be married to man that did not respect me. You deserve better.",
            "But he\u2019s fat too? Maybe you prefer lean athletic men! What a fucking idiot.",
            "Oh my god please leave him. He purposefully says things that hurt you when he\u2019s upset. He\u2019s insulted you in a plethora of ways. \n\nThis is weird, but you should watch Shrill on Hulu. It\u2019s about a fat girl learning to love and stand up for herself. You might not be fat but it will put things into perspective. There is someone out there who will love ALL of you and will want you as much as you want them. Don\u2019t settle for a subpar, sexless marriage. Don\u2019t settle for anything less than someone who will enthusiastically dive headfirst into your clamburger.",
            "Ok. So I was my ex husband's \"type\" but then I guess I got too old or too regular human without an eating disorder anymore sized. And he almost immediately started cheating. And he blamed it all on me. I did EVERYTHING for him. Everything. And there ain't no one who could EVER call me a prude \ud83d\ude06. I took care of him in the self sacrificing loving way it seems you care for your husband. He still completely abandoned me in every way for another woman (\"woman\" may be a stretch since she was barely more than legal) \n\nMy point here is: you can't keep taking someone's crap and giving back love believing they will one day see how much you do and appreciate you. They won't. They just get worse. They just find someone to fulfill what they CHOOSE not to get from you, and keep taking more and more. Get couple's therapy at the very least. But also start building up your \"get out\" fund. When I found proof of his 2 year affair (in a 3 year marriage) I was SO UNBELIEVABLY GRATEFUL I had saved GTFO money",
            "You're not sexually compatible and that's why this will never ever work. He also can't really love you or care about you all that much since he's been treating you like crap, not satisfying you and texting other women aka cheating.\n\nWhy's he gonna change now?? He lied to you from day one and most likely got with you bc you're a safety net. He's so selfish he's never even put the effort in pleasuring you. He's been caught cheating. He just doesn't care and that's not love.",
            "Oh, he has got to go. You deserve to feel better in your own relationship. Please, for the love of god, do yourself a favor and lay this shit out for him. Call a lawyer, get your affairs in order. People are DYING, don\u2019t waste the life you have with this idiot.",
            "He loves the life you give him and he loves your companionship, but he\u2019s selfish and doesn\u2019t really love you. He\u2019s not been honest with you and has not shown you consideration and respect. He\u2019s said horrifyingly cruel things to you, repeateduly. He\u2019s not interested in your needs if they don\u2019t match what he wants. He\u2018s not loving you back the way you love him. Don\u2019t confuse him being desperate to hold onto you because you give him a great life and endless, thoughtful support, with him actually committing to be a loving partner to you, one who makes you feel treasured.",
            "It really depends on you. Can you see yourself feeling this way for the rest of your life? You won\u2019t lose your desires to feel wanted and attractive to your partner. \n\nMy ex and I were together for 8+ years, and I lost my attraction to him. Not because I wasn\u2019t ever attracted to him, but for other reasons like he wasn\u2019t taking care of himself and didn\u2019t make much of an effort in the relationship. \n\nTbh, breaking up with him was one of the hardest things I had to do, but I knew it was for the best. I couldn\u2019t see myself marrying him and feeling the same way for the rest of my life. \n\nMy current bf and I are very attracted to each other and have a great sex life. I\u2019m 10x happier than I was. \n\nI do think it\u2019s possible for a relationship to get better through communication and effort, but that requires both people to do it. I would recommend that you guys go to couples counseling and also meet with a sex therapist. But if he chooses not to take any action to make things better for both of you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a good idea to stay. Good luck, OP.",
            "He\u2019s verbally insulted you for several years and can\u2019t have a mature conversation with you about sex? Hell nah.\n\nOP, this isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. This is not something that you can change, either. You both need to go to individual therapy: he needs to go so he learns how to not be an abusive asshole, and you need to go to learn what healthy boundaries are.\n\nIf you have somewhere else to go, I would recommend leaving. You deserve to be happy.",
            "Yes, you\u2019ll get old and generally sex may be less important due to age and/or infirmity.  But that\u2019s for WHEN you\u2019re old, decades from now.  You\u2019re 36 & I don\u2019t give a flying F if your BMI is 27, it doesn\u2019t disqualify you from living a full and happy life. \n\nIs sex important? In the sense that it\u2019s the only thing that binds you, no it isn\u2019t.  But in the sense that intimacy and sexual contact bridges the things that words can\u2019t, that companionship can\u2019t, that regular activities can\u2019t - YES IT\u2019S IMPORTANT.  \n\nAnd just to be clear that this is not a \u201che\u2019s a crap husband\u201d post, people of all shapes, sizes and orientation are sexual. You as an individual are sexual with or without him.  Just because you\u2019re inexperienced before doesn\u2019t mean your sexual preferences and instinct is tied solely to him - so that end, I would suggest you explore yourself sexually.  Not cheating, but just knowing what you need and want.  And if you already do know that, then I guess my next question is are you ok giving up your prime sexual years to someone who\u2019s expressed disgust ?  This isn\u2019t even a situation where he does want to have sex and is either physically or mentally prevented by some illness.  Granted ADHD can make sexual cycles unpredictable but it does not abscond him of the responsibility to take care of his wife.  Porn does act like rot to an already sensitive sexual appetite, cheating is worst.  And I would consider texting as cheating. \n\nPassion isn\u2019t something that can be sustained at the same level as when it started, but to have experienced it to begin with and to see it burst occasionally is part of what makes all the shitty things about dealing with a partner worth it, it\u2019s this knowledge that you do it for each other and that you want/ accept each other on a cellular level. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t find you hot, has he articulated if this is a situation where that hotness can be created ? If it\u2019s clear to you that it can\u2019t be, then staying means you\u2019ll live with someone who sees you as furniture.  \n\nThat when it comes time for your needs and your desires, he won\u2019t be capable of fulfilling them because it sounds like this has been you powering this relationship for the most part.\n\nSo please consider this: when you\u2019re old and looking back at your life, are you ok saying to yourself I don\u2019t mind having missed that, it was my choice ? Or not?",
            "Someone who truly loves you won't angrily call you fat or say they are disgusted by you sexually.\n\nYou two got comfortable in this relationship where you do all the emotional work, where you love and support him and he only takes.\n\nI know we all fear the unknown, but there's something better for you out there. Don't settle for someone who doesn't feel the same for you.",
            "You remind me so much of myself. You know what you want\u2014you even deluded yourself into believing you had it in your relationship\u2014but you\u2019re asking for validation for your wants. Do you also live in a world where you\u2019re always having to decide what\u2019s acceptable to feel or think? Do you accept something you don\u2019t truly want because others tell you that\u2019s how it should be? \n\nYou *want* to be sexually and physically desired as you desire your husband. You want your husband to see you as 100% his type as he is yours. Please don\u2019t ask for society (the small sample of it here in this subreddit) to tell you to compromise on your wants to settle for a relationship that makes you feel small...maybe I\u2019m projecting but I can\u2019t help but think you\u2019re submitting yourself to your ball-and-chain of a husband. I\u2019m sorry for characterizing your husband so harshly but I really hope you come to realize and clearly see that he is *using* you as a barely acceptable stand-in. He\u2019s lonely and extremely insecure. It doesn\u2019t sound like he loves himself at all. What\u2019s that about everyone will become ugly anyway when they get old?? That\u2019s the mindset of someone who\u2019s *afraid* of being alone so they attach themselves to any living female body that\u2019s willing rather than getting into a relationship because it\u2019s with someone they love, regard as beautiful and with whom they would walk to the ends\nof the earth.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t be afraid of trekking on with the hope that one day you will meet the man who sees you as the most beautiful woman in the whole wide world. Time was not wasted. You learned some things about yourself and life with your current husband. But, he doesn\u2019t deserve you because he just doesn\u2019t see how beautiful you are. If life\u2019s a journey, your time with your current husband is just one stop of many. If there\u2019s a chance that the man who sees you as 100% his type is up at the next few stops on your journey, why would you not continue on your journey to meet him? \n\nThe sexual and physical part of a romantic relationship pervades all other facets of the relationship. It\u2019s super important. Sexual satisfaction sets the tone for how you two get along in other areas of life. Those who say otherwise must not enjoy sex or romance.",
            "It sounds like there are issues that go further than him not being \"into you\" sexually. He insults you and belittles you and has also been caught texting other women? I'm sorry to be so blunt, but it doesn't sound like he's planning on staying loyal to you in the long run regardless..\n\nThrow the whole man away. No partner should be insulting you or making you feel inferior.",
            "There must be an agreement (with therapy if necessary) to help him understand his angry lashings are no longer acceptable.\n\nHe says he loves you, however he also believes he can insult you for his own, what? Anger release? Because he feels superior? Because he\u2019s insecure? Because he\u2019s hoping to get you to admit you are ok being his second choice?\n\nThere needs to be a heavy conversation, and reality needs to be brought to your house.\n\nYour relationship may be saved, however this road may be rocky as he may not be open to full honesty. There probably needs to be several big conversations with consequences if he can\u2019t or will not behave like a true partner in all aspects of your relationship, (sexually, financially, emotionally and in all aspects of a healthy relationship). \n\nGood luck.",

            "This is up to what you will accept from someone who really loves you. He has insulted you many times, has refused before now to try and work on your sex life, and refuses to work with you on making sure you are pleasured as much as he is during sex. If he doesn\u2019t find you sexually attractive now, it won\u2019t change, and you need to ask yourself if you\u2019re really okay being someone who doesn\u2019t find you attractive and who you will mostly likely be a glorified roommate for. \n\nIn my opinion you deserve to be with someone who loves all of you and finds you attractive no matter what. My husband and I have been together for 15 years. We have had some issues in the bedroom (because of different issues) but despite me gaining a fair amount of weight, he still finds me attractive. He tells me that all the time. I don\u2019t think I could be with someone who wasn\u2019t physically attracted to me. I\u2019m not his \u201cfantasy woman\u201d but he doesn\u2019t expect me to be. But if he ever insulted me in the ways your husband has, we would either be in marriage counseling or not together. There\u2019s no excuse for being so cruel during a fight. We\u2019ve had big fights but we\u2019ve never treated each other that way. You deserve so much more.",

He takes it all for granted because he knows its safe to not give a damn- your gaga over him and taught him you'll never leave. This man does not value you. This man does not give you what you truly need OR want, and instead he is sucking the youth from your bones as you waste years with him.  \n\nThere are people out there you can pour your hole heart into, and they'll do the same right back. There are people that will love you even if you put 20lbs (or more!) on RIGHT NOW. There are people that will go gaga over you, while offering you a sex life where you are comfortable. What I am saying is there are people out there that will value you as you deserve. However you need to start asking yourself some difficult questions; why do you feel the need to love someone into staying with you, how do you feel to see these efforts go unnoticed, how have you responded to people & taught them how to treat you, and lastly what traits do you actually want in a relationship.

But honestly, in this case, I think you really should leave.\n\n1. He has said some horrible things to you to HURT YOU. If he had a problem with his attraction to you, he should have said this earlier in a kinder way. If he didn't like your weight he should have supported you and encouraged you to get fit. If he didn't like going down on you, he should have gently said so, and worked with you to find other ways to meet your needs. The fact that he decided to bring this stuff up the way he did shows that he only wanted to said it to hurt you. It's ok to lose attraction to your partner and it's ok to bring it up, but you never - EVER - make them feel ugly or unattractive about it. That's horrible. ):\n2. You aren't happy in the relationship. You aren't having enough sex for your liking. And you know what? That's a PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE reason to leave. You have tried to bring this up with him multiple times and he shows no sign of changing. Don't trap yourself with someone who is sexually incompatible with you.\n3. He flirted with other women. You know this for a fact. That is unacceptable, and *so* disrespectful towards you. I know how much it hurts and I'm sorry. I also understand why you stayed. I've done that myself.

Not the way that you deserve.\n\nI'm really proud of you for building up the courage to face these flaws in your relationship and to put them into words. I know how fucking hard that is. Moving forward, it's probably a good idea to contact a counsellor or a therapist to help you work out your own emotions about the whole relationship. Counselling could help you to logically sort through your emotions and break down the blocking and 'blindness' to problems you've had throughout the relationship. It sucks, but it helps. If you are worried about making the 'wrong choice', counselling can help you work out the right one.\n\nI just want to talk about his mental health for a bit here too. I have severe depression. I attempted suicide earlier this month. So please take my word for it when I say I'm a little bit of an authority figure on mental health and I say **DROP HIM**. The way he treats you isn't ok. He doesn't get a free pass for not being a good partner to you just because he's tired from work or because his serotonin levels have plummeted. I've been that partner and I know how unfair it was on my boyfriend at the time and it's my biggest regret. Fuck that. Do not baby him. Do not continue to support him if it is a drain on your own mental health. It's ok to stay friends and it's ok to stay together if that's what you want, so of course it's ok to support him. But please, PLEASE do not put his wellbeing above your own. YOU deserve some TLC for once. That means putting your foot down and saying 'fuck you, don't talk to me like that' instead of letting things slide.",

            "I very very rarely comment on posts in this sub but I couldn\u2019t hold back on this one. I think there\u2019s something critical you\u2019re missing here. \n\nIt seems the main point of your post is that you completely head-over-heels adore your husband but he doesn\u2019t find you sexually attractive. \n\nWhat the content of your post *should* be is \u201cmy husband verbally abuses me\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m not one to claim abuse left and right like some folks here because I know that couples fight and occasionally *occasionally* you say something you don\u2019t mean but it should be something like \u201cyou suck at cleaning the house!\u201d\n\nYou never, ever, EVER say to a person you claim to love \u201cyou disgust me sexually.\u201d\n\nRead that again, you never, EVER tell the person you love that they fucking disgust you sexually. Even if that\u2019s how you felt inside - if that\u2019s how HE feels inside, he could have found a better way to explain it to you so you can figure it out. Something softer and it as hurtful like \u201cIt\u2019s hard because somewhere along the way I realized you didn\u2019t have a body type that I\u2019m typically attracted to\u201d and then figure out where to go from there.\n\nYou\u2019re really quick to excuse the awful things he says to you, and I think that\u2019s what you need to evaluate. You focused a lot on how much you adore him so I\u2019ll add this - I adore my wife the same way, I think she\u2019s sweet and gorgeous and smart and incredible but if she EVER screamed that I disgust her sexually during a fight about intimacy, I would be packing her bags before she was finished with her sentence. That part literally made me say \u201choly shit\u201d out loud and cringe my face up because it was so freaking awful.\n\nJust because you love someone doesn\u2019t mean you should be their doormat. Everything in your post can be distilled down to a couple main points: you are crazy about him, he doesn\u2019t feel the same about you, he doesn\u2019t like being confronted about it and verbally abuses you because you\u2019re shy and he knows it will deter you from bringing it up again, you completely forgive him - rinse and repeat. \n\nSeems like you\u2019re kind of excusing this, love. He\u2019s gonna keep doing it. I\u2019m also not one to say \u201che\u2019s cheating on you!\u201d At the drop of a hat like most of this sub, but i think you should prepare yourself to find that information out soon enough. It\u2019s hard to believe someone went from being very sexual and a lot of partners to having a wife they aren\u2019t attracted to and having begrudging sex with once every 6 weeks or so and isn\u2019t actually finding it elsewhere. That\u2019s a bit of a stretch.  \n\nGood luck on this one, I hope you figure it out because there are a lot of better guys out there that won\u2019t call you disgusting.",

            "Oh my god. All of this was horrible. I am so sorry. You deserve to be with someone who wants to rip your clothes off and makes you feel worthy. Marriage isn\u2019t all about sex but it sure is a good chunk of it.",

You are clearly bothered  and that's ok. There is this pervasive idea that women are not supposed to be sexual and its bullshit. If you want to be married to someone who thinks you're hot, you deserve that. You deserve to have frequent, hot sex with someone. And it's ok if you need to walk away from this relationship to find it. If he hadnt lied to you all those years, would you have married him?   My husband has always said \"love is not enough\" and he is 1000% correct.",
            "If his lack of attraction to you didn't actually matter to him, then he wouldn't be calling you fat and disgusting. He's an asshole, op. You can find someone who WILL be sexually attracted to you, and treat you with respect. Those men exist, and you deserve better.",

The only real reason you want to stay with him is because you believe you can't find someone you love as much as you love this guy who will also make you feel desirable and want to have sex with you often. You can definitely find that! You deserve to have everything you want in a partner. And you deserve a partner who won't say cruel insults to you like your husband does. \n\nI say, divorce this leech who is basically using you. Work on your self esteem in therapy since he's done a number on you. Focus on making yourself happy. Educate yourself on how to have standards in dating, there are lots of good resources to help women get everything they want in a relationship eg. Matthew Hussey's books.",

            "I havent read this in the comments, so my stance:\n\nHe does not love you for you. You said it, but maybe this will help you see it better. He settled for you. He loves being loved by you. He loves that you care for him and that you always support him. He loves what you do for him. If you stopped, he wouldnt stay, because there is nothing more there for him.\n\nHe loves to have somebody and that somebody is you, but it really could be anyone who would be there. \n\nThis is NOT sexual incompatibility. He does his own thing but doesnt wanna do you, because he feels no desire, even less than that, sometimes he feels disgust. He apologizes because he needs someone like you in his life, but that is all there is to it. Someone like you. Not particularly you. And I bet you had great times, but you can have great times with friends. You maybe also had very intimate moments. But that is the exception and it shouldnt be.\n\nMy advice is leave him. There is someone out there who will love you so so much, if you give them the chance. If you settle for him like he did for you, you will not be truly happy and probably wondering what you missed out on. He may be your love, but you are not his and that will forever hurt you if you stay.",
            "This is going to be very hard to hear, but you need to accept that you love him, but he does not love you. I\u2019m not even sure from your story that he likes you.\n\nNot having your love and attraction returned is devastating I know. But you don\u2019t deserve to lavish your time, devotion and love on a person who clearly does not want it or appreciate it. You need to separate from your husband. If necessary, go and get some counseling because there is something inside of you making you believe that you deserve to be treated this way.\n\nAlso? You can heap all of the love on him in the world and it won\u2019t make him love you. Losing weight won\u2019t either. You\u2019re going to try and bargain with yourself and him to make this work if you don\u2019t accept the facts as he\u2019s explained them. You sound like a really lovely person who would make a great partner for someone who treats you the way you deserve. You\u2019re still very young.  I don\u2019t want you to turn around at 50 and realize how much time you wasted. You deserve better. Good luck!",

I also think it\u2019s been so long that the thought of being single is inconceivable, and on top of that he has really reinforced in you the belief that you aren\u2019t attractive. Then putting your age into the equation, I get how you\u2019d feel it\u2019s better to just settle. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to make hard decisions. \n\nI couldn\u2019t live with knowing my person didn\u2019t find me attractive. I would become wildly jealous and insecure. I\u2019d check their phone, and my heart would crush a million times over with everything I\u2019d find. I\u2019d compare, and I\u2019d hate myself. He\u2019s the one doing all the things that hurt me, but for some reason I\u2019d only hate myself. Keeping that bottled eventually would turn into a pure rage that lives in me and spurts out at everyone, including him. Until I\u2019m nothing, and then he wouldn\u2019t even like (what\u2019s left of) my personality anymore. So I\u2019d become desperate, begging for his love bc WE LOVE EACH OTHER, and no one else will ever love me. Just look at me. Then comes the resentment on both sides. Probably more micro-cheating, more fights, more desperation. And all the while I\u2019d be thinking \u201cIs this worth it? Is this love? I mean, when it\u2019s good it\u2019s SO good, and besides these *little* things I really think we were meant for each other\u201d \n\nI couldn\u2019t do it. \nBut idk friend, that\u2019s just me.",

I\u2019ve had a lot of sexual partners but once I found my husband I knew we would last because he is such a sexual person who enjoys getting me off. You\u2019re just inexperienced. Your weight has nothing to do with it, find a man who looks at you with fire in his eyes. Life is too short to stay with people like your husband.",

I bet if you do a little investigating you will find times that he's not where he says he is. Those overtime hours don't add up and stuff like that. My ex was a cheater.

So, in your case, it\u2019s a big problem because he\u2019s expressed that he\u2019s not attracted, and has treated you like he isn\u2019t.

What are you getting? Abuse and maybe scraps of attention every now and again. \n\nThis is not a happy marriage. If you think this is love then I\u2019m sorry you have a really really warped sense of love and have no idea what a healthy loving relationship looks like. And I hate to tell you but eventually something \u2018better\u2019 (to him) will come along and he\u2019ll leave without a second thought which will absolutely destroy you because you are so invested in him when he is not invested in you as a person or you as a couple. \n\nFWIW - you should have no doubt here, this marriage should not continue.

Why does anyone have to confirm if something matters or not, where is your opinion, the only one that matters when you make your own life choices?  \n\n\nI congratulate you for your awakening. Next step: start interogating yourself what you truly want. And then open your eyes and see if this guy is it. With his insults and his contempt, I hope this is not what you want. And then start making your life changes for yourself. Nobody else will. You are not a victim, you have the power to stop or change this marriage, but it is time you start not accepting less than what you want, with the risk of \"losing\" the husband (read: getting rid of the negative element and actually winning).",
            "I was in a very similar relationship up until a year ago. I always felt insecure, but never supported to lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle - it was just pressure all the time.

Just friends. \n\nHe had cheated on my throughout our 6 year relationship without me ever knowing and finally decided to come clean about it when we were settling down and planning on getting married.\n\nI have to say this break up was the best thing that ever happened to me. I am now in a relationship full of love, passion, and affection. It feels SO good. I was honestly convinced that love meant being best friends but it\u2019s SO much more than that.

My husband and I have been married six years today, and we have never been happier. He is not my physical ideal, and I am also on an SSRI for PPD that makes my libido almost nonexistent.\n\nBut here's the thing that we have that you don't have: open communication and respect. My husband knew I loved his personality way more than his body when we were dating, that sex for me was more about intimacy than physical release. We have had ups and downs in our sex life, often related to how much childcare I have to do daily and what medication I'm on. But I've always made it clear that I enjoy being with him because I like to make him happy, and we're both open about our needs and expectations. \n\nYour husband says cruel things to you whenever he's angry. He treats you as less than. His needs are more important than yours. I'm sure oral isn't the only thing he doesn't reciprocate. \n\nEdit: Upon rereading, its clear that this guy is a manipulative ass. I don't know if he can change but he doesn't deserve you, and you should find someone who actually cares about you..

He did all the things your guy is doing.  \n\nIt was over 7 years ago but I hear his words in my head every day, and never recovered the joy and freedom I felt in love and intimacy where I felt ok to be naked in front of a partner. \n\nThe sad thing is - I look back on pictures of myself back then (I thought i was like a freak, monstrously hideous) - but I honestly was very beautiful - it was all a manipulation.  He stole those years from me. He\u2019s stealing them even now. \n\nWhile it\u2019s totally ok and a thing that happens to become unattracted to your partner and to have partnerships that aren\u2019t sex focused, fetishes, being attracted to something you\u2019re not, etc etc - \n\nIt\u2019s not normal the way he\u2019s saying you sexually disgust him and the dishonest way he\u2019s acting... he\u2019s not being kind to you.

It would be so fucking oppressive and traumatic. \n\nI bet in years later you\u2019ll look back and say - wow, he stole the best years from me and made me hate myself.  \nYou should be loved and cherished.",

Its okay to have bad sex, what is important is that you have fun trying.\n\n>. I also was always there for him in every way (emotionally, practically, etc).

Porn can be a part of a healthy relationship as long as neither gets addicted, this is something you have to decide if you want him to get help.\n\n>He'd call me a prude but I honestly couldn't understand what he was talking about. He cited the fact that I never got on top.\n\nThis is probably something you want to listen to, he is describing what he wants, but not in the correct way. It also ties in with your lack of self esteem.\n\n>\"if you want to know why I've never given you oral it's because you disgust me sexually\".\n\nThis is the biggest red flag a sexual relationship can have. Thats why I think he is co-dependent on you. He wants you for something other than sex.\n\n>I'm wondering.....does it even really matter? Does \"lust\" matter?

            "I may be younger and not married but I know that sexual attraction is really one of the pillars of a good relationship. When that's lacking, it opens a door for cheating, unwanted open relationships, and just general unhappiness (it does depend on the relationship and the people involved, but it does seem important to you at least). You deserve to be with somebody who loves every inch of you, and who admires you as a person as well as your body, and trust me, there's someone out there who will feel that way. \n\nI think since you and your husband (at least from what you said in your post) don't seem to have any other major fallouts you can end this marriage amicably and stay friends. Part of feeling appreciated in a relationship is feeling loved AND wanted, if one isn't there, you're in trouble.\n\nI quite honestly don't understand how people marry someone they're not into physically, you should end this and continue with your life, get back into dating, find someone who'll show you what a good sex life really looks like because you deserve it.",

            "I will be very honest.\n\nI think you both are together because you ended up together and don\u2019t want to lose a relationship.\n\nNow this is only based on the little information you have given but it seems like you both have insecurities that have led to you both settling for one another. In addition, issues with communication but they have never been resolved because you both don\u2019t want to lose the perceived benefits of being in a relationship - even if that relationship isn\u2019t what you want or beneficial to you. E.g. fear of loss.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong a lot of people have these types of relationships where it\u2019s mainly companionship and that\u2019s fine - do you. The problem I see however is there is an imbalance. Essentially you want more than he is willing to give and even though you\u2019re suppressing it clearly it\u2019s been affecting you negatively. Additionally someone who loves and respects you should not ever speak to you this way not even in the heat of the moment.\n\nIf you\u2019re both willing to work on communication and attraction then so be it. Go to therapy, maybe a sex therapist and work on yourselves as a couple as well as individually. I\u2019d never say change yourself for someone but some gym workouts could help with the going on top and BMI - if YOU want to make that improvement.

            "So I\u2019ve been in a relationship with a man with ADHD (and, I believe, probably other undiagnosed things) before. We were in a relationship for 5 years and much like you, we didn\u2019t have much sex. I think every 6 weeks was probably our standard too. \n\nI ended our relationship because for 5 years, I had voiced my need for intimacy but also general support and help around the house. None of which ever happened. \n\nWhat I concluded was that I was just his Security blanket - he might have loved me, but more like a friend. People with ADHD needs structure and stability, and I helped him in that - I helped him get up in the morning for work, made him dinner and cleaned the house for him. \n\nWhen I broke up, my theory of me only being his security blanket made more sense. He was mad and hurt at first, but after a few weeks, he begged me to come back because he \u201c... couldn\u2019t do all of this alone\u201d (referring to managing a household and his own life). \n\nI think sometimes it\u2019s hard being in a relationship with people with diagnoses, because you don\u2019t really know if they love you or just the structure and stability you help them achieve. \n\nAnyways, long story short - you have to put him aside and ask yourself \u201cWhat do I need in a relationship, and is this being met by my partner?\u201d.

The lack of sex is less worrying than the lack of respect he has for you. He is using you! He's not providing what you are in return. He is selfish. I think individual therapy for you would be more beneficial than couple's therapy so you can figure out your next step. IMO you deserve better. Feeling unwanted, undesired in a relationship is a terrible feeling and all I wish for you is to find a partner who is more compatible with you, who respects you, loves you, is affectionate, loving and NEVER EVER insults you no matter how angry he is.",

It seems like he's okay with being gross or however he puts it but leaves it all to the woman to keep up appearances?\nThis is probably more deep seeded than you may know. Also hasn't given oral once? Oh honey the disrespect. \n\nOnly you can really do anything from here on out, However it seems like you are already distant, and he's already checking out emotionally. It will be very hard, but I feel you will be so much happier once you leave and find that you are worth so much more than what he says. You don't even need to find another person to tell you that. All you need is you. I would recommend splitting up for a while. Taking a break if you will, and see how you feel a few weeks or months down the line. \n\nCan you honestly see yourself being happy with him for the rest of your life? That comment he made about being unnatractive when your old anyway would have killed me. I personally would start taking steps to leave. I'm worth more than what he has to offer me, which isn't much to begin with. I don't deserve to be settled for.  You don't either. First loves are tough, but you gotta love yourself to girlfriend.",
            "Re:  \u201cDoes it even matter? Is lust mandatory?\u201d\n\nNot *necessarily*, though it can help.\n\nWhen people talk about lust being the \u201csecret\u201d to a good relationship, try to put it in the same box as advice you get from different types of people who say \u201chumor\u201d is the secret as well as wholly different sects who say \u201cmutual respect\u201d or \u201ccommon interests\u201d or wait no!, \u201c*separate* interests\u201d are the secret.\n\nThe point is that there are a lot of things that a relationship can offer you. Some of these qualities will be more important to you than others. And, some will be more important to your partner than others. It\u2019s possible that you are more sexually motivated than your partner. He, in turn, might appreciate you for your humor, honesty, generosity, or any number of other things. As long as you are both getting what you need out of the relationship and there is some type of balance, that\u2019s all that matters. It doesn\u2019t have to be a symmetrical one-for-one balance. And, you don\u2019t have to value or need the same things. Most couples don\u2019t. They tend to be complimentary rather than identical.\n\nIf you can set aside the new agey preachiness qualities and not put it on too much of a pedastle (no self help book should ever be elevated to philosophical or theological levels), the Five Love Languages is a decent albeit simplistic framework describing this.",

He's got problems he needs sorted out: hurting you and insulting you is not something a \"partner\" should do. Also, he really sucks at communication, which is needed to be improved so that you both truly are on the same page.\n\n2. I agree that in the end, love and companionship is what matters most, even though sex is very important early on and throughout most of the time though.\n\n3. I wouldnt take the \"not into me physically\" as heavy as if he doesn't resonate with you mentally or spiritually. Unless you have a medical issue, then with some work and your own dedication, you can try to be what he wants/needs, so I think this point is more superficial in the landscape of a relationship, AND HE DEFINITELY SHOULD ASPIRE TO BE WHAT YOU WANT/NEED TOO. The same exact way. If it's one sided effort, then no, it's not right.\n\n4. Ultimately, you have to decide, with clear mind and heart, if the person you are with, the relationship you're in, is sustainable for *the rest of your life*, and what your deal breakers are, regardless of what the problem is.\n\nIf the sex and physical attraction is the only real problem, are you willing to work to improve it? Or want to find someone to accept you for who you are? Is it physically possible to attain this change, and if it's not, can you stay with him when he doesn't make you feel sexually desirable? What if you got into the best shape of your life, and he didnt? Would you feel things are one sided or that you deserve better because you believe in yourself more?",

It's not just about getting him to stop hurting you. It's about learning to be your own protector and champion in positive and healthy ways. \n\nIf you can't afford therapy, read books by experienced therapists and PhDs. I'd also recommend that you do some research on narcissistic relationships to see if that fits your situation. My favorite therapy self help book is Feeling Good by David Burns. There are a lot of layers to your situation, and the more you understand all of those layers, the more comfortable and confident you'll be in making decisions for yourself. \n\nForgive me for saying so, but you seem like you might be most comfortable when someone tells you what to do, and whether you stay with your husband or not, you've got to work on that.

My point is this, you deserve someone who not only desires you but respects you.  He clearly doesn't do either, I mean he is texting other girls etc. He is trash, and you aren't meant to be a garbage collector. Best friends don't do this to one another.",

If I could offer you any advice (preface: I\u2019m 23 so take my word with a grain of salt because I\u2019m a delinquent)- it would be to really, truly dig deep & decide whether or not you can spend the rest of your life living the way you are now.

Hindsight is always 20/20- your life is spiraling downhill & either way I feel like you\u2019ll hit a rock bottom either way. I guess the question is, would you rather prolong the downward spiral into rock bottom or demand some respect from him & hit \u2018rock bottom\u2019 when you mourn the loss of your relationship & previous life. The best part about rock bottom is the only other way to go is up. \n\nThis is off topic & just a suggestion if you had previously been considering this: if you plan on trying to get down to a more \u2018petite\u2019 size in order to get him to be more attracted to you- put all of that energy into becoming healthier for yourself. Become your own dream woman & love yourself the way you wished he\u2019d loved you. It\u2019s all easier said than done of course & I\u2019m one of the biggest offenders but I would never tolerate a man lying to me about the way he feels sexually about me for our entire relationship. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d even get past that. You deserve so much better than that. I\u2019d call it quits if I were you. \n\nRegardless, if it\u2019s on your agenda to work on weight (not implying anything), use that journey to remember who you are now without him to constantly walk on eggshells around. & get hot(ter) as fuck which will just be a plus when he comes crawling back because he\u2019s never had to be a grown man before.",
            "I get the feeling that the fights are a very small fraction of the relationship. The worst of the worst, but part of her journey to this realization. Who knows maybe not? Hard to say.\n\nOP, just be careful about which advice you take. Look for success stories and best practices as much as the red flag waving. There's a way through this. Honestly, we all have little red flags, but the true measure of a relationship is both of your abilities to invest into each other and improving. Everyone has different lines where enough is enough, but I hope between better communication, some research, and maybe counseling you can wildly improve your sex life. \n\nBe more confident! Be proactive about asking what he likes. Try new things. Ask Reddit for sex tips and source material. Get a little freaky. Sometimes it takes one of you to take the initiative (for months even) to warm the other's heart and encourage lasting change. If this is what you want, go for it. Everyone is able to learn to develop their sexuality. \n\nThe Act of Marriage is an interesting read. If talking about sex is confronting, then there's definitely something you need to look at within yourself too. Not sure if it is confronting or not, but thought I'd toss that in. Good luck!

            "It's a difficult situation which I will describe from my POV as I've been in the situation, as your boyfriend, but I'm a female. \n\nWe've meet innocently through high school, but only started going out after. Now, I really wanted to have someone close to me. It felt like my best friend would sorta drop me for first better friend she got the attention of most of the time. I was very vulnerable as I didn't have many close people who I found comfort in, and my family had its own alcohol problems and the likes. I enjoyed my time with him mostly, we did fight, and sometimes we didn't understand each other. He did turn out to be abusive which I only found out/realised much later into the relationship and towards its end, but sexually I felt incompatible with him. I tried to make up for it and work on it, but Ive only done it when I felt least stress, but it was generally difficult since I was basically also cleaning after both of us (thats not all there was to abuse but that was also it). \n\nNow, I was all up for trying to work through our sexual incompatibility, but I don't think I would ever be able to see him as more arousing for me even without him being essentially like a messed up child once we moved in. I liked his face and stuff, but I found myself thinking about how I wish we didn't have sex this week, because I didn't enjoy it at all. He was extremely lazy during sex and the amount of sweat was a turn off. But trust me I did love him as a person and all that mean talk your boyfriend said is an escape from the sexual incompatibility of your relationship. Im sad he said that to you but it is always going to happen without sexual compatibility, its normal and human to want a compatible partner but we can live off just being content with what we have. \n\nI did found out that being with someone more compatible is worth it, it makes me much more happy inside. I think what he has said to you is a cry for help to be honest. You should separate and start again looking for someone who sees the same in you as you do. Too bad he couldn't break up with you like he should have, but sometimes people can behave cowardly. I think its okay to make it amicable, you should be sad but don't be sad for anything else than being two different people, ever.",

When I\u2019m with a woman and she\u2019s self conscious about herself/won\u2019t initiate sex it\u2019s a major tune off and after a while I build resentment. I also suffer with depression as well. Manic or bipolar depression really makes me angry and lash out at my significant others. While I do my best to hold it back and relax there are times where I can\u2019t hold it in anymore and I get angry.

This problem is probably something that most people do not understand or want to follow. No one person will ever be perfect for any other person. You'll relate in some areas but not in others, and that is OK. However, when this unrelating comes to sexuality, it is a significant problem that is at the core of why people couple in the first place. The drive, the natural drive for coupling, is to have children, not merely friendship. You don't need to marry a friend; the whole idea of marriage is doomed to failure because natural desires are forever changing, and the inherent need to help many species, including ours, evolve is rooted in diversity.",

Sex is not everything, but it is definitely *something*. For some, no sex is a no go.

If he can't reciprocate oral, he probably doesn't pull his weight in terms of chores, being romantic, etc. He just doesn't even sound like a nice person.\n\nLoving partners intuitively know each other's physical insecurities and never hurt each other by pointing them out even in the heat of an argument and certainly not in the way he did. \n\nHe could say something like, \"I care about you a lot and want you to live a long healthy life and I also want to improve myself for you, so I got us a membership to this beginner level fitness app. We can do the exercises together!\" He doesn't want to work on himself, but criticizes you? Wtf? Also, never reciprocating oral is very selfish. I really struggle to see what redeeming qualities he has! \n\nHow is communication outside the bedroom? Do you guys have shared hobbies? Do you go on dates? Snuggle and hug a lot? Is he affectionate? Do you have long, meaningful conversations that aren't just about his day and how he's stressed out?",

            "He sounds more like he\u2019s abusive than not attracted to you.

You wouldn\u2019t have started dating if there wasn\u2019t, right? \n\nAlso, abusers love to tell the abusee that they are unattractive, because it keeps them down. It keeps them feeling inadequate, and vulnerable to the abuser. It\u2019s a control tactic. \n\nAnd at this point, if he isn\u2019t attracted to you, it\u2019s not because he chose to be with someone he isn\u2019t attracted to. It\u2019s because he has so little respect for you, after years of putting you through abuse, that he isn\u2019t attracted to you. Which, by the way, isn\u2019t your fault.

            "I happened to leave my ex-wife(36 at the time) when I was 37. We had a good relationship in so far as there was love and intimacy and friendship but there was definitely a spark missing as time went on. It sounds to me like you both have just allowed yourselves to enable each others comfort and complacency. There are always excuses for this - i'm too busy or tired for sex, i don't have enough money to do this/that, why go out and talk when we can just watch tv all night. Being content and being complacent are very close cousins and one is very toxic for the relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do believe someone had to be honest and if he says hes not attracted to you overweight gain - its harsh but at least he's not hiding things from you or perhaps looking for something thats missing in other women. But this is an opportunity for you both. My ex-wife and I both had unhealthy habits for a while but I started to exercise and improve my health and she didn't. As my habits changed, we grew apart and ultimately met our end. You two should both take this opportunity to start meaningful investments/changes in your relationship. I did lose attraction to my ex as I started to improve myself internally and externally. I would start to get attention from women I didn't expect and it was certainly one of the many wedges that drove me and my ex apart. I have honestly wondered if she just joined me on my quest to self-improvement, would we have ever broken up......but all of these issues are chances for you to start to make the changes that will help you. It will be slow and it won't always be easy but when you start seeing those results, you'll be in a better position to figure out if what you're doing together as a team is still working or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do believe that \"lust\" matters and that your partner should absolutely *want* you because intimacy is incredibly important. Even as our relationship was souring, I still managed to have sex with my ex-wife at least once a week. In my current relationship I love my girlfriend so much that we had sex almost every day at the start and almost two years in, we still have sex multiple times a week.  He will want you more in time if you invest in things that matter and if you do them together.",

            "There is a LOT going on here. The smallest of which is actual physical attraction. Your husband has a lot of signs of a sex addict. Which can include porn addiction. It could help provide some framework for why he lashes out when you bring up the lack of sex. Or perhaps he\u2019s just an emotionally abusive jerk.\n\nIt\u2019s not okay to call names. Love doesn\u2019t include shaming, blaming, or name calling. It sounds like when you two have conversations where you attempt to address your needs that he becomes verbally abusive. That\u2019s not love.\n\nOn a more personal note, so much of this sounds exactly like my marriage. Perhaps so much so that it could be clouding my judgment but it\u2019s just spot on. Except the verbal abuse. My spouse was/is a sex addict. As I got healthier emotionally it became impossible to have a healthy marriage. It didn\u2019t work out. \n\nI think the bigger question isn\u2019t about how to have a relationship with a man who isn\u2019t attracted to you or is unable to love you fully but rather WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO BE WITH SOMEONE THAT CAN\u2019T LOVE YOU?

If no, then leave him and look for love and desire both. \nIf he is not attracted to you, he will not be unless you fit into his idea of ideal body type. Do you want to do that?

I avoided to treat my depression because I had feared my sex drive would've suffered, so I lost myself and self-respect. I gained a lot of weight, my life was a mess, and my ex ditched me as soon as he found a suitable replacement for his ego boost. Fast forward to present, I've never felt better in my life, lost all the weight and getting close to my ideal size. Life is good again.  \n\n\nThe best advice I got, and it has been my mantra past two years: take care of yourself; you and your needs are the most important things for your well-being.

Whether he meant it or not he's saying it to hurt you. That's unacceptable. If you want to work it out with him you're both going to need to learn how to argue in a productive way that doesn't involve saying harmful things to each other in the heat of the moment with the sole intent to hurt each other. \n\nIt sounds to me like he's consistently ignoring your feelings, not just when arguing, but when you're trying to talk to him about your sex life. \n\nI think you need to talk this out with a professional to parse out what you want and if not getting that means you leave him. And if you decide to stick around I think the two of you could benefit from talking to someone together, at least to learn the proper way to argue with someone you love and want to be in a relationship with.",

You might have to get back in the dating scene, and that's going to be its own sort of learning curve, especially after being married for so long, but if you want lust and passion and sweaty ball slappy monkey sex, you can absolutely go find that.\n\nIf you want to be with someone because you're comfortable and he makes you feel safe (though because of what you've said, I find that hard to believe) and you want to make it work, then I encourage you to invest in a nice vibrator, and then communicate clearly about y'all's sex life (birthdays, anniversaries?) and quit fighting about it. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you're happy. And if you're not happy you need to decide if it's worth it to you to go out and find that. \n\nMy fiance tells me all the time that I'm his kink, and he wants me all the time. It makes me feel sexy and empowered and powerful. We have a beautiful, intimate, sweet sex life and I feel like it adds so much to our relationship- we have entire conversations through touch sometimes because we want to be in each other's space. My dad made a point to let me know he was still having sex when I was an adult. Supes gross. And it's not like you get old and wrinkly and unattractive when you get old (Josh Brolin? Helen Mirrin? Streisand is almost 80.) I want to be with someone that digs me, not someone who tolerates me physically til he gets too gross to be with anyone else. \n\nIt sounds like you guys need to do some real assessments about what you want out of a relationship, and what you're willing to tolerate from your partner. If you want passion, you can go find it. If you want safety, I encourage you to do some counseling with your partner.\n\nAlso, I know that objectifying women is gross- but to give you some context, I encourage you to check out r/chubby to see what it looks like when a man is into you v. doing you a favor.",

The real question is can you live the rest of your \u2018precious\u2019 life not feeling beautiful/desired by your husband with little to no sex? That doesn\u2019t sound like a very fun time to me. You can find someone who is willing to give you what you want, because frankly what you want is not unreasonable and any man who loves and desires you, will be happy to give it to you. If you feel you need to lose weight or maybe get a new makeup/hair routine then go for it. That may fix the issue or it may not... If it doesn\u2019t please realize you need more out of a partner and put in the work to get what you really want. It\u2019s worth it in the end, and you\u2019ll be happy you did. You can do it.

What if he married an athletic skinny girl. She wouldn't feel sexy to him and that can hurt. So let people be with those who find them sexy as it creates an overall better life to get the friendship and to get the sexual romance. \n\n\nAlso, discuss sex! Talk about your insecurities, your desires, your fantasies. That is healthy between adults. If someone makes you feel bad about your sexuality, then they probably are not the right match for you.\n\n\nOP, I see two options. A. Dump him, B. Explore polyamory. \n\nIf your life is otherwise good and he treats you well (be demanding to yourself and expect actual good, don't settle), but the only thing lacking is the sex, then maybe an open relationship could work. You can build your life together financially and emotionally, but at the same time find space to explore your sexuality. It is not fair to you that your partner lied to you and prevented you from exploring your sexuality. Find a boyfriend who finds you sexy.

            "Obviously the things he said, even if he didn\u2019t mean them, cannot be taken back. But this sounds like a desensitizing pattern that he\u2019s gotten himself stuck into that sadly many women (and men actually) can\u2019t wrap their mind around unless they\u2019ve experienced and recovered from it. I can almost guarantee if he stopped watching porn and spoke w a sex therapist his sex problems would improve. Men will flail at a reason why their dick isn\u2019t working appropriately and the frustration will cause them to lash out at their partner, thinking they\u2019re a contributing factor to the dick problems. I doubt he\u2019s cheated physically. He\u2019s probably attempted attracting some new new in hopes that the novelty would turn him on, but it won\u2019t work. \n\nThe bigger issue is of course never performing oral on you. That\u2019s terrible. And I\u2019m not anti-porn at all, but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the constant novelty of trillions of videos of strangers banging can desensitize your body to ACTUAL intimacy. Imagine conditioning your brain to feel turned on by just sitting there staring at a screen and then orgasming, and then trying to mix in sex where you have to actually physically do something to ejaculate. The human body is obviously going to be like, no, fuck that, where\u2019s the strangers having sex on a screen. What\u2019s worse is that when dudes have this issue, their partners will almost always bend over backwards to blame themselves.\n\nAnyway, hopefully he sorts that out and hopefully you leave him.",

He never really initiated sex and we would only have sex when I initiated that would last 1-5 minutes.\n\nHe was a very intelligent and romantic man. He always blew me away with grandiose gifts and compliments.\n\nEventually I tried talking to him about taking viagra or cutting the porn addiction. He would always get offended and act like he didn\u2019t have a problem.\n\nI also found messages from him to other woman and customized porn content from women off of reddit. :(\n\nWhen we broke up I told him it was only because our sex was nonexistent and I needed to feel wanted.\n\nHe said that I stopped sucking his dick and climbing on top. That was the only way I could get him to have sex and I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to put up with it any longer.\n\nHe was my best friend and it still hurts to this day because I do miss all of our deep conversations about life. But it really isn\u2019t fair for you to have to pine after a man. The attraction should feel equal.\n\nThe shitty thing is that all the porn he watched was of tiny white chicks and I am a very curvaceous Latina. \n\nHis new girlfriend fits his preference and I sometimes wish he would\u2019ve just told me he wasn\u2019t that attracted to me from the beginning.\n\nI would get out of this situation while you can, either that or give him a hands down approach to what you need out of the relationship and give him a time frame.

All the women were not the same body type as I am-and I mean there was a BIG difference in my body type vs. what he was seeking out.\n\n\n\nMy confidence & insecurity plummeted during that relationship.

The thing I\u2019ve experienced is those that seem to be able to offer those extreme highs in the intimacy dept also experience lows in other departments. Again my experience. At 39 I found my self single again after a long marriage with a manipulative borderline disorder wife. Her highs faded and the damage had been done. But after having some fun with women in the younger side what I wanted was life long companionship. A friend  and some one that likes to be intimate as well but not the thing that drives the relationship. I realized that many things in life made me happy and liking upon one human to be the sole provider of happiness does not exist nor should it.  Love means something different for everyone. Above all things I just wanted to be treated nicely. Loved for me and how I am. I remarried a women and we mesh really well. Sex is good and regular but not the driving force of us. We have freedoms to do the things we want that don\u2019t include each other. There is one thing that\u2019s an issue for me on your situation is some of the mean things said in arguments. Those are bottled up feelings he has and that\u2019s an issue. Personally I don\u2019t think he\u2019s your best match. At least he has remorse or says it. You can\u2019t just discount people for feeling what they feel. They are allowed to feel how they want. But it should never be used as a weapon and you don\u2019t have to accept it.

Just because your body isn't the initial attraction doesn't mean they can't grow to love your body too.\n\nIf he uses your body as a reason not to be attracted to you, that is a problem. \n\nBody types do effect who you are attracted to INITIALLY but if you grow to love the person that should include their body in my opinion.\n\nAlso, he sounds really shallow. \n\n>He says when we grow old we'll be unattractive anyway and love is all that matters.\n\n\nWtf? Old doesn't equal unattractive unless you are only attracted by looks. If you love someone they don't grow ugly with age. I have family members I love no where near as much as I do my SO, and I still don't think of them as ugly. And yes I'm using ugly instead of unattractive, because that's how that comes off.\n\nAlso people's looks and body change over time, do you think of your husband as fat even though he gained weight? No? Then why does he unless it is an extreme? And gaining weight doesn't effect everyone's attraction, some people it does and those are not people I want to be in a relationship but it is their call. If my SO gained weight to the point where it effected my attraction, I would be more worried about his health than the weight.\n\nTldr: Initial attraction is dictated by looks. Once you have a relationship past that he should love your body if he loves you. Sounds like he loves what you provide, not you.\n\nEdit: Also people don't say things in anger that they don't think. Just because they'd never say it out loud isn't enough in my opinion. I've gone years without insulting my SO when angry, or Visa versa. You don't magically think different ways when you're angry.

If you got in shape and your sex life improved, it would likely make you very happy and that\u2019s fine. I think some people will say that I\u2019m unethical for suggesting this. \n\nHe says he\u2019s willing to work on it, but unless he suddenly unearths his entire mental/emotional/psychological experienced definitions of sexual attraction, it\u2019s not going to happen. It would be no different from, like, conversion therapy. Learning to value devotion, to value sex because it\u2019s healthy for you, for your marriage, for your partner is a more feasible step. Who knows how dedicated he could really be. \n\nSee what you can do. I hope you find a path of least resistance to something satisfying and of value.\n\nEdit: level the playing field and stop giving him oral.",

It took me a while to admit to myself he was never into me. I was a very self confident person but those 7 years really did a number on my self esteem and brought up all sorts of insecurities in me. I am now trying to rebuild myself. I am terribly sorry for the situation you are in and I wish I could offer more advice but I think everything has already been said.",

            "I think you both have to agree about the norms you'd like in your relationship. It sounds like maybe he's blurted out these horribly insulting things because he's not comfortable admitting what he feels, and he'd rather say things to please you (in general) than admit the truth. And clearly he's not sensitive when he does share his truth. \n\nCommunication will definitely have to be worked on, but the rest is up to you. What do you value in your relationship? What does he value? What would improved intimacy look like for both of you? How would you feel if the current situation continues for the rest of your lives? I think there's a lot to explore in what you both value, expect, and agree to work on in your relationship.",

            "Wow, that really sucks. I\u2019m so sorry. He\u2019s right that you\u2019ll be old and unattractive one day anyways, but happily married old couples ARE attracted to each other because of their love. They are respectful towards each other, and it\u2019s not respectful to speak poorly of your partner\u2019s appearance. I\u2019m not saying love cures all and is all you need. I\u2019m saying that when you genuinely love someone and they\u2019re right for you, you are not focused on their imperfections. The things you LOVE about them overpower those imperfections.  And when you notice imperfections your love makes you gracious enough to not be a hurtful asshole about them.   I\u2019ve seen this many times- in relationships that others have, and once in my own. I dated and was head over heels with someone with the same issue. Ultimately I realized I couldn\u2019t be happy with our lack of sex and how unattractive he inexplicably made me feel and broke it off after a year. It was incredibly hurtful to learn I just didn\u2019t do it for him. But you know what? There are PLENTY of men that are physically attracted to all sorts of women- large, small, curvy, straight-figured, and everything in between.\n\nIt is really hurtful to figure out what you\u2019ve figured out. Ultimately it\u2019s up to you to decide whether that\u2019s a big deal to you or not. If you were to lose weight and become more his type would your hurt feelings fade away? Probably not, the problem is less that you\u2019re not his type and more that he\u2019s let that affect your intimacy and his view of you, which affects the relationship. I generally urge people to try and work things out but there needs to be a baseline of attraction and respect- those seem to be lacking here.",

Our attractions change as we age, so that isn't a great indication of a good marriage. I think every marriage has strengths and weaknesses. You guys might be a 10/10 on having fun together, but you might be a 3/10 on sexual compatability. To me, focusing too much on the weaknesses can take away from our strengths. \n\nI am not trying to tell you what you should do.

They want sex but they can't participate fully with a real person, it scares them. I think you need to go to marriage counseling around this. He is not going to admit it to anyone at first if he was abused, it's going to need a professional to get him to talk about it. They act like that, the men when things have happened to them. It's not you at all, something is going on with him something very serious. He calls you a prude but he had issues with giving you oral. All red flags that something happened to him and he is scared and unable to have real intimacy.",
            "He's obviously a monumental asshole, based on both his words to you and his incongruent sexual expectations (wants oral, won't give oral). If no kids, divorce seems like an obvious solution.\n\nAlso kind of weird of you that you won't ever be on top during sex. That seems pretty standard fare.\n\nAgain, based on your description, though, he is largely the problem.",
            "I\u2019m stunned at the fact that he\u2019s never gone down on you. To me, that\u2019s insulting. In my opinion I think you should focus on bettering yourself and making yourself happy. We are supposed to be there for our partners and love and support them unconditionally, but sometimes we forget about ourselves. \n\nStart a new hobby. Try eating new foods. Create and execute a workout routine that works for you. Dye your hair. Read a new book. Focus on you. \n\nI don\u2019t think this in itself is necessarily means for divorce, especially if there\u2019s love there, but perhaps you\u2019re looking for something he just isn\u2019t able to give to you right now. So with that being the case, find it on your own. \nSex is so important in a relationship, but you don\u2019t have to be miserable. Have fun with some toys. Watch porn or read some erotic stories.

            "You guys need couple\u2019s therapy. I\u2019d say consider separation too if he\u2019s being that rude and inconsiderate since you\u2019ve went out of your way to talk about it. \n\nCouples have hiccups, but it\u2019s very much possible for it to be so rare it\u2019s not an aspect of your relationship. You guys sound like y\u2019all have struggled with communicating needs. Definitely more on his side. But in your case, you definitely needed to put your foot down because you are a person. You deserve to have a fruitful relationship. You don\u2019t deserve to be questioning your body or your relationship 24/7. You deserve someone that you have no worries with talking about these types of things. No relationship is gonna be 100% perfect, but a great relationship has to come out of both being in the light to tackle these adult issues. You\u2019ve been doing what you can, but he\u2019s being quite resistant making it so you\u2019re running out of options on how to deal with this. \n\nWhat I want to also point out is the insults are not okay. He\u2019s targeting your insecurities. If you go along with a couple\u2019s therapist, they\u2019ll tell you the same thing. I do genuinely believe people have room to change or there is a chance he needs to find a way to redirect his anger. To me, it sounds like he\u2019s deflecting since he seems to be the prude or he\u2019s too stubborn to try admit that he needs to work on his side of the relationship. Again, something that needs to be brought up in therapy. To me, if he tries to avoid getting this help, it shows that he holds no value to you which means you can go ahead and gift him with a nice old divorce paper. If he genuinely wants to move on in this marriage whether he thinks he\u2019s right or knows he\u2019s wrong, there is a good start. In most cases, I\u2019d be already telling people to pack their shit and go. But I do empathize with him very little (definitely not with the insulting and one sided aspect) that it gets hard to communicate. And sometimes I express my feelings in ways that I shouldn\u2019t out of fear of discontent from my partner or having to accept responsibility. With that said however, it still isn\u2019t an excuse to not self reflect to do right by those that care about you. I can say he\u2019s taking half a step to work on this and that\u2019s expressing emotions; nonetheless in a way that will not make things any better. \n\nSo with that said, there is no shame and it\u2019s not overreactive to at the very least throw separation or even divorce on the table. I do think this issue majorly lies on a lack of communication which created frustrations on both ends. Talking to a therapist will allow you to pinpoint if this marriage can be salvage or if it\u2019s time for you to find someone that can actually discuss status of the relationship as a grown ass adult. If he cannot take therapy to heart and utilize it to make the marriage more positive, you\u2019ve got divorce on the table. If he can actually respond as an empathetic, human being and attempt to move forward out of love, then y\u2019all will be on the right track. At that point, the ball is in his court. This situation is too heavy for you to take on alone so it\u2019s definitely useful to seek professional help."

One day I was thinking about how my friends and their siblings were so nice to each other and thought to myself \"why can't we get along like that?\". So I went into his room and said \"hey, I'd really love to be friends, do you wanna not treat each other like shit?\"  We called a truce and from then on we got on like a house on fire. Now we're best friends. Siblings are weird, they're horrible to each other for no reason. I dont know why but it's normal, and normal to grow out of it. Hopefully that's what's happening for you guys.",
            "I hated my sister growing up with a passion. I used to toss and turn at night and every morning wishing I had had literally any other sibling. The last straw for me was when she threw her high heels at me in a screaming fit for borrowing them without asking right after she'd been freely using my car for months, sometimes without asking. She got a punch in the face for that and we didn't speak or see each other for five years, only reuniting the first time for our mother's 50th birthday. \n\nEleven years later and we are each other's closest confidant and best friend. When I understood that certain aspects of our chronic, psychological nightmare of a family dynamic were what directly drove her behaviour from the age of 2 to 24, all the apprehension, old resentment, and desperate rage I still held for her which I could not previously resolve internally melted away and was replaced with overwhelming love and acceptance for who she was and is today.",

We had a big age difference and I was a depressed, moody teenager that hated life and they were obnoxious, normal kids. We are all 3 super close now that we are older but it did take time and effort to get here. For us, our bond is unbreakable and I will forever be so thankful to have them. It took a long time to get here but it was worth it.",
            "I'm so happy for you, OP! I admit, I was a little harsh on you in the last thread (the thought of cutting off a sibling because of the way they acted in their teenage years was absolutely absurd to me, and the fact that so many in the thread were actively encouraging it really confused me), but I'm genuinely glad you're working towards a positive relationship with your sister. Remember, it's a marathon not a sprint - don't put yourself in situations you don't feel comfortable in yet because you feel you need to rush the 'closeness' process\n\nGenuinely wishing you the best :)",
            "Same. My sister and I are 6 years apart and were not close growing up bc of the age difference. For some reason I was really mean to her when I was in middle school and high school. In hindsight it\u2019s bc I was a moody teenager. Our best story is when I kept telling her she was fat when she was in 2nd grade (she was not at all fat, I was just projecting my insecurities and was jealous of her.) She rode her bike a few miles to the store and bought Slim Fast. In 2nd grade. I was not nice. We\u2019ve lived together as roommates in our 20\u2019s/30\u2019s, had some fights and didn\u2019t talk once for 6 months. Today she is my absolute best friend in the whole world. Our parents suck, brother had major issues, and we\u2019ve barely seen our extended family in years, so we have an outlook of \u201cYou are my only family and my best friend.\u201d She\u2019s married to a great guy now, and I\u2019m included with his family\u2019s holidays.",

I was just an emotional mess and made her my verbal punching bag. I\u2019ve been trying to make up for it since then, so much. I\u2019m her strongest supporter in the family, I always ask her opinion before deciding family trips (I\u2019m the designated family organizer), always call her with my news first, text and FaceTime her every week just to make an effort.... I think we\u2019ve become pretty close now. In fact I\u2019m the first one she told she was gay when she came out earlier this year and you bet I supported the crap out of her. If your sister actually apologized then she knows she has to change that dynamic between you two. And don\u2019t think that there won\u2019t be steps back - there will be because childhood patterns are so hard to fall back into.

But the time I started college, we were pretty much best friends. \n\nNow at 30, her at 27, we are extremely close. Same sense of humor, text each other every day, despite being in different states.

            "My sister and I had a very rocky relationship when we were younger; Screaming at each other, slap fights, generally being mean to one another. It didn't help that as I hit my teen years my role became more of a fatherly role since her dad wasn't around and my mom went through a string of men who weren't around long enough to do anything. I had this dual mindset of protecting her while also being super jealous of the things she had. My mom spent a ton of time with her doing pageants and things and she got special treatment from her dad's side of the family. I was always the odd child out. Then when I was an adult and she was still in high school we had a huge fight over a boy she was dating. It was a big wedge between us for a long time and we didn't really talk about it for years.\n\nOnce we were both settled into adulthood and had kids and perspective it really made it easier for us to relate to one another. It also gave us that time to understand that there were things that weren't about us coloring how we saw one another. I saw her as spoiled, but that wasn't her fault; She didn't invite that, it was what the adults around her did. She felt like I was distant, but again that wasn't my fault it was the constantly shifting ability of my mother to take care of me and abandoning me with different family members (while keeping my sisters). So I was gone here and there at key points in her life. \n\nTime helps heal old wounds, but communication is so vital to really moving forward and understanding that who you were then isn't who you are today.",

            "That\u2019s what happened with my actual brother and me. We used to argue and bicker all the time .... ALL THE TIME. To the point where we would get into physical fights  and really hurt each other. Mind you I\u2019m a female and two years older than him. \n\nSince he was 7/8 he has abused me verbally calling me all sorts of insults and comments. When he was 12 he was at the height of his anger issues and he stabbed me (pretty badly) with a pen on my arm. \n\nAfter that day I stopped speaking to him, made no effort at all to speak or make any notice of him. Like dead ass acted like he didn\u2019t exist.\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to get that angry at me ever again (in case he ever found his way to a Knife or worse) and I figured the best way to do that was to avoid him at all costs. \n\nThis only made him more angry and in his teen years he would constantly try to start fights and call me names all the time. I still avoided him as much as I could in a small house, and attempted to never ever ensue any arguments. My dad is a pretty condescending asshole who was also violent and that\u2019s also how I dealt with him most of the time.\n\nHe calmed down a lot , almost shockingly well and matured a lot in the past few years (we are both in our 20s now) \n\none day recently he said to my mum \u201cit hurt me so much that she stopped speaking to me and we don\u2019t talk anymore why is she so cold and distant\u201d. Every time I go home to visit my mum comments something like that to me and pressures me about it.\n\nI felt scared for my life that time and for a long time believed he was actually capable of causing serious harm. He was a very angry little boy and now I cannot seem to hold a conversation with him no matter how grown or different he might be now. I hold severe resentment for how he\u2019s treated me in the past. \n\nAnd as terrible as it seems because he\u2019s family but that\u2019s just how some things are.",

We're all so different personality-wise and we were developing into our own people at the time. Our household also had some emotional toxicity going on. But now, we're literally best friends. They're the first people I called when I got engaged a few months ago, and if I have a formal wedding ceremony they would be my bridesmaids. We tell each other everything. This didn't happen over night, and it might be different for you, but it's also not out of the realm of reality.",

            "Take your time this is not a race.  Give yourself and her time to adjust to your new interactions.  If you feel like you can't trust her after you have some time to actually get to know each other again then decide from there.  You were both struggling so much to identify yourselves within family roles, school roles, and just generally making friends.  You had a few years on her in terms of dealing with other people and empathy than she did and unfortunately I think you became to focus of her anger toward her bio dad who was no longer in the picture.  You were to closest safest person to lash out at and you bore the brunt of it.  But she is becoming able to see and have some insight into her own issues and might want to rectify what happened without really realizing how much of a role she played in your discord.

            "I am going to admit I was a shit sister. Once I hit 19/20 years old, I really started to look retrospectively and realized I was the person causing pain and anguish because of personal medical problems. From 22 on I started rekindling my relationships with my family, my brother and sister in particular. Now after a few years of; therapy, apologizing and showing them I'm not going to be an ass hole out of no where really helped get our relationship to a more loving nature.

I personally also grew up hating my sister with everything in my soul when we were little, until I realized the reason I hated her was because of how my parents made me feel when they compared us literally all the time and bottom line I was extremely jealous and envious of her. Also she had the worst personality and said a lot of shit but it wasn't things that came from her but rather her biological father that manipulated her to say all that fucked up stuff and act mean towards me. At some point I was done with my way of acting towards her and we tried to fix the relationship, now we are each others best friends and I think being friends with your siblings is something really special because we grew up together so we know everything about each other and our personalities so we know how to deal with each other, we have a lot in common and I don't know what would I do with my life without her in it. I hope you really give your relationship with her a good try and hopefully you guys can experience what I experience with my sister. Good luck!",
            "I actually got along with my sister growing up and throughout college. It\u2019s only been within the past few years that I\u2019ve began to hate her and hate spending time with her. It takes a lot for me to say the words \u201cI hate her,\u201d and I\u2019m really sad it\u2019s gotten to this point. But I\u2019m also pretty desensitized to it now because she\u2019s not worth my fucking effort.\n\nThe problem is that she\u2019s become the most selfish and critical person I know. She gave up her dog, who I adopted because she wanted to go be homeless for a while because she wanted to put herself \u201cin a risky situation and see what happens.\u201d Those are exact words. She blames my parents for having too good of a life. She wished she struggled more because she doesn\u2019t like the fact that she has to lie to all of her friend about her upbringing. We were very fortunate growing up and she hates it. She lies to her friends about it because she wants to seem like she\u2019s struggled and lived a hard, but good life. She told my mom that my mom treats her like a pet because she calls her \u201csweetie.\u201d She told my parents that they have nothing to live for except for my sister and me and that she needs them to get a life. This is not true. My parents have friends, hobbies, and jobs. They love their life irregardless of my sister and me. She made my mom cry. My mom is the sweetest most loving person I know. She made my mom cry. I hate her for this the most.\n\nBecause she gave up her dog and I adopted him, she wants to visit him every so often. She planned a trip to visit the dog and stay with me. But she neglected to tell me that she was planning this. She didn\u2019t know it was over my birthday. She didn\u2019t even tell me this was her plan until a week before, but I heard from my parents 2 months prior that she wanted to visit the dog and stay with me. I waited for her to bring it up because it\u2019s her responsibility to ask to stay at my place. She didn\u2019t ask if she could stay with me until a week prior (about a month after she bought the tickets) saying she was coming to visit and was soooooo happy it was right around my birthday so she could celebrate with me. Yeah right.\n\nShe gets here and she criticizes my whole life. She tells me I shouldn\u2019t go to med school because she rarely gets to see her friends who are doctors. She told me she\u2019s worried about me because I\u2019m infatuated with my girlfriend. Because after two days of constant nagging and lecturing from my sister about all the bad things in my life... I was *really* excited to see my girlfriend. She met her for 1 hour and decided she knew our whole relationship and that as my big sis, it\u2019s her responsibility to tell me when she thinks it\u2019s not a good relationship. Meanwhile, we have since moved in and she is everything to me. I love her so dearly, more than I\u2019ve ever loved anyone before. It hurt so badly that my sister could disregard my feelings to tell me that she thinks it\u2019s not love, it\u2019s infatuation, when in fact this is truly the deepest and most true love I\u2019ve ever had. Then she whines and bitches when I wanted to spend my birthday with my girlfriend... which I had planned out for 2/3ish months. I said fuck it and left her to hang out with her abandoned dog. But boy oh boy did I hear about how it made her feel when I left her alone on my birthday when she flew all the way out here just to be with me.\n\nMy parents keep asking me if I think we will ever repair our relationship. I tell them it\u2019s on her. But I\u2019m done with her at this point. No more staying with me. No more accommodating to her. I won\u2019t take her abuse. If she wants to repair the relationship then she can get off her high horse and treat me like a person, not some young sister she needs to teach the way. She can respect me and my life choices or she can gtfo.",

I think the thing that would've bothered me the most is the fact they texted you out of the blue and asked why you weren't closer.

The first thing they should have said was, \"I know we fought a lot growing up and I'm sorry, I'd like to be closer.\"  \n\n\nSometimes it's hard to admit when you are wrong and it can feel like doing so is tearing you apart, but it's important that you do so.

I was pretty bossy to her and anytime parents would lecture her on anything I'd jump on their side and continue to lecture her (my parents definitely did a good job at shutting that down ASAP, but I knew I still did it for a bit). \n\nI think the biggest wake up call was when my sister called me out, and I realized it too, that I treated our 2 youngest sisters better than I did to her. And that made me realized I was being garbage and I knew that as the older sibling I had to grow up and be better. So I started showing her my favorite movies and TV shows that I grew up with, basically rewatching all the greats. And from that simple thing of rewatching and making our own commentaries, she's become so much more than a good sister, but a legit friend that I talk and share pretty much everything with and even as one of my main movie watching people.\n\nReflecting on my relationship with the oldest sister, I'm so happy that we're in a good place now. I encourage any siblings that are going through rough patches and want to be better, start with the little things, then you can make into the big conversations you've always wanted.",

            "This will be buried, but I think that sometimes you have to consider what your responsibilities are to your siblings. There are a lot of reasons to put effort into getting along with your parents as long they are not abusive. But, if a friendship doesn't happen with your sibling, I think that it's not necessarily something to spend too much energy on. A parent has a responsibility to their kids, for sure. And some other people have been commenting that part of that responsibility is to teach their kids how to get along with their siblings. But, again, if those siblings don't click as adults, why waste time trying to mend a friendship that never had a solid foundation? I'm not advocating cutting family out of your life. I'm saying that trying to be friends with your sibling simply because it's \"the right thing to do\" is absurd. Especially because false pretenses make for terrible relationships. Of course, if there is some love there between siblings, then that's absolutely worth preserving. But, you need to ask yourself how much love there is. If your relationship with your sibling doesn't positively impact your life in any way, maybe it's better to let go of the desire to have that positive relationship with them, like the ones your friends seem to have with their siblings. But, it doesn't need to be some dramatic ultimatum, either. You are simply allowed to stop caring so much about the health and quality and epic-ness of the love between you two.",

It was a decision I came to on my own but it did come with the added pressure of my mom specifically telling me I would no longer be her daughter if I choose to keep my baby. This was huge for me because I am an only child. It was the most difficult thing to do and I struggle with the emotions of it daily. \n\nIt was an open adoption and I have the ability to reach out and get pictures/updates whenever I like. I did that for a few years but then it just became easier to move on by not knowing. I knew I had made the right decision and the family taking my son was amazing. \n\nI also ended up not speaking to my mother for six years after because of the way she treated me during my pregnancy. It took years of therapy and a lot of forgiveness to even be in the same room as her. I made peace with her for the sake of the rest of our family (i.e. cousins, aunts, grandma's).   \n\n\nAt the same time my mothers health was deteriorating and I found out through some family she wasn't working, had divorced her second husband and was homeless living in her car.  \n\nI had moved away and was doing well enough financially. I succumbed to the guilt provided by my family and agreed to move her in with me and help her get the proper care. It wasn't ideal but I made it work. Got her healthy and got her into some housing and our relationship has been ok. \n\nFast forward to July of 2018. I had lost my job, and in general things weren't working in my favor. Mid-life crisis status but with all things I knew this too would pass and a year from now this would not matter.  I had a plan of action and knew things would get better I just needed time. \n\nThings did get better, got a new job, moved to a new city, celebrated my birthday and on vacation until January 2nd. Things were great up until this morning. \n\nI'm visiting out of town with some family, which includes my mother. My mom approached me about having issues with her computer/phone I paid for/bought and asked if I could help. \n\nShe handed them over and I started troubleshooting. As I'm going through I notice her computer has several tabs open and I start closing things and un-cluttering the mess. Next thing I see is an open email from August between the man who adopted my child and my mother. She is basically telling him how bad my life is because of her and her health issues and I lost my job and she needs to speak with him to ask for any kind of help. The last email is them exchanging phone numbers. \n\n\nI'm beyond upset now and don't even know what to do or say going forward. I've locked myself in the bedroom and trying to wrap my head around this. Thanks for reading.\n\ntl;dr: mom went behind my back and contacted the family who adopted my son telling them how poorly I'm doing in life (which is not true) asking for money.\n",

I would just apologize for your mother\u2019s behavior and tell them that her contacting them was not you. That way you can still have that pathway open for you in case future contact with your child is wanted. ",
            "Since your mom has been telling lies to solicit money, check on other ways she may have done this, for example opening credit cards or loans in your name. Get your credit reports and lock down your credit. Ask around your family and friends to see if anyone else has heard a sad tale of misfortune from her which required cash to fix. Has anything of value gone missing?\n\nTo stoop this low for money could indicate either a drug or gambling addiction; or could be plain old greed. Either way I'd consider she's burned all her chances for this lifetime and if you choose to have anything further to do with her it should be on a tough love basis.",
            "Wow.\n\nOk, so first of all, you should reach out to the couple that adopted your child and tell them that you just found out your mother reached out and was asking them for money.  Tell them you hope they didn't send her anything because this was done entirely without your knowledge, under false pretenses, and that they should never feel they have to give you OR your family any money, ever.\n\nSecond, have it out with your mom.  She has some fucking nerve trying to capitalize on your pregnancy after how she treated you.  And all of her apologies are called completely into question now that you know she did this.  ",
            "Reach out to the family personally, apologize for your mother's manipulation, offer to repay anything they sent to her (if you are able), request that they dismiss/ignore any further requests from your mother, and then go no contact with your mother.    \n   \nThis individual sounds toxic. Any involvement you have with her will be opening yourself up for stuff like this.  ",
            "Your mother threatened to cut you out of her life because of the child and now she's using that same connection for financial gain. Completely disgusting thing to do and I really don't think I could forgive my mother for that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were you, I would contact the family and apologize for your mother. Explain how she's being manipulative and that they shouldn't be supporting her financially. If you are able, I would consider trying to pay back some of the money your mother accepted and try to handle this with as much as as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you never want a relationship with your son, that's perfectly fine and something most people would understand. If you ever change your mind, you want to keep that door open but regardless, you wouldn't want that family to be financially strained by your mother. That's not fair to them and that strain certainly is not fair to a 16 year old who's probably planning on going to college in a few years. ",
            "Well, first I would pack my bags and leave, after telling her what sick POS she is. Then I'd email the man from my personal email address so that they know it's not from my mother, and tell them the truth, and not to give her any money. Then I'd block her from my life, and I'd never look back. ",

Please cut ties. She can only think of herself",
            "Send him an email. \"This is Tapjama, I just came across an exchange that my mother initiated with you where she seemed to be asking you for money. My mom is completely wrong to have done that, even if I was in a bad place, which I wasn't. I wasn't aware she was going around using my name and lies to try to get money off anyone.\"\n\nNow, you can either try to get some details out of them, which I'd suggest doing through some sort of \"I have no idea how her correspondence with you went after you exchanged phone numbers over email, but I'd like to offer whatever I can do to make right what she did\" and see what they tell you. Or you can confront your mom right now, before you sent the email, about what she did and figure out what she actually did so you know specifically if she got money from them. If she says they didn't give her money, inform her you'll be contacting them and confirming her story considering the exchange itself proves she's willing to lie for money, so if she's lying you'll know soon enough. Don't give her time between asking her and contacting them if you get a story at all. If she says she did get any money at all, tell them, \"I've confronted my mother and she said you gave her money. I want to offer you that money back. How much did she take and how do you want me to return it? Cheque, paypal, cash, ect?\" \n\nYou could also try to do this over the phone with the number she got, though depending on how her contact with them went, you might find the number disconnected (worse case scenario, you can know she burned them bad if you find this) or that they won't give you the chance to say your piece if she really hurt them in your name. Emailing gives you the chance to get all your apologies and \"I had nothing to do with this I can't believe she did that what can I do to fix its\" out where they can read it before they respond. Your call. ",

Thanks for reading.\n\nEveryone has already covered how you should deal with the adoptive family, so I won't address that. Regarding your mother and the extended family:\n\nSend yourself the evidence of what she did, just so you have it. You might need it in the future, it's hard to say. If you don't know what to do right now, I would advise not doing *anything* until you're able to get away from her and the family that you're visiting. It's OK to take some time to think about all of this before you confront her. It's OK to just cut her off without confronting her. It's OK to publish the email she sent that family on Facebook if you really want to (though I would personally advise against it). My point is that you don't need to make decisions about anything right now, but obviously, I would advise that you take the time to grieve the fact that your mother is who she is. It's a terrible misfortune to be saddled with a parent like this, and I'm so sorry.",
            "Wow. Your mother is a real .... piece of work. I have more uncharitable words to describe her but thats neither here nor there.\n\nSo first off, you've already moved on from any relationship with the adoptive parents, so technically there's nothing for you to do here. However, two things. First off your mother is tarnishing your reputation. Second, Im sure the adoptive parents would have been quite fine to not hear from you or your mom ever again. Im sure they're quite sincere in wanting to support you keeping involved in your child's life... but as an adoptive child myself whose bio parents remained unknown to me, I could imagine the shock on my adoptive parents if my birth mother (or grandmother) showed up one day, blamed ME and my existance for their shitty lot in life, and demanded money. Thats some gall. The word unmitigated comes to mind. My mom, if she were still alive, would punch that person in the face. Like, I don't even understand how she thinks that should work? What do the adoptive parents owe her OR you? Bonkers.\n\nSo, if I were you I'd get out in front of this one. Use your contacts with the adoptive parents and explain (Not in much detail) the situation, explain this your mom and NOT you, you have nothing to do with this, and that any demands or requests from your mom can and should be safely ignored, or referred to their lawyer. p.s. thanks for giving my child a wonderful life and give them a big hug for me.\n\nThen confront your mom. Explain what you did. \"Were you snooping on my phone?\" \"No, mom. <bioparents> still have my contact info from long ago, they said you reached out to them, they got concerned and reached out to me. Needless to say I was a bit shocked at what they had to tell me. Mom, do not contact them again and stay out of it!\"\n",
            "Yikes, OP. That's truly terrible and inappropriate of your mother. Interesting that she had an email open from August. Makes me wonder how much non-email contact they've had since then, or if she was getting the phone number again. \n\nI agree with the other commenters: get in touch with the family ASAP. Explain the situation openly and honestly.\n\nIt was great of you to help out your mom in her time of need, and great of you to help her find housing. Now she's not only abusing _your_ relationship with her, but the relationship you maintain with your child's family. She's leveraging a fake bad situation with you for her financial gain. Unacceptable. If you're actively staying with your mother now, it may be wise to cut that visit short. If she's willing to go to those lengths, there could be other bad behavior afoot. I'd recommend pulling your credit report to ensure there's nothing else going wrong, at least there.\n\nOnce you're done with your visit and have heard the full story from the family, it's time to calmly, simply explain to your mom what you found, and that you will be not be in touch with her again.",
            "One time, when I was in my early 20's, I had moved to a new area and had a new job.  I had just recently made a few acquaintances but no one I would have called a friend yet.  And that's fine, I'm not really social anyway so that was fine.  But my birthday rolls around and I get a shit ton of texts from the new acquaintances.  I find it kinda weird and mention to my now ex-wife and she tells me that she got numbers from my phone and texted everyone to tell them it was my birthday and to ask them to text.  I understand she wasn't trying to be malicious, but as someone who, as I said isn't too social anyway, I was absolutely mortified.  Totally fucking embarrassed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy point here is that my story is a fraction as mortifying as yours and my head was spinning from that alone.

She doesn\u2019t deserve it and a person like her is incapable of change.\n\nContact the family, apologise and make clear that they should ignore any and all communications from your mother. Be honest; let them know that she is manipulative and you are considering/going to cut contact with her. Let them know that you consider this unforgivable. Give them an email address (set one up especially) that your mother doesn\u2019t know and couldn\u2019t guess the password to. Tell them that if you do contact them, it will be from that email address or via a phone call. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that she\u2019s the mother you got. You don\u2019t owe her a damn thing. Personally, I\u2019d keep copies of those emails so that down the line, if people start pressuring you to be in touch with her again,  you can show them what she did and tell them to back the hell off.",
            "Totally get on front of this. Contact the family, say you have nothing to do with your mother's initiative. Apologize on her behalf and make sure they know never to trust her. Furthermore stress the fact that you don't want her actions getting in the way of any future relationship you and their/your son may have. You're afraid he may think you stuck around for money and that's not the case. \n\nSecond,  call your mother out. Tell her it was extremely disrespectful and out of line.

If that's not an option, gray rock the shit out of her (be boring and give no details), and if she says anything about your living/working situation let her know firmly that she's shown she can't be trusted with that kind of information then continue to gray rock the shit out of her.

He certainly would have been justified in doing so.  But, to me, the fact that he let it progress to exchanging phone numbers demonstrates he is truly concerned for you.  He must be a very kind and generous man.  If any good can come out of this awful situation it must be knowing that the child you gave birth to so many years ago has such a man for a father.

            "A few thoughts come to mind:\n\n1. Forgiveness does not require the other person to be sorry. Forgiveness is for yourself and is a totally personal choice, either way. If you choose to forgive your mother for her past and present poor behaviors and treatment of you, more power to you! It, however, does not mean that you need to maintain a relationship with her, if you so choose. *I have no contact with my own mother but, I do forgive her for her past and how it has impacted my life over the years. It makes me feel better knowing I bear her no ill-will but, I also don't need her in my life - I have a full family, having been raised by my aunt and uncle - and, after years of therapy, I know that my choice is not only valid but reasonable.* If you choose to cut ties with your mother after this incident, you would likely be doing yourself a major favor. You also, might incur the upset of the rest of your family but, ultimately, it is your choice and your choice, alone.\n2. As others have said, if you have not done so already, reach out to the adoptive family and assure them of your lack of knowledge regarding your mother contacting them. If they did send money, I'd offer to pay it back (if you're able to) even if it means in payments; they should not have had to bear the brunt of your mother's financial struggles any more than you should be having to deal with this at all! \n3. I would suggest that you encourage the adoptive family to not have contact with your mother unless Son wants to have contact. That should be his choice.\n4. I hope all the best for you. You sound like you've tried your best to do what's right by everyone. Now it's time to do what's right for you - whatever that looks like. Live well.",

            "Lying to get money & coming up with scams to get money are red flags that your mom may have an addiction.  Recently experiencing major life stressors like health problems, unemployment, homelessness, and the end of a marriage are all also risk factors for developing a substance abuse problem.  They could even be directly related - for example it could be the reason why she lost her job and/or her marriage ended, or she may have become reliant on medications prescribed for the health issues.  People often go to great lengths to deny and hide it when this is the case, so you might or might not get anywhere by asking or confronting her.  But do look for other warning signs, like mood swings, lack of energy, etc - you can easily google lists of warning signs & behavioral red flags.    \n\n\nYou have to confront her about the emails regardless, and I would make sure to ask her \"what led you to do such a thing\" and let her flounder a bit to answer that.  If she says that she really needed money, press her on what she needed it for, and depending how cagey her response to that is, you could directly ask her if she's using to gauge her reaction (eg \"Mom, are you using any drugs? I'm concerned about you\"). ",

I personally would confront your mother and tell her she acted inappropriately. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable reaching out to the adoptive family then by all means don\u2019t! That could open a weird door and I know I have a lot of anxiety surrounding the relationship I have with my daughter\u2019s adoptive family. But if you do have an interest in telling them how your life is really going and to explain your mom stepped out of line then that would be ok too.

            "Good job! You just taught your dad a very valuable lesson. Where your family is concerned, you do not give in to tantrums. I only saw this post so had to go back and read the first one. Proper etiquette?!? He got that one wrong. Actual proper etiquette says that you don\u2019t make other people carry the weight of your past choices, and you either learn to behave like an adult in uncomfortable social situations or you keep your ass at home. ",
            "oh this is a satisfying update. I remember your original post and I was JONESING to hear back from you. You handled his tantrum perfectly!",
            "I\u2019m always amazed at parents who teach children things like \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d or \u201cforgive and forget\u201d and then come up with stuff like \u201cit\u2019s customary to accommodate your parents because they made mistakes years prior and refuse to be the bigger person or forgive and forget.\u201d \n\nGood on you for making your child\u2019s birthday party about your child and prioritizing the comfort of your son above and beyond the expectations of your father. You\u2019re setting the tone for the future of your relationship with your father where he knows he can\u2019t bend you to his will. ",
            "lol your step-mom behaving better than your dad and being a nice non-drama person. glad that it all worked well!",
            "Dad was trying to pull a power move and then came to sulk for a bit when he didn't get his way (by nitpicking about the birthday cake and song). Good on you for not budging! Hopefully he respects you and your decisions more from now on. Maybe step-mom can/has talked some sense into him?",
            "Woo! Glad you stood your ground & that the party went so well! ",
            "This is Mom level 600. Excellent job, op",
            "You're awesome and your kid is lucky to have you as a parent. So glad you stood your ground!",
            "Some adults just act like toddlers and you have to treat them like toddlers. Good job.",
            "Great boundary work! It\u2019s hard work but it gets easier. ",
            "Good for you for going ahead with the party as planned. If he hadn't have shown up, it doesn't sound like it would have been a loss, anyway. Keep setting healthy boundaries with Demanding Daddy. ",
            "\"Way to go, Dad. Make your grandkid's party all about you.\" ugh.\n\nI'm sorry you had to go through this. Your dad sounds like a child. I hope he makes more adult decisions regarding his relationships with you and your son in the future.",
            "Congratulations, Now you know the kind of person your dad is.... I totally agree.\n",
            "\\>  My son even slept through the night which he never does, so win for me. \n\n#parentingwin\n\nOn a separate issue, it sounds like his new wife is a decent human being, which is always helpful.",
            "Good for you! It's not your job to keep him from pouting. The one year old is the only baby you're responsible for! \n\nStepmom sounds like a reasonable person. I bet she told him to stop being a fool and go or miss out on the grandbaby. ",
            "Be proud of yourself. You did a great job managing the situation.",
            "Nice job! He moped outside the entire time? What a baby. You should call him out the next time he lets his adult baggage get in between him and his grandchild. ",
            "I love it, way to be a badass and handle the situation well. ",
            "Sleep training your child seems eerily similar to assertion training your parents. Nice work. ",
