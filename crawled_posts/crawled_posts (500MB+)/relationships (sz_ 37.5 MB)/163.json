        "selftext": "This story begins with my ex, Rick and I. My family and his family are friends and he and I have been close friends since we were children, we attended the same high school and dated from 2007 to 2014. Ultimately our relationship felt like it had run it's course and we split amicably, however having many, many similar friends due to attending the same high school and university, we saw each other quite often even after our break up. Because we share such a large and similar friend group, we have many photos together of not just us alone but with all our friends and even with family. Many of those photos are captured moments of treasured memories that make up a large part of my not so long life.\n\nMy bf, Adrian and I have been together for 14 months, we don't live together but I do visit him at his place and spend nights there. Anyway a couple months ago he borrowed my laptop to fix something for me, when I got it back, that was it, I'm not someone who combs my photos often, in fact the last time I did update the photos on my laptop must have been February. I randomly felt like going through them this past weekend though and found that there were a lot of photos missing, there are photos of my ex and I alone scattered here and there but most of them are friends/family photos with many people, which happened to include my ex.\n\n\nI had probably 3500+ photos and I'm down to maybe 1300 now, over two thousand photos taken over many years, mostly by me are now gone. I understand this is partly my fault because not all the photos were backed up elsewhere, maybe 300 or 400 can be recovered, at best. Naturally I called him to ask what happened to my photos because he was the only other person to have the laptop within the last few months. He said that while fixing my laptop, he found a lot of those photos and was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those. I got pretty angry because those photos weren't just about my ex, they were about everyone over a decent chunk of my life and all the memories of fun events and even random mundane times in my life. Yes my ex is in a LOT of them but we've known each other forever and our families are very close, we'd been together for 1/3 of our lives when we broke up and still saw each other a lot after things ended so obviously he'd be in a lot of those photos. It's not like I saw him in a group photo of 11+ people and would start pining or anything. I told him if he didn't like it he should have approached me and discussed it, not acted without thinking and deleted my photos. Especially since the majority of 'couple' pics of my ex and I are gone. \n\n\nHe says he understands why I'm angry and he did overreact when he deleted the photos but he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this and I do love him but I don't know how to just move past this. He says the photos are in the past and our relationship should be more valuable to me as it's in the 'here and now' as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago.\n\nI should note that he and my ex do see each other from time to time, at family gatherings and I'm friends with his **(Rick's)** cousins and sisters and he's **(Rick)** friends with some of my guy cousins and when we **(Adrian and I)** do hang out in a group with my friends, sometimes my ex is there because well, yeah, we share many similar friends. It's not like we interact a lot or anything but he admitted that since we've been together he's always felt like a large portion of our friends and family don't really like him because they're very fond of my ex. So he's felt insecure for some time and acted without thinking. I told him that my family really likes him and my friends like him as well plus they have known my ex forever so it's natural they may have more affection for him but even so, if he felt that way, he should have discussed it with me.\n\nTL;DR Bf deleted over 2000 photos because my ex was in a lot of them, these photos included friends, family and are from times that are some of my fondest memories, doesn't think I should be angry because our relationship is in the 'here and now' and that's the past",

            "I love how he says he thinks your relationship is powerful enough to overcome this. I actually think that is irony at its finest. If the relationship was so good and he was secure enough with it he would not have destroyed parts of your past. Parts that make up who you are now.\n\nI'm sorry OP to me going through and destroying something of mine with consideration of my feelings for whatever reason is simply not acceptable. I would be gone.",
            "This is highly disconcerting. Your boyfriend disrespected you and your property. I can't even imagine how long it would take him to sort through over 3,000 photos, let alone go about deleting 2,000 of them. This behavior is, at best, controlling and possessive. At worst, it's unbalanced.\n\nAnd then he tells you your \"relationship is powerful enough to overcome this\"!?!!! What in the hell is he on about? Did he apologize at all? Did he even explain why he felt he had *any right* to root through your personal files?",
            "> He says he understands why I'm angry and he did overreact when he deleted the photos but he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this and I do love him but I don't know how to just move past this.\n\nWhat a manipulative little shit.\n\nHe doesn't respect you enough to have a discussion with you. No, he makes the decision for you because of **his stupid insecurities**. He did something he KNEW would hurt you, and he knew you would never agree to.\n\nOP, you should tell this guy to fuck off. You don't need a dude making unilateral decisions he *for you*. You are not a child. He had no right to delete your stuff! He crossed a huge fucking boundary and he's not even sorry. If you stay with him, this asshole will do it again.",
            ">and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those\n\nAnd it's somehow not disrespectful to go through someone else's photos and decide what memories they are allowed to keep? Deleting 2,000 photos is absolutely insane. The time that would take.... \n\n>He says the photos are in the past and our relationship should be more valuable to me as it's in the 'here and now' as opposed to 5 or 10 years ago.\n\nThat past made you who you are. It's not his right to decide anything about your past. \n\nThis completely violation of boundaries, trust and respect would be a deal breaker for me. \n\n",
            "2000? Two thousand?!\n\nThink about how long he had to sit there and delete those pictures. I mean. One picture would be crossing the line, but maybe forgivable. But he deleted 2000 pictures, and if he wasn't deleting pictures where your ex wasn't present, that means he was going through them, one by one. And in all that time, it never occurred to him to TALK TO YOU. Instead he deletes memories if your past because of his insecurities and then has the gall to claim that it shouldn't be important to you.\n\nIf your relationship is so strong, so important to him, then he should have communicated with you. But no, he destroyed your belongings.\n\nYou have every right to be upset, if anything you are underreacting.",
            "This is deeply inappropriate and should be a huge red flag to you. It doesn't matter if the photos were digital, treat this like he burned some of your things. ***He thinks he has the right to unilaterally decide which of your own possessions you're allowed to keep.***  I would *immediately* dump anyone who did this to me.",
            "Your relationship isn't powerful at all if he can't talk to you like an adult about your photos, to understand why you have them and what they mean to you.\n\nNo, instead, he goes behind your back and DELETES YEARS OF YOUR MEMORIES out of insecurity and jealousy. He destroyed belongings of yours to make himself feel better.\n\nThat is not the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with.",
            "2000 photos? Two thousand? Yeah, dump him this second. This is insane. These are memories of your life and he deleted them like they don't matter. I don't know what kind of saint he has to be in other aspects for you to keep trying.",
            "If he was uncomfortable about your ex, he should have spoken to you before he straight up DESTROYED anything (digital or not, that's some straight up destructive behavior). You may be able to recover some of the photos using an undeleter utility given that you haven't already overwritten the space they were occupying. This is a huge boundary breach and you need to declare your space. If he thinks the relationship is \"powerful enough\" for YOU to give him a free pass out of this one, then it should have been \"powerful enough\" for him to overcome his insecurity. If he believes the relationship should be about the \"here and now\", he shouldn't have ever been preoccupied by your ex \"because it's in the past\". What a hypocritical load of bullshit. He can behave like a fucking child and destroy other people's things, but no decent human being gets to BLAME others for their reaction to his own actions. Pretty sure that constitutes abuse: He blames you for \"making him\" do some shitty thing to you, then also blames you for reacting to being treated badly? He needs to grow a pair, take responsibility for what he did, and actually show a genuine effort to try and fix it or he will learn that he can manipulate you into getting away with whatever he wants.\n\nEdit: Spelling",
            "Oh I'm so furious on your behalf, I'm so sorry. \n\nHe would be dumped. Invasion of privacy and wanton destruction of personal property. How dare he.",
            "That would be a deal breaker for me. It is controlling and incredibly disrespectful.",
            "Look in to file recovery software. Unless the files were overwritten, there's a good chance that software can restore the majority of them. The more you use the hard drive the less likely this becomes. If he is truely sorry, he should be willing to pay for the software (or for a professional to do the data recovery) and do what is needed to ensure you have access to a computer between now and when the photos have been restored. \n\nOnce he has made this restitution, you should think long and hard about dumping him. There are all actions he should be suggesting to you without prompting while apologizing. The fact that he isn't and expects that you should forgive him is a huge problem, and indicative that this type of behavior will continue in the future.  ",
            "> was very hurt that I had so many photos of my ex and thought it was disrespectful to our relationship to still have those\n\nsooooo...instead of bringing that to your attention like an adult and talking about it, he spends probably hours pouring over your private photos to delete the ones he finds offensive? Makes total sense.\n\nHe just killed your relationship.  I would not be able to recover from this.  He will never see your line of thinking and will always think he was \"justified\" because he's insecure and jealous.",
            "Recover the photos. Delete the boyfriend.",
            "I'm with everyone else. I usually am the \"work it out\" type but he just crossed a major line and it's only going to escalate. Drop this guy like a hot potato.",
            "His apology bugs me. It just sounds very calculated. Honestly it sounds like his plan was to always do what he wants and to ask for forgiveness later. That would piss me off.",
            "> doesn't think I should be angry because our relationship is in the 'here and now' and that's the past\n\nBelieve it or not, but there is more to life than your relationship with this guy. That he deleted it is incredibly ignorant at best, and a one way ticket to emotional abuse / isolation / codependency more likely. ",
            "Ok, something that not a few people are catching onto is the fact that you have been going out with this guy for 14 months. 14 MONTHS. Think about what that means. Over a year into your relationship and he is still so salty about your ex that he feels the need to delete your photos of him. He hasn't trusted you the whole time you've been together if he's going to pull this stunt at 14 months in. You deserve so much better. If he really believed your relationship was in the 'here and now' he wouldn't be so obsessed with your past. ",
            "As far as I'm concerned, the idea that he deleted any files off your laptop without your permission is a boundary violation. Like, he could've deleted half of your music library because he didn't like your taste in music, and you would be justified in being annoyed.\n\nI mean, this is worse because music files would've been replaceable, but it's also not even just about deleting irreplaceable, sentimental files. It's about... Making decisions about things that aren't his to make decisions about. What you can and can't have. How you should feel about it (ie, just assuming you can move past this). Hiding things from you (waiting until you found out to say anything). It's... It's a bad precedent.",
            "**Stop using the PC right away, power it down.**  \n\nGo to a store (place like Frys electronics)  and get a usb to sata device (they are cheap), rip the hard drive out and hook it to another pc and use something like getdataback. recuvera and so forth.. if you can't recover all the photos with one, do not give up, try another.  \n\nI do this for a living and you would be surprised how recoverable data is, how long has it been since he deleted them?  You maybe able to recover more than you think, if need be PM and I can lead you through it. \n\nOh side note, dump that dude for real.. Thats a crazy, shitty, and abusive thingto do.. you will regret staying with him.",

            "It's not about you not valuing the relationship in the \"here and now.\" It's about him completely ignoring your feelings. He did something that he knew would hurt you just to make himself feel less insecure. His priorities are fucky.",
            "This flag is so red it burns.\n\nFirst, he went through your property and violated your privacy (unless you have him permission to comb through your entire photo library). Second, he let his jealousy and insecurity take over when looking at pictures of you ex. Third, instead of talking to you about this, he decided to unilaterally delete two thirds of your photos. Fourth, he gave you your laptop back and instead of confessing to what he'd done he said nothing for several months. Fifth, when he got caught, he didn't sincerely apologize, but instead tried to turn it around on you and even tried to make himself sound noble by declaring your love was powerful enough to overcome this (this meaning his wanton destruction of your irreplaceable photos). \n\nOP, Adrian is showing you exactly who he is with this series of actions. Ask yourself if you want to be with a person who is so threatened by your past that he eradicated the records of it that made him uncomfortable. He showed no respect or consideration for your feelings or wishes. It was all about him and what he wanted. \n\nDo you really want to be with someone like that? \n\nI wouldn't concentrate on moving past this situation; instead, I'd focus on moving past him. ",
            "I am not one to jump on the \"LEAVE NOW\" bandwagon, but this is a special case. He destroyed your irreplaceable property because it made him jealous and insecure, and he doesn't think it's that big of a deal.  Save yourself the heartache and walk away now before you get in even deeper. ",

I'd take the computer to a data recovery place and present him the bill, see how he reacts. But he's probably history at this point.",
            "This is a screaming red flag for worse controlling behavior. I think this is an absolute deal breaker. He doesn't respect you.",
            "> he thinks our relationship is powerful enough to overcome this\n\nHow lucky for him!",
            "he destroyed your property without your permission.\n\n it was wrong and manipulative.\n\nI would break up with him, OP, because I would no longer trust him with any of my stuff.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Ugh, OP, this would break my heart.  I have absolutely no feelings for any of my exes, but I really treasure all my photos of past events (some of which obviously have exes in them, because that's how life works) and I can't even imagine losing 2/3 of them, especially like this. \n\nFirst things first, do what you can to get back as many pictures as possible.  Take your computer to a professional to see what they can recover rather than trying to do it yourself.  And also send out a mass email to the friends and family who shared those moments with you (or make a public facebook post tagging as many people as you can think of, which will cause it to pop up on other people's newsfeeds as well) telling them that you lost a lot of your photos due to a computer issue and asking them to email you copies of any pictures they have from that time period.  You don't have to say your BF deleted them on purpose, everyone has lost stuff when a computer has crashed so they're not going to question that.  Even if you aren't able to get pictures of all the events or people that are missing, I bet a lot of your friends have their own shots and you'll at least get some photographic memories back.\n\nSecond, make sure you're backing up in the future (a lesson I learned after an actual computer crash caused me to lose a bunch of stuff).  No one is good about manually backing up regularly, so sign up for a cloud based service that backs things up automatically whenever you're connected to the Internet.  Then if you lose stuff, you just download your last backup from their site.  I have Code 42, but there are plenty of options out there.  You have to pay an annual fee but it's not absurd (I think I'm paying somewhere between $50 and $100 per year), and it's worth it to never have to think about it.\n\nThird, deal with the boyfriend.  You're completely right that if he had an issue with the pictures he should have talked to you, and that it was completely over the line for him to just destroy your property (because that's what he did).  It's up to you to decide whether you're willing to work through this, but if you're leaning that way I encourage you to spend some time thinking hard about whether there have been any other warning signs about jealousy or controlling behavior.  Does he ask to go through your phone or snoop without your permission?  Does he get upset if you hang out with male friends or coworkers?  Has he been pushy about not wanting you to spend much time away from him or do things without him?  If this has been the only thing and you want to give things another shot, then I think you need to make clear to him how big a violation of trust this was and that any behavior like this in the future will be a dealbreaker.  He needs to satisfy you that he's sincerely sorry and understands why this was completely inappropriate (not just \"sorry, but we can get past this\"), and he needs to be working on his jealousy issues and his communication.  \n\nLastly, I just want to reassure you:  this IS a big deal, and it's not silly or an overreaction if you want to break up because of it.  The scale of what he did is what would make this impossible for me to get past -- it's not like you just had a folder called \"me and ex\" that he wholesale deleted (which would be bad enough), he went through your computer and manually deleted *2000 pictures*.  It must have taken HOURS to do that.  That's not a split second bad decision, that's 2000 individual decisions that he made without stopping to consider your feelings or the fact that he was massively overreacting and hugely disrespecting you.  His thought process was \"I know these are her pictures on her computer, and obviously she's decided she wants to keep them, but I don't like that she has them so I'm making a unilateral decision to permanently take them away from her.\"  Relationships are built on respect, trust, honesty, and caring for one another's feelings.  He violated all four of those things with what he did here.  It doesn't make him an irredeemably terrible person, but it also doesn't mean you're obligated to get over it and keep dating him.",

She knew it bothered me after a while, but I would never have taken it upon myself to just take them down and dispose of them.

But it's imperative that you do this ASAP, and don't use your laptop any more till then, since anything you do can write additional data to the HD, which can overwrite more of the lost data. That's why you need to do it soon.",

This was a deliberate act that he had plenty of time to think about.  And not only did he destroy your personal property, he ASSUMES you are going to forgive him and had the NERVE to tell you that you're over-reacting.  The kicker is his comment about \"our relationship is strong enough to overcome this\"...an assumption, an admission that he doesn't feel that guilty, and a sick irony because if your relationship was so strong, he wouldn't have felt the need to delete the photos.\n\nThis would be a relationship destroying act, to me.  I would never ever stay with someone who disrespected me, destroyed my property, and took my forgiveness for granted.",
            "Have to agree with a lot of the people here. His actions, to me, speak a lot about his insecurity.\n\nHowever, it could be genuine passion for you that made him act irrationally.\n\nTalk it out. Ask him how it would feel if the roles were reversed, and make sure he understands why it was wrong.\n\nWhen you're ready, forgive him.\n\nEDIT: If he invades your privacy again or doesn't value your property, dump him. It shows no trust in a relationship.",
            "The word controlling comes to mind, and insecure. \n\nMoral of the story? #1 back up your data (especially prior to a repair), and be careful whom you give full access to your hard drive.",
            "The main issue here is that he destroyed your things without your permission. The ex aspect is irrelevant. If he felt uncomfortable about the photos including an ex, then he should have come to you and told you that. If you decided to delete the photos at that point because you knew it made him uncomfortable, then that would have been your mutual decision together. If you decided to keep the photos and just say fuck it, then he could have decided from there how to proceed with the relationship. He could have decided if that was a deal breaker for him. \n\nThat's the way mature relationships work. If you are upset about something, you talk to your partner about it and try to compromise. You don't just go and destroy their things. ",

            "Sheesh, talk about immaturity.  What an over reaction!  My now husband had pic of his wife hanging on the wall in his house because they were family photos.  I *asked* him to take them down because they were getting hard to ignore.  He was going to throw them away, but I talked him into giving them to his adult son.  I would suggest, for future relationships you put these away somewhere out of courtesy. Notice I said future.  This guy is not to be trusted.  What will his reaction be to other things about that he doesn't like?",
            "Think about it. How long did it take him to sift through all your photos and delete 2000 of them? What was he thinking???\n\nThis is crazy, if it were me I would wonder what else he has done if he was so determined to go through all those photos and delete all the ones with your ex.",
            "Firstly he destroyed your treasured memories and posessions.\n\nSecondly he basically tells you to get over it without even apologising.\n\nI understand Adrian's unease and jealousy with your ex since Rick is well-liked by your family but he's still an asshole. He intentionally borrowed the laptop to delete your favourite photos. The boyfriend has to apologise and do everything he can to make amends.",
            "Can you imagine how much time it took him to go through 3500+ photos and start deleting them systematically, over 2000 of them? That's a LONG amount of time. This wasn't a thoughtless act of a moment. This was a major effort, deliberately done. I would never be in a relationship that could recover from this complete disregard for my feelings and property. It doesn't even seem like he's really sorry--his emphasis isn't on atonement for his lies and destruction, it's on emphasizing how right you should be in forgiving him, and how reasonable it was of him to do this--he's insecure, because of the actions of you and your family and friends. See how he turns the blame around away from himself? \n\nAnd he still doesn't really understand how wrong he was. Jealousy is destructive and abusive. He's accusing YOU of being disrespectful of your relationship by keeping photos of your adolescence. The level of disrespect he has shown you is colossal. Not only destroying your property, but not telling you about it for months. He's a liar and a deceiver. I could never trust him again. This is serious emotional abuse.",
            "This is something I find really hard because I think about how I'd react if it was my relationship.\n\nThere's no question I wouldn't accept it. I think it would tell me my SO is too insecure and needs to grow up. I wouldn't wait around for this to happen.\n\nThe thing that makes me feel shit is that if I did what Adrian did my girlfriend would probably forgive me.\n\nI don't think I'm very forgiving, something about me is very cold and I feel like I don't have to let weak people into my life and what Adrian did was piss weak.\n\nUltimately it's your call and you know him better than any of us.",
            "I don't know. I would probably be pissed if my boyfriend still had thousands of pictures of his x on his computer also. I probably wouldn't have deleted the ones with other family members in them. Maybe just photoshopped my face on hers.\n\nHa. In all seriousness though it took quite a bit of effort to go through THOUSANDS of pictures. I could see why he would be upset by it but he should have brought it up with you first before deleting massive amounts of pictures like that. That shit probably took hours. You both need to have a serious talk about it, but you also need to make it perfectly clear to him that there are absolutely no feelings toward your ex beyond a friendship level. It's a tricky situation and you're likely to deal with this issue a lot with future partners as well. It's  enough to raise insecurity in the most confident of significant others. Just understand that the issue is bigger than the pictures here.",

He kind of tried to erase the bits of your past that weren't about him, he did it behind your back.\n\nAnd that it was \"disrespectful\" for you to still have them? WTF? Like if you were ~properly respectful~ you'd have removed all evidence that you were an independent person with an entire life before he met him. Maybe you should have pulled an Aphrodite,  bathed in the sea at Paphos.\n\nMaybe it was just one stupid mistake from him, but I would not be able to forgive someone who'd done that to me.

Adrian's a POS for acting that way and it was not your fault at all.  He's insecure and immature. And no... don't fall for the bullshit of the relationship being strong enough to work through it.  He'll continue to do this again in a lot of other situations.\n\nThis is just the start of his manipulation and guilt trip if you decide to stay with him.  By doing so, you're enabling his insecurities and allowing him to control you.\n\nLook forward to an update!",

I'm sure it was devastating to lose them, but she still has her memories and can probably recover (some) copies from friends since we all live in the digital age. But objectively, the photos are only a symptom of the real problem - which is BF's jealousy, insecurity, and manipulative behavior.\n\nThis isn't going to go away unless OP drastically changes her life, which she shouldnt do.",

            "It seems to me that you already realize that your boyfriend deleting the photos is just a symptom of a bigger problem.  Your boyfriend is jealous.  And now for the unpopular reddit opinion: he has the right to be.  Should he have deleted your photos?  No.  He should have absolutely just asked you about them, and expressed his insecurities.\n\nBut he didn't.  And I get the feeling what you're really looking for here isn't so much whether what he did was right or wrong, but \"now what?\"  Even though you have explained he has nothing to worry about, that's not going to solve the problem overnight.  He's not going to wake up tomorrow and suddenly be totally secure in your relationship and trust you 100%.  Overcoming insecurity and jealousy in a relationship takes work from *both* sides, not \"Nothing is going on.  Just get over it.\"\n\n**EDIT: Do the following IF you want to continue the relationship.  You still have the right to decide whether or not his actions are a dealbreaker for you.** So if he is willing to work on himself, then find out what he needs from you.  Listen to what he suggests and if it's something you can work with, then commit to it and go from there.  If you feel he's asking too much, then try to reach a compromise you're both comfortable with.  But be mindful there is always the possibility that he may ask you to cut your ex out of your life.  If that's not something you're willing to do, and he won't budge, then neither of you are going to be happy.  Now that he has voiced his concerns, there is room for a lot of resentment to build up in the sense that \"I told you I didn't like x, y, and z, but you're still doing it\".  That's never going to end well or make for a healthy and happy relationship.  \n\nHope this helps a little.",

People have lives before they come in to yours and I honestly think any person who cannot deal with that is slightly unstable. \n\nThe worst of this is that it's so sneaky. He's kept this quiet for months just silently gloating that this \"problem\" has been taken care of. If he's that much of a weasel then maybe his fear about your family not liking him is a substantial one. \n\nI would really question where you want to go with this. Is he going to destroy your possesions when he finds out that your ex touched some of it? Will he unthread the family tree tapestry in your parents house because your mum accidentally called him the wrong name?

When my wife and I got together around your age, one of the things we discussed up front was that our memories are important to us, and the pictures and items we collected from previous relationships were never to be asked to be discarded by the other person.  \n\nWanting to pretend a person had no good or intimate moments prior to you coming along is a sign of extraordinary insecurity and immaturity.  It was also an enormous breach of your trust...if you can't trust him to not try to write people from your past that make him uncomfortable, how can you trust him to not take it further and remove people over time from your current life.  Most people don't recognize how manipulative and controlling their partners are until after the relationship has ended.  I can tell you from experience though that what he did is a big sign that many people overlook of a controlling personality.  ",

Remember, no one is perfect and plenty of people act in bad ways but are still overall good people. If we dumped every person who made mistake we would all be in temporary relationships.

            "Your BF is jealous and insecure and totally was out of line deleting the pictures but I'll play a little devil's advocate here.\n\nPeople like to harp on what a dealbreaker it is for OP's boyfriend to be doing this. However, dating someone who can't get over their ex and integrates them into their life is a dealbreaker for many people as well. You think your boyfriend doesn't realize how close your family and his family are? You don't think it doesn't bother him he constantly has to see him at family functions but keep his feelings to himself to not look weird or controlling? You don't think he constantly feels like he's in some sort of weird competition with OP's ex over her family's seal of approval?\n\n>he's always felt like a large portion of our friends and family don't really like him because they're very fond of my ex\n\nThis just solidifies what he constantly feels about you and your ex. He'll always play second fiddle to your ex as long as he's around. The fact that you two broke off amicably probably makes OP's BF think the both of you are biding your time until your paths align again. Basically OP, you're not shitting and not getting off the pot and your SO is just a placeholder.\n\nI saw a post here the other day about some dude who got ghosted because he told the girl he was dating that *she looked like* his ex. He was told by r/Relationships to never bring up exes, be as short as possible when discussing them, etc. Now in this situation everyone is telling OP's BF to get over it and stop acting immature. \n\nI think the both of you should break up. He could use some work on his insecurities, immaturity issues and communication. OP could use some time to finally get over her ex instead of expecting her future SO's to be okay with how hip and progressive her relationship with her ex is. The fact that she's moping around over 3500 pics of her ex is laughable. That's borderline obsessive. We all have a little box of mementos from our past relationships but well adjusted people don't keep their exes around and try to force their new partners to play house like this is something normal. Furthermore, they don't need 3500 photos of their ex to scroll through reminiscing about halcyon days with a tear in their eye. ",

Does he not know how important and meaningful those relationships can be? Has he never experienced caring for another person? \n\n4. That is a controlling thing to do. He decided to do this, he knew it would hurt, and if you let him get away with it he will do worse in the future. \n\n**5. When you dump him, please post an update. You sound cool and I am looking forward to hearing about your upcoming badass take down of this waste of skin. It's gonna be awesome, you're going to rock it, and then you're going to have a great time hanging out with your friends (ex included), taking new picture and making new memories**"

Also stablish that you look forward to working with him and maintaining business relations, but that's all (If you want to go that in depth, though I like to keep it as simple as possible ).The truth is, boundaries hurt people's feelings, but are healthier than manipulation or lying. If he's sexist and makes rude comments, he's the type that probably needs firm boundaries, not excuses, lies, or whatever, because he'll try to find a way around it eventually, and you'll end up back where you were.

He probably is hoping it can turn into flirting if he wants it so badly he\u2019s waiting.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s waiting for you to be done work so he can force you into spending time with him is itself a problem that could be taken to HR, but only if you clearly set the boundary and he breaks it. Otherwise he\u2019ll just claim he thought it was mutual (well he\u2019ll claim that either way, but this way you\u2019ll know for a fact it\u2019s BS). A man waiting outside a woman\u2019s workplace to follow her most of the way home? Yikes. Even if he\u2019s not finding your address, he wants a captive audience. I honestly wonder if he even lives where he claims he lives, or if he\u2019s staying on the transit longer to have a captive audience.\n\nEdit: the patronizing makes me think \u2018crush\u2019 even more. He\u2019s trying to impress you. Also some sexist men just cannot see women as friends, and use \u2018friendship\u2019 only as an excuse for her to feel she has to talk to him, so he can try for a relationship. Bring up your boyfriend or make up a fake new boyfriend and I bet he won\u2019t react well. \n\nAsk yourself if he\u2019d stay so long every day to talk to a male colleague who he has no chemistry with.

These are the comments that he is comfortable telling you, a woman whose company he clearly cares about if he\u2019s waiting to go home with you, and who he probably has a crush on. If he\u2019s routinely saying things that hint at sexism to you, I guarantee there\u2019s some stuff he thinks or says to other men that\u2019s far worse that he\u2019s decided not to share with you yet because he knows it will push you away.\n\n(Depending on your HR department) You could say \u2018hey it makes me uncomfortable when you wait for me\u2019 and then if he continues, you have something to bring to HR. You could do a mix and say \u2018I need my quiet time after work, it makes me uncomfortable when someone stays late for me.\u2019 The word \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 can be good for getting HR to listen.\n\nYou could also ask another colleague, who you trust, to hang around. See if this guy\u2019s insistence and the tactics he use suddenly change when there\u2019s another person there. Could he he thought you wanted a friend and you\u2019re shutting him out, but really, most people would\u2019ve figured that out by now because of your excuses and because there\u2019s zero chemistry when you talk.

        "selftext": "OK so I\u2019ve (27f) been dating this guy (26) for over six months and I really, really like him. He\u2019s honestly the most mature and kind hearted guy I\u2019ve ever been with and I do love him. He lives with his eight year old sister who he parents and cares for, and I made a post about this before, but he tried to introduce her to me. She seemed ok with me at first but then one day she randomly bit me, so we decided to keep some distance between her and I. He never told me their story, but today we were sitting down together and he mentioned he finally felt ready.\n\nSo the reason why he parents her is because their parents are no longer alive. He didn\u2019t get too into detail here but his mom had a history of really bad mental health problems and it sounded like she murdered his dad and then killed herself while his younger sister was in the house (who was 6 at the time). Afterwards he took emergency custody of his sister to prevent her from going into the foster system and he said she hasn\u2019t at all talked to him about that night since. He told me she does have a child psychologist and therapist who she sees regularly and she\u2019s on medication (and so is he). He also mentioned that she has REALLY severely bad abandonment issues and even told me this genuinely heartbreaking story of one time he was late picking her up from school and when he got there she was uncontrollably crying her eyes out. He told me that he wanted to introduce me to her because she doesn\u2019t have a prominent female figure in her life and he was hoping to change that, but in hindsight doing so so early on in the relationship was probably a mistake since he can\u2019t imagine how threatened she feels by my presence or how scared she is that I might take him from her. He even started to cry at one point and told me that she is the best part of his life and the joy of his world and \u201cwould rather chew off his dick than leave her.\u201d \n\nI kept reiterating that I\u2019m here for him and love him, but I didn\u2019t know what to do other than that. It seems like the two of them have been through a lot of pain and I have no idea what I can do to help or even if there\u2019s anything I can do.\n\nIs there anything I could do at this point?\n\ntl;dr: my boyfriend opened up about his painful past with and why he lives with and parents his eight year old sister and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.",

            "This is kind of like the whole idea behind empathy. You must be aware that you cannot fix this for him or necessarily change his life for the better. But you can listen, offer support, condolences, love, and help when you can. Just listening and validating what he is going through is your goal. Offer practical help as needed. If the sister is 8, and this happened when she was 6, then this is VERY recent. Things are acute rn. If you decide to stick with him, then I would suggest getting some therapy yourself if you start to struggle with the weight of their grief.",
            "I have to applaud your self-awareness.  This is a perfect example of something that is above just about anyone's pay grade.  Recognizing that rather than trying to fumble blindly onwards is a good sign.\n\nFirst up, talk to him about what you can do, or not do, to help.  Be aware that wanting to help is a lovely example or compassion, but there may not be much you *can* do.  They have to wrestle down their own demons.  You may need to learn some coping techniques to keep a bit of emotional distance in the face of all this. \n\nAsk him what his vision for the future is and what that means for you as a couple such as moving, careers, house, kids etc.  Talk to him about what the therapist has said about his sister's attachment issues.  Find out what her daily routine and treatment is and what that means for you and him.  Ask about how he's dealing, what his goals are etc.  In essence, talk it out to exhaustion.\n\nWhen you have a better picture of the situation, then you can start making decisions.  Perhaps find a therapist of your own to unpack this.  Don't forget to do a bit of research into trauma, whatever mental health issues the mother had and perhaps ways of integrating into a family who suffers from trauma.\n\nAlso be aware that taking your time is key here.  This gives you time to process and figure out if this is something you're willing or able to sign up for.  It gives the sister time to get to know and hopefully trust you.  Your boyfriend also needs time to work out how to balance his sisters needs, with yours as a couple.  Wait at least year before you make any big decisions.\n\nBeyond that, take a breath and don't forget self-care.  As you said, this is a lot to take in.  You need to be in the best possible place to decide what you want and how to achieve that.",
            "So this happened 18 months before you met? \n\nThats VERY recent no wonder she is acting out, not a psychologist but I imagine your female parent killing your male parent might leave lasting effects when it comes to your surrogate male parent meeting a woman\n\nI don\u2019t think you *can* do anything but be there for him & maybe she will see you\u2019re a positive influence",
            "There isnt anything you can do to help. There's nothing anyone can do to help, honestly. \n\nJust continue being you and try to live a happy life with him, and try and be patient and understanding if he ever has issues because of the grief and trauma. But it sounds like he is doing what he can with therapy, and he clearly trusts you enough to open up.",
            "Is he in counselling? If so, maybe see if the therapist will see you too with him? I'm not sure.... I'm sorry. He obviously loves and trusts you...",
            "You can provide comfort, that's about it. The grief he carries is enormous and it will manifest itself someday, someway. But better to leave that stone unturned until he decides to turn it over himself.",
            "Oh man. My heart goes out to them and you. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely above your and our pay grade BUT the best thing you can do is NOTHING. \n\nBy that I mean just be with him and let him lead the way in terms of vulnerability and involvement. He has a lot to unpack and process. He may not be able to have a relationship long term if he suddenly gets hit with serious flashbacks or emotional trauma. \n\nJust love him and be supportive in ways that are healthy for him. Also keep an eye on your mental health, these situations can easily affect you so stay stable and aware while having compassion.",
            "You can't rescue anyone in this. There will not be a fairy tale where your love for him and potentially her eventually as you get to know her conquers and heals all.  So you need to be cautious to not idealize him or get swept up in pity. \n\nThere are going to be serious issues that will impact your life if you continue.  So use this get to know you time to educate yourself on trauma informed care (not because you will be a caregiver for his sister during this time but because you need to understand her needs and also be aware of what behaviors you are likely to face.)  It would be a great idea to read up on trauma in general, because as you have noticed he is also dealing with it.  This is not to help you fix him but just so that you can understand what you will likely see and also some of the long term impacts on him.  Sometimes it can be helpful in supporting someone when you understand at least on an academic level what's going on.\n\nThe other thing that is so very important is that you also use this time to really pay attention to how you are feeling during this process.  That you give yourself permission to decide that its okay if its too much.  Maybe it won't be, but maybe it will.  A lot of people get sucked into feeling trapped (even though the other person doesn't demand anything) because they don't want to be seen as the \"bad guy\" who leaves the injured person. We attach a lot of power romantic stuff to being the ever supportive partner/love conquers all, but the reality is that it is understandable and okay for you to decide that it really is above your pay grade.  Don't be so worried about healing him that you lose track of whether or not as you get to know how the dynamic is shaping that you're going to lose or break yourself.  Because that won't be good for this child or your bf either.\n\nSo I would not romanticize or catastrophize this. That's a hell of a lot of new info to take in and all of it totally out of your control.  So don't skip over it. Digest it.  Ask questions when you are ready.  Its okay to be honest and share your feelings about your relationship with him (and that will need to happen in any relationship, you can't suppress it because you think you shouldn't burden him, if he's choosing to pursue a relationship then he's signing up for communication as a couple even when its hard now and then).  Its good he realized his mistake and owned it as being his mistake not yours, and he's let you know honestly his sister will always be first priority!  It does mean despite all that's happened and you both being so young clearly he does have impressive chops when it comes to communication and that's very promising.",

            "So this is going to sound very harsh but I think it needs to be said. Your boyfriend seems like a good person in a very tough situation. That means for him, sister first, household/job second, self third and socializing last. \n\nHis sister should to large extent dictate your relationship, for example, if she doesn't want you to live together you and him should respect that. If you have a vacation planned and she needs him, you'll have to cancel it.\n\nI think you need to do some very hard thinking about what you can accept. If you can't cheerfully come last til she's 18, leave him.",
            "If you feel like there are some gaps in your understanding of complex PTSD and trauma, reading some books like The Body Keeps the Score, What My Bones Know, The Deepest Well, and What Happened to You? could be really helpful. \n\nI would say trusting your partner\u2019s expertise of where his sister is at and viewing everything she does through a lens of radical empathy will be key. It must have taken so much for your boyfriend to share that! When a friend shares something really vulnerable with me, I try to say something like \u201cthank you so much for trusting me with your story.\u201d\n\nI attended a lecture on childhood trauma and asked an expert how to navigate working with children in foster care, specifically possible joy that they\u2019re being adopted by a loving family while also mourning the permanent severing of their relationship with their biological parents. He said we as adults have a really hard time sitting with that tension. Both things can be true: this little girl can feel happiness that her brother has a new person in his life who loves him, but also feel terrified that there won\u2019t be enough love for her. \n\nTo take this on, he\u2019s a really good dude. Keep us posted!",
            "As someone who has some, um, extreme childhood trauma: you cannot fix anything for them. You can, however, be loving and empathetic to your boyfriend, believe him about his traumas, be supportive of him getting care for himself and for his sister, and you can listen. Listening itself can be huge.\n\nBeing a loving person who\u2019s thoughtful and empathetic can be radical for someone with severe childhood trauma. My partner and both had really \u201ccomplicated\u201d childhoods and families, and I think besides loving and supporting each other, the biggest thing we do for each other is listen, trust, and believe. We make space for each other to process things as they come up - and the more safe and secure a person feels in their life and their relationships, the more memories of trauma burble up and demand processing. For all the f**kery in our past, my partner and I are almost unrealistically happy together. It\u2019s beyond belief, for both of us. And it\u2019s because we hold space for each other and work hard on ourselves and our communication.\n\nAnother thing to remember: one\u2019s trauma and one\u2019s mental health are not one\u2019s fault, but they are one\u2019s responsibility. We should try to not bleed on those who didn\u2019t cut us. Part of showing up for someone with extreme trauma is knowing and holding your own boundaries, and being clear on when someone\u2019s asking more of you than you can give. That\u2019s important for you. Their trauma is big, but your happiness and safety is just as important as theirs.",

            "As a trauma victim myself, I can offer you some insight as to what the sister is experiencing. From your perspective, she\u2019s going to need a lot of understanding and patience. Know that her road to recovery will be lifelong and may even be tasking. She may have some developmental setbacks (hence the biting) but that could also be learned behavior since we don\u2019t know what she saw/heard/experienced while living with her mother. Her abandonment issues will only increase if you are introduced too early as you mentioned, especially if marriage isn\u2019t yet a question (or a lifelong commitment). I get that the brother (who by the way is a phenomenal human being) wants to introduce a woman role model but it may not be the time yet to do so, depending on your relationship goals. As I said, support her and be a positive influence for her. She is young enough that she will attach early and can reverse some of the damage brought on by her trauma under the right circumstances. Showing her lots of love, affection, understanding, patience, and empathy will help her heal.",

Play some board games. Keep her involved with you guys. You could help her with her homework, just small things. When she gets a little more comfortable start going out of the house. You guys can take her to the park, or out to do something fun. Just make sure she knows that she is included in your guys life together.

            "Seriously, just listening and trying to understand. Validation. I recently opened up to my brothers about trauma that happened almost 30 years ago. I can not express to you the relief I felt just finally being understood. We haven't talked about it since and I don't feel a need to with them, although I do still go to therapy. But just knowing they know now, they care, they understand... for me that was huge\n\nEdit to add: I wouldn't discount him due to this trauma. He sounds like an amazing guy. Maturity is a huge plus for any guy in my book. It sucks why he is so mature, definitely had to grow up fast with that past. But to also not only be willing to care for his sister, but wants to is so amazing. That level of loyalty is to be commended, and I can only assume would extend to his SO. I came from a very traumatizing childhood. I met my husband in an odd way, it was long distance. I actually got married a day before my 18th birthday (not pregnant, because of travel times with the long distance thing). Long story short we l had to work through alot but we've been married for 18 years",
            "That is a lot.\n\nThe good news is you don\u2019t have to fix things. Like a lot of other people have said, you just have to listen and validate. Getting your own support would be wise. This will be a long, long journey, and it\u2019ll be hard to say what\u2019s coming next.\n\nI think that while biting you is violent, it isn\u2019t necessarily a mark of the sister\u2019s character. She\u2019s threatened and may not have a lot of communication skills. It really depends on how you feel about it and what you observed - was it deep, did it require bandages afterward, what was her reaction afterwards. Is this something you can handle possibly happening again? What\u2019s the plan if it does? \n\nIt seems like their biggest fear is being separated, and if you want to stick with it you need to demonstrate that you aren\u2019t a threat to that. Maybe take them out minigolfing? It\u2019s clear to me that anyone in your boyfriend\u2019s life will need to be able to deal with his sister peaceably. If you can make friends, that would be ideal; but allies is also good. \n\nI suspect that dating you may take your boyfriend away from the sister - he has to find a babysitter! - which may just make you a threat for a while. You might be fitting really cleanly into the role of their mom for her, which is not something you can help or fix. It\u2019ll just take time and therapy .",

It has only been 2 years since it happened and she's in her formative years. All of this is on her and her time and efforts of the medical help. Just give it time, be consistent about your efforts.\n\nAlso it's possible she had a deep hatred for older women considering what happened.",
            "I think a major thing about this is that your pace with him will have to be super slow. I also think that for his sisters best interests, it might not be a good idea to change her home situation in any way, so things like you moving in or even staying at his place might cause her too much distress.  Right now she is not at the age where she can really process her feelings logically or critically, and it will take into her mid teens at least to start to address some of the issues she is facing.\n\nThis might have an implication on your relationship as things like getting married and or having kids will bring a lot of turmoil and instability to the house. \n\nI just want you to be prepared for what might happen in the future.",
            "Sounds like continuing to be there for both of them, if u can handle it, would be best. Sounds like two traumatized people and i dont see much issue beyond the kid biting you once. Lots of kids bite, im sure she will outgrow it haha",
            "Just be there for them. She will eventually begin to open up over time, but shes got a lot to unpack and recover from. Dont pressure, rush, or force, just be there. Be soft, gentle, and supportive at a distance. When shes ready, she will come to you. \n\nHe's taken the above and beyond supplying a parental role to a child who isnt even his, especially when he's got his own recovery and lack of experience. That's fucking badass. To top it, hes not forcing you or trauma dumping you into being a part of it, hes just telling you the situation. Youve taken to it well, considering.\n\nSo as for what you can do, just be there. You dont have to play counselor or therapist, or mom. Just be there. Recovery takes time, longer than 2 years depending. People recover better adapting to their own beat with a little professional guidance.

When we met, he introduced me to her after just about a month. I found out quickly that she was being abused by her bio-mom (physically and mentally) and that she was around drugs often. Her mother was very neglectful. I felt very protective of her and suggested that he get custody of her. He didn't have any financial resources to do that so after doing some research, we learned he could do an emergency injunction. Long story short, it took its toll on our relationship. She needed things he didn't have and couldn't provide. Her issues were very much above our pay grade, and even though we did our best to raise her, she ended up running away a couple of times, the school counselor was at a loss, the therapists were not effective, and she ended up inadvertently hurting her siblings that we eventually had. \nIt's a lot to take on at such a young age. Her own grandparents weren't fighting for her when she was still with her mom. They told me not to do it. But this child needed a mom, and I loved her Dad. I wouldn't change a thing, honestly.

            "Random Licensed Professional Counselor on reddit  here.\n\nAs others have pointed out, his trauma isn't in your control or your job to fix. And understandably, you're really concerned about your role in all this.\n\nAdmittedly, the relationship isn't that old. But think about it: if he hadn't told you, would you have broken up with him or thought you would have eventually ended the relationship? If the answer to that question is no, then the only reason you're feeling uncertain now is because of the massive amounts of pressure you're putting on yourself now. So why would you be thinking about ending things now? Simply out of a fear you have in your head over something that hasn't happened yet? \n\nHis sister would have these issues with any other woman dating your boyfriend. Not just you. It's going to happen no matter what or who it is. That's just one of those things that's out of your control unfortunately. \n\nOne thing that you can be grateful for is that you're the one dating your partner and not some unhealthy woman who is completely unkind and uncaring (and it's completely obvious that you do care and have a heart, otherwise you wouldn't be thinking the way you did). If it had been an unkind, unsympathetic, unempathetic person dating your boyfriend, the outcome would be even worse for the girl.\n\nBut again, her trauma is not your responsibility. \n\nYou have a good head on your shoulders and a good heart in your chest though. So have faith in those strengths of yours. \n\nIt's natural and normal to open up to people about your past to people you care about. He's probably sharing his past because he thinks you need to know it at some point. Which, let's be honest, you did at some point and you were going to find out one way or another.\n\nThat being said, you're not obligated to stay in a relationship with anyone regardless of what they've been through. You can decide to leave for any reason even if it's just because you don't feel romantic attraction or love for the person. Even if they did absolutely nothing wrong to you, you can still walk away from the relationship. Although, if that ends up being the case, I would recommend that you did it respectfully and honestly so that you can maintain some semblance of respect for one another in the event that happens. \n\nThat being said, from the context you've provided so far, I can only gather that you do care about and respect this person. I don't think it's healthy for you to be putting all this pressure on your shoulders. It's not your job to change him or to be a role model for his sister. Not unless you want to be. It's understandable to be freaked out over the idea of it. My recommendation would be to talk to him about your feelings openly and honestly. And, if it's something that's really bothering you that you don't feel like you can get over, sign up for a therapy session yourself. It would probably help tremendously.\n\nI highly recommend just trying to live in the moment as much as you can without putting so many expectations on yourself. It's not fair to you. It seems like the first 6 months of this relationship were really good and happy for you, and I would want that to continue if it was a healthy relationship. You can't always control the future, but you certainly have control over some things and you can always exit the relationship whenever you want to. But if you're happy, and the only reason you're unhappy is because you found out about something you were eventually going to find out anyway \"too soon\", why would you want to potentially throw a good thing away when it didn't need to be thrown away?\n\nRemember, we live in a society that dictates so many strange rules for us and those around us. But each and every relationship is unique. Although you or other people might believe there are certain \"rules\" to abide by or follow, sometimes following these rules conventionally can be unhealthy or destroy an otherwise normal relationship. One of those rules involves how serious things \"should\" get over time. \n\nYou get to write the rules of your relationship and decide which rules you want to follow. If this is too much, it's too much. But if you don't want it to be too Much for 6 months in, it doesn't have to be. You and your partner are the ones that get to collaboratively write these rules. Fuck what anybody else thinks you should or shouldn't do. This is YOUR relationship. Ultimately, you're the one that has to make the decision about what you want and don't want. Me personally? I'd make sure I'd make every in-the-moment choice to ensure that, whatever happens, I have no regrets. But everybody's different. You gotta do you.\n\nAll's you need to do is just be yourself and do what you'd normally do. Nothing more, nothing less.",

My friend wouldn't even consider visiting her mom in prison until she told the truth, so didn't see her mom for over 10 years (she's in for life without parole). \n\nThis will always be a part of your boyfriend and his sister's life and their story. Are you okay with it being part of yours? If you are, then stay. Listen. Empathize. Love him, and her, with all your might. Know that you can't fix it. Just love them through it.",
            "That's a lot to unload, first of all you have to realize that there's nothing you can do to change/fix the situation. Second of all you need to decide if this is the relationship for you because if it's not then you're doing nobody (not you or them) any favors by sticking around to \"help\". \n\nIf you think it's the relationship you want to be in and you plan to stay with him/them, then you need to realize there's nothing you can do to help or fix the situation. You can potentially improve it, but only by being a very reliable person to them both (they're a package deal). \nYou probably also would need to seek counseling entering into this arrangement so that you can keep your head on straight and better know your role. You possibly could end up being a mother figure, or a big sister figure, or even a friend. Which role you take on needs to be okay with all three of you. Overstepping could be a big issue in the dynamic of the relationship you have with them both. Keeping a good dynamic might be a difficult balancing act.",
            "Basically, don\u2019t do anything that sounds like \u201cchoose me over your sister\u201d or \u201cforce her to accept me as a family member\u201d. Be patient, accept that stuff with his sister might be hard. Basically, don\u2019t be another stressor for him, don\u2019t push her to accept you as part of her life.",
            "I'd nope the F out so fast. I'm sorry but no way.",
            "That little girl may be terrified of adult females. It is doubtful the mudder/sewer slide of their parents was the first or only act of instability in their home. And since in this final act, it was the mother committing the violence,  it would not be a stretch to imagine mom might have been mentally ill and irratic preceding that, perhaps even towards her. Her time living with her brother has probably been the most stable, even happy, time of her short life. \n\nIf you want to be part of his life, take it slow. Maybe even get a counselor involved with navigating these choppy waters. If you don't see this as a possible long-term relationship, you might consider bowing out. If you think he's the one, know they are a package deal and it's not going to be easy.",
            "The title makes you seem like a B.",
            "So her female caregiver was mentally ill and likely abusive\u2026she is going to need a ton of therapy and if you\u2019re gonna be his partner you\u2019ll likely need to participate in it"

        "selftext": "His Tinder profile said he was 45, but he looked to be in his early thirties at most. \n\n*Looking for a sugar baby. $700 weekly. No sex.* \n\nIt sounded too good to be true, but, as a broke university student, I was willing to take my chances. I swiped right, and Tinder let me know it was a match. His message came seconds later. \n\n**Hey, there sweetheart :)**\n\nI cringed at that word, I hated it, but seven hundred dollars was seven hundred dollars, so I sucked it up and replied. \n\n**Hey ;)** \n\nHis name was Jack, and he told me he owned his own business, although he never specified what kind of business it was. We talked for a while before he asked me for my Venmo to send me the first payment. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I got the notification. I stared at the $700 for at least twenty minutes, expecting to wake up from a dream at any second. But it wasn\u2019t a dream. \n\n**You still there?** \n\nI clicked on the message. \n\n**Yeah. Sorry. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are you looking for in return?** \n\nI stared at the chat until he replied. \n\n**I\u2019m just looking for you to do a few favors for me :)**\n\nThat sounded like it was going to be sexual to me. \n\n**Like what?**\n\n**For example, the first thing I need you to do is pick up a delivery for me.** \n\nThat sounded innocent enough, but I was still expecting there to be some kind of twist. Seven-hundred dollars to pick up a package? Come on, even I wasn\u2019t that naive. \n\n**From the post office or something?** \n\n**No.  I\u2019ll send you the address, but I\u2019d rather not do this through Tinder. You got Kik? Or you can give me your number.**\n\nKik? What was this, 2011? I decided to give him my number instead, and he texted me the address immediately, followed by the address to his house, where I would have to drop off the package. \n\n**I\u2019m not home right now, but there\u2019s a key on the bottom of the blue flower pot near the door. Go inside and put the package on the coffee table in the living room. Make sure that you lock the door when you go inside the house, and then lock it again when you leave.** \n\nI grabbed my car keys and wallet and got into my car, putting the address into Google maps. \n\n**Got it! Omw.** \n\nMy phone buzzed as I backed out of my driveway. \n\n**I\u2019m serious. Lock the door BOTH times. Please.** \n\nI thought that was a little excessive, but I promised him that I would. \n\nThe house looked abandoned. It had a broken chain link fence around it, with a small door that was hanging onto dear life. It stuck out like a sore thumb, surrounded by houses that were a lot nicer than this one in comparison. \n\n\u201cYou here for Jack\u2019s shit?\u201d\n\nI looked up to see a man standing in the open doorway of the house. He took up almost the entire space, his head skimming the top of the door frame. He was huge; in height and muscles, and his entire torso was covered in tattoos. \n\n\u201cUh, yeah. I guess.\u201d I replied, not moving from my spot on the sidewalk. \n\n\u201cStay right there.\u201d He said. \n\nI did. I actually don\u2019t think I would have moved if he had asked me to. I looked around and realized that there was no one else on this street. I was a twenty-one-year-old woman alone in the street. I gripped my car keys. \n\nA few minutes later, the man came back out carrying a cardboard box. It was about the size of a shoebox, but stained and damp on some of the corners. \n\n\u201cCan you open your car?\u201d He asked. \n\nI opened the trunk, not wanting that inside on my car seats and he set it in. \n\n\u201cAlright, there you go.\u201d He said. \n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d I replied. \n\nI walked around to the driver's side of the car and opened the door. \n\n\u201cOh, and one more thing!\u201d He said. \n\nI looked at him. \n\n\u201cWatch out.\u201d He said. \n\nI didn\u2019t reply. \n\nI blasted my music as I drove to Jack\u2019s house, hoping it would drown out my anxiety. It didn\u2019t. \n\nI parked my car in the stone driveway and stayed inside the car, admiring the house. \n\nIt was a *huge* house; with stone pillars on the front porch, and the greenest grass I had ever seen in my life. I turned the car off and got out. I grabbed the package, and walked to the front door, getting the key from where he said it would be. \n\nI opened the door and stepped in, closing it behind me. \n\nI thought about what he had said, about locking the door when I got inside. I thought that was a little overboard, but as I stared at the closed door something made me reach out and lock it. \n\nI walked inside, my feet cushioned by the thick maroon carpet, and admired the inside of the house. All the furniture was wooden and looked incredibly expensive. I would probably finish school a dozen times with the money that it took to furnish this place. \n\nI set the package down on the coffee table, and as I walked back to the door, I heard a phone ringing from somewhere inside the house. I froze. \n\nIn my pocket, my phone buzzed. I took it out to look. \n\n**Don\u2019t answer any calls that aren\u2019t from Marvin.** \n\nI put my phone back and followed the sound of the phone, poking my head into a few different rooms before I found it in an office. \n\nI walked over to the desk and looked at the caller ID. \n\n*Incoming call from Jack.* \n\nThat was odd. \n\nI grabbed my phone to look at the message again. I was starting to get a little bit creeped out and decided I wouldn\u2019t answer, just to be safe, and left the house, remembering to lock the door as I left. \n\nI\u2019ve done a few more favors for Jack since then. I drove a BMW to a random park in another city, only to get out and drive a different car back to Jack\u2019s house. He had me meet one of his \u201cemployees\u201d at lunch, who then gave me a briefcase to deliver to the first house I had gone to and told me he would know if I looked inside. On several occasions, he asked me to drive down to that same house and stay with the guy, whose name was Julio, for a certain amount of time.\n\nIn total, I\u2019ve made around $3500. \n\nMost recently, Jack asked me to stay in his house overnight. I woke up to a text message from him. \n\n**I need you to spend the night at my house.** \n\nI hadn\u2019t ever seen him in person, but I had talked to him on the phone a few times. He proceeded to tell me he would pay me $1000 to spend the night at his house, provided that I followed a few rules. \n\nI drove to his house that evening. The driveway was empty, and it normally was, but the porch light was on. I walked up, unlocked the door, went inside and then locked it again. \n\nEverything in the house looked the same. Jack had told me over the phone that he would leave the list of rules on the dining room table. I set all my stuff down in the living room. My bags looked like garbage compared to the fancy furniture in there. \n\nI wandered into the kitchen, and then to the dining room. Sure enough, there was a piece of paper on the wooden table, held down by an empty glass. \n\n*Lock the door when you come in.* \n\n*Only answer calls from Marvin.* \n\n*Don\u2019t turn on any faucets between 9 pm and 11 pm.* \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\n*If the door to the closet at the end of the hall is open, sleep in the library. If closed, sleep in any of the bedrooms.* \n\n*The gardener comes at midnight. If he starts knocking on the windows, hide.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Help yourself to anything in the fridge. :)*\n\n*I\u2019ll pay you in the morning. Goodnight!*\n\nI made sure to follow all the rules. To be honest, I was regretting my decision. But, seeing as I was already here, and I was getting paid, I decided to stay anyway. I figured as long as I followed all the rules, I\u2019d be perfectly fine. \n\nStill, it felt a little odd. What was this? A haunted house?\n\nNevertheless, I lounged around the house for a few hours, as I was planning on going to sleep around nine since that\u2019s the time that all the weird shit would begin to happen. At 8:50, I brushed my teeth, using the faucet for the last time before 9. \n\nI checked the closet in the hallway and upon seeing that it was open, I moved my stuff into the library and got ready to sleep on the couch. I locked to doors just in case, and laid on the couch, scrolling through my phone. I hadn\u2019t gotten any more messages from Jack, and I started to think up scenarios and reasons as to why he had such strict, peculiar sets of rules in his house. \n\nI had dozed off at some point because, at exactly 10:16 pm, I was woken up by the doorbell ringing. I was about to get up to check, but then I remembered the rule. \n\n*Don\u2019t open the door for anyone- no matter who they say they are- after 10 pm.* \n\nI stayed on the couch, trying not to move, paranoid that they would hear even the slightest sound. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the police! Open up.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t move. \n\n\u201cHello? It\u2019s the police! Open up or we\u2019re coming in.\u201d\n\nI still didn\u2019t move, but I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. \n\nThere was silence for a while after that. \n\nThen the doorbell rang again. \n\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s Jack! Let me in!\u201d\n\nIt sounded like Jack, but still, I didn\u2019t get up. He would have a key, wouldn\u2019t he? Why would he need me to let him in?\n\nThis continued for almost a full hour; different people would ring the doorbell, announce themselves, and then disappear when I didn\u2019t respond. \n\nI was finally able to fall asleep, and the gardener never came. \n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, I heard someone in the kitchen. I got up slowly, and unlocked the door as quietly as possible, taking my phone with me and walking across the living room and into the kitchen. \n\nI stopped at the entrance and peered in. \n\nIt was Jack. He was standing in front of the stove, stirring something as the coffee machine brewed coffee on the counter behind him. \n\n\u201cHey! Good morning!\u201d He said when he saw me. \n\n\u201cHi.\u201d I replied, nervous. \n\nI hadn\u2019t seen him in person before, but he looked exactly like his pictures online. \n\n\u201cScrambled eggs?\u201d He asked, motioning to the pan with a wooden spoon. \n\n\u201cYeah, thanks!\u201d I replied, walking over to take the plate from him. \n\nI ate my breakfast and drank some coffee in silence. \n\n\u201cSo how was it?\u201d He asked. \n\n\u201cIt was okay. Nothing super freaky happened.\u201d I replied. \n\n\u201cCool!\u201d He replied.\n\nThere was an awkwardness in the room. \n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna go now. I have class\u2026\u201d I trailed off. \n\nI didn't. But I really wanted to get out of there. \n\n\u201cOh, no! Yeah, sure! I\u2019ll talk to you some other time.\u201d He replied. \n\nI grabbed my stuff and he walked me to my car. I could see him standing in the driveway, staring at me as I left. \n\nWhen I got home, I unpacked all my stuff and noticed that I still had the list with me. I sat on my bed and read it again. I felt my body tense up as I realized that I had forgotten something. \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*Turn the tv on and let it play on static through the night. DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\n*DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS.* \n\nI stared at the words on the page until they lost meaning. \n\nBeside me, my phone buzzed, snapping me back to reality. \n\nIt was the $1000 payment. \n\nI looked at my phone and then back at the list. \n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t an important step?\n\nAs I was thinking this over, a text from Jack came it. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now, I should be back next week, so you\u2019re free from running any more errands for me until then! Just sent the payment, go do something fun ;)**\n\nI stared at the message and read it again. \n\nAnd again. \n\nAnd once more for good measure. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nI thought back to this morning, and how Jack was in his house. How he gave me breakfast. \n\n**I\u2019m not in town right now.** \n\nWithin minutes, a new text came in this time from a number that I didn\u2019t recognize. \n\n**Did you forget to do something? ;)**\n\nThe text was followed by a picture of Jack - or, whoever this version of Jack was- standing in front of the tv. \n\nI didn\u2019t respond. \n\nNext came another picture, this one was of the outside of my house. \n\nIt was followed by another text. \n\n**Watch out.**",

Then I thought it could be an intensely dominant control freak trying to find the person to do any request exactly the way he asks it, which fits but I really don\u2019t buy it.  My best theory at this point is a severe case case of multiple personalities.  If he\u2019s aware of what triggers will throw him into an aggressive state then he will want certain things to prevent it.  Seeing the closet door open might spike a memory that will put one person in control versus closed leading to a different personality\u2019s desires.  He was there the whole time.

            "\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\n\n*says in all caps not to forget to leave TV on static*",
            "By the looks of it first you picked up some money from the big guy at a trap house and dropped it off at the jacks house .  He asks you to lock the door when you go inside so no one bum rushes you while you\u2019re inside . When you took the briefcase to the trap house with the big guy you were supplying him the drugs . Jack is that guys supplier or jack owns that trap house,. When you were driving to a location with a car you were asked to get you were taking money to the guy Jack gets his shit from to supply his trap house. And the car you brought back had drugs in it . When you were asked to spend the night you essentially were guarding a large amount of money. Basically he wanted your car to be outside so it looked like there was people inside and no one would try to break in hence the TV . The people that came knocking at night are close friend /neighbor crackhead feeners he avoids or people he knows and has fucked over in the past . This is why he told you about the Gardner too in case they came knocking on the window . In the morning you saw him and he made you some eggs . I suppose he\u2019s just real critical about how he wants things done . He told you he was leaving town not that he has been out of town this week . I mean if you\u2019re gonna continue working with him just know that you could possibly get into deep shit . There are consequences for your actions and the reason he\u2019s trying to keep his distance from you is because when shit hits the fan he doesn\u2019t want you to be able to point him out . Just tell him your mistake and refund him the money if he asks you for it . Also keep in mind he knows where you live by now and could\u2019ve easily had someone break into your car and put a gps tracker or bug when you spent the night at his house. The fact he told you to watch out is the only thing that doesn\u2019t fit this puzzle . I mean stupid of him to threaten a worker of his \n\nAny way good luck and keep us posted.",

That\u2019s why he asks her to lock the door both times; so if he\u2019s in there, he can\u2019t escape, and if he\u2019s not, he can get in to get her (maybe).\n\nThe TV static thing could just be a weird preference of fake Jack. Fake Jack could be more active from 9 to 11 and be able to hear the water if someone\u2019s there. If the closet door is open, Fake Jack looks for more food or something. When it\u2019s closed, he has something there. He maybe just doesn\u2019t like libraries. The gardener could be a friend of Fake Jack, and so could the people knocking past 10:00p.m. The calls other than Marvin could be from Fake Jack or his friends to see if no one not-wanted is in the house.",

        "selftext": "\n\nMy wife \"Lynn\" and I have been together for six years and married for 11 months. Our entire history together has been very normal and never once have I noticed any weird behaviors or red flags. I can't stress enough how out of character this whole thing is for her.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn is very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. She's always been the no nonsense type of person. Being childish, or trying to scare me is not something she'd normally do.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe doesn't even like watching horror movies. When we first started dating she agreed to watch The Shining with me because she knew how much I loved horror. She was so scared that she didn't even make it through half of the movie before we had to turn it off. She isn't into anything creepy, and has never been into pranks. It's just not her cup of tea. And that's fine. But that's what was so strange about this. It's just so unlike her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI should also add that she never had any mental health issues and as far as I'm aware it doesn't run in her family. I know some people are able to hide their mental health problems, but in the six years we've been together I think I'd have seen some sort of sign.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTwo months ago, I was in the kitchen making myself some coffee before work. I was running a bit late that morning and knew I wouldn't be able to make it to Dunkin Donuts for my usual morning fix.\u00a0\n\nI took a sip of my coffee as I hurried down the hall towards the front door, when I happened to notice Lynn peeking at me from around the corner ahead of me. I could only see her eyes, and a\u00a0 strand of her long dark hair hanging against the wall. The rest of her body was concealed behind the corner. I nearly spilled my coffee when I saw her. I did burn the shit out of my lips.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Geeze, Lynn.\" I said, wiping a few drops of coffee from my pants. \"You scared the shit out of me.\"\u00a0\n\nShe immediately popped out of view like a little kid that had been caught. I heard her scurry off towards the living room, and by the time I got to the front door she was out of sight.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt was really weird, and just totally out of character for her like I said, but I also found it kind of funny that she was being more playful and a little less serious. I shouted that I loved her, and called her a weirdo. As I shut the door behind me I heard her laughing.\n\n\n\nHer behavior was a bit odd, but it certainly wasn't something to call a priest over. I forgot about it by lunch and by the time I got home she was her normal self. I didn't bring it up and neither did she, and life went on.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next incident happened three days later. It was around 2am and I had woken up to get a drink. I was standing at the kitchen island, jug of Oj in hand, when I felt a strong feeling that I was being watched.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor whatever reason I looked down at the floor and saw my wife's smiling face staring back. She was peeking at me from the other side of the island, staring up at me with wide unblinking eyes and grinning. Grinning like the Cheshire cat.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0I screamed, I'll admit it. Not out of irritation but fear. For some reason at that moment I was scared.\u00a0\n\n\nAt the sound of my scream Lynn scuttled backwards out of my view, her hands and feet smacking the tile floor as she hurried out of the kitchen on all fours.\u00a0 I didn't run after her, or even yell after her. I just stood there frozen in shock, wondering what fuck had possessed her to do that.\n\n\n\n\u00a0It took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to go back upstairs, but I eventually did. When I got to our bedroom, Lynn was lying on her side, asleep. Or at least pretending to be. I stood there for a while, watching her breathing to be sure she really was asleep.\u00a0\n\n\nI had the feeling she might jump out at me the moment I got into bed. But she didn't. I climbed into bed and she didn't even move. Her breathing was soft and deep and I was starting to wonder if I'd dreamt the whole thing.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe next morning I waited for her to come down for coffee and after handing her a mug and kissing her cheek I decided to ask her about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What was that about last night?\" I asked, keeping my tone light so I didn't offend or embarrass her.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe frowned over her cup of coffee, shaking her head like she had no clue what I was referring to.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You were peeking at me again. From over there.\" I said, pointing to the spot on the floor by the kitchen island.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe followed my gaze, and when she looked back at me she burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that I couldn't help but join her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You creep me the fuck out sometimes, you know that?\" I said. She giggled and set her cup on the counter and wrapped her arms around my neck.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You creep me out all the time. So I guess we're even.\" She teased.\n\n\n\nWe said our goodbyes and left for work. As I drove I kept thinking about how creepy it had been seeing her grinning at me from behind the island like that. The sounds her hands made on the floor as she crawled away. I told myself she was just trying to be silly. Just trying to join me in my love of all things horror\u2026.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0It's not like I was afraid of her. But it still didn't sit right with me.\u00a0\n\n\nI started seeing her peeking at me more and more. Sometimes she'd be peeking out from behind the couch or living room curtains. Once she even managed to get inside her grandmother's old trunk that sits at the foot of our bed.\u00a0\n\nI might not have even known she was there at all had the trunk's old hinges not given her away.\u00a0\n\n\nShe'd had the lid propped up just enough so that\u00a0 only half of her face peeked through. She'd been grinning like an excited toddler. It was unnerving. I didn't even know what to say to her. All I could do was stare. When I finally found my voice, I asked her why on earth was she doing this. She didn't answer, but she had slowly closed the lid, shutting herself inside the trunk. I just walked away, feeling disturbed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't understand why she was doing it, but it clearly made her happy. I just hoped she would tire of the game quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nLynn didn't peek at me for the next two weeks. I started to think she was done with her weird prank and I was relieved. We were watching a show on Netflix one night and I jokingly said that I hadn't seen her peeking at me lately, and that she must have given up on her spy game. She looked up at me with a small smile and said, \"Maybe I've just gotten better at it.\"\u00a0\n\n\nI didn't say anything but I wondered whether or not she was joking.\n\n\n\nFor the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about what she'd said. Was she still peeking at me when I wasn't looking and I just hadn't noticed? And if so, what the hell was she getting out of this? I started to feel paranoid, constantly checking whether she was watching from around the corner, or behind a door.\u00a0 I was jumpy whenever I was home and she wasn't in full view of me. I felt stupid and a little crazy.\u00a0\n\n\nBut after a few weeks without another incident, I began to relax.\u00a0 I stopped checking behind furniture and walls and told myself it was just a bad memory.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThen a few days ago things got so much worse....\n\n\nLynn left to go to a friend's, and I lounged on the couch and played a couple games on my laptop.\u00a0\n\n\nAround 9pm I hopped in the shower and as I was washing the soap from my hair, I felt that awful feeling that I was being watched. I slowly opened my eyes and almost had a fucking heart attack.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn was peeking from behind the shower curtain, her entire head stretched into the shower, leaving just her body outside. Her long dark hair hung against the curtain, the ends dripping with water. Her mouth hung open in a terrible grin, eyes wide and red, as if she hadn't blinked in a while. I screamed and jumped back against the wall. She didn't move nor did her smile waver. Her makeup ran down her cheeks in two black streaks. She looked giddy and completely deranged. I was fucking terrified.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe stood like that for a few moments, neither of us saying a word. Finally after what felt like forever, she slowly pulled her head back out of the shower, and I watched her blurry figure\u00a0 through the curtain as she moved backwards towards the bathroom door.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA second later the bathroom door slammed shut, hard enough to rattle the mirror. I screamed again, and jumped out of the shower to lock the door. I stayed inside the bathroom for over an hour. Maybe I overreacted to some of you. But joke or not, I wasn't going to put up with the crazy shit anymore. That's what I kept telling myself as I paced in my bathroom, stopping to listen at the door every few minutes.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSuddenly I heard a muffled sound, and I pressed my ear against the bathroom door, straining to listen. I couldn't hear anything but I envisioned Lynn standing on the other side of the door, giggling at her joke.\u00a0\n\n\nI felt a surge of anger. I was beyond pissed at being made to feel scared in my own house, and made to hide in the bathroom for an hour. All for what? Some joke? If it was a joke it was an awful one.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"What the fuck Lynn!\" I snapped. \"This shit is getting really fucking annoying.\" I waited for her to apologize, or to call me a jerk. But instead I heard a faint moan, so quiet I wondered if I heard it at all, and then complete silence.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn?\" I called out, not able to even hide the shakiness in my voice. I got no response. Just my own heavy breathing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I swear to God, just fucking stop it!\" I yelled, pounding my fist on the door.\u00a0\n\n\nI waited for her to cuss me out, something I would expect from me talking to her like that. I never screamed at her before.\u00a0\n\n\nBut there was nothing. Just the occasional drip from the shower head.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI won't deny that I was scared. Too afraid to open the damn door and face my own wife. I waited another 30 minutes or so, which feels like a fucking lifetime when you're scared. Finally I decided I wasn't going to spend the night hiding in my bathroom, so I got down on my knees and peered under the door. I almost expected to see her face peeking back at me but thankfully I didn't. I could see straight down the hallway to the top of the stairs, but no Lynn. I didn't know if I should be happy about that or not. I looked for a few minutes, waiting to see her head pop up over the top step, but it never came.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI stood up, my hand hovering over the door and mentally prepared myself to open it. I slowly turned the lock with shaky fingers, and was about to yank it open when I heard a sound that still makes me feel nauseous when I think about it.\u00a0\n\n\n\nA moan, louder than before, but this time I was able to tell just where it was coming from. I turned my head to the closet door as if in slow motion, and locked eyes with my wife who was peeking out at me from the slight gap.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nHer eyes were still wide as ever and her mouth was hanging open in the most grotesque gaping smile I'd ever seen. I didn't even scream. I was too scared for even that. Her hands were clasped to her chest, body trembling with sheer delight, as if she could barely contain her excitement. A short raspy moan bubbled up from her throat, deep and raw, sending a shiver through my entire body.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSomehow I found the ability to pull the bathroom door open and ran as fast as I could all the way down the steps, snagging my keys and phone from the table in the living room before running outside to my car. I could hear her shrill laughter behind me but I didn't hear her getting closer. I didn't bother shutting the front door. I drove away from the house faster than I legally should have, shivering the entire time, either from fear or the cold. Maybe a little of both. I hadn't grabbed a coat or even a pair of shoes. I was still in my boxers and my hair was still damp.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI drove straight to my brother Chris's house about 40 minutes away, ignoring any and every call and text I got. I didn't check my phone until I was safely parked in my brother's driveway. Lynn had called 4 times and sent a flurry of texts, all wondering where I'd gone and why I left \"like that.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI threw my phone at the dash in a rage, furious at her nonchalant attitude. My brother and his wife were surprised to see me, especially dressed in just a pair of boxers, but told me to stay as long as I needed. Chris lent me some clothes and asked me what happened. I told him Lynn and I had a fight, but didn't get into the details. I didn't want him to think I was overreacting, leaving my wife over a prank, even if it was a strange one. I mean, hadn't I encouraged her for years to lighten up instead of being so serious all the time? I had wanted her to relax and loosen up, but this was definitely not what I'd had in mind.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nI tried to sleep on their sofa, but my brain wouldn't let me sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I saw Lynn's face staring at me from inside the closet. Knowing she'd been in there with me the entire time made my skin crawl. She'd never left the fucking bathroom at all. Instead she slipped inside the closet and slammed the bathroom door shut to fool me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe mere thought of going back home gave me anxiety. I tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Chris ended up giving me a sleeping pill so I was able to get a little rest. My sleep was filled with terrible dreams. All of Lynn's smiling face.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI woke up just as the sun started to rise. My sore body ached from the sofa, and I felt drained. I knew I'd have to call Lynn at some point, but I didn't know what to say to her. I wouldn't be going home unless she gave me her word she'd never do anymore creepy shit.\u00a0\n\n\nI just wanted my wife back. Her normal serious self never looked so good to me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI was contemplating calling her and telling her that, when that familiar feeling came over me. I was being watched. I was staring at the ceiling, my heart in my throat. I didn't want to look away but the longer I ignored the feeling the worse it got.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMy eyes drifted away from the ceiling almost on their own. Her face was pressed up against the window beside the couch, staring down at me with that same gaping smile. Drool dribbled down her lips, leaving two long streaks down the glass. I didn't know how long she'd been there, but something told me she'd been there quite a while, possibly all night.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI didn't bother screaming, though I was afraid anger trumped any fear I felt at that moment. I jumped up from the couch and pounded my palm against the glass.\u00a0\n\n\"Lynn! Are you crazy? What the hell is wrong with you? Just go home!\" I shouted. \"Now!\"\u00a0\n\nShe didn't move, and her ghastly expression never changed. If anything her smile only grew, as if she had never been more elated.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI could hear Chris and his wife moving around upstairs. As if Lynn could hear them from her place outside, her head twitched slightly in their direction, and she began to close her mouth slowly.\u00a0\n\n\nChris called my name from upstairs, obviously concerned. I turned to see him and his wife Rebecca hurrying down the steps. When I turned back to the window Lynn was gone. The only sign she'd been there at all was the two streaks of drool still dripping down the glass.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI tried explaining to Chris and Rebecca about waking up to see Lynn watching me through their window. They were skeptical, who wouldn't be? Chris and I went outside to the spot in front of the window but there were no footprints in the dirt, just a slight indent. Animal probably, Chris guessed, and I didn't argue. He and Rebecca assumed I dreamt the entire episode but they didn't understand, and I was too tired to explain it to them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI called out of work that day and turned my cell off. I didn't want to face Lynn. Just talking to her was too much for me at that point. I really started to believe something was irreversibly wrong with her. That no matter what promises she made we'd never be the same again. The thought saddened me to my core. I cried most of the morning. By noon I figured I was ready to confront her. Give her one last chance to explain herself. I could at least give her that after 6 years I told myself. I turned my phone on and saw the dozens of texts she'd sent, all from a seemingly concerned wife.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Can we talk?\"\n\n\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Please call me.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm really worried.\"\n\n\n\n\"Can you answer?\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Just come home.\"\n\n\n\n\nAnd more of the same. All texts telling me she loved me, and she wanted me home. How worried she was\u2026.Not a damn one addressing the crazy shit she pulled. Like she hadn't been acting like a character from a Stephen King book.\u00a0\n\n\nEven her texts were different. She normally texted novels just to tell me to pick up a loaf of bread! You'd think she'd have more to say to me after her bizarre shenanigans.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI know it probably seems childish to some of you who are miles away from this situation. But if you saw the way Lynn had looked at me, how she scampered away on all fours like some wild animal, grinning at me from inside the closet like a lunatic\u2026..then I think you'd find my reaction was warranted.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI ended up staying with Chris and Rebecca for another night. I didn't wake up yesterday until after noon, and thankfully I didn't see Lynn's face watching me through the window.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't want to pry, because it's not my place. But is this fight something that can be mended?\" Rebecca asked. She'd made us both a sandwich for lunch and I knew she wanted to breach the subject without seeming to be nosy.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't know. I just\u2026.. She's like a different person.\" I said, choosing my words carefully. I still wasn't ready for her or Chris to know the full extent of the bat shit craziness I had been dealing with.\n\n\n\n\"People change Ben. But she's still the same woman you married. Maybe you both just need to talk through your issues. Whatever's going on, I'm sure it can be fixed.\" She said, ever the peacemaker.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I think it's beyond that now. I don't think talking would help. I just don't trust her.\" I said. The words stung in my heart. I missed and loved my wife. But how could I live with someone like that? Living in constant fear didn't sound too appealing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn loves you. She has to be absolutely crushed.\" She said.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't know about that.\" I said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Well she certainly seemed like it to me. I've never seen her so upset. Very much unlike the Lynn I know.\" Rebecca said, shaking her head sadly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIt took a full minute for her words to really sink in and when they did, I felt dread worming its way through my skin.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Wait. What do you mean? You saw her? You saw Lynn?\" I asked, my mouth suddenly dry.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRebecca nodded casually as if that fact wasn't nightmare fuel. Maybe for her it wasn't.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"She stopped by this morning just after Chris left for work.\"\u00a0 She said, cleaning the plates from the table. \"I didn't see her car though. Maybe she took an uber or something.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Becc. What did she say? Did..did she come inside?\" I asked, sweat starting to break out on my forehead. I began looking around, examining corners as though a predator lurked behind them.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No. She just asked if you were awake yet and I said that you weren't. I asked if she wanted me to wake you but she said no. Just said to let you sleep.\" She said as she washed the dishes.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"That's all? She didn't say anything else?\" I asked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"No. She looked awful though. Like she hadn't slept in days. I think you should call her.\"\n\n\n\nI got up from the table and thanked Rebecca for lunch.\u00a0\n\n\nI felt a little bit better at the knowledge that at least she hadn't come inside. Still, I needed to double check that the doors were locked.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI sat for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I didn't want to go home, but I felt that I owed it to Lynn to help her if I could. Hadn't I swore an oath to love and honor her through sickness and in health? Clearly she was very sick.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIf she was sick, which I truly believed she was, I had to try and get her the help she needed. But I didn't even know where to start. I didn't want to call the police, and besides, what the hell was I going to tell them? That my wife was peeking at me? That she was being creepy? As bizarre as she'd been, she still hadn't committed any crime. Not yet anyway. The police would have probably said that I was overreacting. But this wasn't some prank. It felt wrong. Dangerous even. Like something sinister lurked beneath her smile.\n\n\n\nI knew as her husband I was well within my rights to have her committed, but what if she simply acted normal in their presence? She'd obviously been able to fool Rebecca into thinking she was just a concerned wife. As long as the doctors didn't find her a danger to herself or others, they'd have no choice but to release her after 72 hours. I felt lost and overwhelmed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSo I did what any husband in my position would do.\n\n\nI called her mother.\n\n\nI didn't want to, believe me.\u00a0\n\nHer mother, Marianne and I were never on the best of terms. We'd never fought or anything like that.\u00a0\n\nShe just wasn't a very warm person, and wasn't really easy to get along with.\u00a0 She hardly ever smiled and when she did, only her lips would move into a thin lipped smile, leaving her eyes as blank as before. She gave off this aura that felt like she was permanently on the offensive.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI'd only met her twice and both times were for such short visits. I got the impression she didn't approve of me for her daughter. Lynn always ushered us out quickly, as she didn't want me to feel uncomfortable which I was grateful for. Being in her mother's company felt almost unbearable. Like walking on glass. I was glad when we moved three states away so we didn't have to see her often. I was happy to avoid the woman, but I needed her help.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nI really didn't want to talk to her at all but I had to talk to someone and someone who knew Lynn better than I did. So I grit my teeth and did what I had to.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Yes?\" She answered, already sounding irritated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's me Ben. Do you have a minute to talk?\" I asked. I could hear her cluck her tongue in irritation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm in the middle of writing some checks, but if you insist, I suppose I can spare a moment. What is it that you want to discuss Benjamin?\"\u00a0 She said, coolly?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"It's about Lynn. She's been... acting strangely and I was wondering if you had any idea whether there was something - \" I was quickly interrupted.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"It's a bit difficult to follow your rambling Benjamin, what is that you want from me?\" She asked. I could almost see her standing there in her thin sweater and slacks, tapping her fingernails impatiently on the table.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to know if you'd ever noticed any odd behavior? Or possibly any mental health issues?\" I asked. There was a long, uncomfortable pause\u00a0 that I couldn't tell was because she was just thinking, or \u2026.something else. Finally after a few seconds she spoke.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I'm not sure if this is one of your jokes Benjamin, but if so I don't find the humor in it. Now I do have business to attend to as I've said,\u00a0 so if you don't mind -\" she said, but I cut her off before she could get rid of me.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne, it's not a joke. I'm sincerely concerned about Lynn's mental health. Her behavior has been very erratic lately. I'm very worried about her and I figured as her mother you would be as well.\" I said, my frustration evident in my voice.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"If you're truly concerned then I suggest you get the health professionals involved. I don't know what you expect of me.\" She snapped. I could tell she was seconds away from hanging up and for some reason I was desperate not to let her. I had the feeling that she knew a lot more than she was letting on.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Please. If not for me, do it for Lynn.\" I tried.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI heard a faint shaky intake of breath, as if she were trying to hold her steely persona together but failing.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Marianne? What's wr-\"\u00a0 I started.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Benjamin, I don't know what to tell you. My only advice would be to seek professional help. Do not call here again. Goodbye.\" I tried to call out to her but she'd hung up.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI tried to wrap my head around the call and her refusal to help me. Even if she didn't like me, why wouldn't she want to help her own daughter? I couldn't understand that. I tried to replay the conversation, desperate to find something I missed.\n\n\n\u00a0After a while I almost gave up, until I remembered her last last words to me. 'Seek professional help' she'd said those words with a bit of urgency. I could have just been grasping at straws but no, I was sure her voice had changed ever so slightly when she'd said that. As if they were very important.\n\n\n\n\nWhat had she meant? I assumed she'd been referring to medical professionals, but maybe she was referring to someone else. Someone that she didn't, for some reason, feel comfortable saying directly. Or maybe I was just desperate.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI waited for Chris to get home and after a very long and exhausting conversation with him and Rebecca, I convinced them that Lynn truly needed psychiatric help. I didn't tell them everything. I wasn't prepared to go into it yet, but I told them about our last encounter. How she'd hidden in the bathroom, peeking at me from the closet.\u00a0\n\n\nThey were obviously shocked but thankfully they believed me. They too just wanted to help her. Still they didn't think it was all that serious. Weird, maybe but not dangerous. They just kept saying that Lynn had to be playing some kind of weird joke. \"Maybe for YouTube?\" Rebecca offered, if only half-heartedly.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris didn't think we should involve the police just yet. He offered instead to go with me, and I readily accepted. He reasoned that calmly talking to her, trying to coax her into going willingly was the best recourse. I agreed to do it his way. At least I wouldn't be going into that house alone.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe drove over this morning, just after breakfast. There was no way I was going at night. When we pulled into the driveway my stomach began doing somersaults. Her car wasn't there, but I still didn't let my guard down.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe front door was ajar, and for a split second I thought we'd see her eyes staring through the gap. I was shaking and starting to sweat. Chris however was fine. He waited for me to open the door, his hands in his pockets like he was going on a fucking stroll through the park. I envied his ignorance.\n\n\n\nI pushed the door open and was immediately hit with the stench of rot. Chris smelled it too, and he walked in the house behind me with his nose scrunched up.\u00a0\n\n\n\"What do you guys use to clean the floors around here, shit?\" Chris mumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Shut up.\" I said, my eyes darting around for any signs of Lynn.\n\n\n\nThe house was deadly quiet and dark despite being 10 in the morning. All the curtains were closed up tight, refusing to allow any sunlight inside. If I hadn't left it just two days prior I'd have thought the house to be abandoned.\u00a0\n\n\nWe moved through each room, carefully checking any place that she might hide, occasionally calling her name.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Why the fuck are you looking under the couch?\" Chris asked eventually. \"Aren't we looking for your wife?\"\u00a0 He was looking at me like I was a moron.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Let's just go upstairs.\" I whispered. He shook his head but followed me up the stairs to check the bathroom and spare bedroom. On the way up my shoes crunched over pieces of glass that looked to be littered over a few of the steps.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI noticed that one of Lynn and my wedding portraits that hung on the wall along the staircase had been smashed. The frame hung crookedly, all the glass removed. I stared at the picture, a lump forming in my throat. We had taken the photo just after leaving the church, after saying our vows. She looked so beautiful in her white gown. I looked at Lynn's beautiful face. I never dreamed her face would ever be a source of terror for me.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nWe climbed the rest of the steps and checked the spare bedroom, but it looked completely untouched.\u00a0\n\n\nI was hesitant to go into the bathroom, my fear from that night coming back to me all at once. Chris noticed, and offered to go in by himself but I couldn't let him do that. So we walked in together, checking the closet and the shower. The bathroom looked as if it hadn't been touched since the night I left.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I don't think she's here Ben. Why don't you pack some clothes and we'll try coming back tomorrow or something.\" Chris said. I nodded and went into our bedroom and shoved some clothes into a duffle bag. When I checked inside our closet I came across the source of the smell and gagged.\u00a0\n\n\nChris took one look and lost all color in his face. He had to go stand by the stairs to get away from the sight and smell.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0I gazed down in shock at what lay Inside my bedroom closet. Soaking into the rug, were at least a dozen eyeballs, all carefully laid out in pairs. Some were as large as a quarter while others were as tiny as a marble. I stared down at the eyes she'd collected from small animals and I wondered how she'd gotten them, and shuddered at the thought.\u00a0\n\n\n\"Man, I thought I had it bad with Becca's shoe addiction. But fuck me. Your wife's in here collecting eyeballs.\" Chris said, gagging. \u00a0\"Ben, I think we should go.\"\u00a0 He called from the hall. \"I'm getting nauseous.\"\n\n\n\n\"Alright.\" I grabbed my duffle and shut the closet door on my new nightmare. I stepped out into the hall and took a deep breath of air. I could taste the rot on my tongue and I couldn't help but gag.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Who the fuck lines up eyeballs in their closet like that?\"\u00a0 Chris mumbled.\u00a0\n\n\n\"I tried to tell you she needed help.\" I said.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"She doesn't need help, Ben. She needs a fucking exorcist.\" He said. \"You coming or what? I can't stand the smell any- \" his words died in his throat, and his eyes grew wide with fear.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI didn't ask him why. I could feel it. Someone was watching me and I didn't think it was the eyes in the closet.\u00a0 I turned around, my eyes slowly scanning the bedroom.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Christ\" I whispered, as I finally saw what we'd missed. Under the bed, curled on her side, watching us with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning, was my wife.\u00a0\n\n\nShe held her hands together just under her chin, and they were shaking eagerly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nNow that she knew she'd been found, I could hear the quiet noises she was making. A sort of hiccuping sound in her throat, as if the excitement was just too much for her. It was unnerving to say the least. Wide eyes, and that same huge smile.\u00a0\n\n\n\nEverything in me told me to run, but I forced it away. This was my wife. No matter how twisted, she was still the woman I married. I had to help her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn\u2026\"\u00a0 I said softly. She didn't respond, but her head bobbed back and forth in two quick little movements as if she were nodding.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Baby. I just wanna help okay? Can you\u2026. Can you let me do that?\" I asked. I had taken a single step forward, approaching her like some kind of dangerous animal.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"I love you, Lynn.\" I said softly, taking another step closer. She let a tiny moan escape her wide open mouth and I had to resist the urge to run.\u00a0 Her shoulders were starting to quiver, and her eyes grew as large as saucers.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI crouched down so I could see her better, and immediately saw the blood. Her hands were covered in it. They trembled more the closer I got, as if she was barely able to contain herself.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Lynn. Are you hurt? You're bleeding.\" I said. She bobbed her head again, her bloody fingers moving up and down as if playing an invisible piano. They occasionally grazed her chin, leaving smears of blood on her skin.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI wanted to recoil in disgust. The smell that was coming off of her was revolting. I could feel the vomit trying to climb up my throat.\u00a0\nHer lips were dry and stretched thin, blood seeping between the cracks. \n\n\nI knew she wouldn't come out on her own, but I didn't want to leave her in the state she was in.\u00a0\n\n\nI scooted closer and reached out to her. The excited hiccuping sounds got louder and her hands shook, fingers flexing. It was then that I could see the blood oozing from in between her fingers.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Oh my God, Lynn. You're bleeding.\" I said. Instinctively I reached out to take her hand, but before I could even touch her, her hand sprang out towards me. A sharp pain shot through my arm, and I fell back on my ass. My arm burned, and I could see the blood dripping down onto the carpet.\u00a0\n\n\nI looked back at her in shock and saw her grinning madly, her fingers clutching a large shard of glass.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"You alright in there?\" Chris asked from behind me.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI turned my head slightly, and nodded to him, cradling my arm to my chest. When I turned back to face Lynn, I saw that her focus had shifted. She wasn't looking at me anymore. And she wasn't smiling anymore either.\u00a0\n\n\n\nShe was staring past me, her eyes glaring at Chris the way a hungry lion might stare at an antelope. Her mouth was still hanging open but it was twisted into a snarl.\n\n\nI got to my feet, and began walking backwards down the hall, afraid to take my eyes off her.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Are you... bleeding?\" Chris asked. The moment the words left his mouth Lynn started fast scooting out from under the bed, the glass shard still in her fist.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Chris. Run. Go!\" I yelled. He must have been too afraid to move because a second later I felt my back bump into him. He was still standing at the top of the stairs, staring at the horror that was my wife.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn had crawled completely out from under the bed and stood in the bedroom doorway, her face twisted in rage. Her whole body was visibly tense. Blood ran down her fingers and onto the floor.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Jesus, Lynn...\" Chris said, \"You uh\u2026 playing hide and seek?\" I reached back and pushed him towards the steps.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\"Move your ass Chris\" I said as quietly but firmly as I could.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLynn bobbed her head in fast, sharp motions, and began to grin, stretching her mouth open wider and wider so that her chin seemed to touch her chest. I heard Chris mutter a prayer and then he was running down the stairs. I stood at the top of the steps, stuck between the love for a woman who clearly needed serious help, and self preservation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\"I only want to help.\" I said, choking back tears. Her eyes focused on me once again as she slowly lifted the glass, holding it out in front of her. And then she started sprinting towards me, grinning with utter excitement. Thankfully my body took over and I flew down the stairs skipping two or three at a time. I made it to the front door before I felt her leap onto my back, wrapping her arms around my neck, her open mouth next to my ear so that I could hear those terrible hiccuping sounds up close. I shook her off me, knocking her to the floor. I felt a searing pain in my back as she went but I tore open the front door and bolted to my car.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChris was standing in the front yard, talking on the phone with the police. I didn't say a word, I just ran to my car and jumped in. Chris took the hint and followed me, still on the line with 911\n\n\n\nI watched the rear view mirror, sure I'd see her there, running after us. But I never did.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI went straight to the ER and got 11 stitches in my arm and 3 on my back. The police asked a lot of questions and went back to the house to do a search but of course, Lynn wasn't there.\u00a0\n\n\nThey advised me to stay with a friend or relative for a while and to file a restraining order as soon as I could but none of those things would matter. Somehow I just knew.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI dropped Chris off at home, and went to a motel an hour away. I wanted to put as much distance between me and Lynn as I could.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis is where I've been for the last 4 hours. I thought maybe the police would find her, maybe they'd get her the help she desperately needs.\u00a0\n\n\nBut now I don't think so. Because 40 minutes ago I got a text from an unknown number. Just three words :\n\n\n\n\"I found You.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd a picture attached. The picture was dark and grainy, but I instantly knew what it was. There was no mistaking my wife's eye.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI started typing this out immediately after. I don't know what to do. I'm alone and scared, and I can't help but feel that I'm being watched\u2026.",

There i would find my family and friends having a good time, but no one notices me. As i step through the door into the garage, my arm gets yanked from behind and I would get pulled back in while I sceam for my family. Turning back to look, it will always end with a man staring me down with a wide open grin. \n\nEvery time I had that dream, it would be different scenarios in the basement.
