But things went about as expected. She cried, I cried, she begged. It wasn't pretty. But for two weeks we've been broken up and she moved out today. The first few days were aweful. But afterwards we were able to talk to each other like normal people. And I helped her with everything I could. I let her take the room while I slept on the couch so she could have space and I tried to make myself as scarce as possible.\n\nIt's been a sad time and a sigh of relief. She also admitted to me that the reason she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. She apologized and promised to work on herself. Which I appreciate. I told her there wasn't a chance we could get back together. We just aren't right. And she even said she is willing to try being friends after a while and I told her she is free to talk to me anytime but I won't bother her while she is getting over things.\n\nI'm going to have to work things out properly with my financial status. But this is all for the best and I'm glad It happened. I only wish I could have done it earlier.\n\nThanks again for the advice. It helped a ton.\n\nTL:DR I went through with the breakup and we are both doing fine now. Thank you for your help.",

            "Glad you're both doing fine - a positive outcome for you both. All the best!",
            "The way I look at it people know us through our boundaries. And our boundaries are made up of what we like and what we don\u2019t like what we want and what we don\u2019t want. If someone is giving you what you don\u2019t want or not giving you what you want, you have an obligation to let them know, courteously and kindly. If they refuse to respect your boundaries, that disregard threatens the integrity of the relationship. If you fail to inform your partner of your preferences, you are just as much at fault because it\u2019s unfair and infantile to expect someone to read your mind. Clearly stating your wants and needs gives your partner the opportunity to strengthen the bonds between you. Failing that resentment and silent scorn and then anger and contempt will arise and gradually the relationship will transform.",
            "Been in your shoes before. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were 25/26, told her we will never get back together, it was very messy and we did live together as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n6 months later we got back together and we are now married lol. The time apart gave us time to think and work on our issues alone. Made it a better relationship.",
            "Hey, at least she had the courage to admit that she wasnt trying to fix stuff because she was taking you for granted. I wish you the best, may you find a partner that makes you happy or even your ex fiance if she works on herself",
            "You made the right decision. \n\nGood luck in the future, and take some time before getting into another serious relationship.",
            "Well done! I just read your original post and I've been her before, but we got married. And a year later, divorced. Best of luck for your future!",
            "You did the right thing.  She obviously does not want/like to have sex.  Nothing to fix.   If she worked on it, best she could do is have sex without wanting to.  Who wants that ??",
            "Pretty much the exact reason my ex and I broke up. I was unhappy with that and she didn\u2019t put any effort into fixing it because she never thought I\u2019d break up with her.\n\nIt\u2019s gonna be hard, but time heals all wounds.",
            "I wish you the best OP. I saw where you mentioned you felt like you were \u201cwasting her time\u201d. What would have really been wasting her time is marrying her, maybe having kids, and either being unhappy for the rest of your lives, or leaving her years later. \n\nI was in a marriage that had a myriad of issues, but lack of sex was a huge problem too (porn addict). Regardless of the reason I never felt attractive and my self esteem was garbage when I finally left.\n\nNow, I have a fianc\u00e9e who could not be more attracted to me, and whom could not be more compatible both in and out of the bedroom. I always feel beautiful and wanted. \n\nYour ex deserves to be truly loved and with someone who is truly happy with her. You gave her a gift by leaving.",
            "In a somewhat similar situation, my fianc\u00e9 and I\u2019s relationship was a nightmare at the end. He was brought up with the mentality that you ensure the misery because we had a child. My mental health was at an all time low and I didn\u2019t think I had a choice. We even tried counseling, which always ended up with us fighting on the way back. We had a random fight, had a few days apart and when we finally spoke again, we both finally had the guts to call it off. I guess that was the last straw for both of us. We were both so relieved the other felt the same way that we cried as we hugged. We\u2019ve remained good friends in order to coparent our son. He\u2019s almost 7 so he\u2019s been asking more questions about why his parents, who seem to get along just fine, don\u2019t live together and never got married. We just explain to him that we are both happier as friends and that\u2019s far better than getting married and arguing all of the time for the sake of \u201cstaying together for the kids.\u201d",
            "The only sad part is,that she will probably start working on herself like you did but you will never benefit from her improved self. My ex told me how he used my comments during our break up to improve and I just thought: that's great, why not earlier when we had all these problems and you did nothing. Now somebody else will someday enjoy your better self",
            "wow thats shitty. she basically banked on the idea that u wouldn\u2019t have the strength to leave her...? so she was totally cool with u being unhappy as long as u didn\u2019t leave her? good riddance",
            "Good luck in the future for both of you",
            "Congratulations,  this not really an easy decision.  My strength",
            "Honestly, I think you handled this PERFECTLY. You were honest and straight to the point with her and I think she will respect that one day. Nothing is worse than when you \"keep in contact\" because it lingers on and on and I love how you said you will talk to her, but YOU wont reach out. I think you did exactly what you needed to and congrats on the beginning of a new adventure!!!",
            "Thank you. I understand 100% what you wanted to convey in the oh post, you made feel thankful and less guilty for breaking up with my boyfriend and not letting it go for longer.",
            "I've recently had a situation where I broke up with my gf of almost 4 years. We still kinda love each other, had our small family with our cat in a place we rented, but we loved each other not the way we should really. We wanted to take care of ourselves, but we had differences that were kinda splitting us apart, apart from when we were home together and chilling but this can't be your whole life, locked inside a safe space. Still fresh, still hard, for both of us, but we agreed and with a help of my parents advice I came into a conclusion.\n\nDon't let her totally go out of your life. Unless you guys are in a fight or smth, give yourself a break, but maybe try to stay in touch later on. Those memories we had, were beautiful, those were really good and magical times. It all already happened and formed what we are today and forgetting it or going against it is not only disrespectful for a relationship that was, most of the time, everything for me, but also it just means you're going backwards and won't do any self progress in terms of understanding yourself. As much as you want to let go for now to get over it, never forget the times you spent together, especially if you had good times. Later on when you're all cool, talk about these memories sometimes, remember them. This will shape you for the rest of your life and will let you understand what you want from other relationships in the future. Also, at least personally, no matter how much I want to get over it, I'll never fully do, luckily. How can you forget someone you spent years with, living together, who was taking care of you, who you were taking care of, who was there for you always, everyday. With whom you actually felt more at home than you're feeling right now with your own parents at a place you grew up.\n\nI'm sorry, not sure if that's at all relevant in your situation, just I guess had to vent out and share my early after breakup discoveries.",
            "Last year I broke up with my fianc\u00e9e of 5 years and it did not go as smoothly as possible. She would beg me to take her back then verbally attack me when I didn\u2019t. For a few weeks I couldn\u2019t block communication because we had to sort some financial things.",
            "Did she ever explain *why* she was never sexual with you???",
            "Bravo! You\u2019ve done a very difficult thing and you did it for you, to improve your life and your future. That is commendable. \n\nI sincerely hope you find someone who gives you the sexual excitement and fulfillment you deserve. You sound like a very level-headed person and in-tune with your emotions and the kind of person you are",
            "Congrats, hope you both do better and stay as friends.",
            "So glad this all worked out for you man \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",
            "I am so sorry OP that you went through 8 years of this.  Shame on her for never working on anything because she thought yo uwoudln't leave.",
            "Props to you, even dating casually break ups are really hard to initiate.",
            "Nailed it! Good luck!",
            "Well don\u2019t do what my ex did and end it over text and you\u2019ll be fine",
            "Congrats! Breaking up is never easy and I sincerely hope that she will respect your choice and be a decent person towards you long after the break up.\n\nI say do a lot of independent and family/friends hangouts, solidifying your non romantic relationships with others and yourself! Take advantage of the alone times too (new hobby or just self reflecting/thinking!)",
            "Congrats man, 26 is still young, I'm sure you both will do fine without each other",
            "Stay strong OP. It seems like she is aware of the problems you had in your relationship. Make sure to cut all contact for at least a month. You and her needs that time to be able to heal. Also after that month you will see if she is dedicated to actual change. If she is then you will have a decision to make if you are going to give her a second chance, I know that seems like something that won't happen but trust me as someone in your position your feelings will soften a bit if she is actually willing to change which is a small probability, or try to make a friendship of it. If she isn't well I guess you never need to talk to her again. \n\nYou need this month to live life on your own for awhile. Just cut contact and stay strong because she might try to bargin a bit, but I don't think that's the case because she probably did this the last two weeks while you still lived together.",
            "Yes it is honest, which is what matters. It isn\u2019t a good excuse as you\u2019re damaged and are only creating more damage in the world (I can relate). However admitting means you can prevent it in the future. \n\nThanks for answering and honestly without making yourself out to be the victim. Serious props, not enough self reflection in these situations. \n\nHope the best for you in the future.",

            "\"...she never tried to fix anything was because she didn't believe I would ever actually break up with her. \"\n\nBeen told this myself. I found that incredibly inconsiderate of her to say she wasn't going to bother stop doing the things that really bothered me because she thought I wouldn't break up over them.\n\nWrong.",
            "Good on you OP it takes guts and a lot of maturity to do what you did. It is far better off now than getting married and having your partner leave you a few months later ( speaking from experience). So hats off to you for doing it right.",
            "I'm glad it worked out, OP. What I'm really wondering, though, is why did you get engaged if things were already so bad?",
            "this hits me hard because I was in the same scenario, except on the female side. my boyfriend broke up with me and honestly it was all my fault, I was too full of myself thinking I was \"too good too perfect\" for him to ever leave that I didn't realize I was being toxic and putting him down throughout the time\nbut even with that I loved him and appreciated him so much, that when he told me he wanted to break up it completely shattered me, I was destroyed\nfor days I didnt believe it was true, and then finally about a week later he said he just doesnt love me in that way anymore, and doesnt see us being together\nafter he said that I took a step back and had finally realized everything I did wrong.. and what was worst is that it was too late to fix it\nit really hit me hard because he was the first and only person ive loved\nso I just could do nothing but better myself and relationship with people around me\nafter a while he started talking to me and trying to get close again - with caution, probably scared I still had same unhealthy behavior (unneeded distrust, not giving him any space, my way or no other way -type of thing)\n\nto not make this any longer - after 3 months of being broken we got back together, and weve been better than ever. theres mutual respect & I love him even more than before, hoping he does as well!\n\nnot sure if that's the case for you but maybe itll help you see things from the other perspective",

I just want to say thank you all for the advice and I have a very happy update for you all.\n\nI took a week to think about the post and my own feelings. I talked it out in therapy and I came to the conclusion that I could not keep working 70 hours a week. It was destroying my relationship with my wife and son and it was also destroying my happiness. I spoke to my boss and he was very understanding and told me that there was enough in the budget to hire an assistant for me. My assistant started two weeks ago and my work load has been dramatically reduced. I have been able to work a normal 40 hour work week and I am now finally coming home before 6:00 PM each weekday!\n\nI spoke with my best friend about my wife and he knocked some sense into me. He told me how jealous he and the rest of our friends were over my wife and how lucky I was to be with a woman who is super-model attractive, yet driven and kind and compassionate like my wife. Later that night, I drank a bottle of scotch and got sloppy drunk. My wife found me puking in the bathroom and in my drunken haze I confessed to her everything I was holding back. I told her about how I felt left out because I wasn't around for our son, how I didn't feel connected to her like I wanted to be, the whole nine yards. She held me and let me cry it out and she told me that she loved me.\n\nThe wife and I are headed to couple's counseling, but we also signed up for cooking classes to build a common hobby. She says that she will stay by me as long as I stay be her, no matter what happens. I love her and she loves me and I think we are going to be okay.\n\nOne last detail that I can't think to put anywhere else: All three of us are taking a month-long vacation after Christmas in order to have family bonding time. Wife and I both agree that we need this vacation.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Pulled my head out of my ass and told my boss that I had too much work to handle. I got an assistant and relieved myself from that stress. I spoke with my best friend who knocked some sense into me about how wonderful my wife is. She and I are going to counseling and we are going to work it out.",

            "Good for you!  Now keep it up.  Don't do the stoic, suffer-in-silence type.  Trust your wife to listen to and care about your problems.  A SAHM can still be educated and sophisticated.  Encourage her to grow intellectually with you. ",
            "Your wife sounds like a keeper. And you know the old cliche, \"the grass is greener where you water it.\" Glad you started watering your lawn.",
            "I'm so glad that you have decided to cut back on your work hours and reconnect with your wife and your family as a whole. \n\nI just want to suggest something that perhaps you haven't really considered: being a stay at home parent is hard work, too. Since you were only seeing your wife later in the evening when you got home, you missed all the tasks she did that day before freshening up and settling down to await your arrival while playing with Baby. You were gone early each morning, before she got up and her own workday began. \n\nI've been a stay at home parent before. Every time you try to do some task, the baby or toddler comes along and messes it up again or creates a worse mess than before. Your couch gets scribbled on with pens when you're not looking, you sometimes clean urine and vomit and poop off your own clothes multiple times a day. Things get broken, things get dirty, things get very untidy in only a matter of moments. It's not as easy as it looks from the outside. And while you're caring for the baby, you're also rotating through the daily/weekly housekeeping tasks like interminable amounts of laundry, cooking, shopping, running to the dry cleaner's, cleaning the bathrooms, mopping the floors, cleaning up spills and puke and diaper accidents. It can be difficult to even get a chance to shower yourself. \n\nIt can be extremely difficult to get things in order enough so that by the time your husband gets home from work, he sees his wife and baby both showered and clean, quietly playing in the living room together, with dinner on the table. A stay at home wife and mother typically has had no adult conversation all day long unless she spoke to a cashier at the grocery story and she's probably aching for a normal conversation with you.\n\nYou're probably already aware of all of this, but it's very difficult to compare your office job with what LOOKS like sitting around playing with the baby all day. It's not a fair comparison.\n\nPerhaps you could sit down with your wife and ask her what her days are like, what her daily routine is. Tell her you want to know everything, from poopy diapers to the sippy cup that somehow got milk on the ceiling. I think that once she opens up about how much she actually does on any given day, you may feel a lot less resentful of what appears to be an easy job. \n\nYour wife sounds like an honest, hardworking, lovely woman, and I'm only saying these things to suggest another perspective, not to be judgmental. After having been a stay at home parent in the past, if I was offered that choice or a full time job to choose between on scales of effort, I'd take the full time job any day of the week!",
            "I actually came out of lurkdom just to comment on this. I read your last post, and I have to say, my (ex) husband was you. He felt exactly the same way about me, his degree was in engineering and mine in psychology, and we had always discussed and planned on my staying home. In fact, once our daughter was born he INSISTED on it. But he also hated me for it. I could tell something was wrong and just begged him for years for counseling. But no go, he wouldn't admit things were less then perfect, but he also became nastier and meaner and more derisive the longer we stayed together. At the end, I left him. I didn't want to but I did it because he would not adress the issue. Your update made me cry, what I wouldn't have given to have him have your attitude, and our two kids would still have their parents together.

I know you were probably in such a shitty emotional place that it really took the alcohol to bring those feelings out of you and into the open, but please don't make a habit of this!  Hopefully now that you have aired some of your grievances and are in therapy, which will help you to be more honest and forthright about your feelings, those confessions will be a lot easier to make when you're 100% sober.

I've only seen a handful of people who were able to maintain that kind of work schedule and have it not affect their relationships. One guy skyped home to his wife and kids every day after his 12-13 hour shift and he was just about ready to get out of our line of work pretty soon and get a job in town to spend more time with his family.\n\nWhen you're young and need quick cash then it's fine for a bit but don't let work rule your life. You spend all this time at work, why don't you enjoy it, take it easy, and be able to get away and relax.\n\nI'm actually glad I got out of my industry (after being able to wipe out my debts) and moved to another career patch even though it's lower paying (for the time being) but I actually have a career path that gives me a real work/life balance.",

I took some advice I received on this post and decided we needed to take action. I couldn't stand having this guy be around anymore, receiving praise from his coworkers while none of them know what was truly happening. I talked with a few of my coworkers about it and we started looking into our options. Our company offers a hotline to report incidents just like this, completely anonymously. Finally, after a little bit of debate, one of us called the hotline and reported the incidents. We waited to see what would happen. Eventually the security team reached back out to him and asked him for more information. They said they are building a case and they need as much information as possible. After hearing this, the rest of the us decided to report our cases to further aid in the building of the case. I remember the security officer telling me that things are going to \"move quickly.\"\n\nWell I guess in a big company they don't fuck around with this. Less than a month after the initial report was filed the creepy asshole was fired. The entire department was told to meet in a meeting room real quick for some news and management laid it on us that he was gone. He was a highly respected coworker who was really good at his job. The news was met with shock, especially since some layoffs had occurred recently. I remember my heart absolutely racing when the news was being given. I couldn't believe that it was happening. I really didn't think some anonymous reports would lead to action so quickly. The creepy guy was friends with some of the women in our department, and he was texting them constantly saying that he was innocent. He quit pretty quickly once they weren't having any of what he was saying. The rumors of why he was fired spread really quickly around the office, but fizzled out faster than I was expecting. I really thought this would be going around the office for months, but after two weeks or so people stopped talking about it and things returned to normal.\n\nI really appreciate the advice on here. It was extremely helpful in my decision, and it worked out for the best.\n\nTLDR: If you want to take pictures of your coworkers in the bathroom and you like your job, then maybe reconsider. Coworker fired for this very thing after being reported.",

But hear me out. \n\nI have my own home with her brother, and all three of our bedrooms and our only bathroom is upstairs. The only reason anyone has to be upstairs is to go to the toilet, or possibly to my daughter's room if their kid is playing there too. \n\nI've noticed whenever my SIL comes over, she just walks on through to our room, which I kinda feel like is an invasion of privacy. All the clean laundry comes to our room, and if we have visitors we tuck away a few things in our room so it's invariably the messiest room in the house and the one we least want people in. But no matter what she's always in there, and seemingly for no reason at all. It's usually to 'see my paint colour' (it hasn't been painted in over a year) or 'see the cat' or 'look out the front window'.\n\nThe worst was today - I came home from work early as I'm feeling ill. I knew she was coming over with her kids and my partner kindly said I could stay in bed and not worry about coming down to be sociable etc, especially with the kids over it's a lot when you have a headache. He said he just wasn't gonna mention I was home at all because the kids would come try and chat and play if they knew I was here.\n\nSo I'm listening to them play in the next room and SIL comes up to check on them and sees they are all fine. THEN SHE OPENS MY BEDROOM DOOR. I've stuck my head under the covers and she hovers then closes it again. Wtf?? Why is she always opening my bedroom door like what is she expecting to see? \n\nI just feel like because we're all adults it's an unspoken boundary, you don't just hit up someone's bedroom without having an invite to come see or a legit reason. \n\nAm I weird for thinking this is irritating and not being able to make any sense out of it? Also I know that everyone is going to suggest I just talk to her about it but how awkward is that? 'Yo I know you're in you're 30s now but please stay out of my room?'. I have tried in the past to hint that I hate having folk in there because that's where all my laundry goes for ironing and all the spare toys get stored to create extra play room. She don't give a shit. \n\n**TL;DR: SIL always enters my bedroom unasked and this is where I hide all my messy shit when people are over. How can I ask her without sounding weird and accusatory?**",

But I want you to encourage you to learn how to do this, precisely because you sound like you don't know how to approach it (you've been hinting rather than being direct) and you mention you have a daughter.
