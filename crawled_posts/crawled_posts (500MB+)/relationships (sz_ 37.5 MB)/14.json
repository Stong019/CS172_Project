        "selftext": "tl;dr My husband and I got into an argument and he left for almost 2 days.\n\nHusband is 36m, I'm 29 f. We've been together for over a decade. We have a 7 month old daughter.\n\nIn the past, we have normally resolved arguments by taking a few hours to cool off and discussing. However, this situation is different and I don't know what to do.\n\nWe flew back from his parent's house the day before yesterday. While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said \"do NOT say those things in front of MY child.\" It was loud enough that people were staring and I was really embarrassed.\n\nThen we got home and I put the baby to bed and then he tried to initiate sex with me. I told him I wasn't in the mood after what happened at the airport, and he lost it and said I shouldn't put sex in his head by calling him sexy and then not have sex with him. I told him I would've be up for sex had he not snapped at me! He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. I tried calling him and just got a text back that said he wants space to cool off so he \"doesn't do something he'll regret.\" I told him to come home NOW as I've been alone with the baby for 2 days and it's New Years but he won't.\n\nShould I give him space or give him an ultimatum?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the comments. A lot has happened since I posted this and the situation is being resolved. I'll post an update when I can. Happy and healthy new year to you all.",

            "I'm sorry you're going through that. It seems like there's something going on that's deeper than what's being explained in the story. How he reacted was extremely inappropriate. Has he ever blown his cool like that before in public?",
            ">While we were picking up the bags, I leaned over and whispered to him that it's sexy to watch him lift the bags off the conveyor belt. Our daughter was asleep in the stroller when this happened, and I whispered quietly so she wouldn't have heard me even if she were awake. He snapped at me really loudly and said \"do NOT say those things in front of MY child.\"\n\n...she's seven months old. Is he aware she has absolutely no idea what either of you are even saying at this point, even if she HAD been awake?\n\n>He turned and left our house and I haven't seen him in almost two days. \n\nwtf? is he always volatile like this? this is fucked up, would he go to counseling?",
            "He thinks \"his\" 7mo child can understand what you said? Or that calling your husband sexy is somehow wrong even if you said it in front of YOUR (plural) 16-year-old child? \n\nAnd leaving for two days? Something major is up. This is COMPLETELY out of line of him. Can someone come and stay with you and the baby? (**Weird the baby hasn't been HIS for the last two days.**) Do you have a car of your own and access to money? That line about \"something I'd regret\" is chilling. ",
            "If this behavior is really out of the ordinary, I'd be scared. I'd be calling friends, family,  etc. to find out if he's staying with them. Then I'd be getting my affairs in order. If he's still gone by Wednesday with no communication with you or other friends/family I'd be calling him in as missing. Call in backup to help you with your baby. Even if he comes back, something is clearly not right. I'd proceed with caution. I don't think it's unreasonable to require counseling upon his return. ",
            "Wow, that's super out of line to leave your wife and infant daughter for two days to \"cool down.\"  Time for that kind of teen-aged drama and antics has come and gone.\n\nHave you asked him how long he plans on being gone?  Did he elaborate on what it is he may do that he might regret?  Has he indicated anything that might lead him to have this kind of a childish and irresponsible reaction (leaving your wife and infant for two days with no contact is very irresponsible)?\n\nMaybe because of my age and disposition in life, but I would tell him that at this point, before coming back he needs to answer these questions.  I'd personally want answers to those before letting anyone who had that kind of outburst around my child again.  Does \"doing something he might regret\" include violence or other abusive behaviors?  Cuz that sure seems like the implication?\n\nThat \"do something I might regret\" comment and angrily storming off for two days is not exactly the behavior of a mentally stable person.  Is he going through something he hasn't shared with you that he may need help with before being around you two again?",
            "\u201cSomething he\u2019ll regret\u201d? That sounds like a threat. Why on earth is he threatening his wife and the mother of his baby? Something is very wrong. ",
            "If I left my wife and one year old by themselves for two days over something like this she'd tell me to not bother coming back. ",
            "Could he be seeing someone else on the side? He\u2019s been distant, went a long time without sex after you gave birth. He picked a fight after being away with you. If he wanted to see his side chick, blowing up at you over absolutely nothing (you were playfully flirting, his blowup was absolutely absurd) then storming off for a few days gives him the opportunity to see her. Just a thought, ",
            "Gotta ask the question, do your in laws approve of you? Have they been whispering poison in his ear on your trip there? Is your husband usually tense and snappish after interacting with his folks?",

            "I have been known to leave the house to cool down when I'm super-duper pissed off with my husband.  And that's like, four hours, tops.  I go out, I get a meal, read through a magazine or a book if my Kindle was in my bag, or I just walk around to let activity help me get under control.\n\nKnow what it take to get me there?  My husband seriously, super-duper fucking up.  Like something that's going to cost us thousands of dollars or he did/said something really insensitive and hurtful.  Not a silly whispered sexy comment in public, and then a refusal of sex.\n\n2 days is NOT cooling-down from intense anger.  2 days is he wants an escape from his life.  Either nothing shady is going on and he was just stressed out after the holidays for some reason (did something go down with his parents?), or as someone else posited, he has someone else.  So either he's got an inappropriate way of dealing with stress or he's getting ready to pack his bags.",
            "Badly executed excuse to see the other woman for new year? I hope this isn't the case OP. He sounds immature either way. ",
            "Two days? And that \"something he'll regret\" line? It is a counseling or divorce scenario because this is not something that should be how you function as a family. Better to find out now if he's able to be mature enough to recognize that this is a problem that needs solving before you're five years down the line & he's going out for a pack of cigarettes forever.

            "I have a strong feeling this relationship is abusive, and you don't have any frame of reference for a healthy relationship because you've been with him since you were a teenager. \n\nYou say he's never snapped at you in public. Well, has he done it privately? Is it like him to just leave and give the silent treatment? Has he made threats before, because that text sure read like one. Do you have any decision making ability in the relationship? Do you have a job? Friends you hang out without him once in a while? Does he typically help with the baby? \n\nMaybe you should take some online quizzes and read some resources about unhealthy relarionships, and see if anything rings true. If it does, individual counseling for you may be more helpful than couples counseling for now. Someone can help you establish how healthy your relationship is and what to do for yourself and your child if it's not. ",
            "Something else is happening here,  I would not be eager for him to come home.  Counseling would be mandatory. Sleeping separately until you know where he was and with whom as well.  If you and your child can go somewhere do so. Let him sweat it out. ",

And/Or he picked a fight to get out of the house. \n\nIt escalated so bizarrely that I\u2019d bet he\u2019s cheating. I\u2019ve seen this type of behavior before. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t do anything at this point actually. I\u2019d sit back, shut my mouth, and wait and see. No more calling. No more begging. No more ARGUING either. \n\nWait and see. \n\nHe\u2019s either going to return and attempt to \u201creturn\u201d to normal - at which point you\u2019ll be able to have the divorce or counseling conversation. Or he\u2019s going to never return, over something so petty that was technically his fault, that you\u2019ll ALSO get your answer. \n\nOr the truth that\u2019s being done in the dark is going to come to light. Again giving you instant clarity on what to \u201cdo\u201d.\n\nWait and see. Because something is gonna pop soon I\u2019d say. ",

            "Have you checked his credit card and or debit card records? If you haven't, I would STRONGLY suggest that you go online and check what he has been spending and where he has been spending it. Look at his cell phone records to see who he has been calling/texting and how often. Take screenshots of all of the balances in all of your checking, savings, and investment accounts. It's possible that he's having a breakdown of some kind, but it's much more likely that he's cheating and getting ready for a breakup. Make sure you cover your bases to protect yourself and your child. You may also want to make a quick phone call to an attorney as soon as you can reach one.",

An unusual stressor, something he won't or can't tell you, who knows. It could even be something medical.\n\nBy not letting you contact him he's also not thinking about \"his\" child.

He's stressed, mad, and the only thing that could make it work was him disappearing for 2 days, something he's never done. Pressure from another woman to be with her for the holidays would make sense, it also would tell me she doesn't know exactly what's going on either. Text, call, message him on Facebook whatever, but tell him his ass better be home in 24 hrs or locks will be changed  stuff would be moved to storage or thrown out, and a petition of abandonment will be filed with  her courts.

THIS is the problem.  You had a disagreement, and he straight up disappeared.  For two days (so far).  You have no idea where he is, what he's doing, or when he'll be back, and he won't say.  He straight up abandoned you with a 7 month old for two days during the holidays.\n\nHell yes it's ultimatum time.  People need to be able to depend on their partner.  Honestly your disagreement is pretty minor, and he's acting like a spoiled child.  Worse, because a spoiled child is unlikely to disappear for two days.  If this is how he's going to act when you have a minor disagreement, it means that you honestly can't depend on him for ANYTHING when times are tough.  He'll just bail again.",

He did this because he needed an excuse to be away from you for a few days, and he needed you to be painted as the bad guy so that you're upset about that smokescreen instead of understanding that, in the days leading up to this fight, he made plans to be with someone else - and that's exactly where he is right now. He is with someone else. He's not \"cooling off\", he's hot and heavy with someone else. Right now.\n\n\n\n\nPlease see this for what it is. Don't let yourself be gaslit.",
            "I\u2019ve been married 13 years. We have three young children. Life can get stressful as hell. We\u2019ve argued, we\u2019ve had minor blow ups at each other, we\u2019ve gotten right pissed at each other, but we\u2019ve never treated each other like that. \nI would never think of just storming out and disappearing for 20 min, let alone 2 days. Disappearing like that is not ok, that is abandonment. I would also never blow up at her in public like that even with a reason. \nIn my honest opinion from the details given it really sounds like something is going on with him that he\u2019s hiding.  Blowing up at someone like that without reason is usually a sign of guilt or the stress of secrets eating away at a person. This doesn\u2019t necessarily have to mean an affair, it could be something at work that he\u2019s not wanting to share or is ashamed of. Either way he\u2019s hiding something. ",
            "If he has never had a reaction like this, I would ask him to seriously consider having a medical check-up. Unexplained anger, especially prolonged anger, can be signs of a neurological issue. ",

            "Here's what I've gotten from this so far.\nHe's been distant lately you say, but you chalk it up to end of the year crap he has to deal with.\nThere is a recent MAJOR change to the relationship dynamic by having a child. \nHe got angry that you said he was sexy. (Hmmmm, that's really weird.)\nHe then initiated sex when he could probably tell you wouldn't be receptive due to you being publicly humiliated like that. He must have sensed your mood, and it was prickly, not inviting.\nA lot of people here are saying he's cheating and although that might not be an idea you would like to entertain it might be the correct one. He did everything to set up this fight just in time to spend New Year's with her. She didn't get much time at Christmas with him so he promised her time over New Year's to make up for it. Seriously, who needs this long to cool off? And he's never had to take days away after a fight before, right?\nHoney, if there's not a side piece he's on a drug/drinkging binge and either way...its splitsville for you two.",
            "What an irresponsible jerk. You don't owe him sex, just because you complimented him. That is idiotic to blow up about, makes no sense. Sounds like maybe something else is going on. Cheating? Where has he been for 2 days?",
            "He snapped at me really loudly and said \"do NOT say those things in front of MY child.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWOW! I feel there is something else going on that you need to find out. Those little small compliments are one of many  ways to keep relationship strong and interesting. I'd expect him to respond with a \"thank you\" or a \"your more sexy\" kind of thing. I feel so bad for you in this situation. I wouldn't jump to the divorce question right away though, but I would question everything at this point. For him to leave you with a baby to take care of is irresponsible and unnecessary. Counselling is a good first step.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also want to add that men also suffer from PPD (Postpartum Depression).",

It's scary that he'd get so angry at you for refusing sex.   \n    \nIt's not so much a fight as him emotionally beating up on you to scare you out of standing up for yourself....  \n    \nWhich is about par for the course if you two got together as a teen and a predator. The only thing that doesn't fit is your claim that he has never acted like this in over a decade.  Are you so compliant that there's basically never disagreements?  Do you just bend on everything?",

He may be attracted to younger women. \n\nAlso, it is troubling that he said \u201cMY daughter\u201d not \u201cOUR daughter\u201d and as a previous commenter responded: \u201cshe hasn\u2019t been his daughter for the last two days\u201d because he hasn\u2019t been home. \n\nSomething more is going on here...",

You were still a developing and impressionable teenager and he was a fully-grown man from the get go. Oftentimes this power imbalance is abused.\n\nWhat he\u2019s doing right now is called stonewalling, which is a form of emotional abuse. That line about having to physically leave to refrain from doing something he\u2019ll regret is threatening and Not Okay.\n\nPlease seek domestic abuse resources.",
            "Personally, I\u2019d let him be and see what he does. It would give me a better idea of what to do. If he does come back, I would tell him we need to have a conversation immediately. This would include discussion of the original incident as well as his abandonment of you and your child. If he refused to do that, then I\u2019d be saying we should go to counseling. If he refused to do that, then maybe divorce. If he doesn\u2019t come back? Maybe find my own counselor and a lawyer. \n\nI would avoid ultimatums. Usually they just make people want to rebel and they do something even more stupid. \n\n\nEdit: I wanted to also express that I\u2019m sorry this happened to you, especially during the holidays. I\u2019d imagine you\u2019re feeling stressed, hurt, angry, and maybe scared. Let yourself feel what you feel. ",

Also, don't allow him to come home and don't ask him too. \"Something I'll regret\" is a very clear threat, and too many people are murdered by their spouses over a mistress for you to not at least be cautious about this and consider it a possibility, especially since he is acting out of character.

Having a side chick alone doesn't necessarily doom the relationship, but being OK with hurting the main one's feelings in favor of the side one does, because it indicates the main one isn't a #1 priority anymore like she should be.\n\nThese are all just suggestions, however. Confront him to ask if any of this is true. If at least one of these suggestions is, then I'm very sorry to say that, but your relationship has a close to 0% chance of survival.

            "It seems like there is something going on behind the scenes tbh, people who blow up for no reason like that usually do so because they're guilty or something similar in my opinion. Maybe he's hooked up with someone when he was home visiting parents and so you coming onto him has made him feel guilty and lash out at you?\n\nAlso don't know if it's just me but the whole 'you called me sexy one time today so now you owe me sex thing' is ridiculous. I know he didn't say that in as many words but it's certainly implied on the way he acted and thats a huge red flag for me.\n\nI think if I were in your situation I would invite him to have a calm sit down conversation with him and would set up the following rules\n 1) do not interrupt me when I'm trying to say my piece, \n2) do not raise your voice at me and\n 3) do not walk out again.\n\n And then I would bring up how and why I think his behaviour was inappropriate. How in the airport it was disrespectful of him to raise his voice so loudly in a public place and how it hurt my feelings that he seemed to have no regard for my feeling or embarrassment in that situation.\n\nI would then apologise about what I said, and would make sure that he knew that I didn't know he was so concerned about those kind of things been said in front of the baby, but that I had already checked that he/she was asleep and wouldn't hear, and said it quietly under my voice anyway. \n\nThen I would bring up how unfair it is that he didn't respect my wishes not to have sex and in fact inferred that I owed him sex after my comment at the airport because it turned him on. I would impress upon him that even if I had explicitly said at the airport that I wanted to have sex with him later that day, that does not mean that I owe him any sort of apology or sexual favours of any kind should the evening arrive and I not be in the mood anymore. And I would make sure he understood just how entitled his comment was regarding this subject. \n\nAnd then finally I would explain that walking away from your wife and 7 month baby is not okay, it's disrespectful and shows a real lack of judgement and empathy. And a real lack of care for your infant child. If a slightly inappropriate whisper and a refusal to have sex with him warrants abandonment then he has to really reorganise his priorities because what that says to me is that his pride, ego and sexual fulfilment are more important than his wife and babies happiness. I would also express that if he were to repeat that behaviour (of up and leaving) I would look into marriage councelling and maybe even divorce. \n\nI'm sorry I've dragged on so much but I hope this is helpful \n\n\n",

In any case, you did NOTHING wrong from what you've related. \n\nI agree with the poster who said do not even suggest divorce until you have your ducks in a row - financially and otherwise. Frankly, if you're even considering it - talk to a lawyer, now. \n\nWhen he comes back - and he will - you're going to have to have a serious conversation about what happened. It's not even about the material part of the argument - it's about the leaving. That is a disproportionate response.

Personally, I think it\u2019s good for kids to know their parents are into each other. But also how could he be surprised that you turned him down for sex after he put you down? And how could she only be HIS daughter and then take off for two days? I really hate when men do this, refusing to deal with emotional conflict and then shutting down.

            "Well he's either cheating or is having some sort of emotional breakdown..  \nIs his job super stressful?\n\nHas there been any suspicious or eyebrow raising things happen to suggest he might be cheating?  \nLike suddenly \"doing overtime\", suddenly \"going to the gym\"  \n\n\nNo one that's normally placid in nature blows up like that for no reason...  \n",

            "Getting upset and snapping was weird but leaving you for two days alone is unacceptable. ",
            "His reaction is always your answer.  It\u2019s always there for you to see.  He\u2019s got guilt all over himself.  He blows up cause he wants to fight but also guilty.  He initiates sex cause he knew you would say no.  He wanted to leave.  I think he\u2019s cheating.  That\u2019s what I think.  I also think he\u2019s got some narcissistic tendencies mixed with a little bit of sociopath.",
            "Imo, there is something more going on than meets the eye. Have you ever suspected him of cheating?",
            "This is absurd behavior. This is change-the-locks and put 911 on speed dial if he shows up.\nHe ABANDONED you and your baby, and threatened you. He doesn't deserve to just waltz back in.\nYou'll need the advise of a lawyer, of course, but do Google abandonment of spouse.",
            "Some abusers don\u2019t get abusive till they have children. Even if you\u2019ve not experienced this before, is he particular about how he likes stuff? Does he dictate how things should run in your household? Are you in any way removed from your family and/or friends? These all might be little red flags to an abusive streak. \n\nEven if he is not, what he has done is abusive and shows a real lack of maturity. He has basically threatened you with violence in a really vague way, and is manipulating you by leaving you alone with the baby. He is making you feel unsafe and using that to control you. Not cool. \n\nI\u2019d be worried about saying \u2018counselling or divorce\u2019 because of what he could possibly do to you if you bring up divorce. I think you should say that he needs to attend therapy of some sort, and if he refuses (and especially if his behaviour gets worse at the mention of it) quietly prepare to get away from him. I might be overthinking it, but it worries me. ",
            "Doing something he'll regret sounds like a threat. Take it seriously. \n\nHe built up this whole fight out of absolutely nothing and then disappeared for two days. All the comments about cheating have a basis in reality. I realised this was a strategy my abusive ex employed when he wanted to go fuck someone else only after I left the relationship and someone told me they spotted him with someone else while we were dating. I couldn't believe it at first, but then I could see the pieces of the puzzle more clearly. For him, it has the added bonus that it's a way of controlling your behaviour, of making you feel crazy and guilty and trying to \"fix\" yourself in order for it to not happen again. But it always does. \n\nDemanding sex!!!! Blaming you for \"getting sex into his head\"?! This. This is so sickly and wrong! He is not entitled to sex, I hope that much is clear. And to start a fight over what he feels you owe him in that moment? That is a flaming red flag! Say things stopped at this point and you went down your usual path of cool-down and discussion- in that moment I would have asked for couple therapy.\n\nAnd now reaching the point of his initial reaction- oh dear. Yelling at you in a public space over nothing?! a.your child was asleep. b. it's a seven months old baby who does not understand talking to that level, let alone sexy talk! c. You whispered in his ear! Did he refuse to have sex with you during the pregnancy out of fear of poking the baby as well??\n\nSay he really did believe it was out of line of you, despite all the above. First of all, screaming is never acceptable, more so in a public space. Secondly, he should have, could have addressed the issue with calm afterwards. He didn't. If he was so outraged by your comment, how did you get sex into his head? He can't act both outraged and turned on, on the flip of a coin, it doesn't make sense. Something needs to happen in-between the two instances for the transition to make sense.\n\nAnyway, I'd say, don't ask him to come home. Start making arrangements for yourself and the baby to be safe, in case he does further escalate, because he seems capable of it. Under normal circumstances, divorcing over a fight seems like an overreaction. These are not normal circumstances.",
            "Honey the ball is in your court right now. He bailed, even if only temporary. You do what you need to do to be at peace, and for you and your child to feel safe.\n\nYou deserve love. You deserve support. You deserve to be nurtured and respected. Remember that, and don't ever settle for anything less. For each man who denies those things, there is another out there ready to give them to you. It's important that both you and your husband recognize that.",

            "19F meets and dates 26M. Yeah he groomed you, even if he wasn\u2019t aware of it himself. Sounds like he\u2019s always been abusive and is evolving. Nothing that you are disclosing is normal in a relationship. Overreactions, absolutely yes. Disappearing for two days over being denied sex (due to one\u2019s own actions)? Absolutely irrational. BIG RED FLAG. ",
            "Wow,so you compliment him and he snaps,makes me wonder if he's not hiding something from you and decided to use this moment as an opportunity as a catalyst for him wanting to leave you ",
            "At this point, I wouldn\u2019t let him return home before he has some answers and explanations for this shitty behaviour. \n\nIf he wants to come home, he can meet you at a counsellor\u2019s office and you can discuss it there. ",
            "Honey, this man sounds a lot like my ex-brother-in-law. His being super possessive of the baby (\"*my* baby\") is one of the things that drove me up a wall. He punched holes in the wall at one of their former residences. After some therapy, I could see why he did some of the things he did. But I'm so glad my sister finally got up the nerve to break it off. Unfortunately, there is a kid now, so our family will never be totally free of him. Even now, a year after the divorce proceedings have started, I am seeing something new I nbn how abusive he really was and how nasty of a person he is and always was.\n\nHoney, I hope that you can find out where he has been and why he reacted in such a manner. I'm only tell you about my ex-bil just in case you notice any of the same behaviors/attitudes in your husband that are seemingly coming from nowhere. Good luck!",
            "There\u2019s a chance he wanted to get away from you and the child so he can be with himself. However that\u2019s not fair for you. He needs to be responsible for what he\u2019s put you through. Space to cool off and it\u2019s been 48 hours? What a load of shit",

I think you need to really consider how to prevent this from every happening again, from the snapping in public to not being able to work through issues together.",

            "Oh, I've got a gut feeling that's head having an affair.   When SOs bail like that over something final it's often bc they've got a backup to run to. Regardless, get your affairs in order.  Document everything you own, the time he had taken and not been in contact with your daughter. Take money or if the bank and hide it with family.  Protect yourself in case this goes tits up. ",
            "Sounds an awful like he is projecting on to her. The public freak out at the airport over a \u2018sexy\u2019  comment, and then trying to initiate sex when they got home, throwing a temper tantrum  when she said no & leaving for 2 days, knowing she\u2019s alone with a 7 month old baby??  \n\nWhere is his concern for *their* daughter now? It\u2019s very telling when people refer to their children as *mine*\n\nSounds like he\u2019s hiding something himself.  This is bigger than just that one argument & hun abandoning you for two days.\n\nI would suggest couples counseling but something tells me he isn\u2019t going to go for that. Wishing you luck OP - I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. ",

            "I have been married for 24 years.  We still fight sometimes but nothing serious.  If my wife were to call me sexy I would be as flattered as a teenage boy.  There is definatly an underlying cause for this blow up.  I was diagnosed with depression over 14 years ago.  I was being a terrible husband at the time.  I have worked with my Dr and he has successfully been treating me since.  Every few years I have a bad spell like what you described and head straight to the Dr. to change treatment or just talk. My beautiful wife has finally began to understand that the problem isn't her, but a treatable condition.  My heart never stops loving her even though my brain causes me to act like an asshole.  Depression is sometimes hard to see and hard to understand by family and friends, but it is very real.  It kills relationships and kills people and ruins those left behind.  Get to a trusted Dr with your husband.  Maybe it is not depression,  but if somebody with depression says hey that sounds just like me... it is time to help the one you love.\n\nGood luck ",
            "As a man myself I have heard if other guys purposely cause an argument so they have the excuse to go off and do something to other than be a decent husband. The timing of this makes me suspicious. Worth a consideration in my opinion ",
            "Is there any chance he was sexually abused as a kid? Or someone close to him was when he was younger? A lot of people are assuming cheating, which is could be, but exploring another issue here would be worth your time. Good luck. ",
            "Hey darling how are you doing this morning? Are you feeling any better? ",
            "I see that there is an update and it's \"being resolved,\" but there is literally no excuse for abandoning you and your child for two days with no contact. That's unforgivable. He had better spend alllllll of 2019 apologizing!",
            "Am I right to assume you started dating him when you were 18 and he was 25? At that age, that's a pretty big age difference. Often, when I see men looking for younger women, it's because they like to be in control. Maybe he controls the finances, \"takes care of you\" by making enough money that you don't have to work, maybe he doesn't like a lot of your friends, maybe he doesn't like it when you're independent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe relationship he signed up for was likely where he was in charge. Having a baby makes a lot of people grow up fast. It's possible since the baby came, you've been more independent. He's trying to wrap his head around a wife who doesn't always bow to his knowledge and experience. My dad did a similar thing to my stepmom, so let's see if this story sounds familiar to you at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad met my stepmom, we'll call her Flower, when she was 17 as my new babysitter. Dad was 25, I was 9. Dad fell instantly in love. Flower had never lived outside of her parent's house, never even left her home state. Dad was a well-traveled anthropologist, and she was fascinated by his worldliness and knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey married just after she turned 18. Hardly knew each other a year, but they were so in love. After Flower moved in with us, she started to see how dad treated me when no one else was around. She didn't like it, and they sent me to my mother while they \"worked things out\". The next time I saw Flower, she was so tired. Once I was gone, the mental abuse slowly turned to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPoor Flower had endured over 4 years of abuse. When we got to the house, I saw how crazy it really was. They'd had no luck having a child of their own, but still, dad wouldn't let her work. Every time she picked up a job, he would force her to quit for some imagined reason. Finally, she found a job online. She could work from home and dad wouldn't be able to find an excuse to make her stop. He didn't like the privacy that she had in her office, so he took the door off. She was only allowed to take naps in the living room with her head on the side of the couch that he could see. She wasn't allowed to go anywhere alone, she wasn't allowed to have friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe fought hard to be able to perform as a musician once or twice a month, but that was her only solace. When she was in her mid-twenties, Flower started to stand up for herself more, and finally threatened to leave. My father ran away and called her from a hotel. He said if she left, he would kill himself. Another attempt to re-establish control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen he figured out she was driving to her parent's house, he took the next flight to get ahead of her. Tried to ambush her, acting like it was a loving gesture. Thankfully, Flower escaped. My dad now has a habit of preying on younger, less experienced women. He's turning 50 soon and just finished going through a hard divorce with his 30-year-old wife.",

You should NEVER have to worry about your husband (or wife) saying they won\u2019t see you so that they won\u2019t do something they\u2019ll regret, or that they will leave you alone with your baby for two days. That\u2019s just plain weird and creepy. I don\u2019t have any advice to offer, but I hope you and your daughter enjoy your New Year\u2019s eve. ",

            "Being a parent is something new for both of you so its normal it brings new relationship challenges, and parents tend to be more tense and \"try harder\" with their firstborn . And airports tend to be pretty stressful so maybe thats why he was on edge?   But you are definitively on your right to not be in the mood for sex after that.  And  the holidays tend to be stressful and put people on weird moods.  Dissappearing is not normal, but if hea never been like thia maybe he feels ashamed of his reaction?\n\nBy \"not doing something he'll regret\" i hope he means \" i want to cool off so i can resolve this calmly and not fuck up more\" and is not actually trying to intimidate you or threaten you with whatever. You know him so you know more or less what he actually means. \n\nWhen talking to him about the issue, use non accusative communication. Express your feelingw using \"I\" statements, and if you can or see reason to it, try expressing your understanding of his reaction and approach the issue with forgiveness and an open heart. \n\n\nAlso remember that people on here tens to be fatalists (myself included), dont jump to conclusions until you get a hold of him, but open the lines of communication and ask if there might be something else that might have triggered his reaction.",

            "It seems to me it isn't anything you said or did. It is something else bothering him. Men internalize emotions. We don't outwardly like to express them. Women usually like opening up and talking things over, us men prefer to just bury it. We still have and feel emotions, we just deal with them differently. Most arguments couples have is the husband/boyfriend doesn't talk enough. Communication, or lack thereof is the biggest problem. We men keep things to ourselves and may open up to a guy friend, but we are sometimes to proud, or just don't want to be a burden, so we don't talk to our ladies about our problems. He is going through something, because if he doesn't normally fly off the handle like that, then something is eating him up inside. That is making him lash out.\n\nIt's not about what you did or said. His reaction to your whisper in front of your daughter, is the symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. He probably has something he is dealing with physically, mentally, emotionally, but he wants to figure it out in his head himself. If he has any guy friends, call them up and see if they can talk to him about it, maybe he'll open up to them. You are his wife. The love of his life. He doesn't want to admit he has a problem, because he doesn't want to appear weak to you. He wants you to always come to him, he doesn't want to come to you to fix a problem when he thinks he can do it by himself. I am a man, so I would know, because I have done the same.\n\nUnless you can find a way, to get him to talk to you about it. You know him better than anyone, you should know what it takes to get him to tell you what's bothering him.

[Here's my original post from five years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3fnzui/me_35_m_with_my_sister_42_f_siblings_for_35_years/).\n\nThe discussion was really helpful, and at one point I had my therapist read that thread. Thanks to everyone who chimed in. \n\nSince that post, I have not been in contact with my sister, except for incidentally at a few family events, where we had minimal interaction. My other family is conflicted, but they seem to understand that neither of us wants to be in each others' lives any more, despite them wanting us both in theirs.\n\nI've worked on this issue specifically in therapy, which has helped me develop some insight into those messages. Next year I will be as old as my sister was when she wrote me those abusive messages (there were a few followup messages I didn't include in the original post.)\n\nI don't regret cutting her out. I do regret having had a toxic person for a sibling. Looking back I recognized that her over the top email was part of a few lifelong behavioral patterns. I realized that basically, despite our biological similarities and having been raised in the same household, we are simply not compatible people.\n\nI hope one day she will develop her own insight, recognize her abusive behavior patterns, and reach out to try to repair or reestablish a relationship with me. But I'm not holding my breath for this to happen, and I'm not interested in reaching out to ask her if she'll consider trying to improve things. Not having her in my life in the years since has actually improved the quality of my life: there's been a lot of unnecessary drama and hard feelings that I'd been used to having to handle that I simply don't with her gone.\n\nAt this point I anticipate only seeing her at a few more funerals. Would have been nice to have a good relationship with a sibling, but I do not have that with her and I don't believe I ever will.\n\n**tl;dr**: Cut abusive person out and life has improved\n\nEDIT: I am humbled by your responses.

And how good social skills, good interpersonal skills are so much more important. \n\n\nI\u2019m not going to comment on the validity of this, I wanted to say, her original wording REEKED of her having waited a long time to tell you off and specifically, to let you know  you weren\u2019t hot shit just for being so smart (and smarter than her). She really tore into you and with VENOM.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with such a bitter and jealous sister. Happy to hear you are doing well.",
            "I had to go no contact with my parents for some of the reasons you labelled here. The patterns of abuse took me 20 years to realize, but since I have gone no contact with them, I have also had a decrease in both drama, and having to brace myself to snide remarks and disrespect at every turn. My quality of life has increased so much since cutting them out, and I am glad to see that yours has improved since making this decision. I'm still getting used to my Wife's family being so accepting and  helpful. It has taken me 5 years to grow even a bit comfortable with their help and company, as I keep expecting them to turn on a dime and lash out at me. It is posts like this that help me realize that I too made the correct decision, even if there is pangs of guilt at times. I'm happy for you!",
            "This is a pretty popular post, so I don't know if you'll have the time to respond. I just have a couple of questions. \n\n\\- Did you talk to the school about Jenny? Obviously, the mean letter that your sister wrote would have been too personal. However, did you address some of it, and say something like, \"Since I'm being gossiped about and not valued, I'll sub elsewhere\"? \n\n\\- And this is a question that you've probably asked yourself throughout the years: Why does your sister hate you and your late-father so much? Is she jealous of your education? Does she just hate men in general? Was she Ms. Cool Cheerleader and hated being associated with an uncool brother (if you were uncool in school)? \n\nI'm glad that you're doing better. Thanks for sharing your posts to the Reddit community.",
            "I didn't get to see your original post when it was posted, but reading through it I had a burning question -- how is your relationship with your other sister?  What does she think of this?  Your older sister implicated her in the email by saying it was her that pushed her to tell you all those things.  Is your other sister aware of this fact?  Have you shown her that email?\n\nAlso, very happy you are doing better after cutting her out of your life.  Lots of people who tell me they have issues with family members are always hesitant to do so and it continues to cause years and years of pain for them to not cut them out.",
            "Teaching is such a hard profession, but the best teachers are ones who teach with passion and teach from the heart. Thank you for caring. Best wishes on where life\u2019s journey takes you.",
            "I just read your previous post and the message your sister sent you was sheer twaddle. Rather than speak to you directly as problems arose, the other teachers left the trouble you supposedly caused to pile up, by extension letting their pupils fall further behind and endure your pedagogic terror for longer? And then the first and only time you hear about it is from your sister who just so happens to be friends with one of the teachers? Did your sister expect you to believe this?\n\nShe cooked up an elaborate lie to cut you as deeply as possible. No wonder you've been better off without her!\n\nMinor complaint: I think you made a typo between this post and last because the ages don't add up. The post you made five years ago has you and your sister at ages 35 and 42 respectively, but 44 and 50 now.\n\nEDIT: It looks like you've already addressed the age issue. Fair enough.",
            "Just read your email for the first time. I can't imagine how horrible you felt after. Nothing constructive is written, all accusations and opinions to try and demoralise you. I hope you not only cut her out but brought it up with your boss. There is a reason why they called you back everyday and leaving notes is a way of showing you did what you thought was best and no teacher unless they were completely up their own ass would think otherwise. I hope you're still teaching kids every day and give them the tools to grow up and not become your sister.",

I made very clear boundaries with her (basically: be nice to me or don\u2019t speak to me) and she flipped out.\n\nI have found so few people to talk to about this problem. Most people say \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t mean these horrible things she says\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s family, just forgive and forget\u201d. \n\nUnfortunately my sister has  this pattern of hurtful behavior.   She doesn\u2019t believe that I have feelings or can be hurt?  I dunno.  But it sounds like your sister is very similar.  I have also cut my sister almost completely out of my life and things have improved so much.  It\u2019s still painful, but not as bad as before I realized that I did my best, and everything else is on her.\n\nI totally commiserate with you and understand where you are coming from!

            "I had not read your previous post till today, but although I don't have siblings I did have a \"best friend\" who was like that all the way through college. She actually used to provide notes of everything I did wrong when we were out in public, said I needed \"training,\" and generally just made me feel like there was something wrong with me that everybody but me could see. She finally did something so nasty that I stopped being her friend, and a few years after spoke to her for just a few minutes during which time she told me that I had a friend of her sister's in my class and that all the students hated me and that I clearly hadn't \"improved\" at all since college. I haven't spoken to her since. I have no idea why it was so important to her to make me feel like shit 100% of the time and whenever possible, but she can do that to someone else now.

            "Firstly, I am glad that despite it being bitter sweet to have to cut her out of your life (Bitter: She was your older sister, and family is supposed to mean something good - Sweet: You rid your immediate life of a toxic abuser), you're progressing and thriving forward.\n\nSecondly, I missed that first post but by Cthulhu what an insane, nasty, outrageous, unprofessional, hateful thing for her to send. All I can say if there was ONE word in her email that was correct, you would simply not be being hired as a sub teacher, let alone getting positive feedback at all from the kids or the schools.\n\nIt sounds to me like Jenny praised you to her, and this drove her insane with anger and jealousy, so she wrote that poison pen letter to you and made up a bunch of school-yard bully garbage because she KNEW you cared and would take criticism to heart. She picked every word carefully to be as nasty and hurtful as possible, striking at every good thing you did with care to make you feel as bad as possible. None of it sounds like any kind of legitimate criticism, it all reeks of hyperbole, jealousy & vengeance. \n\nIn fact, she's one of the top nasty people I've ever seen. She puts my ex-in-laws to shame, and they sent me a card when my mum died that read \"We're sorry to hear your mother passed away. And even sorrier you will never see her again in heaven because you will be burning in hell.\"\n\nI'm so glad you have been able to let her hateful nastygram go into the trash where it belongs.

            "I'm glad things have seemed to work out for you. After reading the original post, it seems like maybe your sister's friend was a lazy and incompetent teacher, the kind who does the bare minimum with no critical thought whatsoever. The question about sharp objects is a good example of this because, to me, I'd be inclined to agree with you and I would not pay it any mind. Even if I didn't originally catch it and someone else pointed it out, it wouldn't bother me because it's not about me personally. However, if I was lazy and incompetent with no critical thinking skills, and only looked at what the answer key said was the correct answer, then I'd have to go back and give credit to students whose answers I (incorrectly) marked as wrong. \n\n If there were serious deficiencies in your performance, you would not have been asked to come back to a school or your actual supervisors would have notified you of any problems. This person sounds like she just said that because having a teacher who actually tries makes her incompetence stark by contrast. \n\nI teach college students, and while this is a completely different demographic and experience, the types of people who tend to do best are those who are not afraid to appear imperfect, accept (constructive) criticism, and don't take things personally. Those that do terribly are those that like to feel like they have all the answers, are inflexible, unwilling to change and are immune to suggestion. Jenny seems like the latter, which makes me feel bad for her students because they are being intellectually handicapped by being forced into a classroom with her. \n\nI'm assuming, of course, that this is something Jenny actually said and not a bunch of nonsense your sister made up to be petty and evil.",
            "Good for you to get away from your sister. She is not good for you to be around. Such a bully. I honestly think the friend was wrong & unprofessional to talk to your sister like that. Your sister would have been in her ear for years about you so she would have had a bias to begin with. I would have contacted the school to discuss her behaviour. If she didn't discuss any supposed issues with the school so it could be addressed by them, she should not have done it via your sister that you don't get on with. You could have had a open and useful discussion with the school about your teaching skills and any changes that may have been necessary. At the very least the friend could be talked to by the school about dealing with issues and conflict through appropriate channels. She is a bully too and shouldn't treat others this way",

            "that original post was infuriating. i've been a position where i had to organize subs for a few private schools and if anyone complained about a sub like that they would not be called back unless absolutely necessary until I had time to retrain them and observe their progress. After that I would be called in to observe the classes they're subbing and give feedback. There would be a meeting with teachers about constructive criticism and communication with subs.   \n\n\nteachers are always thankful for subs. It's really hard to get time off to do normal shit like go to the bank. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nsorry you had to go through that but glad you are doing better. I know after getting messed up feedback teaching becomes so much more stressful with all those eyes on you and wondering what might be said behind your back. that being said it's easy to tell if elementary students like you because they tell you.",

            "Seeing the original post for the first time and, damn... brutal. But honestly, all I could think was about how they said you needed to be a \"professional role model\", and yet these teachers were talking about you behind your back, making up names, laughing/mocking your notes... kinda seems like bullying to me, and thats harmful to impressionable young kids if they were to ever overhear things. The teachers are the ones who need to grow up and be better role models.",
            "Glad to hear you're doing good man. I have an older brother who's very similar in terms of abusive behavior (and we were best friends when we were little, until our parents divorced and I was stuck living with my dad until the age of 14, so it makes it feel more personal tbh). I just do my best to ignore him and have little to no interaction with him. If one day he reaches out for forgiveness, I'd probably try to rebuild that relationship with him. I hope your sister does one day reach out for forgiveness. Best of luck, u/sisterissuethrowaway !",

I\u2019ve had enough of being shouted at and criticized. \n\nI feel some regret at what will never be but mainly I feel a huge amount of peace.",

            "went thru the 1st post. I will keep it short. your sister was crazy to send you that. the Jenny is probably doing the same course outlines as 5 years ago. schools indoctrinate the youth, and you cant actually help a kid by being a \"good\" teacher. most of the stuff taught , is lies. besides math, gym, maybe ela, most stuff is based off lies or pseudo science. You're lucky to have found another job. learning the law is much more useful. Anyhow ,those people are psycho paths , trying to making you feel like shit, embarrassed, confused, who knows. You were just trying hard. but dude, the outlines are outlines. teachers are all actually fn idiots, no brains. just repeating what they were taught and brain washed with.\nTry to fix the relationship with your sister. But maybe try approaching her. maybe put it to her like this. The teachers of that school and Jenny don't need to come between you and her. Well, quite clearly Jenny is her best friend.... and she is either jealous of teachers or Feels that her own job is inadequate and her own accomplishments are bare. this is such a big topic actually and I can go on forever. but I want to affirm to you you made a great choice becoming law guy. and ditching school. and you are a good dude for trying to help the community and starting with the kids in school. but understand this, schools are dead zones and they're poisoning kids minds with lies anyways. and the teachers are depressed, ill, unhealthy people themselves teaching them, and either the kids don't even wanna learn chz they're brain dead from their Shit diet, their own depressions,  and more, or they just Aren't interested in the stuff being taught because its all bologna. or baloney. affirm to yourself you tried and succeeded. But whatever those teachers said , or whatever Your sister said Jenny said those teachers said, doesn't GO. its all baloney. those depressed ass teachers 5 years ago are where now. still brainwashed themselves, reiterating bullshit to new kids,who still don't care. hhahaha and its actually scary our youth and our children are being poisoned in the mind , indoctrinated, at public schools, because they are sent there, BECAUZE us parents or the parents of these kids can't teach their own. Don't ever feel bad because you \"failed\" in a \"field\" that itself is corrupt and sick. Still, i would recommend trying to fix  the relationship if you're really considering fixing things with your sister,even if you want her to approach you. she won't approach you, women don't approach men after a fight, no not even your sister. so ,you say you're open to her Coming to you and apologizing, NOPE. NOT HAPPENING . but my friend that is your sister, so its actually UP to  YOU to fix it. If she is stubborn let her go tho. \nI got a notification for this feed and felt I had to tap in. stuff like this pisses me off.\n\nTruthtrekker @IG",

In my original, I stated that our relationship was otherwise 'fine', but I see now that I had been deluding myself. My boyfriend never treated me right, and used me more like a mother (did all cleaning, cooking and organising... yes, I made his doctor's appointments). One of the few times he could bring himself to have sex with me, my period started unexpectedly (*really* unexpectedly, as my implant meant I hadn't bled in two years!!) and he continued to bring up how 'disgusted' by me he was for months afterwards and used it as a reason that he couldn't have sex with me.\n\nSo what was the real reason for the abstinence? He was cheating, of course! Found that out after he got stupid drunk at my mother's house, puked everywhere (I cleaned it up) and I tucked him in bed and put his phone on charge... which made the screen light up, and there was a text from her. I got the hell out of dodge and moved in with one of my best friends and his girlfriend.\n\nNow, I'm happy to report that after some dark months of dealing with my first real, painful break-up, my life has been moving in an upward trajectory! I found a much better job, my social life isn't confined to the friends of my partner who hate me, and I have a boyfriend of 9 months who never lets me doubt that he loves me. Guys, he can cook and clean and I don't have to call his doctor or mobile provider. I am so happy. Please, if you feel like you aren't being loved and respected in your relationship, GET OUT OF THERE!! I guarantee someone out there will treat you like a human being!! Thank you to the few who commented, it made me feel better about a shitty situation at the time.\n\nOh, and my current squeeze never lets me go more than a few days without some lovin', so that got better too ;)\n\n**TL;DR** he cheated and it sucked, but not really because he was an awful partner in hindsight. new man much better and my life is more fulfilled :)",

            "This happened to me at 19 which was almost 20 years ago. My boyfriend  always seemed angry with me and he cheated a lot. He was a bad person to the core, inside and out. He used drugs and pawned my class ring. He took advantage of who used to be my best friend while she was drunk. Ran off with an ex girlfriend one night to God knows where. He claimed to be visiting his sick grandma at the hospital. This ex started showing up at his house randomly with me there.  She was obviously angry at my continued presence. I\u2019m sure he told her he would dump me. \n\nThis guy was mean to his dog and cat which I took with me upon conclusion of the relationship. I was so gullible and naive. I remember finding a girls sock in his bed and shrugged it off. I wanted to believe he cared for me. Karma got him. Apparently he was screwing an underage girl a couple doors down and was convicted of statutory rape. He is now a registered sex offender and still an all out looser. \n\nI soon began dating a guy he worked with after he was arrested. He told me everything he knew and I felt sick. He sincerely seemed protective of me then and even when I was still with looser. I kept thinking of that sock I found. He showed up at my house with flowers one day and we attended his court date together hand in hand. Looser saw us and I felt a twisted satisfaction seeing him stare angrily, shackled and unable to do a damned thing. My new guy took the dog and I kept his cat. I took other items to help recoup all my losses from his place with the help of another nice guy who was an acquaintance of his but on my side. I  didn\u2019t stay with the new guy but he did treat me well. I remember running into looser\u2019s grandma at the store and she chastised me for abandoning her grandson saying he wanted me to visit! Ha! No ma\u2019am. I went on to get an advanced degree, a good job and my own everything. I\u2019m now engaged to another awesome guy. \n\nSo yes. Listen to your gut. I never felt any grief for him after all that. It was like a bad dream I woke up from. I just regret ever crossing his path. He sent me a friend request on fb a few years back. Ohh no. Absolutely not. \n\nSorry so long but this is the first time I ever wrote about this. ",

            "Thank you so much I needed this, I was just in a very bad relationship and trying to let go is hard this has definitely given me hope though. ",
            "So often people will come in here and be like \"my boyfriend doex x but our relationship other than this is perfect so please don't tell me to just dump him\" and it always gets me because like, you knew we were going to tell you to dump them. You knew that, because deep down you know that other people wouldn't put up with what you're putting up with, and for some reason you believe that you should. What is that reason? Low self-esteem. And then usually the issue they post is a pretty big red flag for other issues that they are ignoring, much like in yours.\n\nIt's never just about the issue they post about, it's about the issue that's causing the issue they post about; their partner doesn't ever do the dishes? It isn't about the dishes, it's about the partner not caring enough to do the dishes etc\n\nNo one believes in dumping someone over unwashed dishes.

So if a man is turning you down, 1) he\u2019s cheating or 2) the sex is bad. Those are the only 2 reasons a man rejects sex. Now, number 1 is obvious. He\u2019s getting the need met so he doesn\u2019t need it. But number 2? That can be because you\u2019re bad or because he\u2019s insecure about his own abilities. Different roads to the sex being bad, but ultimately the same result. ",

He agreed. I moved out and I've got my own place now. I thought maybe moving out would be the wake up call that was needed to save the marriage, but it wasn't. However, it turned out to be the best thing for all of us. \n\nWe share custody of our children, and they transitioned to public school and are doing very, very well. \n\nI'm doing pretty well, too. It's been hard - and there have been a lot of ups and downs, but it's been worth it. We're all so much happier now, and my ex and I are working really well together to co-parent our kids and we're even friends. We'll always be there for each other, but we're better off apart. \n\nNot the happy ending that I was hoping for, but a happy ending nonetheless.\n\nTL;DR: We split up, things are good now.",

Some people might say that\u2019s so wrong or sexist etc. but there are plenty of people who were happy back then and plenty of people who are happy living like that now.\n\nSounds to me that your husband spent his whole life with you one way and was very happy and content that way. Seems you were not. He probably didn\u2019t really accept that and wanted things to go back to how they were. After or by the time of the separation I\u2019m sure he realized that you were not going to change back. I\u2019m sure he loves you still but as you both seem to realize the lifestyles you want are incompatible.

I am currently in the same boat and like you, I love my husband very much and though splitting up is completely devastating and heartbreaking, it is going to be really good for both of us in the long run. It's hard to let go of someone you love so deeply and have shared so much of yourself with. Kudos to you and thank you for sharing your story.

The most important thing is your children and their parents dont need to be together, but providing that positive model of mature coparenting is so wonderful. \n\nIt\u2019s hard as hell.

            "Reading your original post, I feel like I'm your ex-husband. I worked from home and was miserable because I got no social interactions and my wife would be the only person I talk to. Then she got a job and she is always very social so she does happy hour and other things. Sometimes she'd come home after one or two drinks and I can smell the alcohol and I am just so resentful, and then she drunkenly wants to make out or cuddle and I just hate it. Our sex life took a dive and we started fighting a lot over little things. While I trust her, it's my loneliness that I had a hard time justifying - why be married if your spouse isn't even going to be with you most of the time - and when I bring it up she'd call me controlling.\n\nWe're seeing couples therapy but I feel like we're so far apart now that it might be hard to work things out. Her happiness is when she is doing things and socializing, and my happiness is sometimes doing nothing at all. I'm certainly not as social nor as active as she is. I used to be more active but decided to spend that extra time on developing my career so we don't hang out as much now.",

            "Just be aware of the emotional rollercoaster, and the intense feelings of jealousy you'll feel when he gets his first girlfriend post divorce that you have zero idea where it came from or why you feel it. Try not to let it affect your co-parenting relationship, and at all costs, DO NOT FIGHT WITH HIM IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN.\n\nJust speaking from experience. I thought I was way over him. I called it off. I moved out. I had a new boyfriend shortly after. I thought I was soooooo past him. I really, honestly, would have never taken him back and still won't. But man, when he got with his now fiance, I flipped out, out of nowhere. I got mad at my family for not divorcing him along with me. I looked for everything wrong with her that I could find online and used it against him. I kept our child away so long as he was going to have her around. I went back on my promise not to take our issues to court and instead handle our shit like mature adults. It didn't happen. I ended up getting his custody revoked. He didn't see our child for 2 years because of ME. Our child saw us call each other horrible degrading names, cursing, yelling... it was bad. \n\nI'm not saying *you will do this*, but I learned in family court orientation that it's very common and natural to be on an emotional rollercoaster for some time. All these feelings will come bubbling up to the surface that you didn't think you still had. It finally was making sense, the emotions I was feeling for no good reason. I didn't miss the frustration of being with him, I didn't miss the sexual or emotional aspect of our relationship, or the physical aspect, I didn't miss *him*. But I did miss the fun times we had and realized the new boyfriend wasn't as funny as him or as outgoing and sociable. I missed the shows we would watch together, the rituals we created together, the interests we shared, our friends, the places we would frequent, the activities we were involved in... I missed my old life because it was all I had known for so many years, and the new guy was new and different and nothing like my ex. I missed memories, not the person. So when I learned he finally moved on for himself, all those things I was missing the most, made me jealous to think another woman was getting all of my happy memories. I still don't know what came over me because today we're all really close and best friends. All water under the bridge, as she put it. Nothing about them or their life together makes me feel jealousy today. I'm no longer angry or resentful. We don't fight, or yell, or call each other disgusting names. It just happened like it did, and I don't know why, but I was warned in orientation about it. They just didn't teach us how to deal with it or what to do about it. \n\nI wish I could have been guided on how to handle the feelings. I have a lot of regrets. I could have and should have done better. I nearly made our child forget who dad was in 2 years time. Time they won't ever get back with each other. I should have given us some space, some time to forget or some time to heal, and had my mom deal with meditating pick up and drop off. I shouldn't have gotten so furious when he couldn't pick up our child for the weekend. Instead, I should have just cherished that extra time spent with my child and offered one of my weekends in exchange. I should have allowed myself the time and space to process him having a new girlfriend and understood that no one is perfect and we all have a past. There is so much I wish I had done. \n\nIf it happens, not trying to say it absolutely will, but if it does, remember my words and take a deep breath for yourself and a step back and figure out what is going to be best for your children first and foremost. If you have to remove yourself from his presence, do it, do it until you're ok again. I wish someone would have told me this.",

If you're still interested saving your marriage, I'd like to make a few observations.\n\nFirst, volunteering isn't necessary. When you saw things going downhill, that should have been an easy thing to drop. Between work, school, and homeschooling, you already had way more than the equivalent of a full time job. \n\nSecondly, nursing school is notoriously hard. Your school friends who had free time to hang out probably didn't have families or had more support than you.\n\nThird, if your schedule was packed and it took a toll on your marriage, I believe you could have cut back more somewhere. \n\nIt seems great now since you have freedom to do what you want, you have the promise of a career that you assume you'll love, and you're free from being treated badly. \n\nHowever, the grass always seems greener on the other side... \n\nSounds like your husband had a rough patch and you bailed because you wanted your freedom. And when you had your issues that lasted many years, he stuck by you. \n\nI'm just a stranger on the internet but I think your marriage is still worth fighting for even if it is from far away. \n\nYou gained stability with his support and he gained a successful business with you handling the home front. \n\nHopefully he will understand where he went wrong and try to make things right because you two seem like a good team.",

So to see their need of being the \"man\" of the house not really a priority then it can be hard to handle for some.  It also seems as if there was some jealousy because you had a social life  now, and per your thread, he seems to not have one as developed as you. I hope you were making time for him as well. That will duel a lot of the jealousy. You make time for them but don't make time for him. And vise versa.

Between the comments to both posts and my inbox I have an immense collection of personalized pep talks, which I am referring to whenever I feel down (admittedly, a lot these days). I got advice/stories from all sorts of people - married, single, old, young... Wow. I never thought the internet would bring me this level of support. I just want you guys to know that by just typing up some comments you have made a very real difference in someone's life. Gotta say it feels a little strange receiving 6 reddit gold and making it to /r/bestof just for sharing the worst day of my life, haha. \n\nI got a lot of messages urging me to join redpill. This experience has soured my view of **Alexis.** Not women in general.\n\nI got some messages saying I write too well and this is obviously made up. I have two words for you: I wish. \n\nA clarification on the last update: I wasn't clear about what I see when I walked in. They weren't literally fucking, they were just sitting on the couch with a deer-in-headlights look that was incredibly incriminating and they both went quiet. It was just obviously not a \"hey, guess who dropped by\" situation.\n\nAnyways, onto the update. I've been extremely busy with the semester ending and I took the majority's advice to bury my head in work. I've spent a lot of time at the library because Alexis never goes there.\n\nIn the process of posting the last update I realized how dumb it was that I hadn't contacted Derek and Brooke with my side. I screen-shotted the text from the cool neighbor, Will. (Side note: all names have been changed except Mark because fuck you Mark). Within the minute Derek was blowing up my phone with calls and texts that made it very apparent he didn't know anything. At the same time Alexis was sending texts begging me to meet up with her. I was feeling miserable and sent back a single text to Derek saying I wasn't feeling up to talking, then put my phone away for the night. In the morning I got a text saying to meet him at my favorite restaurant for dinner and drinks on him, assuring me that no one would be there \"not even Brooke.\" I haven't had any appetite since everything went down, but the offer meant a lot and I really did want to see him so I decided to go after classes. \n\nI got to the restaurant first and I had my heart in my throat worrying that Alexis would somehow be there, but she wasn't. Derek came up to me and gave me a big hug and opened with \"Dude, what the fuck.\" So here's where shit gets a bit crazy and dramatic. A lot of you suggested that Brooke might side with Alexis or had been covering up for her the whole time. I wasn't so sure, because while she is closer to Alexis, her and I have been friends for a bit longer. According to Derek, as soon as he told Brooke she was absolutely furious.  In his words: \"I sort of wanted to bitch Alexis out but Brooke took care of that... and then some.\" Remember how I said Alexis came from a conservative small town? Her parents had NO idea that we were living together and she constantly stressed that they couldn't know or they'd cut her off financially. They liked me enough to be polite, but they were constantly worried a relationship would distract her from school and didn't want her getting pregnant or whatever.  Derek said that Brooke demanded Alexis pack her things and find a new place or she'd call up her parents and tell them everything.  Derek told me that later that night Alexis was sitting in the living room hugging a sweater I'd left behind and wailing at the top of her lungs that her life was over when Brooke yelled from her bedroom \"Well maybe you shouldn't have fucked Mark then.\" Imagining that moment was kind of funny.  Brooke's always been a very no-nonsense girl with a hot temper, but I definitely didn't expect this. It was extremely touching that she took the cheating that seriously.  During that dinner all my fears that I'd lost my friends were completely washed away and I was able to choke down a few pieces of sushi.  \n\nWhen we left dinner, Derek promised to let me know when Alexis was gone so I could move back in.  I declined his offer, because 1) Even if she does move out everything in that apartment reminds me of her including Derek and Brooke 2) Alexis and Mark probably fucked in my room, so I really don't want to sleep in it 3) In the current emotional state I'm in I don't want to be third-wheeling a happy couple, even though I'm sure they'd be considerate.  He understood my points but said to let him know if I changed my mind, because Brooke and Alexis' friendship seems to be pretty over. \n\nThis week has been pretty uneventful, but I keep having to dodge Alexis. Luckily, I'm in an undergraduate program that only has 60 students so we have a lot of our classes together. I asked two friends to keep an eye out for her after giving them a sparknotes of the story, and started showing up to class at the last minute.  As far as I know, she only waited outside of one of my classes. I got a text saying \"Bitch has been spotted in front of (classroom). Waterworks in progress. Proceed with caution.\"  I ended up skipping the class, because I didn't know if she was going to leave and I really didn't want to risk it. \n\nLater that night she sent me a really long Facebook message explaining everything from the beginning and it sort of made me sick to read, I contemplating not reading it but once I opened it I just had to.  She said that he'd been flirty with her in the halls (as I mentioned before, he would say inappropriate shit to both girls) and she tried to be friendly back, but it must have come off as flirting because he kissed her mid-sentence one day.  She said she felt guilty that she \"led him on\" and that guilt prevented her from shooting him down in future advances because she felt like it was her fault it happened and she has trouble saying no (???)  She said they'd only slept together 3 times and she hated it, he had pushed her into it (\"not rape, but..idk I never said yes either\") and she was going to end it during the conversation I walked in on.  She said she understood if I needed some time and some space but that she'd do absolutely anything to \"make it right\" and would spend the rest of her life making it up to me by:\n\n* Treating me like a king, I'd never have to cook, clean or do my laundry again\n\n* Give me full access to her phone and passwords.  She even suggested we install Life360 (an app that allows you to track someone's location through their phone) so I would know where she is at all times.\n\n* Cut off all contact with Mark and all her male friends (just for good measure, I guess?) \n\n* Makeup sex whenever I wanted\n\nYeah, that sounds like a healthy relationship - right? I didn't answer.  I kind of wanted to keep her on Facebook and watch the shit show unfold (she was posting dramatic statuses and song lyrics about mistakes, forgiveness and some from \"our song\") but I know how I am, I don't want to compulsively check her page or go through old photos. So I blocked her. Derek sent me a text a few hours later saying \"She's crying and screaming about you blocking her LOL\" \n\nIn happier news, the family I'm staying with is fantastic. I felt a little guilty about taking up their space, electricity, etc. so I offered to put down rent and pay for some bills (I am unemployed but my family gives me a decent allowance for rent and food) but they declined. The dad said \"First month's free. If you need more time here then we'll talk about it.\" and winked. My friend was telling me that they have hosted his and his sister's troubled friends so it wasn't a big deal. Still, I'm unbelievably grateful. \n\nAs for Will, (awesome neighbor) I called him to thank him for everything. I wasn't up to inviting him for dinner just yet, but I will. He apologized profusely. He says he can't stand Mark, not just for what he did with Alexis but various other things that I won't go into. He told me that Mark has been unusually quiet the past few days and told another one of the guys that he had gotten dumped. Whatever. I don't want to think about it. \n\nSo that's really all I have for you guys. I'm still going to be friends with Derek and Brooke but I'm going to limit my contact with them because they remind me of Alexis so much. I sent Brooke a message thanking her for kicking Alexis out and she said she'd do it regardless of whether or not I move back in. She's going to give me a heads up on when Alexis is gone so I can get the rest of my things. In the mean time I'm spending a lot of time studying, applying to grad schools, and hanging out with the guy I'm living with.  Earlier this week I posted onto my university's Facebook group searching for roommates for next semester and I already have a few replies. I'm going to wait until after finals to tell my parents about the situation because my mom asks a million questions about everything and I'm not in the mood to answer them. \n\nAgain, thank you thank you thank you for all the messages. I didn't not expect this level of attention and while it has made me a bit paranoid someone will recognize the story from the details - fuck it I needed the support. \n\nI fucking love you guys. \n\n---   \n**TL;DR**: Brooke is kicking Alexis out and Derek is still my buddy. I'm doing okay given the circumstances, and I'll hopefully be finding a new apartment next month. ",

            "I'm old enough to be your dad. So I've been around the block in this game, and I've spent about a third of my life on tour in the Rock world. You can imagine some of the shit I've seen and lived through, and you still wouldn't even come close to the reality.\n\nThese stories are nothing new to me. For years I have seen them play out in the worst ways. But for some reason yours got deep under my skin. I've thought about it a lot. Tuesday of last week I was driving home from the grocery store and all of a sudden you and your story just popped into my head, and I wondered how you were holding-up, if you were alone in all this, and if I'd ever know what ultimately happened for you in the end. It just fucking hurt to think about what you were going through, and I thought to myself: \"If she walked in front of my car right now, I'd run her ass over, go back and tie her to the bumper and drag her down the street.\" (Yes... Extreme some might say. But hey, I'm sick. I need help.)\n\nThere's really nothing other than time that's ever going to make this any better. It's going to be a long painful process, and in the years to come, when you least expect it, it's going to pop into your head out of nowhere and give you a little kick to the gut. That's just what being a good and truly loving person sometimes gets you in life. (It' still better than being one of the Mark or Alexis' of the world.)\n\nI've got no advice for you. Unfortunately, it's all on you. People can be there for you, but in the end, when you are laying in bed in the dark at the end of the day, it's just you and your thoughts, and no one can protect or help you in that moment. Sleep will for a long time will be your only respite from the waking nightmare you're going through. I can only promise you that those moments will come less often, and their severity fade.\n\nAnd I hope she gets eaten by a bear.",

Three days into it, she got bitchy and asked how long was I going to be mad at her, and tried to turn it around back on me.  I realized she was only remorseful about it initially because I almost broke up with her, but thought she could just go back to her way once I forgave her.\n\nFrom then on, I have had a strict zero tolerance policy on cheating.  I'm not jealous at all, and have never had a problem with girlfriends having guy friends, but if I find out they've been cheating on me, I tell them they've made their choice and I move on.",

That mistakes have consequences, that regret is real and her pretty face and sorry tears and lengthy excuses will not undo what is done.\n\nShe can learn from this and be a better person.

            "I just want to say something in reference to your reasons for not moving back in after Alexis is gone.\n\nI used to live with my two best friends who were dating each other while I was single. With really good friends like that, you'll never be a third wheel. You'll be part of a tri-pod. It can sometimes feel like a three way relationship, just where only two of the people are sleeping with each other. Despite the fact tht they remind you of Alexis, they are also in the best position to give you the support you need to move on. I wouldn't distance myself from them if I were you. I think being close to and spending lots of time with them would really help you in the long run. My best friends that were a couple helped get me through some of the hardest parts of my life. That friendship is a wonderful, powerful tool you have, and I would encourage you to use it.\n\nWhether or not that means moving back in is more of a judgement call. If it were me, I would. The companionship you get living with your best friends is invaluable. I know the place reminds you of Alexis right now, but that's just a time thing. Before you know it you'll have new memories, and that won't be the case anymore. Maybe get a new bed if it icks you out/reminds you of bad times. But your associations with the place itself would change quicker than you think.\n\nOther than that, I just want to say how awesome you've handled all this. You sound like a very mature and intelligent guy, and I know when you move past all this you will be very happy and have a great life. Good luck to you.",

            "Good for you! You are doing everything right and you are going to be fine.\n\nI wanted to explain to you about what you said about Alexis having trouble saying no... Not to defend her position, but explain. I used to be like that. Some women who are of the peacemaker personality type have a hard time learning to assert their own feelings and desires when they are contradictory to what is expected of them. They find it easier to take whatever unpleasantness might result than to say no. Furthermore a lot of women (particularly in conservative areas/families, as you mentioned) get taught not to rock the boat, to be complacent and agreeable, to go along with things. Conflict is very upsetting to people like this and they are very susceptible to coercion as a result (if they go along with it, the conflict goes away). Think about it... You would never have guessed that she would so this. It is way out of character. And yet she did. It wasn't what she wanted but she felt powerless to assert her own will.\n\nThis does not mean you should give her a pass. It means she is not emotionally equipped to be in sexual situations. It means she needs to get her shit together ASAP and before she gets involved with anybody else on any level. Chances are she is doing lots of things that she does not want to do, then rationalizing it, and it is going to fuck her up royale. That will screw up your self esteem. I know.

She is paying a high price for cheating, losing her BF, and all of her friends, and getting kicked out. Also she is basically being blackmailed into leaving the house based on her poor choices.\n\nAll is fair in love and war, but her mental state might not be the best and being suicidal might be something on her list of stuff to do. People are saying she will learn from her mistakes or it will teach her a lesson. And I really don't know if it can without help from someone.\n\nI would hate for this to end like attempted or succeed in a suicide. No clue how to handle it but yes. Just something to keep in mind. Maybe have someone she knows ask her if she having suicidal thoughts or give her a suicide hotline to talk to just in case. If your university has some sort of on call psychologist or life counselor, I know some do, you probably should through a third party give her access to it.\n\nAlso all of her makeup techniques are pretty unhealthy basically ingratiating herself to you, which could never really sustain a relationship longer than it needs too until she starts resenting you for having so much control over her.

She is literally putting a 'price' on your trust and to go as far as using sex as a mechanism to get a second chance, that is just laughable. \n\nI assume she never even told you about the 'kiss' she had with him prior to the facebook messages.

It may be awkward or bad at first, but they sound like amazing people.

So like the other users said, make new memories with Derek and Brooke, it'll be worth it in the end. They have proven themselves to be great REAL friends. If anything you can still move in with them, I am sure they might be struggling with the rent now that it's split 2 ways. \n\nThat brings me to my next point. Derek and Brooke still kicked her out knowing it was gonna make rent harder and even knowing you might not wanna go back. They still went through with it and even though rent is only split in half they still give you the support. Specially if they haven't even mentioned the rent to you, they're real friends and you should be happy to have them, don't let what alexxis did blind you to them.\n\nI'm really happy for you OP, I was cheated on, but sadly my story didn't end as good as yours did.

            "So, I've been fallowing this saga since the beginning, and I just want to say: You're awesome!\n\nDespite the shit going on with your ex right now, you are one strong motherfucker, and you have some awesome friends.  I know seeing Brooke and Derek right now may be a bit painful, but don't push them away.  You need as many friends as possible, and (this may reflect poorly on my character, but...) if I was you, I would love having that direct line to Alexis just so I'd know how miserable she is because of her own stupid mistakes.  I'm not saying use your friends for this purpose, of course, but having been cheated on by all of my previous exes, having someone to talk shit about said exes has always helped the healing process.  Not to mention, your friends also feel betrayed by Alexis, and I'm sure they would love, love, *love* to have a bitch fest with you. It's petty, but, man, it really helps with the healing process.\n\nGood luck with exams and applying to grad school!  If anything, you are now free to really enjoy what the next few years have in store for you!",
            "\"only slept together 3 times\". Only? *Only*.\n\nYou only stuck another dude's dick in your orifices, a dude who is not your bf. Go to hell with your 'only'. Fuck that made me mad.",
            "This story hits home for me. I know how it feels to be in love and have it stolen from you all at once.  I wish you the best.  \n\n\nSorry.",
            "This makes me so fucking happy. ",
            "I survived my own \"Alexis\" 3 years ago.\n\nShe was so sweet and innocent and selfish and  poisonous, it makes me want to vomit. ",
            "Late to the party here, but you should try meditation dude. I know it sounds like a dumb suggestion, but it helps with depression, and absence of thought sounds like it'd do you some good right now. Good luck, and don't shut out your friends.",
            "sad doge face :(",
            "You go bro! I'm extremely sorry about the situation, but i'm happy things are gonna go uphill for you very soon! She's not worth the worrying anyway, hope all is well.\n",
            "First of im so sorry to her about this ( I know im a bit late) but could you maybe give us an update of how things are going know? Thanks",
            "I'm way late to the game, but it would be great if you updated at some time with any new developments.  Not being condescending at all, but for a 22 year old you handled this fantastically.  I wouldn't have done as well at 45.  Anyway stay strong.  If she was your wife I could understand reconciliation if you were up for it, but with a girlfriend forget it.  You would never be able to trust her again and that's no way to live.",
            "stay strong brother."
