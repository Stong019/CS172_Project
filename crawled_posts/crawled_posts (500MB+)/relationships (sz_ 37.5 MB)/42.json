        "selftext": "TL:DR GF wouldn't talk to me after some unfortunate events that happened that resulted in her officially breaking up with me this past weekend (OCT 17)\n\nHere is the original post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my\\_34m\\_gf\\_26f\\_of\\_6\\_months\\_wont\\_talk\\_to\\_me\\_over\\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/j9z5di/my_34m_gf_26f_of_6_months_wont_talk_to_me_over_an/)\n\nNo one asked for the update, but I would like to say some things.\n\nWell, I was finally able to see her over the weekend for my and someone else's bday celebration, it wasn't a formal bday party, just hanging a friend's house during the day and going out later on. She basically ignored me at the friend's house and when I tried to get a minute to talk to her about what was going on, she wouldn't spare a few minutes to let me say my peace. But she did tell me she was pretty much done after the initial birthday incident a few weeks ago even though she kept telling me she didn't know how she felt or what she wanted yet. It's been a few days and the rose colored glasses are beginning to come off. I still think about her and want to be with her but it's getting better by the day. I've also started to try to remember certain things that bugged me about her in an attempt to help me move on because I've always had an issue with only remembering the good. Thank you all for you insights and advice, it helped me come to terms with the fact that she overreacted and wanted out anyway and this was just a good enough reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  Wow! So many people have wished me luck and brought up some thoughts I've had as well. Thank you all so much for your insights and ideas.  Anytime I find myself thinking about/missing her, I will come back and read these comments to push me through.  Oh yeah, and thank you for the awards as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit #2:  Somebody asked in the comments what hobby she was trying to get into.  I play tennis recreationally and I'm not sure if she was trying to get better at it for me, but she mentioned it several times that she would like for us to go and play together.  She even got one of our friends who also plays tennis, to take her out and show her some drills she could use to help improve her game.  She texted me last night saying she had some things to say and clearly I do so could we call and talk sometime, I said sure just let me know.",

            "You're right OP...her reaction is so wildly illogical that I dont think she ever really was that into you. She probably was already teetering over an indecisive line and found a reason to say she isn't interested. Don't take it personal. You did nothing wrong",
            "Seems like she was just looking for an out and the chipped tooth provided one. You guys are in different life stages by your ages, often times it\u2019s harder to connect and communicate. Just keep swimming.",
            "My dating life got a lot easier when I decided to just stop pursuing people that didn't pursue me with the same fervor. If the person is telling you they don't know how they feel, or being indirect, why waste your time? You shouldn't have to convince someone to like you or to stay with you.  You're worth more than that.",
            "I just read both posts. I agree with what others have said about her irrational and highly strung reaction, and that you need to remove yourself from this person asap. \n\nBut what really struck me was something you said about meeting someone and putting all your energy into that person, being ghosted, etc. Am I right in saying that you get attached quickly?\n\nAs well as removing yourself from this toxic woman, I'd suggest you try and address the issues underlying your own dating and relationship patterns. It seems like there might be some kind of attachment issue here, exacerbated by how you view yourself.\n\nMight I suggest that you take a break and focus on yourself for a while? Perhaps a period of therapy or counselling to help you understand yourself better?",
            "I can understand why she would be so upset about something like a chipped tooth, it's a big issue. But you offered to pay to resolve it, and it was resolved pretty easily. After that she should have calmed down because you handled it maturely, but she didn't she continued to be petty. you did the right thing.",
            "I just want to speak to the \u201cyou put your all into relationships\u201d which I think you said in your original post. That\u2019s some of the issue I think. Find a way to be comfortable, confident and happy in yourself and by yourself for a little bit.\n\nBecause the woman\u2019s behaviour was rubbish but you want back repeatedly to try and \u201cfix\u201d it. At the point when she was still playing silly games and started the game about you not going to the other party, that\u2019s when you should have decided to stop apologising. She was just being mean after that.\n\nSo, stay away from her and work on your own confidence, you deserve much better!",
            "Maybe she just doesn't want to date you anymore and the stress of the incident just sped something along she was already in her way to do. She would not act that way toward someone she wanted closeness with. \n\nEither way sounds like you need to give her space. Ghosting happens. You don't get to call. No ghosting. Sorry she was shitty. Do the right thing and move on.",
            "She broke up with you that night. You just refused to hear it.\nThen you kept contacting her. A bit clingy for your age.\nI think you're minimising the dog's behaviour.\nThey probably came in running at her with full force, wiggling, jumping around.\nAs much as anyone loves dogs, most really don't want them all over them in uncontrolled ways. You didn't say what breed they are but it sounds like they need more training.",
            "From your first post: \"She told me she was done and that she wouldn't be coming back to my house any time in the near future. But I let this go, thinking she was just caught up in the anger of the moment.\" \n\nShe told you she was done, but you didn't take no for an answer. You continued to be pushy and creepy. \n\nDude, she broke up with you weeks ago.",
            "I read the story and everyone says she's acting like a child but I don't agree. Why can't women have high standards in dating? The vibes were off with you. I would be pissed if my boyfriends big dog chipped my tooth before my work meeting. And then he let the dogs back in right after. U didn't end up paying for the tooth cuz it was an easy fix and... . I personally would get the feeling like: What is this dude contributing to my life ? His dog chipped my tooth and my insurance covers it cuz of my own hard work, and this guy is messing with my work flow, and now assuming that he can go to a party with me... just so annoying tbh. Why would we entertain a man who's nuisance... not just about the tooth, its how u make her feel...",
            "I can't help but feel like there's more to this story. you've written it so carefully with all the cues for the audience to sympathize with you and 'know that you're a good person'. \n\nIf this is true and exactly as you're saying then it sucks but I guarantee if we got a post from her perspective everyone in the comments would be sympathizing with her.",
            "Dude, fuck this woman. Like what someone else said, she's acting like a fucking child. She's so deep into her looks and angry over her chipped tooth that she is irrationally dumping all the blame on you for something the dogs did. She can't even be bothered to give you a fucking proper break up. Fuck this person. You deserve better.",
            "She wasn\u2019t that into you in the first place",
            "I'm more upset that ya'll hanging out at birthday parties and going out during this pandemic... No wonder we can't get this thing under wraps.",
            "Dude no offense but you talk about you and your feelings a lot. A chipped tooth is a big deal, especially for professional women. She probably thought you didn't truly get this or understand how she sees the situation.",
            "Okay, I would be pissed if your dog chipped my tooth. But, I'd get over it once the tooth was fixed. I can see her point, but her dragging it out isn't good at all.",
            "You dodged a bullet man. I know it sucks, I don\u2019t mean to minimize that. It sucks. \n\nBut you\u2019re on the right track. She is surprisingly immature and self-centered for a 26yo woman, and obviously this was never truly about the tooth anyway. She was too chickenshit to talk to you like an adult so she seized on anything to make her move. You handled everything thoughtfully and maturely. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be bummed, let it happen, but don\u2019t let it stop you from getting back out there. Good luck man.",
            "Wow she is very immature. Honestly sounds like you dodged a bullet there. I wonder, though, do you remember other times where she unfairly blamed you or was way over the top with a reaction to something you did? \n\nI say this from experience as a guy like you that cares a lot and apologizes and tries to help when bad things happen; immature people react to apologetic people by turning them into scapegoats. The unfortunate reality with immature people is that the more you give them the more they demand from you and the more they take.\n\nI think that you should move on at this point and NOT look back, unless a long time from now she has shown some serious self-reflection and acknowledges how poorly she treated you. You might want to try to understand why and how you can grow from this but sometimes we need to accept that it really wasn't anything we did. Sometimes our partners are the ones with demons and we just made the unfortunate choice of investing in them.\n\nGoodluck to you brother and don't let this dissuade you from being a caring, apologetic person. Some dudes get walked over for being nice guys but then turn into NiceGuys^TM out of spite and ego. Don't be that guy, you will find someone that appreciates you caring so much when their tooth gets chipped.",
            "She sounds insane. You dodged a bullet.",
            "Did everyone just forget the OP originally posted this? \n\n\u201cI posted about this is in AITA but this is sort of a follow up with different conditions.\u201d \n\nI would like to know the real story, this is sus.",
            "I mean... a lot of people are saying her reactions are illogical. I disagree. People are allowed to feel like they weren't cared for enough, or that people didn't respond like the other person expected them to. Remember that she literally just got hurt by a dog, and then next thing is you allow the dog to go to her... I find that sort of shocking. A dog bite can bring in trouma straight away but you didnt consider it that way, which youre allowed to do, but people can and are allowed to think of it differently. Its not an overexaguration to have a different mentality. \n\nI wish you well, but I'd say its best to look at fault from both sides here. I felt like you were very insensitive to what she went through by the way you written it. It was like oh kay the tooth is fixed, that means the event never happened for you.",
            "She's ridiculous. Accidents happen. You sound like an awesome, thoughtful BF. You can do better.",
            "Id probably be equally annoyed as your ex GF. I cant stand badly trained dogs. It speaks volumes about the owner when you have a happy excited dog that hasnt learned to be happy and excited safely. If she has medical issues as well it makes this concern amplified because you pretty much can't be around your dogs post surgery because they will inevitably stand on their back legs and put there paws right on your abdomen. Youve trained them with zero awareness. She can't trust your dogs so she doesn't trust you anymore. The fact you just let them back in without establishing that the play was a little to intense just shows you are not training them properly...",
            "She showed you her true colors. While I can understand being a bit upset to not speak to you is crappy. Someone once told me the silent treatment is a power move by narcissistic people. Anecdotally, that has been true for me. \n\nBe well and good luck!",
            "Moving on can be hard... wish you the best",
            "Ignore the shitty comments. I'm sorry this happened to you, OP.\n\nI'm sure that your relationship was important to you, and to her. But clearly there's something unresolved on her end that she's not willing to share with you. And it sucks. Hope you feel better soon.",
            "An accident happened, that you were in no way at fault for, but she blamed you and broke up with you?  That is a huge pile of poo.  Honestly I would like to think that she had been looking for a convenient excuse to break up with you (as slimy as that sounds) instead of admitting that an adult could be so incredibly immature.  \n\nBut immaturity is what seems to be evidenced.\n\nGood riddance that childish brat. You dodged a major bullet.  Block her every where.  Move on in your life.\n\nIf she wants help paying for that dentist bill laugh in her immature face.",
            "Why do you want to be with someone who is so immature that she broke up with you over an accident?",
            "It sounds like you dodged a bullet. The refusal to have a conversation with you over a simple accident and immediately jumping to 'i'm doubting this entire relationship now' is such a weird escalation to me. It's one thing to say things in the moment when you're traumatized and scared, but to then be so avoidant and uncommunicative, and then COMPLAIN about things she never established as boundaries (you having to ask if you could go to a mutual friend's party) AND refuse to take responsibility for her own emotions (you ruined my mood by making me feel like a mean person)???  If she's struggling to communicate and deal with a minor issue this early in the relationship, then she would have struggled down the line, too. \n\nStorytime: The other day my partner did something without me that made me feel a little left out, but I knew he didn't do it on purpose. So I had a conversation with him (and myself) and worked it out until I realized what I was actually upset by and resolved the emotions I was feeling. \n\nNow next time, my partner will remember that, and include me not because I *demanded* to be included, but because he knows I appreciate being given the choice to join in. He wasn't left feeling like he'd upset me and did something wrong with no idea what to do to fix it. And I don't enjoy sitting and stewing in my hurt feelings and letting them create resentment between my partner and I.\n\nBecause my emotions and responses to things are *my problem* first and foremost. Just because I'm feeling a thing doesn't mean he \\*made\\* me feel that way. And that's just something that comes with time and experience and learning to self-assess and self-regulate. Which is why I say you dodged a bullet - and now you know to look out for someone who does this on their own in the future.",
            "Hate to break it to ya but, but she wanted out long before this incident. It's because of how you've been acting. The tooth thing was just the nail in the coffin. Examples in the context of the story: offering not to go to the friends party because of what you two were going through, saying \"please don't ghost me,\" crying with her on the phone for 45 minutes trying to make her feel better, apologizing to her endlessly, trying to \"keep her close because you don't want to lose her.\" All of these behaviors will turn a woman's panties into the Sahara desert. Grow some balls guy, you're 34 years old. If you want to go to the birthday party, you go to the fucking birthday party. Doesn't matter if she wants you there or not, it's a mutual friend and you have the right to go. You don't need her permission. Same goes for the other things on the list, you give ONE sincere apology, let her figure out her chipped tooth and don't bother her, and wait for her to text you. Not blow her phone up apologizing (for something completely out of your control btw) and constantly checking to see if she is ok and still likes you or where you two stand or what the \"fine line\" is.",
            "Good riddance.\n\nAccidents happen and having a partner that will calmly roll through the occasional curve ball that life throws your way is invaluable... even better is someone that can laugh when times/situations are tough.\n\nYou dodged a bullet OP. \ud83d\udc4d",
            "I didn\u2019t catch the initial post but I just read it now. Wow, your ex gf sounds insane. Good riddance I\u2019d say!",
            "There is more to this story you will probably never find out...\nThe behaviour is sketchy and by far has nothing to do with the tooth insident.....\nBreak up was in her mind and the tooth is an excuse...\n\nTry to find if there is someone else.....",
            "I won't lie, I would be pissed. I would not want to be around your dogs for a while, maybe. Letting them in with you was probably not a good choice  but then again, her reaction made it quite clear that she was only hanging around for a while, and not interested in the relationship anymore. It sounds like it was just a quick affair.",
            "Sorry it didn\u2019t work out but I think you\u2019re better off given her immaturity. Also it\u2019s \u2018saying your piece,\u201d not peace, for future reference! Cheers",
            "It's not about the tooth, she was unhappy for some reason and that was her exit. Walk away and don't try to get closure. Your request that she not simply ghost you and to just say flat-out that you're done was absolutely reasonable. Her decision to ghost you and act like a little kid shows her truer nature. Don't even bring her up to your friends and ask them about her.",
            "Something tells me she already wanted to break up and just saw this as the closest out. Had a bad feeling from that last post she was gonna ghost you. Sorry man, better lick next time.",
            "You so better off without her. I just don't get her very over the top reaction. Did she want the dog punished and kept outside? Which I'd be annoyed with as it was accident!! \n\nMy thinking is she wanted out anyway and she used this as her out, making you the bad guy. I really think you dodged a bullet with her. It's such a none thing to get pissed over. Then she stringed you alone for so long, drawing out your hurt.\n\nSending you hugs for your sore heart. You'll get passed this.",
            "She had a huge over reaction to the incident but she found an excuse to you as her way out\nBe lucky it was sooner rather than later. Keep moving forward!",
            "She reminds me of my psycho ex. Don't worry, you've dodged a bullet there. If she's selfish and overreacts to the point she won't talk to you about something that is not your fault, you just know that she either is too self centered or doesn't care about the relationship. \nI know it's not that simple, but just forget about her and go onto the next one",
            "Never forget anything. People tend to forget and find themselves in the same situations... I know because I lived it. Don't forget anything, don't close your eyes to anything, see all as it is. And never go back, you deserve to be in a better relationship.",
            "Interesting.. I read in the original that she was eating at a friend's and then went to visit you?\n\nShe had obviously wanted an out. I'm just wondering if maybe things are a bit different than she lead you to believe",
            "26 but acts like she\u2019s 11",
            "She was childish and manipulative - the bit in your OP where she said you'd made her be mean to you... Girl, bye.",
            "Yeah, I mean, that girl sucks. You will absolutely be better off. I have been with people like that, including my first marriage, and it is absolutely impossible. Your relationship would not have survived anyway, so better that it ends after six months then after six years, because you would\u2019ve been truly miserable in a long-term relationship with her",
            "Yeah something else was going on. She was looking for any reason to be set off and upset. Move on and you'll be better for it. Accidents happen and her reaction is nutty. She is  mad because you let the dogs back in too soon lol? Bullshit. You don't need people this drama hungry in your life. I assume she was probably seeing someone else probably in the group, hence being so upset you were going to the bday party.",
            "If a girl or guy breaks up with you over a clear freakish accident, then that person was just searching for a way to break up, don't worry you'll find someone less immature and right for you.",
            "She sounds insufferable. This whole situation is so immature it irks me to know people like that exist. I don\u2019t know how to eloquently and politely say this but grow a backbone and have some self respect. You were dating a freaking teenager, it seems. Maybe try dating someone your age or more mature. \n\nTLDR: wtf",
            "She probably just used the chipped tooth incident to break up with you. Perhaps she was getting annoyed by you and obviously didn't like you as much as you like her. BTW, I noticed this in your original post.\n\n\"*When I genuinely care about someone I try to put everything I have into them and into us, putting myself out there. This hasn't worked for me as I keep getting hurt because I don't know how to protect my feelings. I really do care about this girl and I've apologized numerous times but I still don't know what to do*.\"\n\nYou had only been going out for 6 months. I have no idea about you, but were you... too clingy? Did you wear your heart on your sleeve? Were you too emotional? Too dependent? Overly apologetic? If so, try to change your ways.\n\nBest of luck!",
            "Read the original too... Get over her. Entirely. She clearly doesn't live you if something like that would scare her off. \n\nI broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years because he broke my tooth.,. By punching me in the side of the face. Then I had to get 3 root canals cuz he ripped the nerve roots out., then I also had tramatic brain injury. Nothing like that happened AND out want your fault. Tell her to get the fuck over it and if she can't then call it quits. That's ridiculous to still be blaming you over something your friends (who lived here to death you said) did. She wasn't really in this to start.",
            "Does she expect you to never let your dogs near her again?  \ud83e\udd14 She is overreacting and taking it out on you.  It clearly was an accident.  She\u2019s manipulative with the birthday get together.  It\u2019s best to move on and block her.",
            "There is a massive maturity gap in your ages. It's not a gross age gap or anything, but I think you will have much better luck in a relationship with someone closer to your age.",
            "I had an ex like this she was my \"one that got away\" she eventually got married to a tool of a guy (cop go figure) and got divorced. I was happily married with 2 kids at this point.  I talked to her a bit over fb with my wife's blessing (I would never cheat on my wife). She is definitely aware that she was the one who fucked up our relationship and she  Sabotage it on purpose because she just didn't know how to handle a guy who cared about her (or some crap she told me) she sees my loving wife and kids and really wishes she had that in her life. Now I just give her dating advice because apparently I'm pretty good at it. We're both getting older now me at 41 her at 46. I do sometimes wonder what it would be like if we stayed together... realistically probably headaches but you always remember the good times right!",

            "This is such an irrational reaction- she\u2019s so angry at you because of a total accident caused by a pet that she wants to break up- that you should be celebrating this as an escape from wasting any more time with someone like this.",
            "She acted really really shitty to you! I think you might've been looking at her through those rose tinted glasses, because what happened was just an accident and she turned it into some really overblown drama and it sounds like she basically enjoyed toying with your feelings. She sounds like not a very nice person to be honest. If someone tries to make you feel shitty over something that was a total accident and not your fault, for days, and then tries to make you feel bad about going to your own friend's birthday party, and then tries to make you feel bad about 'making' her tell you she doesn't want you to go, then keeps dangling you on the end of a string for weeks, then ignores you when they see you - then they're not really that great a person. That's the kind of person who gets a kick out of watching you not know what to do, out of making you feel uncertain and knowing you're wanting to be with them even while they treat you like crap. People like that are just so exhausting and horrible, I think you dodged a bullet here, so count yourself lucky and I'm sure you'll find someone who is just genuine and caring and not so...icky.",
            "Hey OP, glad you are starting to see that this could be good for you too. There is someone out there for you, and my philosophy is that breakups just get you one step closer to that person. You learn things about yourself and what you want in that partnership that will serve you well in the long run. Good luck!",

Two people two balls. One court and one line that never gets crossed.  The game works like this.  You send a ball across the net.  They can choose to return it or not.  If they return it you match the distance to the net and send it back across.  If they become more distant you be come more distant they get closer you get closer.  The moment they leave the court the game is over.  \n\nWhere you are making your mistake is she has left the court and you are tripping over the net sending ball after ball hoping she will come back.  It's time to pick up you balls and find another court.  The chase shows you are giving her more power in the relationship than she deserves. No one, I mean no one would want to come into an easy game with a ball launcher pointed at them.  \n\nSo that happened.  Yup she's gone.

She CHOSE to be mean & petty about the whole thing and then instead of listening to her feelings and exploring in herself why that made her feel bad, she turned it around on you to make you the bad guy. That is an abusive tactic called DARVO - Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender.\n\nShe felt accused of being mean (even if only by her own feelings), denied responsibility, went on the attack toward you and reversed the situation so SHE was the victim and you \"did\" it to her, you were the offender. This puts you in the position of having to grovel for forgiveness and gets her off the hook for taking responsibility for her behavior.\n\nAnother way DARVO could look is if you had told her that her behavior hurt your feelings, a reasonable person would say \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, I didn't intend to, lets talk about that\" or something along those lines. But an abuser (deliberate or unintentional) would respond with \"What?! I didn't hurt you, I can't believe you'd say something like that when YOU **made** me so angry!\"\n\nWhether she is an intentionally abusive person or just accidentally like that because she's avoidant doesn't really matter if she's unwilling to communicate and self reflective. And yes, you can be abusive without raising a finger in violence against someone, words can be violence as well, and they don't have to be aggressive words either.\n\nSo, I know you're in the process of getting over this, but honestly it sounds like you dodged a bullet, and you should give your exuberant puppo a bunch of cuddles for inadvertently saving you from a relationship that would leave you walking on eggshells and suffering emotionally/mentally.",

If she doesn't, well, there was nothing to resolve anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany years ago, I was in a relation with a woman 16 years older than me. I was in my late 20's, she was in her early fourties! I loved her deeply, she had a teen daughter that simply adored me, we were not living together, but planing on it...\n\nThen some stange things began to happen, and after a big one happened (not going into details here, but you can read it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/comments/hzyeva/a\\_story\\_from\\_my\\_past\\_49m\\_that\\_may\\_help\\_others/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzyeva/a_story_from_my_past_49m_that_may_help_others/)) i tryed to call her for a week, but never did get to talk to her! And it was eating me inside! But, after a week, I took a look at myself and thought really hard about what was going on... And just stopped! No contact at all! After a month she was the one initiating contact, and acting like we had just talked the day before and all was well...\n\n(spoiler alert: It wasn't)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish you all the best and that everything works out as it should :)",
            "Be better than you think you deserve. Meaning quit putting this broad on a pedestal believing that you will never find anyone better. Stop crawling on your hands and knees to win a 4 minute audience with her so that she can laugh at you to her dummy friends later about it. They've all heard your pleases, the voicemails, etc. Stop letting her piss in your mouth. If your mutual friends invite you somewhere......GO, don't call her or say see you tomorrow with HOPES that you'll get her to slip up and say \"ok babe\" so you can jump and click you heals like a sucker. \n\nYou go to the party, he'll bring a date if you can, but you go and have the best time. Never let them see you mope. Never put energy into someone who isn't putting energy into you REGARDLESS of how well it went, you didn't make it change she changed herself somehow and it's not your job to rape yourself to try to pull the \"old\" her back into existence. I had a girl tell me she was sorry she didn't text back because she didn't allow electronic devices at the dinner table.............TWO Days later. I gave the rolled my eyes emoji, and told her I had a meeting with Parliament in a few minutes and stopped trying to pursue her.\n\nGranted you all talked for 6 months, but the way she's acting now....she doesn't even consider you as a friend, you're the \"whiney old guy, who is weird\" let her tell it.

Strange behavior and circumstances makes me suspicious. Found pictures on facebook of him with a girl. Can't prove whether that girl is his \"ex\" or not. Looking for advice.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3rdxxz/update_i_21f_suspect_that_i_might_be_my_boyfriend/)\n\n**tl;dr** Y'all were right. He's a lying, cheating asshole. I found texts on his phone that Tim is still with Stephanie and that they live together. It was her in the pictures from when he went home in the summer. I'm going to break up with him and tell her about me. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n\nAgain, I'd like to start off this post with a thank you to everyone who responded with constructive and helpful advice. I read every comment, reply, and PM. \n\nSo, I took your advice and did not try to have a conversation with Tim. I realized that since he was so successfully able to manipulate me for two years, having one last conversation with him was bound to end up with me doubting my findings and perhaps my sanity. \n\nI wrote Stephanie a three page letter, detailing the relationship that Tim and I have had over the past two years. Making clear that it was serious and not just a fling. I mentioned dates and events that most people would not have known about, and I included the intricate lies and back story that he had told me. I included a list of dates from the last 2 months that he spent the night with me and encouraged her to cross check them with nights that he wasn't at home. I printed out a few photos of us as a quick visible proof, and I included the rest of the photos on a usb stick in the letter. The stick also contained screenshots of any particularly incriminating conversations that we've had over the last few months. I scanned postcards that he had sent me from various vacations and included those as well. For safe measure, I also included a copy of the letter, in case the hard copy went somehow mysteriously missing. I gave her my email address and phone number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to.\n\nOn Wednesday night, I had someone drive me to where she lives. If Tim was there, I would just have confirmations that he actually lives there and we'd leave. If he wasn't there, I'd ring the doorbell and hand her the letter personally. We drove the 45 km and Tim was sitting there in the living room on his laptop. It was obvious he lived there. She was nowhere to be seen. His and her names were on the mailbox. I called to see if he'd pick up and he ignored the call. We headed back home. \n\nOn Thursday morning, I mailed the letter. I ensured that it was registered post. In order to receive the letter she'd have to show her ID and sign for it. On Friday the letter arrived. She was not home, so she received a notification to go pick the letter up at the post office. On Saturday morning she picked it up and I got an email of the receipt with her signature on it. \n\nThroughout all of this, I conversed normally with Tim and made excuses as to why he couldn't come over during the week, so as to not tip him off to anything. He stopped talking to me about 20 minutes after she picked up the letter Saturday morning, and I have not heard from him since. He has, however, defriended me and my family on Facebook. I have not heard from Stephanie either.\n\nSo, now it's really over. I hope with my whole heart that he was not able to lie and manipulate his way out of the situation with her, but I will probably never know. I do not expect to hear from him again. \n\nI feel very lonely, taken advantage of, and beaten down. I am going to do my best to try to come out of this situation without trust issues and without being cynical and jaded. I am seeking therapy to make sure I don't slip into depression. For now, I need to find ways to distract myself and fill up any free time. \n\nThanks again for all your help, /r/relationships. This really sucks, but I'll get through it and hopefully be a stronger person for it. \n\n**tl;dr** Sent Stephanie the letter. Haven't heard from Tim since she received it. He defriended me on facebook. Don't expect to know any of the outcome or ever hear from him again. \n\n**quick edit** I forgot to mention that I'm going to go get tested on Tuesday to be safe. Obviously if anything comes out of that, I'll do my best to notify both of them. ",

I know it's not easy to be the big person in this situation and do the right thing, but you have 100% handled this as well as possible. \n\nRemember that Tim's behavior is in no way a reflection on who you are or what you deserve, as you very clearly deserve SO much better than this.

It's a time to celebrate your triumph!\n\nAnd I'll tell you one other thing... if I met you somewhere and you told me this story, I would ask you out on the spot, because a woman who thinks things through this thoroughly and only acts when she's got all her facts assembled in just the right way is a woman after my own heart.\n\nYou go girl!",

If Stephanie, for whatever reason, decides to contact you and say something nasty, at least you told her the truth. At least you walked away from the relationship with your dignity. DO NOT lose respect for yourself!",

Don't let someone like that shape the way you think of real human beings.  \n\nHang in there, you will get through this and it will make you stronger.  You may have rescued another human being on your way out.  What you did takes real courage!  Be proud of yourself, you turned the tables on that asshole.  You came out on top.  One day when you are not hurting anymore you will tell this story and everyone will laugh at what an ass you made of Tim.  You're the girl who blew his whole web of lies up.  Certified letter no less :)\n\nPlease don't let this make you afraid to trust, nothing great in life comes without risk.  Love is the greatest so it takes the biggest risks.    \n\nGood luck.  ",

The evidence is too damning by far.\n\nI'm curious to know if you've warned your friends via social media (e.g. Facebook) about this sociopath? He's earned it.

I don't think I would be able to stop myself from confronting that person. But I think I agree that it's the best strategy. Don't give him any reason to believe that you still care about him after everything he has put you through. Just work on forgiveness--for yourself, not for his own benefit.\n\nI admire your desire to come out of this without any trust issues. That is going to be quite the battle. Just remember that very few people are capable (both morally and practically) of executing such subhuman levels of deception. You should probably be open with boyfriends in the future about this so they understand how serious to you it would be to violate your trust in any way.\n\nBest of luck to you.

She will leave him and find someone who deserves her. Or, if she stays with him, she won't let him pull shit like this again. He'll be on a short leash. She may not realize it right away, but you have saved a fellow woman from a lifetime of lies and grief.\n\nAs for Tim... he's learned he can't pull wool over anyone's eyes, regardless of how charming \u2014 and careful! he is. I'm certain it's a lesson learned. On some level, he may even be relieved to be rid of the intricate web of lies & that he doesn't have to live double lives anymore.

It's great you don't have to be around for any of that, you get to have a clean break.\n\nYou did well. I bet you get over him sooner than you think.

        "selftext": "So I've been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. He's quite stoic, not very emotional. He has a tendency of just saying or doing anything to keep the peace and hates conflict. We've sort of fallen into a pattern of me wanting things (to talk more, to do more things etc) and him doing them 'to make me happy'.\n\nNearly every time he does these things or I bring up that they're important to me, he says that those specific things are not important to him. Here is a list of things he's stated are not that important to him:\n\n* Physically being in the same place. We've recently gone long-distance (not far though, about two hours away from each other) and when I mention I would like to see him more or be together more, he says that being physically together isn't a big deal for him, or not 'as important as it is to me'. He says that he 'doesn't mind' going to see me, as long as it's not inconvenient.\n* Sex. Our life has dropped off since we first started dating (not significantly, about twice a week now instead of five or six, not a big deal). He's mentioned before that sex just isn't that important to him. It's fine and he likes it, but not a priority. He rarely initiates anymore.\n* Physical affection of any kind. He's not a cuddler at all, he doesn't care much for kissing (he'll mostly do it because I want it, I feel, though he hasn't stated this expressly).\n* Communication. Since we've been together he's stated that he doesn't feel the need for any type of meaningful communication or to talk much. He will do it to please me.\n* Doing activities together. He doesn't feel the need to do anything specific together. Doesn't see the point of dinners out, doesn't see the point of social events.\n* Holidays together. He hates holidays, doesn't see the point in them.\n\nThis list goes on but these are the main ones. Also, these things came out slowly during the course of the relationship. He would do the above activities, and only later tell me he did them for me. The only activity he's ever said he enjoys doing (with me) is watching a movie together at home. He also enjoys buying little gifts for people in general) and will buy me little thoughtful gifts.\n\nLast night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask) where he will spend way more than that. I've come to visit him twice in a row and can't travel during the period we're both free because my own sister is visiting during that time from Europe (he's close with my sister btw, and him not visiting will mean he won't see her as well). I said that two months of not seeing each other is long for me and that it sucked. I wasn't angry, but definitely upset, and I said I didn't want him to not go to the wedding (I actively encouraged him to go) but that I feel he doesn't ever put anything in our relationship on priority.\n\nHe then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. So I said okay, you've told me many times about the things that aren't a big deal for you/aren't a priority, and that's valid. So what IS important to you within the relationship? I said it doesn't have to be the same things as mine, but surely there is something within the relationship that is sacred or a priority for you? He said that was a loaded and unfair question and refused to say anything. He then said that some of the things I stated were important to him, just not as important as they are to me, and not something he would necessarily sacrifice other things to do. I just said goodnight and hung up after that, and now don't know what to say.\n\nHe is a kind person and I appreciate that he does things to make me happy, but I wish there was anything he did just because HE wanted. It must be tiring for him to constantly be doing things he doesn't want to do, and it's tiring for me to know it's always, always a chore for him. I don't know if it was bitchy of me to put him on the spot or if it's something valid that should be addressed. We are so different, but I enjoy being around him and I really do care for him. I'm just starting to feel that we are too different and want very different things.\n\ntl;dr my boyfriend has a list of things he doesn't consider super important in a relationship. I asked him during a semi-argument what he DOES consider important. He thought I was being unfair and has still not answered.\n\nedit: I really didn't expect this to blow up the way it did! Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to leave comments. I want to go through each one properly, sorry if I haven't replied to yours yet! The consensus seems to be that this isn't a relationship he's invested in and that I should cut my losses. I think this is something I've known subconsciously for a while, but to have nearly a thousand people reaffirm it makes me feel like I'm not the crazy one for once. I also think I need to visit this whole issue in therapy and explore why I feel the need to just be in a relationship, why I don't expect more for myself, and why I don't think I can do better than this.",

He has no goals other than finding a girlfriend and checking that box. The only important relationship thing to him is being in a relationship. Everything else is work that he isn't willing to sacrifice his time for.",
            "Jeez. I don't want to sound rude but I don't know how you date him. Everything he said he feels isn't important for a relationship is incredibly important for pretty much every relationship. I also think you asking him what his list of important things is  reasonable as he certainly isnt a conventional man.",

            "The list that he doesn't care for:\n\n* Talking to you\n* Being near you\n* Doing thing with you\n* Being affectionate to you\n* Having sex with you\n* Listening to you - Proof is that he cut contact because you asked a question\n\nAre you sure you're dating him? I mean, i'm closer with my co-worker than you are with your bf, and fuck i was recently fired.\n\nit looks to me that he checked out of the relationship, consider it to be too high maintenence\n\nIf he literally put everything in the \"I don't care\" zone, he pretty much said:\n\n\"This relationship is not important to me. I'm doing this to make you happy.\"\n\nI'll ask again OP\n\nAre you SURE you're dating this person?",
            "No, it wasn't an unfair question at all. He just didn't want to be pinned down with an answer, because the truth is that he just doesn't care about this relationship nearly as much as you. He didn't want to give you any kind of answer that might've resulted in you two doing more stuff together. I'm sad for you. When someone tells you who they are, believe them. He's clearly told you what he will and won't do as a partner in this relationship. Up to you to decide if it's good enough (hint: it's not)",

            "[deleted]",
            "Does he actually get anything out of your relationship besides being able to state that he's technically in one? All the things he said don't matter to him are basically what people do in relationships. He doesn't care much for being around you, doing things with you, talking to you, being affectionate and having sex. That's barely a friendship.\n\nMaybe he truly is happy but if that's the case, you're simply not compatible. If he doesn't want anything more, you can't make him, but it's also unfair in you since you want those things and he can never give you them because he actually wants to, so he'll never initiate anything unless asked. It's not like one of you is required to be the bad guy for the things to not work or be unsatisfying. You're just too different.",
            "it is a loaded question, if his honest answer is that nothing matters to him because the relationship doesn't matter to him. \n\nfor you to meet his needs you need to know what they are. if they are \"i don't want you to meet my needs\" you need to know that too. \n\nanother way to phrase it might be; does he know how you feel? does he feel you prioritize him? it sounds like yes. so ask him how he knows. what does he receive that you emit that gives him security and assurance that you committed. now ask him what he is emitting that you are supposed to receive, because you aren't receiving the signals. ARE there signals that he is committed and interested and you are important to him? if you are important to him, you don't know it, and he needs to tell you what signals to look for, or change how he signals those things. or, admit to you both that you aren't important to him.",
            "When I was reading this, my first thought was what does HE want? What does he get out of this? I would be very disappointed in his responses here as well. He is basically playing the part of a good boyfriend, because you tell him to, like a puppet. But has no real sentiment behind it? What happens when he stops trying for you? What are you left with? \n\nI would guess there are some deep-seated emotions here relating to not wanting anything, so as not to be disappointed or something? Does he have nagging parents, strict and controlling? Just shooting in the dark here. But he is either devoid of emotional connection, or unable to explain or describe it in words (which does not mean he is devoid at all). Sounds like he might need therapy for a little self-awareness.",

But aside from the lack of communication there's nothing *wrong* with that beyond, well, its obviously not the kind of relationship you want to be in.\n\nHe probably *likes* being in a relationship with you, but then... its hard to tell if thats true as well if he's genuinely conflict avoidant, and this might be part of him doing a slow fade.",

            "I think you have a good read on your SO. And I don't think you are being unfair. You might ask yourself, beyond the current immediate circumstance you described..do you see yourself being happy with how he is 2 years further in with him, or in 5 years, or 10 years? Assuming he stays more or less the same? He seems to have a particular OS, and probably the only way he would be able to change and become a more lively and less conflict-avoidant sort of person, would be via some kind of OS reboot...which would usually come along in the form of some hard existential crisis. \n\nSO seems to me to be a bit of what I would call a \"sleeper\". Some people wake up emotionally following some kind of long ordeal or life catastrophe. But it is also possible he may just \"be this way\", and not be capable of being rewired in any substantial way. And I don't think you can do that for him even if he can be. You might actually be doing him a long term favor by dropping him, if his relationship failure forces him to look inside himself and actually change for the better, and learn to face conflict instead of avoiding it.\n\nIn any case, if he's unlikely to change as I seem to  think he is, you will have to decide if you really see a future with him that you want...kind and nice as he is.",

I would cut him loose and move on, TBH. Do you want to spend your time and energy on someone who can't be arsed or someone who can?",
            "Hey OP! Hopefully my perspective, informed by past mistakes, might be helpful for you.\n\nYour bf has been able to dictate the terms of the relationship because you care more/put in more effort. He obviously intends to keep doing that with this conversation, but a good relationship is an equal partnership.  If your bf won't even communicate what he does/doesn't want and what he can/can't give, he is withholding information you need to make an informed decision about the relationship.  Since he won't talk to you like an adult, you have to think about what his previous words and actions tell you.\n\n1. His failure to communicate extremely important things now and in the past is, in and of itself, something that shows a lack of respect for your right to make your own decisions and for you as a person. The question you asked basically amounts to what he wants and if/why he wants to be with you.  This is something he shouldn't have a problem answering. He also seemingly waited until you were emotionally invested before letting you know that, actually, he hadn't wanted to do any of this stuff you'd been doing and the entire relationship was based on his supposed benevolence. Yet despite his apparent inability to communicate he is regularly able to very clearly communicate how disinterested he is and how put upon he feels.\n2. You mentioned you appreciate/think it's kind that he does things he says he doesn't care about/want to \"just to make you happy\". One-offs like going to a movie you don't want to see or a boring event are kind when you don't do them grudgingly. But how kind is it to tell someone that doing things like spending time with them, or talking, or cuddling is all just a reluctant favor? No one wants to feel like a chore and him acting like you should be happy about/appreciate these \"favors\" is evidence of how turned around he's got you.\n3. You say it must be tiring for him to be constantly doing things he doesn't want to, but then why is he in this relationship? It's obviously something he doesn't have a good answer for. When you first asked him what he did prioritize he said he didn't prioritize the same things as you and basically had no answer. Eventually his copout was that he prioritizes some of the same things, but obviously not as much and not enough to sacrifice other things. He's told you before he doesn't mind things like spending time together as long as it's not inconvenient and he's shown you that inconvenience includes not going to his brother's exes (? I can't even remember the ridiculous removed relationship) wedding. Basically he likes to have you around for him to pick up when he has nothing else to do. Acting like it's a favor allows him to cast himself as being selfless while actually being super selfish.\n4. The things he told you he enjoys with you are watching movies and buying you gifts. Watching movies is something he would do on his own anyway, so basically he has some company and a situation where he doesn't have to really interact with you (because if you cuddle or whatever obviously it's a favor to you and he doesn't enjoy that part). Buying gifts is apparently also something he'd be doing anyways, and by grabbing something for you while he's there he gets points for being considerate. The only two activities he has come up with are things he'd do anyways that require minimal to no interaction with you \n\nYour bf isn't even treating you with respect, let alone care or kindness. I know it might feel hard to end the relationship right now because you care about him, but it seems like you realize you need to and I think you'll be surprised at how much better life feels once you're out of it. I know it's never easy when you want a relationship to work and you've put in so much effort, but you've got my vote to breakup ASAP!  (Sorry for the essay-length response)",
            "What are you getting out of this relationship?",
            "Yeah there\u2019s definitely something not right here. He doesn\u2019t seem to care nearly enough about your relationship with him. For him to dismiss everything because it\u2019s \u2018not as important to him\u2019 isn\u2019t the mark of a compassionate, caring person. Everyone has their likes and dislikes, their differences, but he\u2019s being too careless. \n\nThis whole thing isn\u2019t fair to you. From another perspective, though, is it fair for him? Is it fair to be in a relationship where *everything* you do for the other person is just to make them happy and not yourself too?   \n\nAnd your question was fine. It sounded like you were trying to work with him at the very least. There\u2019s no reason for him to get a case of ass with you about it. He doesn\u2019t seem to care as much as you do, which is a problem, but at the end of the day, this sort of thing is supposed to be worth it. So is it worth it for you and him? I would try to find the answer to this before proceeding.",
            "Food for thought for OP: It's completely okay to value different things and have different love languages than your SO. The trick is communication. If you get a clear understanding of what you want, you can communicate that to SO. Then (in a loving relationship), your needs/wants become an important priority to SO because YOU are an important priority for SO. It's a two way street that works really well. \n\nAs to your current relationship, the comments sum it all up. He doesn't ask for or give anything because he doesn't care. I've been there. Find someone willing to communicate!\n\n\\*Fair warning: Your current BF may not be happy with a break up. Be prepared to hear nothing. Be prepared to hear everything you've ever wanted to hear. Either way, the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. There's nothing wrong with either of you, but your relationship doesn't work. \n\nBest of luck to you! Happiness is a journey.

Make sure you communicate that you asked this question because of your desire to do things for him and 'speak his language', because his language is clearly different from yours. \n\nYou should also seriously consider whether or not he brings the things you need to the table.

The rest he'll particpate in because of the kids, but I have given up expecting ANY sort of holiday... surprises? thoughtfulness?\n3. He hates going out. I LOVE going out and people watching. So we kinda split it in the middle - I have friends I go out with who enjoy people watching, then me and hubs 'date nights' or other events are more secluded or even movie-at-home nights. His favorite activity with me is binging TV shows together.\n4. Sex is 95% my initiating. He'll do it if I... do it... but, until recently, he never initiated. We had a huge throw down screaming match at each other a few months ago and things have improved, however it's still not... passionate. It's good, he's very focused on me in bed, but it's not passionate. He says it just does not occur to him to start things. \n5. He doesn't touch. Period. He's told me before he 'loathes' when other people touch him -  he 'doesn't mind' when I do, but again, the thought (conscious or unconscious) of \"i should hug her\" just does. not. occur. to him.\n6. There's just... no emotion. He doesn't get sad, he doesn't get excited, he doesn't get nervous. He will, if provoked, get angry - usually at himself (\"I know I suck\", etc.)\n\nThat being said, HUBS will talk it out with me regarding out relationship, but I REALLY have to push it. I have to lead it.\n\nHe's also an amazing provider. Things that matter to him are\n\n1. His family not going without. He's worked tirelessly to give us everything in life, be it financially, a roof over our heads, food, etc.\n2. His children. We have 3. He's amazing with them. A bit aloof (no hugs before bed), but absolutely amazing as a dad. He teaches them things (yesterday he was teaching our 12 year old all about screenprinting T-shirts), gets them to think different ways. Of course, everything puberty and girl emotion is my territory, but everything else is his.\n3. His brain. This dude is fucking brilliant. He's a mechanical type - he can take apart, put together, see steps, etc. Programming, mechanical stuff, building things - we've never had to hire any sort of professional help because he just... fixes things. And if he doesn't know how? He figures it out. Quickly. Seriously in awe of his brainpower.\n4. Stability. He likes routine. He likes a gentle river. He likes his days to just meander past (sometimes this drives me bonkers, but I regress). He's happy at home, hanging out (he's currently a stay at home dad and amazing at it), introverted, loves TV.\n5. He spoils the shit out of me other ways. Bringing me coffee every morning... serving me food... asking me how he can help, what do I need... He's a bit clueless, so he asks, but he cares enough to ask (if that makes sense) and that means a lot to me.\n\nA note of personal advice - if this is your path, and you want to be with this person forever... really stop and think about it. Think about this - for 10+ years, 20+ years, etc. It's HARD. I love my husband, but sometimes I honestly regret marrying him. I miss passion. I miss excitement. I miss touching. I miss feeling sexy. You're going to have times where those regrets or empty spaces in your life will overwhelm you. \n\nAnd you CAN'T go in to it expecting him to change. That's not fair to him, and absolutely unfair to you. I spent 10 years trying to change my husband before I just grew up enough to admit to myself that A) it wasn't working and B) maybe he didn't need changed, maybe I needed to appreciate him vs trying to change him.",
            "My question to you is... what the hell are YOU getting out of this relationship... besides \"he's nice/kind\". Sounds like this kind of guy would be boring AF to hand around. Do you guys have mutual interests that he actually enjoys doing with you? Because if not... Jesus. What are you holding onto here?",
            "He doesn\u2019t want to hang out with you, do things with you, touch you...I honestly am confused.  He is saying he doesn\u2019t value spending time with you in any capacity.  Is there actually any relationship?  I would expect more from my dentist.",
            "Y'all don't sound compatible at all. Why is he even in a relationship.",
            "It\u2019s a reasonable question, he thinks it\u2019s loaded because it\u2019s forcing him to admit to you that the relationship is not important to him and you\u2019re not a priority. He\u2019s with you because it\u2019s convenient, and ending things with you would be the conflict that you say he avoids. \n\nYou two want different things and he\u2019s unwilling to take action to allow you both to move on.",
            "This is a real \"He's Just Not That Into You\" situation, I'm afraid. Cut your losses. There are tons of people out there who will want to see you, hug you, talk to you, sleep with you, etc.",
            "I\u2019m so sorry but this shark is not swimming anymore. It\u2019s not a personal issue of his or yours, you\u2019re just incompatible.",
            "To me it just really sounds like you both have different ideas for a relationship and what should be done. I don\u2019t think you two are a good match. It just seems like he deems certain things as not as important that you deem very important within certain subjects that aren\u2019t negotiable.",

            "SO I  might be projected but my last relationship was a lot like this. I was very much like your SO. It took about a year of regular therapy to realize why I was like that and a lot of it had to do with my childhood and ex girlfriend. I am not sure if he is on the same page as you and it is clear you have made the effort to try to get on the same page well making compromises on what is important to you. He has not. I would strongly consider looking at your life now and where you want it to be, does this man fit that image? It doesn't sound like it. He may not have anything going on causing him to have these walls up as I did, it could very well be his personality in which case we aren't compatible with everyone out there and that is why we date. Best of luck!",
            "Does he have depersonalization or depression bc he seems awful bland and that\u2019s not normal? Has he always acted like this?",
            "My husband is kind of like this, doesn't see the importance of celebrating things. He recently let our 10 year anniversary go by without even a mention or a card, despite me getting him a card a few days earlier (maybe too suttle a hint that I was hoping for something). Instead he wanted us to host a big party on said night and he jetted off to Mexico a few days later. After many meltdowns from me, we got to an OK place again (he does treat me well throughout the year, just doesn't get the significance of certain days). It can be a lot to deal with, but you have to find a place where you are mostly happy. This type of relationship has pushed me to be more independent and he challenges my way of thinking about things.",
            "Um... this isn't putting him on the spot if he's thought at all about the relationship.  Your boyfriend doesn't want to be in a relationship, but doesn't want to be alone.  He's not giving you what you need, and is not enthusiastic about even seeing you... you deserve better.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Sounds like you are frustrated and probably should be about a couple of things. BUT being frustrated about him not pointing out what is important and what you could do for him is probably not worth you being upset about (or upsetting the apple cart). He\u2019s basically telling you he is satisfied in the relationship and feels \u201cless than\u201d because you wonder how he could be. Not all of us need to label and labor over the details of our relationships. He is happy and feels he contributes the right amount. I hope I am right because that only leAves you to decide if YOU are happy and can live with this type of person going forward.",
            "It's not an unfair question and should be a simple one to answer as just a reflex.  In fact, after all the things you listed...what is there left for him in a relationship? Why not just break it off? Doesn't need sex, doesn't need intimacy, companionship, communication, activities...dude is a mossy rock.  The only thing you've named is...a movie watching buddy?  \n\nI feel bad for you.  Go out there and find what you need.  I don't see how this dude fulfills a single need for anybody.  Almost seems like he doesn't even want to date you and keeps you around as a beard or to keep family members off his back or something.  Wouldn't blink if at some point down the line you found out he was into someone else or was gay.",
            "I mean, I\u2019m reading here that being in a relationship with you isn\u2019t important to him. I\u2019m sorry but he doesn\u2019t seem to want to date you.",
            "You're clearly not compatible, simple as that.",
            "Uh ... it seems as if he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you. You really need to break it off with him. He doesn't care about seeing you, talking to you, or doing things with you. He is apparently checked out and you should move on. Cause he already has.",
            "why are you with someone if you have different ideas about what it means to be in a relationship? It's really a no brainer. dump him and find a new boyfriend who likes to hang out, shag, cuddle, etc.",
            " Christ I can\u2019t be in a relationship with someone like that",
            "If he doesn\u2019t care about all those things, then what DOES he care about? Those things that you listed are all important aspects of a relationship, so I\u2019m confused as to what he actually cares about, or why he\u2019s in this relationship if he doesn\u2019t care about things such as spending time with you, being affectionate, etc? It all sounds very strange to me.",
            "So, OP, I'm sorry to break it to you but you don't actually have a boyfriend. Dump him and be single, it'll be the same without the longing.",
            "I suspect his answer is like... never interacting except watching movies? that's not a relationship. TBH I don't know what that is, but you shouldn't be wasting time on this person who seems entirely disinterested in spending meaningful time or effort with you.",
            "Quick question: Why are you with him?\n\nYou sound fundamentally different in every single aspect of this relationship. So, then, what\u2019s the point? You may care about him and love him, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s enough to make you happy or to make this a sustainable partnership for the long-term.\n\nMy ex was the same way. Mostly unaffectionate, didn\u2019t care for going out, never communicated, never expressed or talked about emotions. He would do those things occasionally because they were what I wanted and because he knew it made me happy, but deep down knowing that these principles weren\u2019t inherently important to him made me UNHAPPY. I ended up leaving him after 4 years and met a guy a year later who is just like me. We cuddle, we kiss, we communicate, we go out and have tons of fun, we sacrifice for each other because we WANT to and not because we feel like we HAVE to. Nothing is one-sided.\n\nSounds like you should reconsider your relationship and start thinking about finding someone more compatible, OP. It makes everything easier.",
            "This dude sounds miserable.",
            "You've identified a laundry list of things that are important to you, and that aren't important to your partner. Bone chilling, essence of life things. \n\n> He then told me again how the same things that are important to me in the relationship aren't important to him. \n\nI have no idea why you are still with a person who doesn't have the same priorities, goals, or likes that you do. Enjoying being around someone isn't enough. You need to break up.",
            "Sounds like a bonafide sociopath tbh.",
            "OP it is not a loaded question considering you were both talking about what is / is not important to you in relationships. It is a normal progression if someone says, \"those aren't things that are important to me.\" to ask the question that you did. It is alarming to me that he couldn't think of a single thing. Even on the spot most people could come up with something that they need from or is important to them in a relationship. \nIt really seems like you are correct and want different things. It sounds almost as if he's choosing a romantic relationship simply because it's the norm and what he thinks is expected of him... I can't imagine being in a romantic relationship where I wasn't passionate about a single thing regarding my partner / our relationship. Wow.",
            "People realize they can break up with someone they don't enjoy being with, yeah?",
            "Honestly, it doesn't sound like he is into you. Those things need to be important to both people for a relationship to work. And no your question wasn't loaded, it was a simple question that he should have answered.",
            "My take is that it sounds like he's checking out of the relationship. It doesn't sound like he really wants to be around you and is just going through the motions to make you happy.\n\n>Last night, he told me that he can't afford to come visit me (it is  about a $50 flight) because he's decided to go to a wedding (his  friend's ex-girlfriend's sister's, whom he has never met, don't ask)  \n\nFirst, this shows how low of a priority you are in his life. Second, you said \"don't ask\" and I assume that's because this feels pretty shady to you. If he hasn't met the bride, is he going as someone's +1? If it were a wedding of one of his close friends as the bride or groom, and you couldn't make it, it would be more reasonable for him to spend the money to attend (it would suck, but it would be reasonable and not necessarily a sign of you being low priority). With this, it sounds like part of the reason he's spending the money to be alone in a romantically charged event. I'm not saying he's looking to cheat, but if he's not really interested in being with you romantically...",
            "Ever see the film \"He's just not that into you\"? This unfortunately smacks of that. As others have said the bits that you defined as important - they are! They make a romantic relationship. Different hobbies are great but the essentials of just being there with each other, touching (in any way) and being able to communicate effectively are key. Your question was completely reasonable, you're relationship (from this insight) isn't.",
            "Seems like he's just not that into you. He also could have anhedonia but from a relationship standpoint, what does it matter.",
            "You are not his priority and you will never be, is hard but is the truth, he also doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship and would care more to do other things than anything with you. Girl get out and don\u2019t ever look back. You will find better, way better",

You should tell him to go to the wedding and find someone who is not long distance who will share the things that you like to do and actually prioritize your relationship.",

That is not a personality difference. That is utterly miserable. \nGo find someone exciting. Who is excited to see you and spend time with you. This shouldnt be the way things are.",
            "Hey, you know that you\u2019re not dating this dude, right?\n\nBecause this list of things he doesn\u2019t see as important are basically definitive of most relationships. If it was just one or two things, it would be a relationship with compatibility issues. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t dating, you just never got the memo.",

            "A lot of people here tearing down this guy, but have you discussed any sort of mental health issues with him?\n\nI ask because I am a lot like what you describe. I'm over ten years older, and have been in many relationships, so I've learned to deal with it much better than when I was younger. I have a disassociation disorder which makes it difficult to find ANYTHING in life important.\n\nHaving the wealth of experience, I don't think your question is unfair though, but also coming from that experience, I certainly used to in my twenties.",
            "I\u2019m sorry... but I have been in a similar relationship before. \nLong distance, the guy didn\u2019t try hard... or at all. \nAfter a while of my 90% and his 10% I was emotionally exhausted and so was my wallet: \nAfter a while you come to the realization that you deserve someone who is willing do put in the same amount of work as you. \nAnd OP, I truly believe that you deserve it. You seem to care about people too much. \n\nI hope you resolve this and good things start coming your way.",
            "He's just not that into you. It sounds rude, but he is doing you a favor by being so blatant. Relationships are _not_ like this. People care about each other and cuddles are mandatory. He might be a good person, but this is clearly not what you want. Find someone who wants the same things. It is so wonderful to love and get loved back in ways that are meaningful to both partners. Either your bf knows and he's just too cowardly to leave, or he doesn't know because he doesn't or can't feel like this for you (or perhaps anyone at this point in time). Either way, you deserve much better because you are willing to give  lot more than a half-assed effort.",
            "It's a fair question.  But the more important piece is that he's not a good fit for you.  It's fine to want what you want in a relationship, the trick is to find someone who wants the most of the same things.",
            "The face I made at this post...\n\nOP, is this how you want to spend your life? Begging your SO to see you/have sex/whatever? Convincing them to go to the freaking movies sometimes? Celebrating holidays with a morose wet blanket?\n\nHe sounds boring and exhausting.",
            "This guy is not the one for you.",
            "Sounds like depression or apathy. He might need to work on himself before a relationship",
            "Sounds like he's become complacent. I wouldn't anticipating that changing any time soon, so it's something you'll have to decide if you're willing to deal with in the long run. In his mind, he's done what he needs to do to found a relationship, and once that foundation is built, he doesn't need to upkeep it. It's nice that he does things for you, but you're right to be annoyed that HE doesn't want to do those things. Seems like minimal effort, and again, complacency.",
            "I don\u2019t usually comment on stuff like this, but it really hit home for me. I was in a relationship like this for 8 months! I\u2019m a person that really wants to feel wanted by my boyfriend- I want them to want to be around me, want to hang out with me, get to know me. But every time I asked my bf what HE wanted, I would get \u201cI don\u2019t need anything. I don\u2019t want things like you do.\u201d Ultimately, this led to the relationship being incredibly one sided because I wasn\u2019t getting what I needed to feel cared for. Both people need to be committed to speaking the other\u2019s love language, as it were, and it felt to me like he didn\u2019t have one. So how was I supposed to show him I cared? \nWhat was really happening was I cared so much more than he did. And I nearly drove myself insane trying to convince myself that I just wasn\u2019t being a good enough gf!!!\n\nWhat I ended up learning was that it is NOT a crime to \u201cwant to feel wanted\u201d! Communication, care for the other person, and desire to make you happy is something you DESERVE in a relationship!! Independence is important, yeah, but you should pursue someone that\u2019s picking up what you\u2019re putting down, ya know? Sorry if that didn\u2019t make sense!",
            "This sounds exhausting. It was a fair question. He doesn't want to answer it honestly. **What's important to him is that he can do what he wants to do when he wants it and you have no input in his life.** He will see you when he wants to see you and ignore you if you're being at all demanding -- and these will be normal demands that a normal human would want in a normal relationship. You don't want anything out of the ordinary. But he cannot provide it. You're already long distance, don't rely on him financially, and have no kids... it's really easy to break up now.

He did the things you like to \"get\" you, but now that he's succeeded he's not sure what to do about it. \n\nI'd find it incredibly hard to be with someone like this. He can be a decent guy but still not a decent boyfriend. And you deserve more than just \"decent\". I hope things get better for you, with or without him. You deserve more. Make sure you get it.",

She stayed relatively upset and cold towards me throughout the funeral, but afterwards it seemed like we started to get closer. That week was honestly living hell, having to go to a man I truly cared for's funeral, while his daughter is mad because she thinks i'm not proposing, all the while I am but cant tell her right now. It sucked\n\nHowever, time went on and things started to get better. Two weeks after the funeral, early November, I talked to her Mom and she helped me develop a new plan. I had convinced my girlfriend to take the whole week of Thanksgiving off, which wasn't hard because she knew the first holiday without her father would be really hard. So I took her on a surprise trip (which was our original mountain trip just later). Our plan was to leave Sunday evening and return Wednesday in time to help her family prep for Thanksgiving.\n\nSo I decided Sunday was my day. Her mom took her out all day to help her get ready for our little get away (aka distract her). I started setting up my proposal.\n\nI first took screenshots of all of the conversations her dad and I had via text about the engagement and printed them out. I was actually able to turn it into 15 individual screenshots of conversation. So I made them into a little book. I also included the picture I took with him the day I asked for his blessing and the two pictures i had of us three all together. \n\nI packed our bags for the trip and decorated the house in flowers and balloons so she'd know something was up as soon as she opened the door. When she opened the door she looked shocked and a little confused. Even more confused when I handed her a book and didn't get down on one knee. I had initially intended to get down on one knee while she read through our conversations but she started crying pretty hard and took the book to the couch in the living room, where I just kind of scooped her up in a hug and asked her to marry me. I had to awkwardly fish the ring out of my pocket and we didn't have the magical getting down on one knee moment, but through her tears she shook her head yes and hugged me, which I thought was even better than expected. \n\nOnce she regained her composer she told me how excited she was, but asked if i would mind if we waited til Monday morning to go to the mountains because she wants to show her mom and brother the book and ring. I didn't care at all and we ended up spending the night at her moms house. We left Monday and had an amazing trip to the mountains and we tried to hit all of her dads suggested proposal spots while we were there and snap pics (even though the weather was a lot colder than when our initial trip was planned) We had an amazing Thanksgiving with our families and now we cannot wait to start wedding planning.\n\nShe decided she no longer wants to get married next October and I obviously understood. Our wedding day is still TBD, but I couldn't be happier.",

            "Awesome job OP. I love your idea for the book, I'm sure it must have meant a lot to her and her family. Best of luck planning the wedding and living your lives together!",
            "I've seriously never cared about a wedding or proposal in my entire life, but I was tearing up reading this. What a sweet and thoughtful way to overcome this awful event; I hope you two have a wonderful life together! Congratulations!",
            ">I also included the picture I took with him the day I asked for his blessing and the two pictures i had of us three all together.\n\nWow! You hit it out of the park! Amazing, so happy for you and your new fiancee!\n\nThat book sounds so touching! And all the photos! Wonderful!",
            "As someone who was proposed to within weeks of a close parent\u2019s death (my momma), *this* is how it can be done without trying to be a detached happy moment in a sea of sadness. I couldn\u2019t think back on the (lack of) proposal without associating it with my mom\u2019s death and a horrible time in my life. You\u2019ve made it so that it was not only a happy moment for you both, but a testimony to both of your relationships with her father and poetically ushers her into a new life without him, but with his blessing and his love.\n\nYou\u2019re a good man, OP. Thanks for making me tear up in the bathroom at work...",
            "NOW I'M CRYING\n\nso glad everything worked out for you and what a thoughtful proposal. I bet she'll cherish that book forever.",
            "Wow  seriously how thoughtful Op.  a moment she will never forget along with a keepsake of her father blessing your marriage.  I would remember and cherish a moment like that always and I\u2019m sure she will as well.  Congrats on the engagement! ",
            "I remember your original post, this is lovely OP.  She is going to treasure that book forever.",
            "Wow. My dad died very unexpectedly in February, and I'm getting engaged soon. I'd give anything to have that little book. You did such a great job.",
            "Getting down on one knee is moot at that point. What a beautiful way to include her father in the proposal.  ",
            "You killed it OP. That was such a thoughtful idea.",
            "How exciting for you both! congrats! I love how you included her father in all of it and made it super special for her! It will be a moment she will never forget!",
            "This gave me goosebumps. I'm so happy for you, OP and I think her father would be proud of the man you've proven to be. The sentimental value in everything you did for her speaks volumes about you as not only her life partner, but as a person in general. This is such a significant moment of unadulterated love that I hope you both carry on throughout the rest of your lives together. Wishing you both every ounce of happiness and strength, especially your now-fiancee as she heals throughout her loss. ",
            "What a lovely update, OP! I absolutely loved your idea on how to incorporate her dad into the proposal - it was very sweet and touching. This seriously bought tears to my eyes. Wishing you and your fiance the best! :)",

            "Wow! You are amazing! What an incredible plan you put together! Thats one of the most thoughtful and heartfelt proposals I\u2019ve ever heard of. The book and coordinating with her mom - astounding. You are a great partner for your future wife! Her grief is going to be a dififcult journey and she is very lucky to have your support. Please be patient with her and know that you are doing a great job. Congratulations on your engagement! ",

            "Omg this made my cry. The printing of convos was genius, very nice job. ",
            "I literally cried when I got to the part about OP making the book out of the texts with her father discussing the proposal. Sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Her father isn\u2019t there to celebrate with her which is devastating but being able to see that he was in on the whole thing is so amazing",
            "I'm glad it worked out okay for you both, you've had quite the rollercoaster of emotions! \n\nCommunicate with each other going forward. I am partly responsible for the failure of my marriage because I became withdrawn, grumpy and failed to care for my wife when I was suffering with my anxiety.\n\n\nExpect your fiance to be uncertain about things with her ongoing grief and maybe even wanting some space sometimes as she works out how she feels buddy. \n\nAll the best to you both! \n",
            "Congratulations OP! You have done an amazing job and your fiancee is such a lucky girl! I wish you all the happiness in this world!",

            "This is so uplifting and I'm glad it worked out with happy tears. Congrats to the both of you and your families! ",
            "Sitting on the pooper and crying my eyes out. Ya'll are adorable people.",
            "Congratulations on your engagement ",
            "You handled this perfectly!!!! Wishing for all the best. \n\nI am truly sorry for your loss and I\u2019m sure it will be tough especially as the \u201cfather daughter moments\u201d of the wedding come up but it sounds like she has a great support system in you and her mom! ",
            "Wow.. this was a great post.  It seriously choked me.  All the best OP for you and your future wife.",
            "Proposals are never 100% to plan. My husband had the place all planned out and thought the words would come to him. They didn't. He was wordless, on one knee. Even though technically he was gaping like a fish and never asked for my hand, it was one of the most beautiful and wonderful moments of my life. Warts and all.\n\nBless y'all and your engagement. Your sweet book was touching and your love of her and her family is obvious. I wish you all the happiness in the world! ",
            "A lovely and thoughtful proposal. I think it was the best idea that you waited. I know she was disappointed and upset, but I'm sure it would have gotten all mixed up in the sad emotions of the timing. So many emotions fly around with the death of a parent. I've experienced myself. I felt like I was in purgatory for weeks, it was just such a strange sensation. It's good that you gave her a little time to deal with those initial emotions a little first.  \nYou waiting the way you did made a sad situation into a wonderful memory that you could share with her and show her. It will give her an extra little positive remembrance of her dad.",
            "Awesome job. As someone who lost their daddy this means the world to me and I\u2019m sure did to her. ",

            "The book! What an incredibly special thing. I, like a few others who posted, am not one to care much about proposals or marriage. Yet here I am sobbing! May you have a long and happy life together. xo",
            "I wouldn\u2019t usually comment but really wanted to say well done OP, you\u2019re obviously a kind and thoughtful person - this was a very classy and considerate way to propose and look after your girlfriend - now fianc\u00e9e! - and I wish you both the best! Congratulations! ",
            "I was afraid you had organized a flash mob proposal at the gravesite.... Gotta admit I think there's too much pressure today to make a huge event out of every step of the wedding cycle.  What you did was think through what your fiancee needed most: honoring her father.  Tough stuff happens.  ",
            "This is so beautiful and so romantic. I'm really happy for both of you.",
            "This post made my eyes all watery. Congratulations to you both! ",

            "Good job. Best of luck to you both.",
            "As someone whose dad died over a decade ago, this made me actually cry. Like full on. Your NOW FIANC\u00c9E is a very lucky woman. You handled this with grace, sensitivity, and love. Congratulations to you both. \ud83d\udc95",
            "Aaaand I\u2019m crying. Great job, OP. You two sound like a lovely couple and I wish you all the happiness in the world. ",
            "That is so lovely OP. Really beautiful idea and now she will cherish the memory of you and her dad forever. I really really love this idea and definitely bring to the book to your wedding! I wish you two all the happiness. ",

            "FUCK I'm crying oh my goodness, CONGRATULATIONS ",
            "The idea for the book has me in tears. I lost my father and if someone ever wants to marry me, it does make me feel a little lost I can't have that of him asking my father. So this really resonated with me. I'm sure she appreciates it so very much. You are such a thoughtful and sweet person she is lucky to have you.",
            "My favorite part is the trip you guys took to visit the proposal spots her father suggested, what a great way to include his memory and also commemorate your engagement. Great proposal!",
            "I am so happy for you both!",
            "\\>_> /r/unpopularopinion time\n\nI read your last post and I was honestly hoping that it ended. Your fiance sounds entitled and selfish. You need to stamp that behavior out and let her know you won't put up with it, or she's going to walk all over you until your early divorce. Do yourself a favor and start going to couples counseling now. I hope things work out for you, but you seriously need to get in front of this problem or you'll regret it. ",
            "Damn OP. Good job. Idk what to say to you man, you're probably better at this emotion and relationship stuff than 99% of posters or commentators in this sub.\n\nSeriously, your proposal is the smoothest and most gracious handling of her dad's death I can think of. ",
            "I\u2019ve never cried reading a post on Reddit before. I can imagine how she felt thinking her dad would never be part of the proposal and the wedding. For you to have talked to him and get his blessing must make such a difference to her. Well done OP. Wish you many happy days. ",
            "This really moved me. You're such a fantastic human being OP.",
            "So nice to hear things are going good with you and your fiance! I just wanted to message you because I actually got engaged on that same Sunday! I just thought that was neat! ",
            "OP, you're making me cry at work. Congratulations, that was really well thought and sweet. <3",
            "That is just about the nicest thing I've ever heard.  You're a good man, OP, and she's a fortunate woman.  ",
            "Marrying someone who gets angry or annoyed at you for not conforming to the relationship escalator schedule is going to end poorly. ",
            "I don\u2019t know, her reaction to blame you for not proposing to her and then giving you the cold shoulder for weeks is not a good sign to me. Yes, she was dealing with her unexpected loss, but not everyone\u2019s first reaction is to get angry with their partner and push them away. There are many people who deal with their loss is much more mature and non-hurtful ways.\n\nJust putting this out there. I doubt it will change anything because OP and fianc\u00e9e are currently happy, but something to be cautious of in the future when life obstacles get thrown her way. Just be careful. Congratulations on the engagement.\n\nEdit: it was a lovely way to propose, by the way.",
            "I would wait for at least Christmas. Might cheer her up a little. My dad died a year ago this week. I was pretty much over it by Christmas as was my sister, and she is the emotional one in  the family. However my dad was 90 so no big shock. \n\nIf not Christmas, Valentine\u2019s day is a good time to consider. Best to play it by ear."

But she keeps escalating the relationship way faster than I feel comfortable. It started when I took out a lease on a bigger apartment last June and she just decided to move in with me, without even really asking. It\u2019s been fine and I enjoy having her around. But then she took out a mortgage on a condo this October. I told her I thought things were moving too fast and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this has nothing to do with you.\u201d I tried to tell her I didn\u2019t want to move there because it\u2019s way further from my job and I would need to buy a car to commute. She got upset and said I wasn\u2019t committed enough to her.\n\nThe condo won\u2019t be finished until December and I told her I\u2019d think about it (which I have). But now it\u2019s turned into her expecting me to help pay the mortgage, furnish the place out of my pocket, and go half and half on a car with her, none of which I agreed to. She also said she expects kids within 2 years, and that she\u2019ll go to a sperm bank if I don\u2019t want to do it.  I just tell her, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d to keep the peace. \n\nShe keeps making these huge life decisions and just expecting me to go along with her. Should I just break up with her? It would break my heart. I really do love her and the life we have together now, as is. But I don\u2019t want a mortgage, or kids. \n\nI\u2019ve never written any of this down before. The more I write the more insane I realize this is starting to sound. I\u2019ve just never initiated a breakup before. It terrifies me and I have no idea how to go about it. I keep ruminating about it constantly. It\u2019s driving me crazy. I need help.\n\nTL;DR \nGF is strong arming me into buying an apartment and having a kid with her way before I\u2019m ready. I think I need to break up with her but I\u2019m scared to.",

            "I think the most telling part of this is where she continues to tell you that if you don\u2019t want one aspect of this, she\u2019ll accomplish it another way. She isn\u2019t treating you like a partner, she\u2019s treating you like filler. You\u2019re filling a spot in her life. She will fill the others by any means necessary. You cannot possibly want this for yourself, to just be a wheel on the vehicle that conveys her to her ideal future at the sacrifice of your own.",
            "Dude. You need to learn to use your words.",
            "If it doesn\u2019t feel right to you, and she\u2019s forcing it on you, I\u2019d break up man. She doesn\u2019t care about what you want, just about what she wants. Sit down and have a talk with her about how you\u2019re feeling and if she reacts badly, I\u2019d end it. Spare yourself some trouble.",
            "She's afraid she's becoming old and wants to hurry up with \"the rest of her life\" (getting married, having children etc) \n\nSince you said she is Chinese, she probably has extra pressure from her family too. \n\nIf you don't want to get married, break up with her now, so that she can go find someone else who wants these things quickly. If you hold her back some more, she will hate you for \"wasting her time\". Asian people date differently from people from the US. We don't just move in with people unless we are sure we are going to marry them.",
            "What is so scary about the idea of doing what is right for you? Let's unpack this.",
            "Consider part of the problem is your unwillingness to have tough conversations.  You keep avoiding the discussions you don't want to have by saying \"I'll think about it.\"  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But I don't want a mortgage, or kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me guess.  You haven't told her that either?  Someone can't 'strong-arm' you if you're not saying 'no' or 'I don't want that'- how would anyone know what you want or don't want if you don't speak up?  Seems like she knows what *she* wants and she's telling you and showing you she's working toward those things and your only definite reply is \"I'll think about it.\"  I think you know what you want (or don't want) but you haven't told **her**.  \n\nYou're just avoiding having the tough conversations you should have had a long time ago by posting what you want to tell your girlfriend on reddit, instead of talking to the only person that matters- your girlfriend.",
            "Every time you say \"I'll think about it\" when what you really mean is \"no,\" you are lying to her. She's created this situation by making decisions unilaterally, bulldozing over you, and manipulating you by accusing you of not being committed to her when you disagree--she's definitely not acting right. But you're not acting right either. Stop lying and stand up for yourself! Tell her no, and break up with her! If you don't want a mortgage or kids, you have to TELL her that.",
            "You need some therapy and assertiveness training to learn how to stick up for yourself instead of letting someone else steamroll you into things you aren't comfortable with. There was plenty of opportunities in the last year and half for you to have set down a boundary, or even broken up with her, and you didn't. Instead, you're blaming her. If you don't set your boundaries, you can't expect other people to know what they are and respect them.",
            "She\u2019s almost 30 bro. You guys are jus at different stages in your life. You\u2019re incompatible and it\u2019s neither of your guys fault. Breaking up is best for both of you.",
            "That 4 year age gap might not seem like a lot but at 28 she's probably much more ready for marriage and kids than you are at 24.\n\nDon't do anything you're not comfortable with. If you aren't ready, be honest and cut her loose so she can find someone who is.",
            "Sounds like you need to break up with this person. You haven\u2019t been with her that long. She is putting her desires first and not even considering your own. On top of this, it seems like she assigns way too much identity and fulfillment in societal measures of \u201csuccess\u201d. These things - marriage and kids - should be seen as the icing on the cake of a good foundation of a relationship, not an end game. End this relationship.",
            "If you don\u2019t want kids you need to break up with her. She\u2019s going about it poorly but you have to understand at 28 she is approaching that time where she needs to have a husband in order to have a kid",
            "I\u2019m 25 this year, been engaged 2 years, with my guy for 5 years... I don\u2019t see the point in rushing. But your comment about really liking her, puts me off. If you can\u2019t even say that you love her after a year and a half I think it\u2019s time to call it. No point in dragging it out for either of you.",

In the end, you agreed to let her move in by not saying NO.  You are agreeing to the escalations by kicking the can down the road and not saying NO.\n\nWanting commitment after a year and a half isn't entirely unrealistic, but she's clearly doing it because she wants THOSE THINGS and not because she wants those things with YOU.\n\nStand up for yourself.  Tell her that you don't see a future with her anymore and you are ending the relationship.  You don't need her agreement or consent to do that.",
            "My ex was like this. We eventually broke up and then a month or two later she found another guy who she quickly moved in with. I later realized that she wasn't really in love with me. She was in love with the idea of marriage, kids, and buying a house and she had a timeline that she \"needed\" to meet, with or without me.\n\nOP, if she's not listening to your needs then you need to get out now while you can. She's 28 so the chances of her changing the way she is now is slim to none.",
            "It sounds like you two are in two completely different relationship phases.  She is ready for a partner, you are still wanting a companion.  Neither are wrong, but they are incompatible. \n\nAnd like another poster mentioned.  It sounds like your girlfriend has a relationship checklist she is working off of and not really investing herself in having an actual relationship with you.",
            "> Should I just break up with her?\n\nYes. 1000x yes. She is steamrolling over your entire life and feelings and plans for your future; she only cares about what she wants and isn't even *listening* to what you want. That is \"get the fuck out of there immediately before you end up with an unwanted life and no idea how to escape it\" territory.",
            "Being alone is better than being unhappy in a couple. Time to end it and do what's right for you.",

There is no way to do it nicely or gently.  There is also, unfortunately, no way to do it that she will accept.  You need to be firm.  She is (probably) going to say all sorts of terrible things about you and make it seem like you are a monster.  You are not a monster.  Relationships take two.

She is going too fast - This is easy: She feels her biological clock ticking now she is approaching 30. It is a fact of life, you can't blame her. But you are still young. When I was your age I was not ready for fatherhood. This is the consequence of your age difference.\n2. Making big decisions for both of you without your input or consent - Worse, she expects you to go along, or rather to tag along as a puppy.  This is really bad and serious! She doesn't respect you. Be careful, because she can get you in trouble (f.i. financially).\n3. She seems to threaten you that she will use other (if not any) means and methods of carrying out her plans -  This is a bad one too. It is her way, her plan, her wish and nothing else. Think about it! A relationship is supposed to be something two people create and give shape - give and take, compromise, discuss, or even negotiate. Not with her. Other people have already hinted at it, when calling you \"her checkbox\". You are indeed her puppy. It also sounds like emotional manipulation to me and the fact that she throws at you that you are not committed enough to her confirms that suspicion (imho).\n\nNow most people here will advice you to run away from this woman, but we (readers of your story) don't know her values as a person and how much she may have to offer you in other ways. Besides, she may not (consciously) realize what she is doing. Giving her the benefit of doubt, the least you can do is make her aware. Being a good man, in a relationship, you should always have the courtesy of giving feedback to your partner.\n\nYou should definitely have a very, very(!!!) serious talk with her.  You can always break up, but *this* is the moment for this important conversation.",

Decisions that feel stable and natural, not pushed and pushed.\n\nIf you allow this behavior - as you have already seen - it will continue and will continue to escalate it.

He slept on the couch of my one bedroom condo. A year in, and I'm wrecked. I can't get away from his drinking, he can't hold a job, and I'm providing for both of us. Then my step dad dies. \n\nNow my step dad was like my real father. Not an alcoholic. Kept a stable job. Always there for me and my mom.\n\nMy now ex swooped in and after three months gave me keys to her place. Keys I didn't want. Then offered her place for me to stay. But only on her conditions.\n\nNow listen, I was real beat up then. I felt trapped. I was depressed. I was drinking too much. And I moved in. \n\nYou know what happened? Her \"rules\" for me kept becoming more strict. She started pushing for babies. And started making me feel bad about wanting my own place and some room for myself. I could go on and on about all the red flags that I discovered with my therapist, but I won't.\n\nAs soon as things ended, within weeks, she was onto a new guy. A new sperm donor. Because women like this (and not all women, for sure) are so focused on themselves and their plan that they will manipulate you when you're down and try and fit you into their plan like a puzzle piece. And don't get me wrong! Men do this, too. \n\nShe sees you as a piece to her perfect life. She doesn't have any respect for you. Or any regard for what you want.

She wants to accomplish things with or without you, and that's a telling sign that she doesn't really need or want you there. She obviously does not care about how you feel, and no relationship can survive with one person having the attitude of 'its my way or the highway' you need to try and talk to her about this and her controlling behavior. And if she doesn't back off or start respecting what you want, as well as take into consideration what you would like In not only this relationship but in life, you need to break up.",

            "Hey, I just want to let you in on a little story.\n\nNot my story, but it's my friend's story. I don't have exact details, but my friend's parents got married when her dad was 22 and her mother was 32. I met her in middle school and her dad seemed like the type of guy who loved his family a lot and would spend time with my friend constantly. However, by the time we reached high school he just up and left, had an affair with a friend's wife (the husband died) and shit really went down from there. It wasn't until recently when he decided to tell my friend his side of the story and he's in the process of apologizing to her and mending the relationship.\n\nHowever, when my friend told me how young her dad was when he got married to her mother, it clicked in my head that this guy, who was in the military and just started adulthood, hastily got married to a woman in her early 30's and probably didn't experience enough in life to fully see the situation. She did have a previous husband and divorced him and was probably quick to marry the next guy that came along. Maybe he did think he was ready for marriage, but the age difference felt unsettling to me. \n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is forcing you to get married. I speculate that it's because of her age and she's worried that if you won't marry her then she will never find another person. If you aren't comfortable, you are perfectly valid for feeling that way. You need to put your foot down and tell her that you aren't ready for the next step in your life. You may have to brace yourself and mentally prepare to leave her. If she does not respect your boundaries or wants to find something else, then I am sorry that this had to happen. \n\nI was also in a similar situation, though my ex and I were the same age. It was two years ago when he told me he was taking me on a trip to Japan. I was ecstatic! We both loved anime and Japanese pop culture, and we both wanted to visit Japan some time in the future. I was about to graduate college at the time and I really appreciated that he would do this much for me. However, when I talked to a friend about our trip, she asked me if he was possibly going to propose. Then the realization hit me. The trip. What it meant to us. The fact we'll be alone for an extended period of time. We talked about marriage occasionally, but I thought of it as a casual conversation, something we would discuss in the future. I wasn't thinking about it seriously yet. I still felt unsure about marriage and the anxieties that followed. I had the notion that marriage was a sacrifice and if I didn't do it right, it would mean decades of unhappiness and unfulfillment to me. I know that I can change that fate, but the only married role models I had were not the happiest or most uplifting role models (my mother and my grandma.) This realization, and my ex's hastiness to do the deed, hit me like a ton of bricks and I had anxieties about it for the next year. \n\nIn the end, he and I are not together. He has another girl friend who he moved in with the beginning of this week. They started dating a month after I officially said that he and I will never get back together anymore. In hind sight, I think I made the right choice. I lost my first love, but I don't believe he and I were meant to be together. He was ready to settle down. I was not.\n\nHowever, do not take this as a lost of hope. I'm actually glad I broke up with him because now I got a chance to breathe and be on my own for a bit. I believe I instinctively knew I needed the alone time to mature and rethink what I thought about marriage. I also needed the alone time to work on my other priorities, like my career and my financial situation. I think that if I got married, I would not have been able to handle the shift in my life. I believe that if things end between you and your girlfriend, you won't be forever alone. I believe that, if you have the right mindset, you can change your life and prepare yourself for marriage. I believe you can use that time to mature yourself and the next time you date you will date with intention. And if she understands and stays with you, then that will be good too!\n\nHopefully this helps and stay strong \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 You will get through this!",

            "IMO, you guys need to either agree on a timeline, or break up. I say this as a 33-year-old woman who struggled to get pregnant. I get why she wants to settle down now; the problem here is that BOTH of you need to be all in on your future plans. She can\u2019t make them without your input, like she has been, and you can\u2019t just drag your feet to avoid a tough conversation, like you have been.\n\nFirst of all, do you want to marry her/make her your life partner? Second, do you also want to have children?\n\nIf yes to both questions, then you need to mutually decide when you want to get engaged (say, in another year, 2 years, 3, 4, etc.), married, buy a home, and have kids (obviously doesn\u2019t have to be in that order as long as you both agree on when). \n\nPlease keep in mind that it\u2019s very hard to plan for kids, and it can take up to a year to conceive even if there are no problems with either of you - and that as both of you age, but particularly her since she is 4 years older, it will be harder and take longer. So waiting a few more years before you get started may limit the total number of kids you can have. Obviously that doesn\u2019t mean you should rush to have a kid before you are ready (I waited until I was 32 to even try) - you just need to be realistic that if y\u2019all don\u2019t even begin trying to conceive until she\u2019s 32 or 34 or 36 or 38, then you may not get to have a huge family, and you may even need some fertility treatment that wouldn\u2019t have been necessary when you were younger. If both of you are okay with this, then great! If not, then you both need to make sure your family size goal is realistic to your ages and current life circumstances. (For example, having 6 kids is not realistic for most women if they don\u2019t start until age 35, but having just 1 or 2 is.)\n\nIf you answered \u201cno\u201d or \u201cIDK\u201d to either question, then honestly, you should re-evaluate this relationship. Making a timeline is NOT a good idea if you aren\u2019t 100% certain that this is what you want. It will be much easier and less painful for both of you in the long run if you break up now and find someone whose life goals align more closely with yours, rather than getting further entangled in a relationship/marriage that isn\u2019t what both of you truly want.",

            "You have a 28 year old girlfriend. Of course she will be thinking about her biological clock. It sounds like she is communicating clearly her needs and expectations and you are lying to her and placating her. Don\u2019t do that. You need to be honest if you aren\u2019t ready and should not expect her to wait around.",
            "I would just break up with her, without wasting any money on therapy. I know it sounds harsh, but you need to do this for your own greater good.\n\n\nShe doesn't see you as her partner. Instead, to her, you're her obedient marionette, who's ready to help her accomplish things that you're not ready for. If she doesn't understand that you're not ready to move into another house, or to have kids, then she needs to get some self awareness, because this isn't a goddman game. We're talking about getting married, buying a house, and kids.... KIDS, MAN DO YOU HEAR ME? You wouldn't want your kids to have a bad childhood because you're not ready for them, right? It's way better to get ready and settle down when you feel it's time.\n\n\n\nOnce again, we are talking about commitment. She had the gall to move into your home, without paying rent, and without asking you. She had the gall to buy a house, and expect you to pay for it, without even discussing it with you. She had the gall to buy a car and expect you to split the bill, without even goddman telling you about it. How much more are you going to take? She's crazy! After all these occurrences, what makes you think she doesn't have the gall to go to a Sperm bank without telling you about it, and ruining your life?\n\n\nOP, get some guts, and tell your girlfriend that you don't want to see from her, or hear from her ever again. Find someone suited for your pace. Someone in the same branch, indifferent of their age.\n\n\n\nAnd don't be afraid of being alone. It's way better to be alone, than to be forcefully married to a woman you will soon grow to hate, a woman who treats you like her obedient puppy, who doesn't consider your opinions, and who disconsiders your value as a person, not to mention having your life locked because of unwanted kids. Think carefully, and break up with her. Therapy won't help, because if she's able to make all those LIFE CHOICES, about YOUR LIFE, BEHIND YOUR BACK, then she won't care about a therapist's words. She just won't care, and will continue manipulating you until you find yourself locked in a shit life. Live your life, and find a girl who truly loves you. The girl line doesn't end with your current girlfriend, OP.\n\n\nDon't be stupid.",
            "Breaking up is hard to do.\n\nGoing along with what your girlfriend seems to want from you could be much harder in the long run.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to move on and find someone you're more compatible with and works with you to communicate and make major decisions as mutual decisions.",

She's just bossing you around. Partnership requires cooperation and compromise, not steamrolling someone to lock them down. This won't end well. She's controlling and I'd be very surprised if she isn't abusive in other ways as well. You may love her, but doesn't care one iota about you. It's likely if you marry she never works a day your entire marriage, and you'll be miserable the whole time. People who move to fast tend to do it to lock you down before their mask to hide who the really are starts to slip. Your life well genuinely suck if you put up with and just go along with whatever she says. Not, \"I'll think about it\". Actually say no and why.

And my mom is still alone, with 2 kids, and miserable, because she doesn't understand how to not be self-centered. \n\nThis is not your problem, this is hers.

It's not easy and it definitely gets stressful.\n\nKids are just added stress too btw. It's yet another thing to argue about and compromise with. Plus it's another life that has emotions and feelings and their way of doing things. \n\nI think if it's too fast you definitely should not rush it and tell her that it's pushing you away. You also have to think of it from her point of view. She's probably thinking that she's getting older and is running out of time. She's probably scared and just not vocalizing it in a way for you to understand. Women suck at that sometimes lol. But you really have to take that into consideration.\n\nI'm starting to realize that the more you both worry about the other person instead of yourselves that things get A LOT easier.",

Afterwards, you should probably seek some counseling from a professional about why you allowed your own interests to be minimized for so long.   \n\n\nThere is no need to sign yourself up for a lifetime of financial responsibility and emotional strong-arming because you feel like being alone would be a bummer.",

If those aren't your goals, say so and plan accordingly! \n\nShe can't (without being physical) force or escalate anything without your permission and in this instance, your complacency is acting as a type of permission.  \n\nWrite down what you want so it's clear in your mind. Ask for a time to discuss with her. If these things aren't going to line up with her goals and common long term relationship goals, then it's sensible to end the relationship. \n\nI don't think common interests are all that important. I think common core ethics and morals are, along with respect and support for the other person's choices. Try not to get caught up in the notion of shared interests and personal goals as making for a solid basis for a long term relationship. Honesty, trustworthiness, communicative, kind, ethical, patient, vulnerability etc.... that sort of stuff (in my experience) makes for a far better relationship foundation. \n\nIf this isn't working for you, then speak up. You are your own best advocate and if you can't communicate your needs, or she doesn't listen to them, then you need to end the relationship. It will hurt and it will suck and then it will get better and you both will be OK after some time. \n\nBTW, you dont \"have to be cruel to be kind\".

            "I know this will get buried but I have to tell the story. I was that woman. Well, kind of. I met the guy who was the love of my life, my made up life in my head. I was planning our wedding three months in and figuring out how to live together and talking about all of the plans. I never asked him what he wanted, just decided. I was so excited to be in a relationship where he loved me back and so happy to actually want to be married. I didn't even think about his needs.\n\nOne day, he sat me down and very gently told me he didn't want to be married again. He had already been divorced once and didn't want to go through that.\n\nMy whole dream, the life I built in my head shattered. I was so angry. We didn't really break up, but I treated him like dirt. I was so mean. How dare he take away MY DREAM?!? \n\nI don't remember much after that, but I remember our last day together. I do know something had changed and we talked about getting officially back together that day. I remember the sun being bright and shiney, I remember the motorcycle ride we went on with my friend Scott. I remember going left instead of right because, for the only time ever, they didn't wait at the turn. I was so mad. \n\nI remember him turning just a little and smiling and giving me a little wave. I remember it made me less mad. I remember the car that hit him broadside. I remember him flying through the air and knowing he was dead before he got the ground. \n\nTo this day, it is my single biggest regret. He loved me with all his heart, and I was so mad. I thought that was love. After all that's how my mom treated my dad.\n\nNow, you don't need to die. You need to leave because no matter what you do, if it doesn't match what's in her head, or even if it does, it will never be good enough. I can tell you it took two years of soul searching on my part to figure out why I treated him like that. It took getting on mood stabilizers to help me control my manic depression so I don't treat my wonderful husband like that. \n\nIt took him dying in front of me to want to change.

Since she is getting close to thirty, she is probably feeling the urgency that some women feel about starting a family. None of that excuses her trying to force you into it, though. If you really want to try and make it work, my advice would be if you could really see yourself wanting those things with her down the road (say in four years instead of two), then tell her that.

As time went along he said a lot of the same things, like \"I want us to be living together before a year\" when he knew I had trauma surrounding a relationship with an ex I'd signed a lease with who was verbally and physically abusive and it was very hard to get out. When I pseudo moved into his apartment at age 24 (unintentionally, he just happened to be living near me when I needed a place to stay while my family was moving), he started making noise about marriage and started pushing me to do things I wasn't sure I wanted (like he wanted me to get my MBA so I could financially cover us, which was not something I'd ever said I wanted). I put up barriers around myself (things like I wanted to finish school before he could propose so I could be financially stable, or I wanted to decide for myself when I got out of school whether I wanted to work or go to grad school) to slow him down, but he'd talk to my dad about \"our wedding\" in front of me like it was a foregone conclusion. When I finally broke up with him, he made noise about how I'd wasted his time and how he'd planned on buying a ring that winter (keep in mind I *wouldnt have been out of school for another year so he wasn't even following my boundaries*) and how now he needed to \"find someone else\" to fill that role and how much harder it would be now that he's 30. \n\nIt took me years to realize what you're starting to realize yourself: marriage and kids and all that stuff are meant to be things that you do *with* someone you love. Shoehorning someone into a role in your life to meet a certain deadline of societal expectations just ends up making everyone miserable. You're not going to be happy being a checked box in someone else's life story. \n\nSo stand up for yourself! If you're not ready, you're not and that's ok. If you want you can try to approach her and say \"I love you but I am not ready yet for the stage in my life that you are pushing right now. If you are ok slowing your pace I would love to try to find a compromise for our timelines but I understand if your timeline is too much of a priority for you. I wont be ready for what you need in that case and it would be better for us both to part ways now\". Then if she wants to compromise you know that you matter more than the timeline and something can be worked out. If she throws a fit, then you no longer need to feel bad and can go out there and find someone who's not just trying to cast you into a role in their personal life story. \n\nPS: after breaking up with him I met someone who makes me feel excited about moving in with him and getting married someday and we both feel impatient about getting there together when we are both ready, so I promise it happens :)",
            "Dude the more I keep reading about narcissists because I discovered my ex was one the more this sounds like you\u2019re dealing with a narcissist.  Idk I could totally wrong but it just reads that based on the little you wrote.\n\nI will also say this.  Im and I remember when I was 24 and not wanting to settle down, so I get it.  But now that I\u2019m 29 I want to settle down.  It\u2019s crazy how a few years can make such a big difference.\n\nShe may be in that mindset where as you are not!\n\nFood for thought.",
            "Bro... what are you doing going along with this? She moved in without talking to you first, bought a place in the suburbs expecting you to split the cost and expects kids in 2 years when haven\u2019t even proposed to her yet? You are 24 years old man, I know some people are ready by then but I can tell you are not. Fuck, I\u2019m 30 and I\u2019m not even close. Get out of this. Now. Imagine how it will be married to her if she just does everything without consulting you. You\u2019re a means to her end of having kids and that\u2019s all you\u2019ll be to her. There are plenty of women out there. Don\u2019t get pressured into something you\u2019re not ready for because she thinks it\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen.",
            "This doesn\u2019t sound like pushing commitment as much as her just wanting a free ride. Run.",
            "You may love her now, but you may come to hate her longterm.\nOr you will actually have an amazing life, who knows.\nShe does sound controlling tho",
            "What are you in the relationship for? Are you just marking time until you are an adult?\n\nSo, from what you wrote, here's the conclusion I get: yes, break up with her. She needs a grown up man, not a big child.",
            "It sounds like your her checklist and not her partner. I always wanted marriage and kids and my husband took a lot longer to come around. But I waited until he was ready on his own time. You need to cut it off with her. You deserve someone who respects you and she clearly does not. I would NEVER tell my husband (even when he was my bf) that I would go to a sperm bank if he didn\u2019t knock me up. That\u2019s nuts. Also, she does not realize that it takes WAY LONGER than people think it does to conceive. My guess is if you stayed with her and tried to conceive, she would go to the sperm bank anyways because she would blame you for not having good enough sperm or something stupid like that. I know people that took 3 years of meticulous tracking to conceive. Your gf is nuts and does not respect you.",
            "She\u2019s a lot older than you and if you\u2019re not where she is that\u2019s fine. Find someone you deserve who doesn\u2019t pressure you into living your one life a certain way.",
            "> She also said she expects kids within 2 years, and that she\u2019ll go to a sperm bank if I don\u2019t want to do it. I just tell her, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d to keep the peace. \n\nShe is being honest with you about what she wants. You owe her the same. Don't waste her time of you don't want the same.",
            "Honestly, no matter how you protest here to strangers on Reddit, it seems like you are allowing yourself to get dragged along. If your goal is just to pacify the GF and make her stop talking every time, I guess I understand why \u201cI\u2019ll think about it\u201d would seem like a productive thing to say. But it\u2019s useless if you want to achieve any real clarity or change with her. Using this so often as a crutch makes you appear fairly avoidant in your communication style.\n\nThe way you explain things, it sounds like the GF is a little steamrollery...and yet I can\u2019t help but wonder what her side of the story would be. This is such a lop-sided situation that there has to be more to it. How exactly has she unilaterally forced her way into your place and started to secure your financial support for what are her life choices?",
            "If I'm being frank, it sounds less like she wants a relationship and more like she wants someone to drag around behind her. If she's willing to treat you like an accessory AND not care about how that impacts you, I'd leave her. Yeah, the process of breaking up will suck, but being free from someone like that far outweighs the anxiety/stress of being with someone who makes you feel like you don't matter.",
            "She's on a time crunch dude (28 vs 24).",
            "Honestly, after a year and a half you just \"really like her\"? I can see why someone would be upset that she is making all the decisions for you, but it really seems like its only because you haven't lifted a finger either direction.\n\nI feel like you should break up, mostly because you don't seem strong enough emotionally to be in a relationship and that can attract the type of people who will be dominate and make things happen.",
            "If I were you I'd be more scared to NOT break up with her and wind up with a mortgage, car payment, and kids. If you're not ready yet, those are WAY scarier than a break-up.",
            "No matter how long you've been together, if you're not ready then you're not ready. You'll only make yourself miserable by going along with things you don't want. My husband and I got engaged at almost 2 years of being together, but we had been talking about marriage for a while. My twin brother, on the other hand, dated his now wife for 4 years and had 3 kids then got engaged. I would hate to have 4 kids (which he now has), but he loves it. Everyone is different. She sounds like she's not treating you like a partner, as others have pointed out. If she is so set on doing things regardless of if you're on board or not, then let her go do that and go your separate ways. She can call you out for your lack of commitment, but if she's willing to do things by herself, she's only committed to herself as well.\n\nEdit: Also, it makes some sense she is so rushed on kids and stuff since she's almost 30. Some people have a timeline. I can't fault her there, but I understand your limits as well.",
            "You're in your early 20s. She's pushing 30. This is to be expected. \n\n\nHonestly I'd suggest you date someone who's in the same stage of life as you.",
            "She\u2019s at that age where she wants these things and that\u2019s reasonable. You are not at the same page as she is. So either sit down and come up with a compromise that works for the both of you or break up. She deserves to have what her heart desires which there might be a man out there better fitted for her. And maybe you\u2019ll want these things in the future and maybe not.",
            "So I'm going to point something out here.  Because you two have a slight age gap, you are in different places in your lives.  She is ready to settle down, but you are not at that place.  And that's fine.  It just means that you want different things and aren't compatible.  \n\nHave a calm discussion about what you want, what she wants.  When is she feeling ready for certain things and when do you feel ready for certain things.  \n\nThen together make a decision.",
            "She seems extremely manipulative, you were supposed to decide these things together and not this way. Be careful, I wouldn't be surprised if she punctured the condoms without you knowing. You have to thank god she is showing what she is capable of in this early phase of the relationship, most ones only show later on.\n\nTake care man.",
            "Tell her to bounce. Tell her she is a controlling nag and it's not worth  the time",
            "A mortgage and kids are two LIFETIME commitments. If you let her drag you into that without being prepared yourself, you are going to lose so much money and so much personal freedom that you aren't ready to give up. She seems to know what she wants and so do you. And they are two different things. At this point you're just delaying an inevitable break up in the hopes of her coming around. \n\nIf you legitimately don't want kids, check out r/childfree. They have many stories about SO's dragging them into having kids or them witnessing the affects of people having kids when they're not ready or even sure they wanted any. You can even cross post this post on that sub and they will let you know what all goes into having kids. It's a lot and it's VERY long term.",

            "If you don't break up with her now then you're going to live an unsatisfying life. You guys don't have the same desires. There's women out there that would prefer to take things slow like you. I say break up and live the life you want to.",
            "for all the people acting like  his gf is a bad person, she has a biological clock ticking and at a year and a half this conversation should have happened. \n\nneither of you are entirely wrong. she is at a different place in her life and she shouldn't be doing these things without you and expecting you to go along with it and you should have been straight with her by now rather than wasting her time.",

I've decided I do not want to be a part of that and am breaking up with you so you can find someone that DOES want those things.  I will help you move back to your company studio and then that's it.\"\n\nStay strong.  Write it down if you need to.  She will probably fight and bully you and make things up about buying the condo for you, or that you agreed to this, or what will she tell people, etc.  Do not engage in this conversation.

            "It\u2019s morally upright for the more committed to wait for the other. Positive progress at whatever speed necessary. Otherwise the less committed will naturally lose interest as you have clearly indicated. Furthermore, it should be in the best interest for the one more committed to live in true love and not in forced love. Which usually ends up being a dead road.....and then being left with kids from a broken home plus all sorts of complications. If she can\u2019t understand this.....Exit!",

            "This is not good bro, you need to sit her down and really talk about all this and how you feel about it and if she still plans on sperm banks, mortgages, and cars then unfortunately you might have to make the tough decision to break up if your not willing to let her make all your life decisions for you which would then in turn most likely lead to you absolutely resenting her when your waking up to a screaming baby ever day that you didn't even want in the first place in a condo that you dont want to live in. So ya talk to her man and dont stuff your feelings.",
            "You two aren't even close to being on the same page about your lives and your future. Also, be **VERY** careful about birth control. Make sure you wear condoms and if you're sure you don't want kids any time soon, consider getting a vasectomy. A modern vasectomy has excellent reversal rates and you can get it reversed when you're ready to be a father. She's willing to strong-arm you into a number of things without you being onboard, don't let one of those things be parenthood.   \n\n\nAs for breaking up, you can just say, \"It's become very clear to me that we have very different goals and views of the future and they're not compatible. It's best if we break up, make a clean break with no black and forth, and I sincerely hope that you find someone who shares the same goals for the future as you do.\" It's OK to break up with someone even if you love them. A partnership relationship is built on far more than just love and you two aren't on the same page on many things that are critically important for long term relationship success. Stop saying \"I'll think about it\" and start saying, \"I've thought about it and my conclusion is that we're not compatible.\" Don't backslide. Breaking up is hard for everyone and it is scary, but that's no reason not to do it.",
            "This isn't love! I know it's hard to see sometimes! But you can find someone who is much more compatible she will find someone else for her cookie cutter life.\n\n\n\n\nAs for breaking up you tell her, \"I'm sorry, our life paths do not match up this will not work out in the long term please take your things and go.\" Do not accept arguments, do not accept complaints. You wanting the relationship over IS ENOUGH.",
            "Looks like you answered your own question, you don't want a mortgage, you don't want kids, she does, needs them, will even go to a sperm bank to get it done, \n\nThey're deal breakers, it's sad but it has to be done, getting trapped with a mortgage, a marriage, a kid, when you don't want them will lead to decades of resentment which will turn to hate.",
            "Hi! As a married women who is 28, I think there might be a mental age gap. She's ready for these huge commitments probably because that's what is happening with her peers. Also about the pregnancy thing- by 30 you are technically at risk but people have healthy babies later in life still. \n\nWhen I was your age I was still getting to know myself and the meaning of life. Your brain is still growing and it's okay to stay with her or break up. That being said, you should have conversations with her about how you feel. You shouldn't feel like you have no say in decisions and no control.",
            "Everyone has their own timetable for when things should happen for them. And I don't mean that this is a bucket list thing, like some are saying,  but that each person matures at a particular rate. Women tend to mature faster than men on the whole and you're younger than she is, and you don't have a ticking biological clock either.\n\nIt's entirely possible she's really in love with you. She cans see you as her kids Dad, waking up beside you at 95 and feeling the luckiest woman in the world, wanting to be the one you want forever.  I get a little ticked when ppl assume marriage minded people just want to tick boxes.  It's possible,  sure. But more likely she's at that stage in her mind/heart and she's in love with you. I'd approach the situation as if this were true.\n\nUnfortunately,  you're not at this stage. It's always sad when this happens,  especially when you get along well otherwise.  But even in this I'm seeing some major issues. Even if you were ready to settle down and thought she was \"the one\", I don't see a lot of respect for your opinion on major life decisions. And it sounds like you'd be chafing under that at the best of times. She's pretty domineering, and you making that known in the narrative makes me think you're less submissive than she has determined. There's a mismatch and it probably won't change.\n\nThere is no easy way to break up, especially when you live together.  In order to make this less traumatic,  I recommend finding your own place and arranging the move out before saying much to her. During the waiting period you can reiterate that you might be \"thinking it over\" but that ATM you're still not in agreement with her wishes. If she brings up not being adequately committed,  tell her that maybe she's right and you'll consider that too. The day before the move out, just tell her you're done thinking.  You're not adequately committed,  because you're not ready to be. And that she's free to find a partner that is ready for marriage. You wish her the best but her future is not with you/yours is not with her.  Be as kind as you can...but be firm.\n\nShe'll ugly cry. She'll probably accuse you of stringing her along (you didn't,  you considered her position and made plans), not trying hard enough (not true but that's how she's going to feel) and reneging on the condo (when you said you didn't want it).  Just tell her your mind is made up and then go.\n\nDon't let her guilt you. If you ever want to be married,  you're entitled to decide when you're ready based on who you are and your own will. She's ready, you're not.",
            "You're a passive personality and she is using you like a doormat. She knows that you'll just go along with whatever she says because you are afraid of conflict. \n\nAt some point you're going to have to just bite the bullet and end it or you're going to be living the life she wants for you rather than what you want for yourself.",
            "Ok, this will make you mad and you will probably respond back with snark and ignore my message. That's fine, you do you, I can't control your reaction. I do, however, want to teach you something I was taught about relationships that changed my life. Things are so easy now after grasping this concept, and I want all men to experience how easy and amazing a relationship can be when both people are fulfilling their biologically natural roles. So if I am harsh it is because, to be frank, modern men need it. We have been coddled, feminized, weakened and brainwashed to behave counter to nature so much that modern women find us repulsive and pathetic. As a result of this they walk all over men and do not respect them. We become nothing more than sperm donors and a joint financial contributor, not a lover or vla valued life partner. This is so true in your case it is almost comical, she straight up told you that she considered you a sperm donor. Do it in 2 years or I'll get a sperm donor, she told you. It is the same either way to her. She decides she wants something, she doesnt care if you do, she just wants that half paid for. In return she gives you a taste of that pussy and you continue along like a sap. Does it sound like respects and values YOU? Even though she seems to be taking it fast, she is more so using you and you are letting her. How did it get like this? Is she evil? 99% of the time the answer is not at all, she is just doing what your behavior dictates. You see, in a sexual relationship there are two roles. There is a masculine role and a feminine role. If the male does not embody and live fully, completely and comfortable in his masculine state a women simply will not be comfortable embodying her natural famine state. Masculine energy is emotionally centered, strong, purpose driven and demands respect. A man respects himself, his time, and demands that others treat him with the respect he deserves and has for himself. He is honest and strong I'm conviction. He doesn't take his women too seriously when she is all over the place and emotionally reactive, because he is loving, playful and emotionally stable.\nFeminine energy is flirtatious, mischievous, emotionally reactive, biologically and emotionally driven instead of logically driven. It is prone to fantasy and connection, is impulsive and carefree. It is often feisty and provocative due to an innate desire to constantly test a man. They do this to make sure you truly are strong, driven, and a man, not just pretending. Once you pass these tests, it is submissive, for awhile... until they test again. It is also, especially nowadays, exceedingly rare. \n\nYou see, in our society women have been told they need to be more masculine, and men have been told they need to be more feminine. If you are reading these traits and scoffing at me right now, it is probably because you've never experienced a women in her natural, comfortable state as a lover, and never been a man as nature intended. Most have not. This is why half of all marriages end in divorce, and the other half are toughing it out with bitter resentment. We have lost our natural roles. Ever hear a women ask where the real men are? \n\nOK so why am I telling you this? Well, to be honest, you are a text book case of a weak man whose woman who does not love or respect. You are not acting like a man and she resents it. She does not feel like you have the ability to take control, protect her, or be the rock she needs.. so she takes on the masculine traits you lack. This leads to her not being able to simply submit and fully embrace her feminine being like she wants.\n\n\nTo start fixing this you need to tell her your stance without hesitation, be firm in your convictions, and if she doesn't accept it you have to leave (I would give her some time to accept it, but not forever. Do not waver. Say that you are sorry it took you so long, but this is how you feel. She's been building this up in her head and you've been cruel by being weak and playing along to avoid standing up for yourself. It will take some time for her to accept this drastic change, if she can.). If you have to walk away and the damage is already done, most likely she will eventually miss you, realize she was wrong, and come back with a better attitude. If she does it is your role as a man  to show some integrity and take control of your life from now on. Start being loving, caring, and strong, not selfish and weak. You do this by having a backbone, being true to what you want and are ready for, and to be unwavering in your purpose. Never let her make a decision like this without your input first. She will try. She will test, I promise she will. Stand up to her and be strong and promise she will start to open up and start acting like a loving and caring partner again. Right now you're basically along for the ride, letting her run the show and indulging in her every whim and fantasy.... of which you have no intentions of actually seeing through. \nBefore you start trying to rationalize your weak and feminine behavior, hear this...\nYou are not doing this for her, you are doing this for yourself, to avoid having to be a man and standing up for yourself. It is time to make some changes and to rethink the way you approach women and relationships. I would reccomend you read corey Wayne's \"How to be a 3% man.\" This dude gets natural human relationship roles better than anyone. Feel free to message me if you need direct help.",
            "her biological clock is a bit further advanced than yours. especially given social pressure and expectations of women, she is likely feeling a lot of that pressure.\n\nif it's too soon for you to commit, just let her know that you're not ready. if she needs commitment right now, she at least has the information she needs to make a decision for herself."
