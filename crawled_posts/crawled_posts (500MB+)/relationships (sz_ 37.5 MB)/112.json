        "selftext": "Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4hw45v/my_26f_mom_died_a_couple_days_ago_my_boyfriend/\n\nThanks everyone that sent me condolences about my mom. It's been really hard these past several days but I've been hanging in there okay. \n\nI tried being reasonable to John about he wanted to handle things...I even told him like one poster here suggested that he didn't have to go to the service, but could wait in the lobby with my daughter while the service was on going, then she could spend time with my family after the service, but he again, shot it down. He would be able to hear the service and that was \"a violation of his beliefs and asking to compromise on those beliefs was unconscionable and unfair to our daughter\". \n\nI told him I had had it. This is the icing on a very large cake. I told John that as of this week, I wanted our bank account separated (he made us join accounts to make sure we split everything equally to be fair despite ME making more) and that I'd be staying with my brother after the funeral while we figured out what to do wether that was a total breakup or counseling. It was up to him. He said counseling was for \"the weak minded\" and that we were staying together despite my \"empty threats\" and there was no way in fuck he was letting me take his money. He became very loud and in my face during this conversation so I just let him throw his tantrum until he took my silence as agreement.  \n\nI took my daughter with me to the viewing with no problems. John and I barely spoke that day, which was fine by me. But it hit the fan the next day....when I got up in the morning to get myself ready and get my daughter ready, I discovered that he had the motherfucking gall to PARK HIS CAR DIRECTLY BEHIND MINE, blocking me into the driveway.  I had no way to get to the funeral in my own car. John ALWAYS drives to work, but for reasons I can only image were to get back at me, decided to take the metro, and took the baby carriage and bottles, and my pump with him. \n\nMy brother and I have our differences, granted, in fact we haven't talked much since my mom and I were estranged (we started talking again after she was sick), but he'll forever be a saint to me for what he did. I called him crying, and he and my sister in law arrived within 20 minutes. SIL calmed me down and helped me get my daughter ready, and they brought along spare bottles, a carrier, and a breast pump. Thanks to them I was able to go my mom's funeral in comfort, and my daughter was an angel during the service. They calmed me down and everything went perfectly, and even though I was a mess most of the day, having my daughter with me, and my SIL and even my brother with me to lean on gave me peace on the inside. \n\nI've made up my mind not to tolerate John's insane and controlling behavior anymore. He had a litany of excuses for doing what he did (he even tried to claim his car had problems) and I don't want to hear any of them. I never wanted to be a single mom...I always wanted to raise my baby within a family. But I've decided that going alone is so much better than doing it with this man, who thought nothing of trying to kick me while I was down. My brother's arranged for me to talk to a friend of his that specializes in family law this week, and we're taking it from there. \n\nI still feel so guilty for what happened with my mom...I miss her so much. I hope from here on out I can make her proud of me, despite my mistakes.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend flew off the deep end and tried to block me into my driveway to stop me from going to my mom's funeral with my daughter. My brother and SIL came to the rescue. We're now seperated and I intend to move forward on my own. ",

I had a feeling when I read your first post that this would end in breakup, but I hadn't thought that he was so much of a jackass as to deny a baby food (bottle feeding where breastfeeding is not appropriate) and shelter (carriage to keep her out of the sun and wind). That's fucking criminal and you could use it against him in your custody case, especially of your brother and SIL are willing to testify that they had to bring you supplies.",

And thirdly, I'm glad you have a supporting family who came through for you. \n\nAnyways. Your ex sounds down right horrible. In your first post you said he called your mother a cunt and said she deserved it. I would have left he then and there, no one talks like that about family, not even if you have differences with said family, especially if they have passed away. Any amazing qualities he had were all a charade and he showed you his true self. I'm proud of the fact that you realized that even though your daughter may not know her father, she is going to be better off. Take care of yourself and your daughter OP. ",

He, my ex, didn't even WANT to be a part of my sons life, he just wanted control, wanted to win. I won because I kept my cool, logged EVERYTHING, screenshot every text he ever sent me, and after many failed attempts at trying to peacefully talk (he would always scream and say he didn't want to hear what I had to say, start gaslighting me on EVERYTHING, tell me how worthless and horrible I was) I started doing most of our communication via email. That way it was easier to avoid a he said, she said. I had proof. \n\nGet a lawyer (I reread and see that you are doing that) and be proactive. Serve him papers first. That gives you the upper hand. My ex served me first and it was a uphill battle (until he was caught in lies thanks to my proof). NEVER post anything bad about your ex, or your situation on facebook. Ever. It will be used against you. No matter how much it sucks avoid talking bad about him (except to your closest friends) because that will also be used against you. I've no doubt your dude, if he is anything like mine was, will make this nasty and tell lies. You can win with your truth. \n\nMy lawyer told me, \"Meggasaurus, the difference between him and you is he has a case based on lies. You have a case based on truth. If you keep telling the truth eventually he is going to get caught in his lie.\" And he did.\n\nAlways be 100% honest with your lawyer, even if it makes you look bad. We all have weak moments of being a crappy person, especially when we reach our breaking point with crazy dudes. Let your lawyer know the time you freaked out at him. It probably isn't as bad as you think, but they need to know because your ex's lawyer will DEFFINITELY know about it and will play it up. Your lawyer doesn't need any surprises.\n\nI've no doubt you will be okay and have custody of your little one. I just wish someone had given me all of the advice I gave you. When everything went down it was terrifying. Stay calm. You have a better case. You got this. Don't give in when your ex taunts you. He will probably try harder once you get this ball rolling because he WANTS to make you look unstable, and he will try his hardest. Resist his crap. \n\nGood luck love. You got this.",

At times like these, you already know that all BS should be put to the side I haven't even read these comments but I am positive that almost all of us here have been confronted with a funeral where we had to say to ourselves,  \"we're not of the same faith (or lack there of) but ya know what? its a funeral so I'm not bothered by it.  Ill go to show respect.\".\n\nIts actually not even something we have to remind ourselves of. We just go.

I hated it and as soon as I was old enough to escape I did. We had a very rocky relationship because I didn't believe the same things she did and that was hard for her. Things got better as I got older (moving across the country helped too) and eventually we got to a decent point. \n\nBecause of my history with religion, I made it a point to only date atheists and agnostics. When my mom first got sick a few years ago, I had been dating my husband for only a few months. She died almost exactly a year later, three weeks to the day after our wedding. I knew that she would want to have her the service held at their place of worship, so I arranged it, even though I hadn't stepped foot into one of those places in over a decade. \n\nMy husband and I are both extremely anti religion. And he's even more abrasive and aggressive about those feelings than I am. But he didn't act like an asshole. He sat with me and gave me the support I needed to get through that extremely difficult time.\n\nI said all that to say that you deserved so much more than you got. I'm so sorry for your loss. I hope you can summon the strength to separate from someone who is behaving in such a toxic manner to you.\n\nPS I would have mangled his face for taking all the baby stuff on top of the blocking you in.

Can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6bfrr9/me_23f_with_my_friend_23f_she_cheated_on_her/).\n\nThe TL;DR of the OP is basically this: My friend Sarah cheated on her boyfriend James, who happens to be my friend, too. She didn't want to tell him because he'd likely end the relationship and they had a big trip planned. I didn't know if I should tell him (my gut told me yes, definitely) or stay out of it.\n\nAfter I posted here Sarah decided to tell James parts of the truth and told me to stay out of it. I decided not to do that since he deserved the whole truth. \n\nI wanted to tell him in person but he couldn't meet up because he was at a family gathering or something like it, I don't remember. He called and asked me what I wanted to meet up for and I told him the whole truth. That she cheated on him with her best friend, that she didn't tell him everything that happened, etc. I was worried she got to him somehow and that he wouldn't believe me, but he thankfully did. I still send him every text I had of her, which was probably incredibly helpful. \n\nWhile I was talking to him she sorta knew what was happening and drove over to his place immediately. When she got there he hung up and they talked. She tried to weasel her way out of it but since he had her texts that didn't work out too well. \n\nBefore she came over he told me this was the last straw, especially since she lied to him about it and made out with said friend once before. I don't know what she did or what she said, but he did a complete 180 and suddenly he was okay with it. \n\nI've only talked to him twice since then and he told me that it's not such a big deal and they'd get over it.\n\nThey've completely cut me out of their lives, when I asked him why he said he wanted to wait until his girlfriend and I had a talk and could get along again - which isn't happening, since I don't want to be friends with her anymore. \n\nIt sucks that I've lost my two best friends even though I wasn't even the one who fucked up, but at least I can sleep normally again. \n\nTL;DR: I told my friend, he wanted to break up with her, she talked him into staying and they've cut me out of their lives.

            "This happened to me once. I told my close friend that I had known since elementary school that his girlfriend was cheating on him with my other friends, cousin. \n\nI had all the proof (texts, screenshots, pictures, everything). I cried in front of him because I felt so bad doing this to him. I wanted him to get away. \n\nShe found out it was me, things got really bad (she tried to have me hit her with my car. She was crazy). \nHe ended up forgiving her (again, she cheated multiple times). He blocked me on everything. I was devastated.\n\n2 years later, I got a Facebook friend request from him. I accepted. He then messaged me on there and said, \"I'm sorry for how big of a douchebag I was when I was under the spell of a succubus.\" I was wary because I had heard this all before. He then told me all the changes he made and how he was moving hours away to get away from her. Starting over. \n\nHe has kept his word. He is happy and away from her and it's been years now. I have my friend back and it's the best feeling ever. He may live further away from me now but he's happy and that's all that matters. \n\nI honestly thought, at the time, we would never be friends again. This girl had him under her thumb and he believe everything she told him (like that a good guy friend just bought her a car because they were \"friends\". Yea, no. Her kitty bought that car bro).\n\nHe was in an abusive relationship. Your friend, is in an abusive relationship. Keep that in mind. There may be a day he comes back, maybe for help getting out, maybe to tell you he got away. Either way, while it hurts now, he is someone that is broken. Don't push him away if he tries comes back. \n\nThat succubus has a tight grip. They may wiggle free someday. ",

When she cheats again and doesn\u2019t change, he will have no illusions because he knows who he is dating: a cheater and a liar.

As you found out, there's a very big change that they make amends, and turn you into the bad guy.  You absolutely did the right thing morally, but just keep this in mind in the future.

Even if it didn't result in you ending the relationship, you would at least want to have that knowledge, right?\n\nThe result may have been less than ideal, but you couldn't have known that beforehand. And it doesn't change the fact that what you did was objectively the best option. You can only make the best decision based on the information you have, and that's what you did.

Also, do you maybe have a thing for the guy? Maybe ask yourself what good it does and why you needed to tell him every detail. \n\nI value trust and honesty completely. But sometimes it's enough to just say, your gf told me some really personal things and I think you should talk. It sounds like you expected him to be really upset and break up with her. You shouldn't really place any expectations on the information because it's not your relationship. And you can't really expect them to be all buddy, buddy. People like to get angry at others when they make mistakes. She's going to get angry at you for talking to him. ",

            "If they both know she cheated on him, and they're staying together, I can see the both of them being embarrassed about it in a way. Her because you know she did something wrong, and him because it makes him \"less manly\" or whatever to stick with a chick that cheated on him. Either way, I see that sort of embarrassment/shame being enough reason to stop talking to you. You didn't do anything wrong but sometimes people stop facing others when others know certain truths about them... It's not always easy to face up to that. \n\nNo real advice here. Life just sucks and it goes on :) Make new friends! ",
            "I know it is hard, but this is probably for the best. She is going to keep doing this because she knows she can now get away with it. Their relationship is just going to be come more and more toxic with time and you don't want to be in the middle of it. \n\nI would bet good money in a couple of years he is going to be calling back about how he left him for her best friend and how he should have broken things off.

I just couldn't sit there while she told me how in love with him she was and how great he was know that he was lying and cheating and she had no idea. She thanked me and later that night I got a text from the bf pissed that I told on him.   Then she and he cut both me off and dated for another year after that.\n\nNothing you can really do but know you did the right thing.

I'm not saying that's right, just that it's a pretty common attitude.\n\n\nAnd if that's what they've decided, they probably think you'll keep beating a dead horse and not respect their decision and mind your own business, so they've cut you out. \n\n\nThe fact that *six months later* you're still hung up on this kind of proves that you wouldn't be able to respect that they're adults and can make their own decisions about their relationship.",

She'll throw attention at him right now to cover her cheating, but she'll soon tire of that and go back to her true self.  That's when he'll start realizing how foolish it is to ever forgive cheaters as they will just do it again.\n\nYou did the right thing and in time you wil hear from him with a thank you and an story of how he caught her again.",

Sounds like this is a pattern of her being shitty and him glossing over it to keep the relationship together. It will end in heartbreak for him one day :/",
            "James is a doormat and Sarah is of very poor character. I'm sure this is a tough situation, but you did the right thing--and would you ever be able to see Sarah in the same light anyway? I think not. I'm sure James will come to regret his decision, and perhaps he'll reach out to you when that happens. And maybe you'll forgive him for so callously jettisoning you from his life. I wouldn't. ",

However, now that I am older, it may depend. But it just causes so much drama and people are in denial when they're being cheated on. \n\nIn the end, both of those relationships didn't last (I guess the girls finally caught their boyfriends in the act cheating). ",
            "Good for you.  Leave this in the past and meet new friends",
            "It\u2019s a shame you lost your friends but something else probably would have happened to make you grow apart. If James gets himself ok with this he\u2019s lying to himself, not mature, and really wants to keep her, and those things mean he wouldn\u2019t have been a good friend to you anyway.",
            "Youre lucky to have someone like her out of your life and he\u2019ll just roll over like that, it seems like hes a pretty weak and empty person and no major loss there.  It sucks now but your lufe in the long run is probably improved.\n\nIf he learns his lesson and gets back in contact with you, dont let him in close again.  He can be in your life, but there is no reason to have his back ever again.",
            "Unfortunately you may never hear from him again. He may realize and apologize later, but that's up to you if you want to continue that friendship. You did the right thing. I was watching a friends families house and she had told me her bf might stop by to sleep, because he was at a bar nearby. Well he did and tried to hop in bed with me. I woke up promptly told him to fuck off and went to sleep in her sisters room with the door locked. Waited the next day until he left and slipped out. Told her immediately and they are still together 4 years later. I guess that was worth it over a 10 year friendship. I have no doubt in my mind that he cheats on her whenever he gets the chance. Supposedly according to her sister, she had tried to get in touch with me a year later, but I change my numbers often and I don't have a fb. It fucking sucks, but have some goddamn self respect and protect your friend. Idk what would have happened if I didn't wake up right away and immediately left. ",
            "Their problem, not yours.... if they continue along validating unhealthy behavior, they won\u2019t last as a couple ",
            "This happened to me years ago.  She (the cheater) ended up leaving him for someone else.  ",
            "Your friend is an idiot. A moment will come when he realises this. I hope you\u2019re still ready to be friends with him when he does because at that point he will probably need your friendship.\n\nBe proud. You did the right thing. The high road isn\u2019t always easy. ",
            "Jesus Christ. This sounds awful. You did the right thing. This is not the type of couple/people you want to be friends with. He needs to learn some self respect and dignity. She needs to learn to be a better human being and have some morals. Trust me, you got the better end of the stick. They will most likely fall apart sometime down the road. Go find you some new friends. Some friends that aren't gonna cut you out for doing what's right. ",
            "this happened to me when i was in my early twenties. my (boy) friend ended up cutting me out of his life and stayed with his GF who was a cheater and punched him in the face lots. \n\ngood bye to our 20 year friendship.\n\nwe still dont talk. they both are fucked and not together anymore. (i think)\n\n*internet hug*",
            "You did the right thing and eventually you\u2019ll look back on this as a helpful lesson in life about who we decide is good for us and who we want in our lives. I\u2019ve cut out many people and happier for it. We don\u2019t have to hate them or be rude we just don\u2019t need them in our lives. ",
            "This happened to me at university. I lost one of my oldest friends from where I grew up, and my best friend who I lived with for the whole time I was at uni. I lost both of them- didnt get invited to their wedding even though they met because of me. I am facebook friends with them now 15 years later but it was never the same.\n\nStill - even knowing all of that I don't regret being honest ",
            "The moment you lie to someone, you take away that person's ability to see the world as it truly is.\nIt's easy to pretend such things are not on your table, and that you should stay out of it, but imagine if it was you.\n\nYou did the right thing.\n\nI've been in that situation, and I made the same call.",
            "You're a good friend OP. Always remember that. Don't just surround yourself with \"yes\" people which is apparently what your friend wants from her friends. Those are not real friends. ",
            "You definitely did the right thing. Here\u2019s the twist. HES CHEATING. Only a cheater would be okay with being cheated on.",
            "This is about what I'd expect. If you know then it's about 80% certain that the person being cheated on either already knows or should know but is in denial. The usual outcome is it's the person who tells who gets blamed and dumped. ",
            "This whole thing sounds so hall-monitory to me.  \n\nYou definitely deserved what you got in this case, although you weren't given very good advice in the first thread.\n\nThis girl may be having an internal sexuality conflict, and you basically just yanked her out of the closet before she was ready to come out.  And for what?  I question your motives.\n\nOn top of it you have (had) two friends involved here, not just one.   Why on earth would you turn them against each other?  This is simply not your business.  Do you run to your parents/the authorities any time you sense someone/something has been wronged?\n\nYou got what you deserved, maybe next time you should keep your nose out in sensitive matters that don't involve you.",
            "This is what happens when you get involved in other people's shit. It's not your business. ",
            "It's possible to be morally opposed to something and not get involved if it has fuck all to do with you. \n\nI don't really have an opinion on whether or not OP should have shared the information, but it was told to her in confidence and her friend deserved better than to have information that only belonged to her shared with a third party.\n\nObviously what she did was wrong and as a friend OP had the obligation to steer her in the direction of telling the truth, but if all my friends turned around and blabbed information I shared with them in confidence because they didn't agree with it, I'd find new friends. That's what strong relationships are for - bouncing things off each other, accepting faults and being supportive. \n\nAgain I don't care one way or another about what OP did, but knowing how she acts, I wouldn't dare share information I was struggling with knowing she turns around and takes ownership of that info, feeling like she can share it at will.

Since last week she has had a pretty nasty bout with the flu, and yesterday it finally caused her to regurgitate and defecate on herself and her bed.\n\nI heard it occur, and heard her sobs afterwards, so I went in and carried her to her bath. I ran a warm bath and cleaned her up(I had seen her entire body at this point anyways), and left her wrapped in a blanket on the couch. I took her bedding to the laundromat and got all of that cleaned, and scrubbed her comforter and left it outside to dry. I thought nothing of it at all, you help those you care about when they need it.\n\nI work nights, so I left her that evening.  When I woke up today, I came over and found her locked in her room, upset that I saw her like that and did what I did. She says I saw her in a way she never wanted me to see, and she can't handle that.\n\nDid I overstep a boundary? I am sitting on the couch right now and can't really get her to talk to me, she just says she can't face me. I've always been of the mind that when people are sick you help them, and cleaning someone who had an accident isn't really a big thing to me. Was I supposed to just leave her in her fluids?\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Girlfriend was sick, had hygiene issues, I cleaned, she is upset I saw her that way.\n\n\n**Edit:** About an hour ago she texted me to come to the door. We started talking through the door. She finally said that she was just afraid that I wouldn't see her as attractive(What a number of you guys said) and she was really embarrassed. I told her that is is just a natural part of being alive, and that I thought no less of her and she is still my Lynx(my nickname for her). I told her she needs to see the doctor, which she has agreed tomorrow, so after work I will take her. She opened the door hugged me, thanked me, said she loved me, then shut it and said she was going to bed. I am going to head back to my place and take a nap before I head to work.\n\nThanks everyone who responded, been a help.",

She was laying in bed feeling sorry for herself when he crawled in to cuddle her. They were both naked, he was spooning her from behind, and unfortunately she ended up sneezing and *shitting all over his dick*.  \n\nYou know how he reacted? Exactly how you did :)\n\nShe was of course horrified and embarrassed, but when she later looks back on the story she says \"that's when I knew I was going to marry him.\" He handled it like a mature adult who put her health and needs above his own. \n\nHonestly, just give her some space.

The embarrassment was palpable.  She looked right at me and ask how on earth could I have cleaned all that up. \n\nI looked right back and said, \"grandma, it's just poop.\" Then I went on about my business and pretended it didn't happen.\n\nI think that's the only thing you can really do.

I even look at this memory with some fondness because of how selfless she was for helping me in such an abject state. Sure, I was embarassed by it (and still am), but it was such a kind and loving gesture.

I went home with my skin feeling on fire at 12 AM. A few days later, I thought it was the flu since I only had it once before and it felt like I had it. \n\nTwo weeks later, it got so bad that I was crying, vomiting, and defecating simultaneously for at least an hour (never had this issue before with the flu.) Went to the doctor, it was a kidney infection. Again, not saying that is the case with her, but good on you guys for agreeing to go before it gets even worse",

The next day when my dad was at work she made me clean it up and then hose it off outside. My elder brother mocked me endlessly about it for many, many years and that makes me sad to think about. I was beyond mortified when it happened and it stuck with me for many years and made me ultra uncomfortable for sick/hygiene related issues.\n\nWhat you did was kind and loving. I'm so glad you were able to help her when she was so sick :)",

            "So this might not be quite the same but I had a similar experience with my mom. Now my mom, as my mom has cleaned up my shit and vomit from when I was a child. She also did the same when I got my wisdom teeth out and before when I was a teenager and got period blood on my sheets. But the one time she had an awful bout of the flu and had uncontrollable diarrhea she felt super embarrassed. Its an intensely vulnerable experience to be loved and cared for that way. Some people are not used to ever needing that and it's hard to accept help. Maybe a letter or text could remove some of the awkwardness. Bodily functions are nothing to be ashamed of and remind her she would probably do the same for you. ",
            "My bf saw me very drunk one night. I threw up in the shower,  in the sink and in the toilet.  I then proceeded to poop like crazy in the toilet (probably making push sounds). He was by my side the entire time.  He made sure that I sleep on my side and even though he got very angry in the morning when I sobered up, I am so grateful that he took care of me. It was a very embarrassing  moment, but we are all humans. ",

I was working at a gas station awhile ago, the height of hygiene quality (/sarcasm) when I got gastrointeritis which was explained to me as \"food poisoning on steroids\". It was so bad that I needed to go to the hospital. While in the hospital I was put in a room that shared a bathroom with another room. Some jackass locked both doors and didn't unlock my side. Which meant I could not get to the bathroom quickly enough. I ended up vomiting and defecating on the floor. So not unlike your girlfriend.\n\nMy girlfriend at the time (I am female) helped get me cleaned up and taken care of, yelled at the nurses, and just made sure I was alright. I ended up marrying this woman. She's seen me at my absolute worst both physically and emotionally and she's never ever shied away from it. I know she'll always be there for me. (We've been together 11 years in total so far)\n\nYou are a fantastic, wonderful, caring boyfriend. While she might be embarrassed at times to think about it, she'll remember this in a positive light, I promise.",

Remember she is probably really emotionally drained from being so sick, I can never really keep it together after a bout with the flu.\n\nJust a suggestion but your note could read:\n\nI love you and I'm sorry you are so sick. I'll be out here waiting for you. \nAlso- there is going to come a day when I shit myself and you're going to be there for me. I hope for both our sakes it's not taco-related.\n\n\n",

            "No, you should not feel bad. This is actually exactly what you should have done. If your parents haven't said anything or taken any anger out on you, it is very likely that they already assume a neighbor called the cops which yes, is very common especially if an argument or noises can be heard from the neighbors house.\n\nHowever, your safety is your priority so if you ever feel calling the cops will put you in danger, you should first secure yourself in a safe place (for example somewhat ironically, running to the neighbor's house and making the call there).\n\nAlso, At seventeen based on where you live and the laws there, you may be able to emancipate yourself and leave home before you turn eighteen. This may be worth pursuing if you feel you are under threat of violence.",
            "Never, ever feel bad about calling for help. Ever. \n\nThis is exactly what you should do. She wasn\u2019t safe and neither were you. Thank you for being so brave.",
            "\\>>as I think my dad will beat the crap out of me if he finds out,\n\nHas your dad beat you before?   You should consider going to police station and explaining your past experiences and your fears.  If you aren't ready to file charges, you can tell them taht you just want to get advice.  One thing they can do is to put your home phone # and your cell # on the list of calls to respond urgently to if you ever need to call 911.  And they may have some good advice about keeping yourself safe.  \n\nIf you are really likely to get hit prepare an exit strategy.  Can you get out your window?  Is there a way to get out if dad blocks the door?   Can you tell when things are escalating?  If so, leave early on in the escalation, don't wait for him to start hitting.  Call the national domestic violence hotline and you will get a ton of good advice for this situation.  1-800-799-7233",

            "First off, I cannot recommend enough that if you have these questions you read Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft. It is considered *the* book to read if you have questions about abuse and need help. It's available for free online (just Google for the PDF) and I've never found a library without multiple copies.\n\nThat said-\n\n1) No, there is absolutely no reason to feel guilty about this. You did not do anything to cause anyone harm, you acted in the interest of preventing harm.\n\n2) Neighbors do call cops about this stuff all the time, or even random passerby. However if you're worried your dad will attack you if he thinks you're responsible, *take precautions*. First send yourself an email saying what you did and that you think your dad might retaliate if he finds out, if he does retaliate that will streamline the process of getting help or going to the police afterward a *lot*. Second, tell a friend what's up and make arrangements with their family to be able to stay the night (or two) on short notice (most half-decent parents will do so). Leave a couple change of clothes, a toothbrush, some toiletries, etc. \n\nIn other words, make sure that if your dad does attack you you have a way to both get out of the situation and then back up your side of the story later.\n\n3) No. Lundy Bancroft, the author of book mentioned above, is one of the foremost experts in the world in treating abusers so that they stop being abusers. With his decades of experience, he gives at most a 10% 'fix' rate for abusers who spend *years* in a specialized abuser program. His advice, and the advice of every psychologist I've ever met who deals with abuse, is to not expect abusers to change. Improvements are almost always conditional or temporary, changes in behavior are just replaced by other types of abusive behavior, and it is just in general healthiest to assume that abusers will never change and that you need to live your life without the expectation that they will get better. \n\nLastly, I would recommend calling a women's domestic violence shelter for advice. (You can find the numbers of local ones on google). You don't have to take any drastic legal actions or flee there or anything, nothing so serious as that. But those shelters have people who understand these situations very well and can give you good advice.  If you're looking for advice about your situation, the people you will talk to there are far better equipped to help you than Reddit is. \n\nGood luck. I wish you the best.",

            "1. No, it's good to have a police record of this for the next time, and there will be a next time. 2. Yes. I once called the police because I heard a loud bang and then my female neighbor screaming and crying while her husband yelled. 3. No. He's an abuser. They don't magically see the error of their ways, and they REALLY flip out when their secret (that they're abusive) gets out (I had an ex who was like this, the most psychotic he ever got was when he found out I'd told a close friend what was going on ... he forbid me to see her). He'll likely come home more angry and take it out on one or both of you. That is not your fault. That is HIS fault. He brought this on himself, no matter what bullshit he spews.\n\nThis is a shitty environment for you. I realize your mom is a victim but as the adult she should get you the hell out of there. That is unlikely. And you can't make her leave. Keep your head down, get through high school, and then get the hell out of there and don't look back. Or better yet tell a trusted adult (school counselor, family member you know you can trust) about what's going on. This is not a safe place for you to be right now. \n\nIf you can safely call the police on him the next time he does this again, do it. If it puts your safety at risk, do what you need to do to protect yourself. Your father is dangerous. He left marks on your mother's face. He is capable of worse.\n\nYou were really brave to call for help. Your mom was NOT safe. She won't be safe as long as she stays with him.",

Someone with a temper like that can \u201ccalm down\u201d for a second and be right back with their anger within minutes. Neighbors commonly call the police in situations like this especially if they hear it happening often. Unfortunately these like this aren\u2019t typically red flags to get them to stop their behavior. It may be better for a week or so but people always go back to their ways. If anything is going to help your dad it\u2019s mental health help. \n\nYou and your mom deserve better and should try to get into a woman\u2019s shelter ASAP. I know how hard it is to get your mom to leave but I would start the conversation with her soon.

            "OP, a single \u201chit\u201d is grounds to call the cops. That\u2019s unacceptable and wrong. Is there a school guidance counselor you can see? I\u2019m concerned for you. Not just your safety but I think you could benefit from an outside person who can help you see that none of this is normal or okay. It\u2019s so easy for abuse to be normalized if you\u2019re raised in a home where that occurs and you sound like a really good person who could use some help processing all that. Never feel guilty for standing up for your mom and what\u2019s right. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unlikely that your dad will change and I would be making plans to leave if your mom won\u2019t leave too.",
            "Growing up around your dad and how he acts has made it seem normal to you. It's not. Whether your mom ever presses charges, what he does is against the law. It's against the law for him to beat you too. Not only is it against the law, it is just wrong. He is hurting you guys and teaching you that you deserve to be treated violently. Your mom is teaching you that too by covering it up. I know she probably feels in her head it is the best way to protect you, but unless she is working on getting you safe she is not doing her best to protect you. \n\nLots of parents spank their kids. Studies have shown it doesn't help kids learn because it just scares them out of doing something when they could get caught  But either way regular spanking without excessive force  is not meant to be abusive in general, even though it can be. Luckily it's becoming more a thing of the past. \n\nBeating someone is never ok. No one deserves that. Being beat can make someone feel they must have done something to deserve it, or be someone who deserves to be beat. That's just not true. The only reason people feel that way is because getting beaten up and mentally abused confuses our brains into believing that. Therapists can help with that. No one deserves more or less than other people, but sometimes we need to be taught that as adults because we were not taught that as kids. Your mom is definitely confused in that way, because she not only lets him abuse her but she lets him abuse you too it sounds like. That is nothing to do with you, it's to do with her confused abused brain. Most likely something happened to her growing up that taught her that this was normal which is why she ended up with your dad. \n\nA 17 year old girl should not have to fear her dad beating her up. You probably feel really old sometimes with this going on in your life, but you are a kid who should be loved and cared for and protected. I felt old at your age, but now I have a nephew and a little sister in law your age, and I would protect them with my life. They are so smart and competent, but to me, an adult who loves them, they are kids to be loved and protected. You deserve that too. \n\nIt's really admirable that you are concerned about your mom, and it's a good thing, because it means you are not like your dad. You have empathy and you care. But your mom is not your responsibility. You are hers. So you need to do the job she is not able to do, and take care of you. There's a lot of good advice here about who to reach out to for help. There are good people who will want to help. Your mom may not accept help, but things can be different for you. You do not have to live wondering if you were overreacting because your mom didn't get beat up that bad. A good man doesn't hit his wife. You felt it was wrong because it is. Listen to your gut, not what your dad has taught you. \n\nI know the world isn't black and white. You probably love your dad. He is probably ok sometimes. That doesn't change anything I've said. Whatever is wrong with him, he does not act like a good man, and he does not protect you, and someone needs to do that. Someday your mom may be ready to leave and you can be there for her, but right now she's like a person with an addiction, and you can't help someone like that until they want to be helped. So learn from this, and take good care of yourself, because you deserve it just like every other kid. I'm sorry you are going through this and have had to see such darkness so early in your life. I hope you can catch some breaks now and things will get better for you. Take care.",
            "You did the right thing. The neighbors do sometimes call police (screaming isn't normal). Keep calling next time and eventually your dad will (have to) stop. If your mom sinks too deep plan your leaving in the near future and find a therapist (even tho everything looks fine you got raised in abusive household, without proper therapy it will make you the target of social predators)\n\nThank you for being so brave!",
            "I can only imagine how difficult it was for you to make that call. Your parents who are supposed to love you and keep you safe, are contributing to an unsafe environment. Thank you for trying to protect your mom and for not making excuses for your dad. Sounds like everyone is in need of professional help for all of the trauma, but it's a long hard road. From personal experience, I'm not sure I'd expect the phone call to the police to be \"the wakeup\" call your dad needs. It may get better for a while but in most cases, this is a repeatable pattern with potential to escalate. Please seek safe housing for yourself, and your mom if she'll go, until he gets help. Best to you.",

He'll just be more careful to make sure he hits you and your mother where the police can't see.  \n\nOP, you should google domestic violence shelters and start talking to your mother about getting out of an unsafe environment.  Your father is a domestic abuser and not only is it incredibly unlikely he'll change, even if he says he will and things get a bit better for a little while the rate of recidivism for domestic abusers are very high.  You and your mother will be safer if you leave while your father is not home.",
            "You did the right thing OP <3 hope you (and your mom) can get to a better situation soon.",
            "I know you're still too young to be handling such matters but i believe that you could be your mother's heroine. Domestic violence is something no one deserves and no one should be okay with. \nYour mom is a victim and needs your help. She needs to feel security and love and most importantly be far from her abuser. This will be really hard but you can help her get over this. Google domestic violence and how to support and handle situations. You did the right thing by calling the cops. \n\nYour dad probably suffers from a trauma or some kind of psychological illness. He surely needs professional help. But your mom should first be empowered and feel safe.",
            "You did the right sweetie",
            "That's how most domestic abuse cases happen. The abuser gets violent and the receiver calls the cops screaming and crying and when the cops get there they are all loving again telling the cops it was nothing. This happens all the time so calling the police isnt bad it's actually good becuase the police know something is up",
            "You absolutely did the right thing! Domestic violence is NOT EVER OKAY. It is very likely they would believe a neighbor called in a disturbance, so I wouldn\u2019t be worried about that. Please stay safe, I can\u2019t promise that will be a wake up call for your dad because someone who abuses their family won\u2019t stop just because the cops got involved once. If you and your mom need to get out, there are so many resources available and I encourage you to look up ones in your area.",
            "Do everything you can to get out of there at 18. Your mom can't be saved if she doesn't want to. Take care of you first. Like someone else had said, DV creates strange loyalties. What a great example she is setting for you on what's acceptable treatment from a partner.\nRemember to question your attraction to people . Your parents set the standard of \"acceptable behavior\", so it's very likely that you'll seek out abusers in the future as well. It took me way too long to realize that!!",
            "You did nothing wrong. Just be smart and remove any record from your phone (will your phone bill reflect this call?).\n\nYou mother is not safe there and neither are you. Can you move out and live elsewhere?\n\nI'm sorry your are not your parents' priority that's why you must consider yourself your top priority and do what's best for you.",
            "Along with what others have said of making sure you are safe (for example deleting records on your phone of this), honestly, nice job.\n\nIt takes guts to stand up to an abuser. And yeah, you might feel bad about it, but that's because the situation in your family is so distorted from what it should be that you can see it as \"not necessarily worth calling because it was unlikely she'd be beaten more and she was probably safe.\"\n\nI hope the best for you and your family I guess, but once things come to blows it is NEVER fine. Just... never. Abuse is abuse (physical or otherwise as well) and even if they may not know to be grateful for it, or may not know at all (maybe a good idea to not let them know), you've given if nothing else an opportunity for your mom to have a night's peace, and your dad to calm down and possibly reevaluate how he's been handling himself.\n\nTo answer #2 (IMO)- I'd say whether they ask or not, it's probably best to say a neighbor called. They can suspect all they want, but it's a suspicion and hopefully nothing else.\n\nTo #3 would be there's no promises in life, but you've given him a chance to do so. There's that.\n\nAs someone who had similar problems with their family growing up (they split when I was 11 and they're both far better individuals for it though it took time) it's just never okay, and it's never going to turn out okay being left alone like that. It has to change one way or another (hopefully by your dad coming to his senses) because otherwise it's miserable for everyone involved.",
            "1) NO, no guilt required. \n\n2) Absolutely neighbours call for help. \n\n3) Sorry, not likely. In most cases abuse escalates. The most dangerous time is during initial separation. \n\nYou did a brave thing and you are in a shitty place. You shouldn't have to carry this - parents are meant to protect and guide their kids, I'm really proud of you right now, dealing with that level of abuse is frightening. I hope you find a way to GTFO as soon as you can.",
            "Keep us updated and stay safe.",
            "This is abuse :( you did the right thing. I wouldn\u2019t tell your parents it was you. I would seek help from a therapist to talk about your experiences. \nSending you love!",
            "Wow, you are an incredibly brave, self-possessed young person.  I'm impressed with your backbone, and your quick thinking, and I'm sorry you're in this horrible situation.\n\nAlthough calling the police and reporting the problem is always the right thing to do, it seldom stops an abuser.  But what it hopefully does is highlight for your mother that what she is going through is something the rest of the world would take seriously.\n\nI hope you can get in touch with someone from a domestic violence hotline who can give you more immediate and specific support.  They may be able to coach you on how to keep yourself safe in the situation, while hopefully getting your mom safe too.",
            "So this was most my childhood, doesn't make for feeling good and if your nearly 18 i'm guessing they've been in the relationship for at least 20 years, i'm not sure if this is a regular occurrence? If it's new has there been something that happened? More likely is your dad a drinker? If you dad has done this for 20 years, and your only asking these questions and calling cops for the first time now that this can't be something that happens regularly. \n\nIf this is a once off, welll choke it up as that. Yes neighbours generally call if they hear domestic abuse in the higher socioeconomic suburbs. \n\nIf this happens regularly if you cam talk with your mum see if she wants to leave, almost never do they want to leave and often calling the cops will make it worse and generally the wife will need to press charges and want to go to court and follow up the charges on the day which unless she's leaving she wont.\n\nIt really only stopped when I got big enough to take down the old man.",
            "1. Absolutely not. You did a brave thing. Hitting a family member (or others) is not acceptable, unless it\u2019s self defense. \n\nHopefully this is a wake up call for the both of them.\n\nETA: if he hits you for calling, call them again! My dad hit me all the time when I was younger, to the point of leaving bruises, bc he\u2019s a fucking toddler emotionally. I wish I had the foresight/balls to do anything about it but the 80s were different :/",
            "You did the right thing. But as others have said delete the phone call from your records.\n\nAs far as I know, the police cannot tell your parents who called them + it is likely that neighbors call for these types of things, so that could be the rational explanation your parents believe.\n\nDon\u2019t tell them anything and play stupid. I really hope this won\u2019t happen again to you or your mom, at least out of shame from your father because the \u201cneighbors\u201d know what is happening in your household :/ \n\nStay safe",
            "Never feel guilty for doing whats right. Protect yourself hun, dont tell anyone. Neighbors call all the time for domestic dispute things. Hide any and all evidence that youve called, and keep yourself safe. Sometimes unfortunately it isnt always the case for a wake up call to domestic abusers. Some stay that way forever. It might be a mental illness, or something different. Get out of that house as soon as you can though, for your own safety. There are plenty of support subs for abusive parents. Try r/raisedbynarcissists which is a really good support group.",
            "You did the right thing in the moment but if your dad is an abuser (and he is) things will eventually get worse.\n\nYou need to help your mom leave him. And possibly testify against him in court. Staying with an abuser sometimes leads to dead family members, and always leads to traumatized family members in need of years of therapy and usually medication.\n\nGet out now.",
            "Hey! I\u2019m a clinical therapist and I work for an agency that specializes in physical abuse, sexual abuse, and domestic violence. Here\u2019s my advice/answers.\n\n1. No, you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. If you ever feel you or someone else\u2019s life is in danger, no matter the conclusion of the events, you have every right to call the police.\n\n2. Yes, that\u2019s likely, but it depends. Erase the call form your phone. Just a heads up, most phone companies maintain records of calls made for x amount of time, so it\u2019s still possible he could find out.\n\n3. Maybe. We often see a cycle in domestic violence, which includes the acute explosion (the violent event), honeymoon period, tension building, and then back to the acute explosion. If you\u2019ve noticed this pattern, then my advice would be to seek out professional help.\n\nResources:\n\n1. 911 if there\u2019s ever an emergency. If you feel like you should call but your unsure, just call.\n\n2. National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233. They have a ton of great resources to offer.\n\n3. Local ACT shelters. Easily to google. They provide case management and therapy services to victims of domestic violence.",

I'm so overwhelmingly worried every time I know he's drunk and she's there by herself with him.\n\nI'm proud of her though, there was a moment when she did actually call the cops and they came and let my father understand that one more time behaves like an asshole, they're nearby and they know what to do with him and where to take him.\n\nHe learned the lesson I suppose, so did my mom.\n\nIt's never wrong to ask for help! \n\nBest of luck, my dear.

            "NTA. OP, another option is if you have another adult you feel safe with besides your parents, one who would take you in, you could ask that adult to go to court and file an emergency guardianship of a minor hearing (at least that\u2019s what it\u2019s called in my state) in family court (or whichever court is most appropriate at your state. The courthouse would know). With the father\u2019s actions and your mother lying to the police about it, plus your fear of your father hitting you (has he done that in the past?), that may warrant an ex parte hearing and immediate order to place custody with the petitioner as temporary guardian (ex parte means with having the other parties of the matter there). \n\nPlease stay safe OP.

You were trying to protect your mother and yourself, as you should, especially since it appears that no one else will.

You did the right thing, and even if its hard, its not okay how your dad is treating your mom and if you are afraid of getting beaten up by him then by no fucking means in hell he treated you the right way! Please stay strong even if this is hard and try to involve the cops, neighbours etc. Maybe get help from someone at your school or something. \n\nYou definetly have to take action, when not for your mom then for yourself. Your mom is in love not rational and trying to hold something together which shouldnt. Your dad is abusive. People who are abusive know exactly how they can treat someone maybe frighten someone to stay with him and on the long run it feels good that everyone calmed down and play happy family again but its not. On the long run its not. And your dad was not about to beat up your mom he hit her if she had bruises etc then he already was violent. Help your mom! and first and foremost help yourself!

            "OP; I was in a similar situation a few years ago. My dad was abusive, and my mom almost never took action against him. It wasn\u2019t until *I* called the police on him one day that my mother got a wake up call and started taking protective measures against him.\n\nYou did the right thing. Now, you need to make sure you are safe and supported. Talk to your mom; try to get her to understand why you called, and how your dad\u2019s abuse is not only affecting her. You\u2019ll probably need evidence of some form, like \u201che has done x, y, and z to us and it\u2019s wrong and unsafe, we can do A, B, and C to stop him from doing this again and here are resources where we can start.\u201d Consider googling quick info on divorce laws, protective restraints, domestic violence shelters, welfare, etc., because those are things that can and will help you through this. Sometimes people in abusive situations need to know they have a \u201cteam\u201d to help them out of it... I was that support for my mom, and you may need to provide some of that for yours. It\u2019s not fair and you grow up quick, but you and your mom will be better off for it if that\u2019s the case. \n\nI would love to hope this is a wake up call for your dad... but it\u2019s probably not. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Men like this always blame \u201cthe system screwing them over\u201d before their own action. \n\nAbove all else, keep yourself safe. If your mom can\u2019t be convinced, go to another trusted adult at school or a friend\u2019s parent or a family member. Have a safety net of a different place to crash and a way to get full meals.\n\nAnd talk about it. Tell your friends. DM me if you\u2019d like. This is a lot to handle at 17 and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s fallen to your shoulders. It does get better and I hope you find your way out.",

He is extremely good looking and always has multiple women flirting/hitting on him and this has always been a big insecurity of mine so maybe that's why I am so paranoid.\n\nRecently about 7 months ago a new couple 'Dylan and Flora' moved into our area. They are both 23 and out of college. Flora and my husband met while playing tennis as they both go to the same club and they get along great. I always thought she had a crush on him but as she is(was?) respectful, so I left it at that. Soon my husband invited her to the Gym he goes.\n\nNow, a week ago I get a call from Dylan saying that one of the guys in the Gym had seen my husband and Flora kissing just outside our apartment building. He also gave me three instances when Flora was out and asked whether I could account for my husband. I said I\u2019d call him back so I could check my calendar. I\u2019d been with him all three times. When I called back he said she had condoms in the glove-box of her car and she\u2019d been checking out hotel sites. She\u2019s also very secretive about her phone now. \n\nI went through his phone and social media as we are very open about these things and there was no sign of an affair although they had been texting quite a bit(about tennis etc.) and she has always been very complimentary but my husband has not responded/flirted back. It sounds like Flora is up to something but I pray to God it\u2019s not with my husband. So why phone me? We have very loving relationship and he doesn't strike me as the type of guy who would cheat.\n\nEven worse, the guy called me again last night asking that I go on some sort of stake-out with him. She says she\u2019s away with work next week and he\u2019s sure it\u2019s not true. He\u2019s hoping to catch her at it. \n\nShould I go too and keep everything crossed it\u2019s not my husband? Should I just confront my husband or just lay low and hope for the best.

Tell your husband that someone told Dylan that they saw your husband kissing Flora, that Flora has condoms and has been checking hotels out, and that you have confirmed with your calendar that you know there is no way he is doing this but that you are telling him because you are being bothered by the calls and accusations when you are confident he would never do that.\n\nI say to phrase it this way because it sounds like you know your husband isn't cheating, there is no reason to approach it like he needs to defend himself, because he doesn't as he has done nothing wrong. \n\nDo not go on a stake out, talk to your husband. I think it would be best if he limited contact with Flora for the moment so her husband can move on to the next suspect.

Could it be that he's threatened that she's developing friendships outside of their relationship? Does she have any friends outside of you, and your husband? \n\nBe transparent about all of this with  your husband, don't tell him that you feel this is confirmation of infidelity, but rather, drama that's landed on both of your doorsteps, that is unless you really believe that these stories are valid, but given your experience of being with your husband on the days that this guy is saying he was cheating, it seems pretty doubtful your husband has strayed.

He warned you, you did your due diligence checking your calendar and your husband's phone (sketchy, but I'll take your word for it that he wouldn't have minded).  You found no evidence.  The prudent thing to do is rely on your trust for your husband and drop it.  Staking him out (insanity), checking up on him, or continuing to let Dylan involve you in his paranoia is risking your marriage, and your husband's trust in you.  He would have to be a master deceiver for you to not have noticed anything yet, and for an examination of his private conversations to have turned up nothing.\n\nIn all likelihood, Dylan has been uncomfortable with his wife's friendship with your husband for a while now, and so it was the first place he went when he convinced himself she was cheating.  It doesn't really matter though, because this isn't your problem, it's his.  Tell Dylan to stop calling you and walk away from this mess, before you get caught up in the blast radius.",

I think you need to explain all this to your husband just as you have here and he will make everything right. ",
            "Since the things Dylan is saying things don't add up (at least, that Flora is cheating with your husband), and you have no other reason to think your husband is cheating, t's time to tell your husband about this. Look, I know you're insecure, and you should get some help with that (like, therapy), but at the end of the day it's up to your husband to be faithful to you. Maybe Flora is planning on cheating with your husband and letting him know now will let him put up some boundaries with her, maybe she is planning on cheating with someone else and all of this is none of your or your husband's business (other than him maybe not wanting to spend time or befriend a person who cheats), maybe Dylan is insecure to the point of lunacy and nothing is going on there at all. I'm not saying you should give your husband blind trust, but the key to being secure is giving your partner the trust they deserve and accepting that if you partner decides to betray that trust, it's on them and not something that you can control. If your relationship with your husband is otherwise healthy and there are no other signs of cheating, and if he loves and respects you, then there's no need to worry about anything other than not letting your insecurity get in the way of loving him.",
            "I would not go with Dylan, who you don't know well, to do a stakeout of your husband. First, you don't know this guy and frankly it could be him trying to trap you somewhere. Or that he's irrationally jealous and those types can turn dangerous really fast. And I say that, because the dates he gives you don't add up. You know where your husband was in those times. You have access to his phone and you see he's not flirting and you see there doesn't seem to be anything there.\n\nYou need to stop talking to Flora's husband and go talk to your husband about this. Frankly, given the lack of evidence and some pretty strong evidence that Dylan is either lying or mistaken that his wife is cheating on him with your husband coupled with his trying to get you alone, I would treat Dylan as the greater red flag. Whether he's legit concerned about his wife or not, you do not know what he may or may not do and things like following and confronting people when one is not a licensed PI can turn ugly really, really fast.\n\nStop talking to Dylan, tell your husband what's been going on, ask him if there is anything going on but reassure him you don't see it. And that he should probably scale way back on his contact with the wife, because Dylan thinks they are having an affair. And you are worried about what Dylan might do if this gets out of hand.\n\nAnd whatever you do, do not agree to meet alone with Dylan or let him into your place or really have any further contact. Unless you're leaving something out, right now I think Dylan is the larger problem.",

            "So if Dylan thinks that Flora is cheating with your husband, telling you about it is:\n\n\n\n1) About showing you respect and consideration, and not leaving you in the dark about a cheating spouse.\n\n\n2) Getting another set of eyes on Dylan and Flora so that the truth can come out.\n\n\n\nIf someone told him his wife and your husband were kissing, he thinks they are cheating with each other.  If it were me I would tell Dylan that I wasn't comfortable going to a stake out with him. I would tell him the times he was concerned about do not match up - you were with your husband, and tell him that your husband is open with all social media, and that while Flora texts him there is nothing there that makes you think they are cheating.  I would ask him WHO saw your husband and Flora kissing as that might give you a better clue as to what is going on.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't go on the stake out.  I would ask Dylan to leave you out of it unless he was sure it was your husband, as you don't think it is with the addition that you would let him know if something changed.  Dylan is probably in the worst pain of his life right now, and the person that he trusted the most is being dishonest with him. \n\n\n\nTelling your husband?  I actually wouldn't yet.  You aren't staking him out. You don't think it was him. He *does* have a friendship with Flora though, and if he tells her, then he gives her the power to keep hiding things from Dylan.  This is a real possibility as you think Flora is up to something.   After you find out *who* the person that saw them kissing is, then bring it up with your husband.  If there is a *who* at the gym that is causing trouble in your marriage then your husband is going to have to make some changes with his gym/friendships.  If your husband's friendship with Flora is causing you trouble in your marriage (it is now) he is going to need to make some changes there too.  If there is truth to the kiss/cheating claim, I'm so sorry.  If there isn't, you two still have a lot of work to do because someone out there is willing to lie to mess with your relationship and you need to figure out who that person is and block them out.\n\n\n\nIf it isn't your husband, well, it isn't uncommon for a cheater to throw an innocent person under the buss to help hide and protect their affair partner.  Flora may have very well lead Dylan to believe she was with your husband when she wasn't.  I've been cheated on, and this was the tactic used to hide it from me.\n\n\n\nTrust but verify, then talk to your husband about what changes need to happen to get these people out of your marriage, if nothing is going on.",

I would question our relationship because you took the word of a stranger in a matter of moments instead of just asking me. There is no confronting until you have real evidence, that\u2019s letting your fear guide your thought process not your logic, your trust for your partner should be paramount. Which begs the question do you? \n\nYou seem very nice and sweet but fuck this guy hitting you up. It\u2019s super shady, if he\u2019s so convinced his girl is cheating then that\u2019s his business and he should break up with her not dragging you into his drama.

            "To be fair, I would be at least a little suspicious about the claim that someone saw them kissing, but the fact that he asked you to account for specific times and you could is a point in your husband's favour. That said, saying \"we're in a loving relationship and he doesn't strike me as a cheater\" is a bit of a moment of putting your head in the sand. I'm not saying everyone cheats, but anyone can cheat, and a lot of people are very good at hiding cheating, and cheating can happen in an otherwise happy relationship sometimes. So him striking you as loving and not a cheater doesn't mean much. It does mean a little, though. I do think your husband cheating is the least likely scenario here, under Flora cheating with someone else, Flora not cheating and this guy being a suspicious bad boyfriend, and even under this guy trying to ruin your relationship specifically for some reason (Flora having a crush on your man, wanting to ruin your man's life for it, ect).\n\nPersonally, I'd confront your husband, but not from the angle you're thinking-- tell him how Dylan accused him of having an affair with Flora and how he's tried to convince you to take part in a cheating stake out. Tell him you want the pair of you to distance yourselves from these weirdos because you aren't comfortable with them right now. Tell him Flora is flirting and knowing that she might be cheating on Dylan makes you a bit uncomfortable with her, and the drama the both of them or just Dylan is stirring up is something you want to stay out of their lives because they're trying to drag you two into their relationship problems and that's not a worthwhile friend.

If he finds out, the trust on his side will be severely damaged, as it should be. \n\nDylan may have read the texts between your husband and Flora, concluded they are cheating, and invented that story to bait you into helping.

As far as seeing nothing in his phone, it is possible he just deletes his end of the conversation out of the text chain.

It sounds like your husband isn\u2019t having an affair with her. The invitation to go on a stake out is suspicious, although he could just be seeking someone to go through a potentially unfaithful spouse with. I\u2019d trust your husband and tell him what\u2019s up.",

Worst case, it is your husband she is cheating with, and you avoid the drama of catching them in the act, dylan get to bear that.\n\nmiddle case is you dodged the bullet of being the akward random person there when the stakeout busts her with some random person not your husband\n\nBest case is there is no cheating, Dylan is nuts, and you just did the right thing by ignoring the drama.",

Too much drama. Tell your husband what\u2019s being shared in a way that keeps you on the same team - 2 sane attractive people that people want to spend time with some of which are cool and some not so much. \n",
            "If you\u2019re seriously concerned about your husband than you should ask him! It looks like all of the information you have is pointing to him standing by you, asking him and maybe telling him to be wary of this chick who may have different intentions than he does seems like the right move in my opinion.

There's no need to be accusatory, secretive, or go out on \"stake-outs\". Just tell him that Dylan called and had some concerns about Flora. \n\nMaybe he has some more insight than you do. It's also perfectly possible that Dylan is trying to strike up drama or is just jealous of Flora. In which case, it would probably be better if Flora knew anyway. ",
            "If you have no signs via various communication you snooped on (I mean that neutrally), I don't think there's much for you to worry about. Or at least, there's no reason for you to involve yourself in a stakeout or go out of your way to check in on your husband. \n\nFrom the sound of it, it seems like Flora *may* be cheating, and Dylan, not knowing who it is with, has picked your husband as the most likely culprit. It makes sense from his perspective given that your husband is good looking and he and Flora have regular means of meeting up, plus they communicate often. My guess that the stakeout is partly so Dylan can make a move on you. Cheat with each other because *obviously* both of your SOs are cheating!\n\nI've been in your husbands shoes three times. My now-ex from a few years ago had a best friend that told her I was cheating when I wasn't (friend actually liked me). With another ex, her shitty friends would constantly make remarks that I was flirting with other women. Then a few months ago, the former BF of a lady friend told my girlfriend me and another woman were being inappropriate (which was hilariously ridiculous for stupid reasons). \n\nYou've checked his social media. Nothing. You've checked his phone. Nothing. You've checked your calendar for three specific \"suspicious\" nights, but nothing, because you two were literally together. You currently have no proof and no actual reason to doubt your husband, except for the ramblings of a man in desperation due to his likely cheating SO. \n\nAs for what you should do now: Obviously, you don't hang out with Dylan one on one. I can see why you wouldn't want to tell your husband, since doing so would tip him off if he was actually cheating, but if you trust and believe in him, then I think you need to show it. I would want to know if some dude was trying to break up my relationship, which is what Dylan is doing. ",
            "Just talk to your husband and be straight up about it. Who cares what the other girl does, but if it is bothering you that much don't hold back. That'll become toxic and even if it isn't true you may convince yourself it is. ",

His current insane behavior and possible volatility needs to be taken into account when making that decision. \n\nEdit: to reiterate what another poster said you need to work on your insecurities.
