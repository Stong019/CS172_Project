Life took some turns! \n\nI never got around to asking him out as he went on sick leave due to stress shortly after the math exams. I didn't want to pester him when he was already going through something. I didn't, and don't, know him well enough for that to feel appropriate. Unfortunately I have no idea how he is doing now, but I hope he's okay. \n\nThe exams went terribly for me, speaking of. I did pass, but nerves got the best of me! Luckily the rest of my grades keep me at a good average.\n\nAnyway, it's not all bad. In the summer after my post - and after some horrible Tinder dates - I fell in love with one of my long term friends and fortunately he with me as well (to be fair I always thought he was beyond amazing)! \n\nSo, I'm in a great relationship now, we're moving in together and I will be a fully fledged teacher come January :)\n\nThanks for all your replies though, they were really helpful at the time!\n\nTl;dr - Didn't ask him out in the end as he went on sick leave, but life moved on and I'm in a good place, hopefully he is too.",

            "As a male professor this makes me happy. Please students don\u2019t ask your profs out. First off we can\u2019t really go o it with you  as it\u2019s morally wrong and as we can get fired . My dad  (and mom) was also a prof who left my mom and six year old me for a grad student. But those were the 70s so he kept his job. They got back together eventually but it\u2019s sucked for  my mom and I. When I first got a chilli pepper on the rate my profs ( when that was still a thing) it kinda made me feel gross. \nNow I have a lot of ex students who I absolutely love (platonically) cause they are awesome and  smart people. And yeah I\u2019ve had some super hot looking students, but since they are my students I don\u2019t even think about looking at them in that way cause it\u2019s damn creepy. Students please be inspired by your teachers if they are good but please don\u2019t make shit awkward. If you have a crush (and yeah I did too back on the day) keep it to yourself.",
            "In hindsight, it wouldn\u2019t have been weird to want to go out with your professor, but it wouldn\u2019t have been ethical for him to do so. Glad things worked out when all was said and done!",
            "I\u2019m in a similar situation as this. I (f/28) had a huge crush on my manager (m/29), he quit last week and asked me out immediately. I had a secret work crush on him for awhile and recently became single last month! I was so excited when he asked me out, but the next day he texted me with an excuse and then didn\u2019t reschedule. It was weird because he was the one to ask me out and even mentioned dinner and drinks, which to me is a date. Then the next day I said just take your time, I know you\u2019re going through a lot and he replied nicely saying we\u2019ll \u201chang out\u201d soon.  He came in the other day to say goodbye to a few people and didn\u2019t acknowledge me for the few seconds he saw me. Others were around and it was an awkward situation but I\u2019m bummed to say the least. \n\nI\u2019ve pretty much let it go, but I\u2019m glad to read this and know there is probably someone else meant for me one day.",

Even though you didn't get together in the end it's nice to see someone share how they maturely moved on and ended up finding someone else (and that you made the wise choice to not pester him after he took sick leave). A lesson some in this sub could definitely learn from! \n\nA++ on being a shining example of an adult OP. I'm sure you'll be a wonderful teacher! Good luck with the new job and the new roomie ;)",

            "Tbh I was rooting for this story to end with you getting with him, because I was in a very similar situation as you OP- a few years ago in my last year of uni I had the biggest crush on my young-30ish professor. He was smart, charming, well dressed and so handsome. I\u2019m 99% sure he was attracted to me too, but I never jumped on that after the class ended because of nerves and a friend of mine gossiping to me that she heard he had gotten in a relationship in the time the class was about to end, and I did not want to get involved in all that. \n\nRegardless, I\u2019m so happy you ended up in a happy and fulfilling relationship! I hope you continue to enjoy it :)",

Or, in many cases, they are just outright using posts and their comments as case studies to drive their articles or discussion.  We have observed this behavior sporadically in the past, but now we are starting to see it happening with greater frequency and consistency, so we need to let you all know.\n\nTo be clear, we don't condone this kind of behavior in any way.  We are not interested in the additional traffic this behavior might bring.  We are not interested in the kind of extra guidance that users might receive from the larger audience these outlets possess.  We want to do whatever we can to make sure your decision to post *here* and not anywhere else is respected.\n\nThat's really the key here.  We get the reality.  We're taking it to the reddit admins to figure out the legal perspective because it is murky territory that isn't likely to be in our favor.  However, all the same, we moderators are still reaching out to these entities from the ethical perspective as best we can.  While our subreddit does indeed represent a public forum, you are still a relatively vulnerable individual who worked up the courage to put yourself and your situation out to this community.  Our contention and concern goes beyond a simple matter of copyright, expanding out more to the issue that someone is making spectacle and entertainment out of your very real problem.  You aren't a character in a story.  You are a real human being requesting help from other real people.  If you wanted the help of some other media outlet, you would have submitted your story to them for input.  Instead, you chose /r/relationships because in some way, you felt our community would be a decently safe and useful enough place to get help.  \n\nIf external sources continue to threaten this safety, then we risk seeing the most vulnerable and shy posters choosing to not get the guidance they are needing.\n\nWhile we understand the desire to perhaps discuss this issue in the comments, we are locking the post for now as we don't want to spur on a witch hunt against these different media sources.  The majority of them are individual writers who likely haven't considered the harm they are causing, and though we wish they were more thoughtful, directing a community of 433k members at them isn't really the solution either.  **We instead ask that you message the moderators directly with any information you have on these external sources so that we may get in touch with them and pass that information along to the admins.**",

I'm also hoping it might be therapeutic to write this out.\n\nI did break up with my boyfriend, albeit not immediately after Reddit resoundingly told me to.  A lot of people were saying to me that by doing this to me (especially at this time), Andrew was expressing a lack of commitment to me and consideration for me.  I think part of me knew that as soon as it happened, but I just wasn't ready to accept it yet.\n\nWe ended up staying together after the incident I described in my post, partially because he apologized profusely and reassured me, but mostly because I had just lost my mom and I wasn't ready to lose him too.  I don't regret staying with him these past few months; he's provided me a lot of support that I would have been to afraid to ask for from anyone else in my life.  But as time went on, his lack of consideration for my feelings and our clear incompatibility continued to resurface.  We talked about breaking up a couple times, and I finally decided to pull the plug last night.  Unsurprisingly, he was pretty relieved.  He admitted that he has wanted this for awhile, but has \"wronged\" me so many times in our relationship that he felt an obligation to \"do right by me\" and not end things until I was ready.  \n\nIt's hard to take this kind of loss while I'm still dealing with the loss of my mother, but I know it's for the better.  Thanks for the advice, Reddit.  \n\n**TL;DR: We finally broke up.**",

            "> Apparently, the day before, Jack had called him to express some doubt about our compatibility that he said was shared by the entire group. Andrew then called Max and Dave, who echoed Jake's thoughts, along with some rather hurtful statements about my character. In particular, Max told Andrew that he was settling for me, that Andrew was extraordinary and I was ordinary, and that I lack depth as a person. Max has only met me once.\n\nFor fuck's sake. These sounds so much like one of those alien races connected through some unviewable thread (Xenoblade's Orpheans for example).\n\nWhat the hell. It's like Inside Out, but in real life. A council dictates his life.\n\nYou're better off this way.",

This breakup however seems 100 percent the right thing to do and you will be so much better off without clinging to an unequal and unhappy relationship. Just sending you loads of hugs and support from a random internet stranger!",
            "You sound so emotionally mature and it was a super difficult position to be in, but it really sounds like you were able to make the best decisions for yourself over and over again. You totally deserve someone who is able to be as mature about their feelings as you are, and I hope you find that soon.",

            "I think his behaviour during those first days following your mom's death was absolutely reprehensible, but I might be able to offer a weird silver lining for \"future you\".  \n\nMy dad died when I was 15.  It was without a doubt the single most defining event of my entire life, and has impacted every day since (and this was almost twenty years ago).  However, I kept diaries back then, and when I look back at them it is super confusing.  I remember the reality of the horrific shock, pain, and my inability to process what was happening at the time, but if you read these diary entries, I just seem fixated on weird teenage romantic shit.  Like I'm talking about the same week that it happened, on the funeral day, you name it.  On (literal) paper it looks super self-absorbed and callous, but as an adult it's obvious that I was clinging to any distraction in order to survive and keep from completely losing my mind.  \n\nSo in conclusion, this guy clearly wasn't it for you, and the fact that he decided to put those doubts and fears in your head during your darkest hours is absolutely disgusting and abhorrent, **but** - maybe the fact that you had something to focus on besides your grief was helpful in some small way?  In twenty years your memories of your mom will still be strong, hopefully you'll have processed your grief in a healthy way, and you can probably look back and laugh at the self-important knob that you dated for a while.",
            "i don't like how he behaved even if you weren't going through one of the toughest grieving periods most people have. Like, even if everything was sunshine and roses, it's really messed up to poll your friends about your relationship and then share the mean things they said with your girlfriend. That feels like an early high school sort of thing to do. \n\nI'm glad you moved on and wish you luck. He and max can be extraordinary by themselves if you ask me.",

I want you to look for relationships where the other person lifts you up and supports you. Also, look for someone who doesn\u2019t share everything with friends or family. They will always take his side and consider you the villain. The other person is only painting your flaws with other people. You could jump through fire and they will see you in a negative light. If your future boyfriend ever does that, or even you, shit that down immediately.\n\nIf either you or a future boyfriend have problems with your relationship, you need to speak to each other. When things can\u2019t be resolved between the two of you, consult a therapist to bounce ideas. This is how healthy and respectful relationships work.",

He's more of a cult material, not a husband.  This holier than thou mentality has nothing to do with Buddhism, but rather their hive hubris among his friends.",

            "You did the right thing, even though I imagine it was incredibly difficult. I hope you are getting through the grieving process okay and that you feel supported by those in your life who care about you.\n\nSomething I want to mention from your last post that might not have been addressed, but stuck out to me:\n\n> Another way he deals with his doubt is by bouncing it off of his close group of friends.\n\nI cannot overstate how terrible an idea it is to vent about trivial relationship struggles, uncertainty, and doubt to your friends. ESPECIALLY if those friends don't have a close relationship with your SO.\n\nYour friends will develop a mental model of your partner based on what they know about them. If they don't have a close personal relationship with your partner, then what they know about them will be based on what you tell them. If you vent to them, their mental model of your partner will be negative. \"This person is causing my friend stress. This person probably isn't right for my friend. This person has x, y, z bad attributes.\"\n\nVirtually none of us follow up with people we've vented to about problems to inform them the problem isn't an issue anymore. So when you find resolution to your relationship uncertainties, or when you realize for yourself that the thing you were venting about wasn't a big deal, your friends won't have that new information and will continue to think negatively of your SO, indefinitely.\n\nWere I to venture a guess, I would bet your ex boyfriend's inability to commit to relationships and fear of commitment, paired with his close relationship with his friends as you've described them to us, stems in large part from this problem. He shares everything with his friends, including relationship venting, so then his friends get a bad impression of everyone he dates, and then when he seeks advice from them they amplify any doubt he might have because their impression of everyone he dates is bad.\n\nHaving friends you can share your feelings with is great, but when it comes to romantic relationships, airing dirty laundry is a terrible idea. As long as we're not talking about something like abuse, or cheating, or obvious terrible behavior, tackle those issues as a couple, and if you can't, see a couple's therapist.",

Everything he said about his \"practice\" was just utter bull shit.  We'd only hung out a few times and he made me cry twice and I'm not overly emotional.  The second time I had it and walked out.  On my ride home I thought about it and recognized what he was emotionally abusive.  I called him when I got home, tried to explain how I felt and he went off on me.  I told him we couldn't be friends anymore and that was that.  Ge acted incredulous that I'd actually cut him loose and I reassured him what I was saying was real.",
            "Yeah, I was dating a real piece of shit when my dad died. And during the lead up to his death and the day of his death, he decided then to start messing with my mind if he wanted to dump me or not. People like that are horrible, horrible people. Dumped him and never looked back. Now I think back and I'm like, was I insane during that time to have dated that guy?? You'll be ok. Don't date someone who needs a friend group to vote on what to do with their life.  Pathetic.",
            "It sounds like you dodged a bullet with this guy! I'm so sorry you're having to grieve not only the loss of your mother, but also the loss of a relationship. It also sounds like you're ultimately better off without him. I'm really not a fan of anyone who uses their spirituality as an excuse to live in denial of the full spectrum of human emotions. It's not healthy, and it's also not really aligned with Buddhism. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. the fact that you have  the strength to walk away from this relationship at such a difficult time, and to show yourself compassion for staying as long as you did, shows that you're far more exceptional than he is. An exceptional man wouldn't have told you about the crappy things his friends said about you, especially when you were already going through one of the hardest times in your life. I don't necessarily believe in rating the value of people (and that's not aligned with Buddhism, either) but if we're going to be rating the worth of a person, I think we can all safely agree you're far closer to the exceptional end of the spectrum than he'll ever be. Good for you for moving on. Sending you so much love.",
            "Good for you!  Life is hard.  You want someone who doesn't bail at the first difficulty.  I also had a relationship end right after my mom passed.  You'll find that breaking up with someone who wasn't there for you is nothing compared to the pain of your loss and you'll move on.  I wish you the best!",
            "Your ex sounds kind of like a huge douche. I hope you get to feeling better.",
            "You made the right choice, OP. I hope things get better for you. Losing your Mom is never easy, but the pain will change in time. Lots of love from this internet stranger.",
            "Glad to hear you broke up.",
            "This is your 20s for ya. As you get older, what your friends opinions are just that. Opinions. You can make own decisions as a big boy or girl the older you get. He's immature. Good luck honey! I'm sorry about your mom. Grieve all you need to. Me and my bf are wildly different and appreciate that about each other. Your bf should've appreciated how different you guys are. My bf also takes his friend's opinions as just that. The older you get the less you want to involve biased friends opinions anyways. That's what therapy is for. My dad just died but also my bf's friends don't really like me much. I'm glad his friend's opinions aren't taken seriously enough to affect our relationship. This post hit close to home \ud83d\ude22",

            "Good for you for having the strength to do that. It was clearly inevitable that you guys would not last & it was incredibly insensitive for him to even consider breaking up with you during that time. Don't shed a single tear for that man, he doesn't deserve it. I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through right now... If you ever need someone to talk to, shoot me a message anytime. Please take care of yourself, you're going to get through this.",
            "Im sure it is very difficult now but I promise you in a few months you will no longer be mourning the loss of your bf and instead willl be thinking what a nutcase, albeit an extraordinary nutcase",
            "I'm so sorry for your loss and that things with your BF came to a head at this time. It was incredibly insensitive of him and his idiot friends to push their doubts onto you while you were dealing with the loss of your mother.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey only think you are ordinary? Girl, they couldn't be more wrong. The way you handled the crap he/they pulled on you was extraordinary and you showed more grace then any of them deserved. I know your ex bf being bashed doesn't help you heal, but I do think you deserve much better. He served a purpose in your life, and maybe it was for him to be there for you during this tragic time. I am glad you had him to lean on and that you are strong enough to move forward.",
            "Unfortunately for many guys their friends opinions matter A LOT.  Many guys will dump their gf if the friends dont like her.",
            "Good riddance, girlfriend. The only thing \"extraordinary\" about this guy and his band of merry assholes (aka: friends) is how extraordinarily poorly he treated you and how extraordinarily judgmental they were of you. You, dear, were the one settling. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss, and I pray you find true happiness with someone deserving of your affections.",
            "I\"m so relieved for you and thank you for the update. I remember your post and I understand why you didn't break up with him just yet, becaue of the loss of your mom. My condolences for your loss by the way.\n\nYou just know wherever she is if she were around she'd be saying, \"It's about time you kicked him to the curb, I always wanted better for you.\"\n\nIt stings now but as time goes on you are going to see more and more how much this relationship was never meant to be and how you dodged a massive bullet. It's also really telling that he knew he was wronging you, but still went ahead and kept on doing it. Hmmm, really looking hard at him and his so-called of Debbie Downer friends right now.\n\nIf they want to talk about negativity they should all be looking in a mirror right now and practicing some of that mindfulness on their own actions instead of goodness posturing.",
            "You sound like a really awesome person, and I really respect how you are approaching this awful situation. Really hope that the people in your life are taking care of you and letting you know how loved you are. I am sure your mom is proud of you. I'm truly sorry for your loss and I wish you all the best.",

            "It seems clear to me he wanted you to break up with him. No way does a person forward that negativity to someone that want to be with. He decided to stay together hoping you would break up with him. Guy is a extraordinary alright. An extraordinary asshole.",
            "Good for you, girl. Long story short, I stayed with someone during my grief and it was horrible",
            "Im so sorry. Youre going to walk out of this stronger. Im so sorry that you lost your mom, I hope you are doing well and healing.",

            "He is just a child and so aren't his friends. Now you are free to find a real man (and you'd be fine on your own, better than being dragged down) who will love and cherish you and be the strength you need and deserve during the hard times.",
            "Sorry for the loss of your mom. It's bad timing but in the long run, you're better off without him. People who make you feel like you're hard to love are not worth your time.",
            "Any man who has the audacity to whine about what his friends think about you while he knows you are actively mourning the loss of your mother (especially on funeral day) is utterly pathetic.",
            "It's really annoying with people claim to live a Buddhist life style but only kind of adopt it and only adopt the points that easily integrate in to their life. Get off your \"chill and earthly\" high horse and stop judging people for living differently than how they choose to. It's literally the opposite of what Buddhism stands for. It's so fucking silly. But anyways, I'm glad you're separated from the hypocrite and his even more hypocritical friends.",
            "I had been in a longish relationship. Like 3 years and my mom died when I was 18.. My BF at the time suggested we smoke a joint while my family and I were waiting for the priest to send her. I broke up with him soon after.",
            "That whole friend group sounds toxic. They sound like they all believe childish, insensitive ideas and they all stick together and feed off it, telling themselves they are good people because they do yoga, lol. I'm sorry for the loss of your mother, but losing the boyfriend and his friend group, congrats because you will be much, much better off. Dating someone who seems to not be able to decide things for themselves or just know who they are is incredibly exhausting. He doesn't sound like he was that committed to you in the first place, probably because of his friends. Sometimes, your friends are more harmful to your life than helpful.",
            "Hang tough, It gets better. Condolences for your mama, she's gotta be proud of you for leaving an unhealthy relationship.  Take this time to grieve your mom and ex on your own.  \nEmbrace the best qualities from your mom.  Learn from the relationship with your ex,\nwhat you want and don't want.",
            "Well, if he cannot support you during your hard time, and his immediate circle is toxic as fuck, breaking up with him sounds like a right choice.\n\nAnd sorry about your mother's loss, I know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you. Hope you stay strong.",
            "I lost my younger brother(we were 14 months apart) in January 2012 and got involved in a relationship too soon after. He was pursuing me a month after he died and I finally agreed to go on a date by May. It ended by the end of summer. I wasn't emotionally/physically ready to let someone in plus he didnt like a lot of aspects of my personality. Werent compatible.\n\nSkip forward a lot of mistakes and wonderful experiences andd 7 years later I'm with the right one for me. All of my family/friends adore him and its hard not too. He's handsome, so kind and thoughtful and a wonderful partner. We bring out the best in each other over the the past 4.5 years and happily living together for 1 year in July. I was single for 2 years before I met him and honestly I needed that time to grieve and have positive experiences. Best advice I can give is work on you/make your mistakes(they will be your life experiences) and just do the next focus on doing one right thing at a time.\n\n A friend just told me to do the next right thing the day my brother died and it has stayed with me ever since. \n\nI hope your heart and head are okay and you have good people to talk too. :)",
            "I'm actually a little bit enraged about this whole post. I don't want to bring specific demographics into this, but he and his group of friends sound like some privileged assholes who actually don't understand how Buddhism works. Coming from a family of Catholics, Buddhists, and Shamans, the way they talk, even in that short bit is so insulting and I'm extra insulted for you. Ordinary? Drive them anywhere in socal and there will be a bunch of other exactly like them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry for the events that led up to that breakup, but you definitely deserve better, and are better off without that canoe of douches led by Max.",

            "They sound like lame pretentious idiots, long term you'll be very happy you ended things. \n\nSo Sorry about your mum.",
            "I am so very sorry for your loss in both cases.\nMy mom died 2 years ago after a 5 year battle with cancer and it was f-ing brutal.\n\nI was in a relationship with someone, who as another redditor wrote above of your bf, also thought he \u201cfarted rainbows\u201d. He was also someone that touted Buddhist philosophy (which I too love and do my best to live) but he did not seem to internalize the lessons of Buddhism. For him, it was most important to appear spiritually evolved. It was a brain fuck to be with him. He could treat me so poorly, was a total alcoholic, yet would speak in these ways that always exalted himself and I totally ate it up... blah. I put him on a pedestal and myself very low on the ground. What a mess. But actions speak best and his behavior was truly shitty, much like you\u2019ve described with your ex.\n\nWhat you describe is some truly shitty behavior. Could you imagine treating him the way he treated you? I imagine not.\n\nMy moms death and the very real fallout from it made me feel in his debt. I was anxious about my level of neediness and he made no bones about letting me know how very inconveniencing I was to him.\n\nI finally got out.\n\nThen there were two relationships to grieve.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for what you are going through.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your mom as a 26 year old.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you do not get to talk with her in person about what you are going through now and get a hug from her.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you got the message that your grief is a burden to someone else.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that on the day of your mothers funeral you felt you had to check in with him about how taxing it must have been for him. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry that you had to spend the day that should have been reserved as a very hard goodbye with the occupying thought that your partner is there reconsidering your relationship.\n\nI think what you have been through is a big trauma.\n\nI have 3 girlfriends that all lost their mothers in their late 20s/30s. They all said \u201cyou never really get over it.\u201d \u201cIt comes in big waves.\u201d \u201cThere are many moments I still pick up the phone to call her.\u201d\n\nThey all briefed me on the rollercoaster that is \u201cmom death.\u201d Without their words, I would have been lost, thinking I was crazy, or broken now, or too much, or annoying, or too depressed and was not worthy to ask love and support from others.\nI am very proud of you for removing this man from your life during a time when it would have been easier for you not to. He does not deserve the level of kindness or consideration you offered him, and yet, it shows a good deal about your heart and selflessness.\n\nI would really suggest getting all the support you can on board. You\u2019ve had a huge loss and now have a smaller \u201cdeath\u201d with in tow with the loss of someone you shared a year with and your heart with. I realized about a year into my moms death I had to use all the tools in my toolbox: self care, no substance, self help, therapy, friends, uplifting music, art, baths... anything that made me feel good.\n\nNow that you do not have to worry about this man loving you, you get to love yourself through this tragedy.\n\nPs.  My rainbow farting ex reached out about 6 months ago to let me know that he was now aware of what an ass he was in what was the hardest time of my life to date. He apologized. It helped a little. If this guy reflects he will come to see how truly selfish he has been to someone he claimed to care for.",
            "hey OP! I was just broken up with after a 5-year relationship and my father passed away in march. it's really hard to lose close people in such a short space of time, but I hope I can deal with it as maturely as you are right now. Best wishes!",
            "His friend group remind me of some of my friends, some of them are the hippy/meditation/psychedelic doing type (so are hubby and i) some people do that kind of stuff and it makes them realize that they\u2019re small in the world and changes their perspectives for the better BUT some people do that kind of stuff and then think they are better and somehow more knowledgeable than everyone else. It sounds like andrew and his buddies decided to take the asshole route, maybe one day he\u2019ll get off his high horse and realize meditation does not make you \u201cextraordinary\u201d or \u201cenlightened\u201d it just make you some dude who meditates",
            "I had a similar experience to yourself where my partner of 11 years decided several weeks after my mums death was a good time to end things. \nHe couldn't be there for me in the most difficult time of my life, when I was most vulnerable.\nI'm glad he did as the people who have been there are actually the kinds of people I want in my life.\nTrust me that guy doesnt sound like someone you want around and you will find someone amazing in time.\nFocus on yourself now, let yourself grieve for your mum and focus on what you want out of life for yourself \u2764 you deserve better.",
            "Dude sounds like a chump.",
            "Just read your old post.  Your ex and his friends sound like fake ass Buddhists.  I've met plenty....they use the aesthetic and probably think it's cool to tell people they follow an eastern religion, but when it comes time to actually put principles into practice....nothing.  \n\nYou're better off.  Dudes like that suffer from a massive lack of self awareness.",
            "I'm so impressed you could handle it so maturely, thoughtfully and kindly (to him and yourself) in this terrible point in your life.  There will be ups and downs - as I'm sure you know.  But please accept my admiration.  Well done.",
            "He wanted to break up with you, but didn\u2019t have the balls to do it.\n\nI will bet you a bunch that half of what he said wasn\u2019t even from his friends, but him",
            "I'm sorry it had to end, but it sounds like you were both mature about it, and honestly it sounds like it was time to move on. I'm glad you had him to give you that emotional support, I couldn't imagine trying to go through that.",
            "I'm glad he was ok with breaking up, and helping you recover from your loss. He sounds considerate, even if it wasn't meant to be. At least everything ended smoothly!",
            "Omg. Baby girl. I know everything is swirling right now. But sweetie, you will be better without him. I can not ever imagine anyone doing such a heartless thing. Even some of the worst people I've ever met have put aside issues in delicate circumstances. \n\nYou are going through one of the hardest things right now. I lost my mom 10 years ago when I was 19 and I'm still not over it. What kind of selfish, egotistical, mindless human takes the floor during this. \n\nSo glad he is gone. You will heal honey. And when you do you will come out so much stronger and will have the confidence to find someone who deserves you.\n\nXoxoxox you are in my prayers.",
            "Ouch. Just read your original post and I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve moved on. Obviously I also understand why you chose to stay with him for the time being. I\u2019m so sorry you lost your mom. I can\u2019t fathom how painful that is. But he was a real jerk throughout the relationship and I guarantee you will find someone better. \n\nI dated someone like this. He had his head in the clouds and had very similar interests and friends. I realized after a while that he had never been able to support me emotionally. I was drained by him. I felt that because he always talked about his emotions and talked to me about his doubts and fears, he must have been the emotionally mature one. I didn\u2019t realize until later that he really only ever talked about HIS emotions. Whenever I needed support, he became withdrawn and criticized me or our relationship. He was very immature and he masked that with his talk of the \u201cethereal\u201d and the spiritual. Really he was just not at all grounded in grown- up reality and every bad habit, poor decision or hurtful action was framed as part of some spiritual journey. \n\nYou are much better off. I hope you have some support available to you as you continue to grieve."

I tried to reply to each one and thank them, but it quickly became too hard. Thanks so much everyone. The link to my original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9xnqpo/my_31m_boss_35m_just_made_me_aware_im_not_well/\n\n\n\nAnyway, to the update. I went to see my boss and another boss, one of which I wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about me so figured it would be a good idea to ask someone I\u2019m close to and someone I\u2019m not to cover all the bases. It turns out it actually is just the two I\u2019m aware of that don\u2019t like me. However, it was also pointed out that while people do love my sense of humour, I need to be more aware around people who don\u2019t know me because I do come across as condescending or rude.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve gotten lots of great tips from you all, and from my bosses as to what to work on and how to be more appropriate at work. I\u2019m going back to therapy this week as well. It was suggested by some Redditors that I don\u2019t seem happy and maybe that was an issue. Turns out I\u2019m still holding a lot of pain and defensiveness from a past abusive relationship so I\u2019m working on that too.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a long road ahead but I\u2019m going to work hard to make it to where I can let go, be happy and learn how to better understand others and be more appropriate. I really appreciate the replies from everyone, so thanks again.\n\n\n\nTL;DR - had a conversation with two of my bosses and discussed how to be more appropriate as well as figuring out how to work on the issues I have.

            "Great update! Keep in mind, you being willing to go to your bosses to have these uncomfortable discussions about improvement in the interest of bettering your social interactions and environment at work looks really good to them. They want a cohesive team and you being willing to see areas where you can try harder can go a long way with them and their perception of you. ",
            "While many people said that you are not socially aware (and they are not completely wrong), you are conscious enough about your surroundings that you not only went and asked for advice but also followed it. That is pretty good and better than a lot of other people can do. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder for that!\n\nI wish you all the best in your social endeavors :)\n\nIt's an uphill climb for the best of us.",
            "You know, it takes a lot to look at a situation and accept you could be better. It\u2019s takes even more to actually follow through. Good on you for allowing the self awareness to both ask the question and be receptive to  answers. Another bonus for acknowledging you haven\u2019t worked through the damage of your past relationship.  I hope things improve for you and that you see success and happiness beyond what  imagined possible. ",

            "hey, I read your last post as well as this one.\n\nmost people go through life without making many waves, so most people aren't liked or disliked, people just feel meh about them.\n\nthen there are people who are horrible, and everyone dislikes them.\n\nthen there are interesting people who make waves who are POLARIZING. some people like them, some people hate them. these people are pretty rare. \n\nso when your boss found out that 1-2 people disliked you, it was an easier conclusion to make that you're generally disliked than that you're polarizing. \n\nso maybe rein in the worse parts of your personality a bit, but don't just become oatmeal. it's better to be a few people's shot of vodka than everyone's cup of tea.

            "I like you because you seem open to criticism and acknowledge you likely have some work to do on yourself. I will say that in your first post when you wrote you tried to dumb yourself down, I immediately thought what a jerk. it's okay for us to think we're smarter than everyone else, I'm sure we all do feel it at some point in time, just don't say it or act like it. Good luck.",

Yeah your use if the words \"dumb down\" was annoying but not to that extent. It's just bizarre to me how they all fed into each other to be mean.\n\nBig hugs to you OP. try and work on that caustic sense of humor because some of us can be a little sensitive or find it exhausting.

I feel like an \"acquired taste\" as you said, (I have the same humour that I get from my family and it does not appeal to everyone) \n\nI always jump to help everyone and I feel like I should feel so good about myself but I don't. \n\nI've never thought about taking therapy. But good for you for putting that effort in. I think socially there's nothing wrong with you. I think people as they age just don't care to be friendly or put in effort where it doesn't benefit them or make sense. People don't not like you. Its just your sense of things. I am so sorry this happened, as that is a terribly blunt and rather rude thing to say to someone at work who does nothing but the best they can. I wish the best for you. \u2764",

            "For all of the seemingly innate lack of \"people awareness\" that was thrown out in original comments, a majority of ACTUAL people would not take the input to heart, as you have, and  then actually applied new behavioral strategies, as you have. This says a lot about the complexity of your intellect that is excellent...and also your emotional intelligence, that you could investigate the situation, by talking to your bosses, then follow up with positive action, while handling the stress of feeling/knowing that your behavior was objectionable. Some people would fold, handling the input as rejection of themselves personally. You are astute and will do well with your new approach.",

I didn't think anything you said in your OP was so terrible. In any event, I'm glad this story has a happy ending and that you're going back into therapy. You've demonstrated a willingness to confront and address your issues. Congrats, you're ahead of 99% of us haha...Good job man! :)",
            "I read your original thread and was shocked by how many people immediately broke out the pitch forks. You didn\u2019t sound like a jerk to me, just withdrawn or perhaps socially awkward. I hope you didn\u2019t take those overly harsh comments too seriously. The idea of making a judgment of a person based off a few sentences is ridiculous.\n\nBut I am glad you came away with the courage to have an uncomfortable conversation with your bosses and learn the truth of the situation. Really good for you. I hope therapy helps you too. You deserve some peace and happiness.",
            "Some times there are simple answers to these problems, like joining your local sports club or hosting poker nights, etc. Don't over think it, humans are just social creatures and if you come off as not wanting to socialize you'll always turn at least some people off.

            "Congrats OP.  I'm in a similar situation, and I got this advice, that you might find helpful:\n\n\n- People perceive us primarily by our body language and tone.  You can work with a Speech Therapist on this.  You need to ask if they work with Adults on \"PRAGMATICS,\" which is the subfield that focuses on tone, pacing, and pitch.  \n\n\n- You can also look into Occupational therapy, which they teach (or reteach) social skills, including how to read the room.\n\n\ngood luck",

            "Just read your original post OP and I recognize a lot of the feelings of isolation and feeling excluded. What has really helped me is mindfulness and a type of therapy called DBT for the incredibly useful skills classes, but that\u2019s me. Different people are helped by different modalities and you can discuss with your therapist what you could explore.\n\nI noticed that you did immediately think everyone didn\u2019t like you and it brought up some deep painful feelings of being left out. Then it kind of spiralled from there. It felt like you thought everyone was judging you and in turn you took those perceived judgements as truth and turned it against yourself. Now that you\u2019ve spoken with your bosses you\u2019ve checked the facts (a DBT skill), which is great. Not trying to sell you on this type of therapy but it\u2019s just what I went through so it\u2019s the lens I am speaking through, but DBT\u2019s whole point is to reduce suffering and recognizing that things don\u2019t necessarily have to change on the outside for you to feel much better inside.\n\nI see it as great you are so reflective and want to better yourself but self-compassion is really important, it\u2019s how you\u2019ll start to feel better. Go easy on yourself. If you disappoint yourself (am I off base to think you feel this way a lot?) just tell yourself, lesson learned. I know how to handle this situation better now, and that\u2019s valuable. I am not yet where I want to be but I am exactly in the right place for right now.\n\nApologies if I am off base and read way too much into your posts. I am definitely seeing this through my own lens so I am sorry if it doesn\u2019t gel with you. I do think being kinder to yourself is important though, it\u2019s the first step to learning to like yourself. All the best, OP. It sounds like you are a great friend to have, to be honest.",

Therapy would be good for other issues but honestly, you seem super composed and mature, and you came here to open yourself to criticism about something you are insecure about. That is rough, but I see it as someone wanting to improve emotionally and socially and that's admirable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: I don't think there's anything seriously wrong with you, socially.

We're a strong team and we really look out for each other.  I spent yesterday just bouncing around to different departments because I was done for the day and I loved being able to help the others with their busy days and keep them from being overwhelmed.  \n\nIf your work place does any social events or morale boosters see if you can attend.  Burn out and compassion fatigue are big issues in our field so we do a lot of these.  Some are low key like donate a food bank item and get to wear your favorite non-company scrubs.  Others are more involved like holiday cookie swaps, our bosses buying lunch and off site activities.  ",

Basically, judging me for being me.\n\nThe tipping point for me was when I told my manager that I\u2019ve been bullied and I don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m not a team player if I don\u2019t interact with the team. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable.\n\nShe asked me if I\u2019m overreacting. I wasn\u2019t. I asked new people in the team if they\u2019ve experienced it too, and they have. She told me that it\u2019s my own fault I\u2019m bullied, started saying I\u2019m terrible at x, y and z, and that if I can\u2019t handle the pace of the company, I should leave.\n\nI decided to leave.

I echo the other redditors who said you don't seem so bad and you fell victim to a bunch of folks who smelled weakness and dogpiled on you.  I really cringed when I read your post that you were \"such a bad person\"\n\n I wanted to add that there is such a thing as dumbing yourself down, and it's not always so sinister.  You might have meant dumbing yourself down as in making small talk about trivial or uninteresting things when you didn't want to.  You might have meant dumbing yourself down as in not choosing to make certain jokes or references that are obscure and you didn't want to explain.  You might have meant that you literally didn't make certain observations or conclusions because you didn't think they could be explained.  \nThinking you're the smartest person in the room can be annoying.  It may be true, however.  If you believe that there is such a thing as intelligence, and you are on the high end of that -- part of socializing is knowing how to dampen or even mask that trait.  From a life satisfaction standpoint and from a learning humility standpoint, I ask whether you've considered finding a room with smarter people?  Taking into account that smarter means \"the opposite of what dumbing down meant to you\" and not necessarily more Mensa.\n\nEdit - also regarding older people, there was one person who suggested that your preference for older people must be because only they have learned the patience to tolerate you.  I wonder whether your interactions with older people give content to the \"dumbing down.\".  Less superficiality?  ",

I posted it at like 7:30 Monday morning while the family was getting ready, got zero responses and went out skiing, by lunch time it had like 200 responses and by the time I got in that evening it was over 500. By far my biggest reddit post ever (mostly DIY and crafts stuff). I spent Monday night carefully reading every single response because there was a ton of value in all of them. \n\nOne post stood out and I apologize to whoever made it that I can't mention it them by name, but essentially they said it appeared I was conflating two issues, my husband taking risks and him not being social on vacation. I guess in the interest of brevity I had left out some details, I found out about Gregory's back country skiing because he is essentially my dad's hero and my dad sat there like a star struck school girl while Gregory regaled him with tales of backcountry skiing with local teenagers and jumping off 20 foot cliffs into powder. I was deeply annoyed with Gregory because it was the first time he was social with anyone. We were on day 3 of the vacation and he had literally gone to bed at 8 every night to get up and ski. I was jealous of how much fun my brother's wife and my two cousin's spouses were so engaged with the family. So I conflated my annoyance with both him (and my dad frankly) for being anti-social and taking risks. The posts the other day really helped me realize that and I made it a point to be nicer to him. \n\nIt also helped that Monday night my cousin's husband got rip roaring drunk in our condo and started cursing up blue streak. This with kids aged 1-10 all staying in the same relatively small space. He and my cousin had a extremely embarrassing and public fight that started inside and ended outside within earshot of the entire base area \"village.\" It made me realize that no matter how annoyed I can get with Gregory and his desire to not be social on most occasions, he will never, ever put me through that which helped me gain some perspective. \n\nThe yesterday afternoon as my cousin and her husband were getting ready to leave, he was acting like a jack ass while driving (he was probably wickedly hung over) in the parking lot and ended up sliding right into a snow bank, giving their new Lexus some significant body damage. He got out cursing and spewing in the parking lot all while basically standing like a helpless baby screaming at my cousin that she needed to \"call someone goddamnit.\" Gregory and my Dad very calmly dug his car out of the snow, dug up some gravel for traction and then backed his car out. It took maybe 10 minutes. It made me realize that quite possibly, all of Gregory's experience in remote places while biking, skiing, bowhunting, etc... have taught him to be relaxed and knowledgeable in a high pressure situation and he just did what had to be done. I felt very lucky and felt very sorry for cousin. I was watching this very hungover, overweight man cry in the middle of a parking lot because \"that's a $6500 grill on that car!\" while my very attractive and in shape husband who doesn't drink was calmly digging the entire car out. \n\nYesterday, morning I asked him if he would be willing to ski with me that day and he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a \"burden\" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. We actually had a great time together and he's so experienced he actually taught me more than I probably ever would have gotten from a paid lesson. \n\nWhile we were on the chairlift that day, I very calmly brought up my concerns about the back country skiing, leaving me to watch the kids (on other vacations, as I've said my mom and aunt are on \"kid duty' this trip--though me and my brother's wife are watching the kids today while my mom and aunt ski) while he goes and does activities. He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps) in order to reduce the risk and he said that he was sorry for leaving me to go surfing on our last trip and that he would try very hard to communicate before hand what his desires for any particular trip will be in advance and have it be a dialectic conversation with give and take vs him just assuming he can bolt off whenever the waves are big. I also said I was sorry for being so cold to him since the trip started but that I would appreciate him trying to hang out for a little longer each night. He said that it's thinly veiled secret that he can't stand my cousin's husband because he is constantly trying to \"one upping\" and \"talking down\" to Gregory for a myriad of reasons (they work in a similar field, so I guess there's something of a rivalry) and now that he's gone he will be more comfortable. So last night Gregory cooked steaks for everyone and stayed up a little later (8:30 is later right?) and chatted and seemed to have a good time. So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good. \n\nSo basically all is good, I love my husband more than words can possibly say and I'm glad we had this time together because I think while we had relatively minor problems in the grand scheme of things, we are coming out healthier and happier for it. \n\nIf I hadn't made my post Monday morning, I very well have made the rest of the vacation miserable for both of us. Thank you very much for all the all the help!\n\n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: follow up to my post from Monday about me being angry at my husband for taking extreme risks while doing his sports. But was probably more about me being annoyed with him not being social and me not communicating with him. ",

If he wanted you to ski with him, he should've asked you. He was trying to get away with doing whatever he wanted for the entire vacation while you watched the kids. I am not saying he's irredeemable for this, but I hope he was equally if not more apologetic for treating you like this on your own vacation.",
            "This is progress, but you aren't done yet.\n\n> So another strike on me for not communicating with him and assuming that he would see me as something of a \"burden\" to his ski day so I didn't even want to ask if he'd ski with me. \n\nAnd a strike on him for not asking you to ski with him\n\n> he said absolutely, that he was hoping we would get at least one day together. \n\nWhy is it your job to ask? He should be able to communicate his needs (and not just his need to go back country skiing!).\n\n> So today, since this was a planned day off for me to watch the kids, we agreed that he could meet his new friends really early so they could do some in area hiking before the lifts started and that he could stay out as late as he wanted if the snow was good.\n\nWait, when it's your day to watch the kids, do you get these concessions?\n\nI recommend more ongoing conversations, not just while on vacation.",
            "Let me just preface this, I've been a professional instructor for 14, certified, and worked out in Colorado for the past 6 seasons. We have probably the highest avalanche mortality rate in the world, and we take it seriously. When I saw this\n\n\n\" He assured me that the back country skiing at this area was very safe but that in the future he would get all the equipment necessary (float coat, peeps)\"\n\n\nI realised your husband is a completely incompetent skier. Allow me to explain. \n\n1. First mistake is that he's trusting himself to a bunch of locals he knows nothing about. These guys could be complete idiots, have no understanding of snowpack, or could just leave him there if he's in a slide. \n\n2. Is he AIARE certified? Were his buddies? Did any of them have any outdoor first aid certifications? Actually, you don't have to answer that, because I know he wasn't certified. Nobody who passed their AIARE 1 wouldn't have their own equipment. This is a very important part of education you need at the minimum to be able to operate outside the resort. You are a fucking dumbass not to put money into learning about this if you are going outbounds.\n\n3. Did he get rescue insurance? No? When he gets stuck, or dies, look forward to that 30,000 or more bill.\n\n4. Did he know the conditions loading up to that week? Was it warm, was it really cold? Did it snow a lot? Did they have a lack of snow? Because this shit matters. Two years ago their was a snowmobiler die in an avalanche after the snow broke on a layer from three weeks before. \n\nI could go on. But he and you probably still won't understand how fucking dumb this is. My first year working out west i thought I was going to be some badass Backcountry guy. That was when I realised how many people were getting killed that year. Thanks was when I started to talk to really certified guides in my school. It's not a joke, and I'm sick of seeing tourists ruining by dying all the time. ",

            "This sounds like a great positive update.\n\nCurious though, do you get time off to do what you want on vacation and does he get to watch the kids? I haven't seen anything about him staying with the kids yet?",
            "I was going to suggest in the original post that perhaps his anti-social behavior is because deep down he didn't like your family and wanted to actually get some quiet time away from them while on vacation.  It's nice that he admitted to hating cousin's husband because at least you know now and maybe you don't go on long vacations with them anymore.  I can't think of anything that would make me want to hide on vacation more than having to spend it with someone I don't like.",
            "I love updates like this. Great communication skills and self-reflection. This wasn't a popular sentiment on your last post, but I actually think there is something really cool about a dad being this adventurous and wanting to take his kids along when they are older. As long as he follows safety precautions, bringing your kids skiing, teaching them to surf, and going on lots of adventures will enrich their childhoods and teach them a lot of confidence. I have a feeling you will end up having great adventures as a family and your husband will naturally tone things down a bit because he'll want to do things that he can include you and the kids in once they're old enough.",

            "On the theme of conflating issues: I noticed you didn't address the issue back home with BJJ. You said you have a fight \"every week night\" because he comes home with scratches and a bad knee. I really hope you mean every week *at* night and not 5x a week of you, I hate to say this, b-tching and nagging and whining at him over an activity he loves that you think is dangerous. (It's not)\n\nBut you know what would not be \"b-tching, whining or nagging?\" You saying that 5x weekly BJJ is inappropriate when you have a family at home to spend time with. Again, two separate issues. You would be ENTIRELY in the right in this case.\n\nAnyway not sure how often he does BJJ, but that was the part of your original post where you lost me. Assuming it's once a week and he is otherwise an active, present and involved parent I will warn you: if you attempt to whine BJJ away from him on a WEEKLY basis for no other reason other than scratches and a tweaked knee, you will do irreparable damage to your relationship. \n\nIf he is not spending enough time with the family, however, he is doing the irreparable damage.

            "I know this is a late response, but your and your husband's situation sounds exactly like mine and my wife's. I do the same activities: ski mountaineering, DH mtb, surfing, BJJ, and also tend not to be social, especially during those trips. Also, my FIL and I get along super well even though he doesn't do those activities. \n\nEarly in our relationship, I wanted (and still want) to go Special Forces, but decided not to because my wife was against the idea of my being deployed for long periods of time etc. I understood that, but part of the compromise was my continued participation in these activities. \n\nWhat I wanted to pass along was some of the details of the compromise that have helped her, and I stay sane with this stuff. \n\n1. An understanding that without these activities as a stress relief, I'm depressed and less fun to be around. I had a tumor removed from my knee over the summer, and I was apparently a lot less fun to be around. \n\n2. I do everything possible to be as safe during those activities and to stay in communication with her during those activities. E.g. proper avalanche equipment (probe, beacon, shovel). And, renting a satellite phone to stay in contact when in the wilderness. \n\n3. Making sure to spend rest days together etc. \n\n",
