        "selftext": "I'm sorry for the length! I'm just really confused and emotional right now. tl:dr at the bottom. \n\nBackground: I volunteer as a videographer and photographer at a local church. All video and photo equipment is paid for out of my own pocket, and I do not receive any donations for my equipment or expenses. Which is fine, they do good work in a bad neighborhood, and I'm happy to lend my amateur services for free as a hobbyist. I've known the pastors' family for a very long time (17 years), and they have provided me with food and a place to stay numerous times during my turbulent childhood. \n\nThe media department has a windowed office within the church. There are patterns on the windows so you can't see inside, but it's common knowledge to everyone but visitors that our equipment is in there. There are two keys, one of which I have, and the other belongs to my partner. \n\nA couple of weeks ago, the pastor's son asked me if he could borrow my camera. He said that it's \"just shooting a video, not that hard\". I declined, so he asked me if I could \"shoot a music video for him\" He said he'd compensate me and I agreed, knowing that once he realized how much work was actually needed he would reconsider. Anyway, we decided to do it that weekend, and I told him to call me during the week so I could verify my availability, and that Friday was my birthday, so it would have to be before or after then. \n\nI hear nothing from him the entire week.  On Friday around 5am, he called me five times. I responded with a text saying that it was my birthday, and that I would be available the next day. He responded \"Alright\". \n\nThe following Sunday I go into the office and notice that there's a piece missing from my DSLR. My small RODE microphone is also missing. The settings are changed to auto and the picture style is set to monochrome, which is weird because I never use them. \n\nAt first I brush it off, thinking that I lost the stuff and just can't remember where I put it, and that maybe I was messing with the settings and lost the pieces myself. It's not likely, but my memory is pretty bad, so I let it go. Plus, the booth was locked and the door intact, so I had no reason to believe that someone broke in. \n\nDuring the next week I lost my keys, so I was unable to do any volunteer work. I came in on Sunday to let them know, and the Pastor walks up to me and *hands me my camera*. She goes \"the office was left open, so I borrowed the camera. [Son] wants one so I wanted to see the model\". \n\nOkay. Never mind that she's seen the camera hundreds of times, but okay. Sure. So I go over to the office that was \"left open\" to find that it's locked. Weird. Maybe my partner came during the week and left it open. \n\nSo I let my partner know later on in the week and they go put it back in the office and locked it behind them. They cleaned up my \"mess\" (as they put it), and also believed that *I* must have left the door unlocked. \n\nFast forward to this Sunday. I notice that the leftmost window has screws missing. The window is loose, and I'm able to pull it away from the wall and reach my hand inside. That's when I notice that my camera is also missing. I call my partner, and they say to take picture evidence. We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him. I ask about my camera and the missing equipment, and she says that I should have kept it locked up better (?!) and that I should have come to her when I first noticed something weird. Whatever, but okay. But he still has to replace the fucking camera right? Or at least give back the one he stole? Wrong. Apparently he has \"two daughters to feed, so he can't afford to buy a thousand dollar camera\" and she \"doesn't know where it is or what he did with it\". \n\nAt this point, I have of course told them that I'm done volunteering for them. But I am torn about whether I should pursue this legally because of everything their family did for me in the past. I feel so betrayed and worthless. How could they treat me and my things with so little respect? They are supposed to be better than this. \n\n\n**tl:dr** pastors son stole my camera, they don't care. Their family took care of me when I had nowhere to go, so I'm torn about pursuing this. Advice needed.\n\nEdit: It was suggested that I add this to my post as it may clear up why I am so reluctant to involve the police:\n\nAmong other things, when I was 16, I was homeless and the pastor's family took me on for a year. They fed me and gave me a bed free of charge, and the Pastor stayed up late to make sure I had a hot meal to take to work every single day. With the exception of this incident, they have been very involved and concerned with my well being since I was a child. I feel extremely betrayed, but I am also not comfortable taking action (that involves the police) against them.  \n\nEdit 2: I'm really surprised this got so much of a response, and unfortunately although there was more sound advice than not, I'm even more confused than when I started. The overwhelming consensus seems to be to go to the police, which I am still uncomfortable with although willing to at this point. From what I'm reading, though, it seems that notifying the pastor ahead of time to see if we can find a better solution is illegal on my part, and falls under the category of extortion. \n\nI've decided that I'm just going to go to the free legal aid office near my job, as I can at the very least get free counseling in regards to this issue before I decide to involve the police. Thank you so, *so* much for your support, r/relationships I was really feeling alone and betrayed about this, and many of your answers cleared a lot up for me. \n\nThere's no way I can fit all of the details and reasoning behind my reluctance to burn this particular bridge in this one post, so I'll just say that there's more to our relationship, many gray areas, and more sensitive issues that go into this. There's no way I can respond to all of you, but I still want to thank those of you who responded. I appreciate all of the advice given (and believe me, I've read every one). ",

            ">We confront the pastor, who admits that it was her son that took it, and that she was covering for him.\n\nGreat moral role model right there. Methinks this pastor is in the wrong job. Motes and beams, motes and beams.\n\nStill:\n\n1. Police, this is simple theft. He stole, not to feed his kids, but to get a shiny toy. He fucked up. He pays the price. Let the pastor cough up for a replacement, if the pastor wants to help her kid. This is a no-brainer.\n\n2. Report the pastor to her superiors and tell them this un-edifying tale (theft, lying, deception, and if you've filed an insurance claim, fraud, not to mention crapping all over a parishioner)\n\n3. Find a new church.\n\n\nEDIT: You will note I said nothing about outing her to her parishioners or the media - that would be inappropriate and vindictive. The person to deal with this is her superior.",
            "Does the pastor know how expensive the camera and related equipment are? I have a friend who is a semi-professional photographer, he has spoken about the cost for his cameras and lens. How many months worth of paychecks did it take to purchase your camera? You should make sure the pastor realizes this is on the order of stealing a used car and not a camera the average person would buy.\n\nI wouldn't let this slide. If the camera and equipment was insured you will need a police report for the claim. You might want to let the pastor know you can't afford to just go out and buy something so expensive either. That you'll have no choice but to file a police report to replace it.\n\nPS\n\nGet one of the elders or deacons, and your partner to go with you to confront the pastor per Matthew 18:15 \u201cIf your brother sins, go and show him his fault in private; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. 16 But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you, so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed. 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.",

            "If you pursue this, it's probably the end of your volunteer position and the end of your good relationship with the family.

Repaying people's kindness is a good value to live by, and you've done a lot of photography/videography work for the church on a volunteer basis. Do you consider that to be a sufficient repayment for her kindness?\n\nPersonally, I would consider it sufficient repayment and would not feel warm to the idea of excusing the son's $1000 theft.\n\nHere is what I would do: I would contact the pastor and let her know that you don't have the $1000 to pay for the camera either, so you'll need to file a claim with your insurance, which requires a police report to be filed. \n\nYou never know. This might result in the pastor suddenly finding the $1000.",

I know you want to resolve this amicably, and they need to know that their pastor's children are breaking and entering on church property.  You could speak to them, see if they'll either put pressure on the pastor to pay or pay you out of church funds.  You can use the threat of the police report to see if that'll spur them to action.\n\nI know you feel like you owe the pastor's family, but you've paid them back through your free labor.  The fact that the pastor won't even accept responsibility and give you a real apology says a lot about her character.  \n\nIf the church won't resolve this, I think a police report is your only option. It may not get you paid but it will show her and her children that there are consequences to their actions.",

            "Pastor here, created an account after months of lurking just to say:\n\n**Aw HELL no.**\n\nPastor's son does not get a pass for stealing your camera and keeping/breaking/selling it.  It doesn't matter if they took you in when you were homeless; it doesn't matter if he's broke.  He stole from you.  On the legal side of things, he committed a crime.  On the religious side of things, he broke one of the most straightforward commandments.\n\nI'm glad your pastor was there for you when you were homeless.  But that is no excuse for letting the son off the hook.  He broke into your storage, potentially on multiple occasions, and took your belongings.\n\nI would encourage you to contact the pastor AND the son at the same time and make it very clear that you expect repayment or replacement for the stolen items.

Thing is, I highly doubt this is the first time they betrayed you and I can guarantee you that it won't be the last. At the moment, they believe that you are such a pushover that they can lie and steal from you and you will let them. This will happen again and they will respond the same way.  \n\nWhatever good relationship you had with this family before the equipment was stolen is gone now, but it wasn't you that destroyed it--remember that.

Forgive me, I am a lapsed Catholic myself, but this woman is a pastor. Isn't she supposed to be acting in the best interest of the lord? Isn't she supposed to be doing the right thing because that is what she preaches? Aside from the original conversation, where she admitted to knowing her son is a lying thief and she acted in a very un-christian-like way, have you spoken to her about how betrayed you feel? I'm trying to think of a way to resolve this without involving the police, because like I said, I wouldn't want to get them in trouble either if I were in your position. What I would do, though, is talk to her about how this whoever thing has made you feel, and how it has changed the way you see her. When it comes down to it, it sucks that you have had expensive equipment stolen, but I think what hurts you the most is that this woman that you trusted and looked up to has let you down in such a hurtful and disrespectful way. This is a woman who you saw as someone who you could look up to. A woman that you had respect for. To have her act as if this is in any way your fault, to have her so easily lie to you, treat your expensive property like it's a dollar store camera (saying her son doesn't know where he put it, no one misplaces an expensive camera they stole), to have her act in a way that is the total opposite of how you saw her, has left you feeling let down, hurt, and betrayed with good reason. It may be a good idea to talk to her about you feel. Granted, it probably won't get your back or the money to replace it, but maybe she'll hear what you ate saying and realize just how wrongly she has handled the whole situation. \n\nFrom the little information you've given, about her taking you in when you were younger, she seems like a decent person at heart. Sometimes good people do stupid things. Sometimes they make bad choices. Or handle things the exact wrong way. Sometimes, when that happens, they need someone to point out that their actions are hurtful. So, maybe try sitting with her and talking to her. Explain that you are upset, and why you're upset. Explain that you're hesitant to involve the authorities because of how much you respect and care for her. That you understand she is trying to protect her son, but as a pastor she should understand why that may not be the right thing to do. Appeal to her senses of right and wrong. Appeal to her knowledge of the bible. Most of all, though, let her know that she hurt you by acting in a way that is so at odds with how she has always taught others to act. Maybe if you are able to at least speak to her about this situation and let her know how hurt you are by her and her sons actions, and why, *you* will feel a bit better. Best case scenario, she has an \"a-ha!\" moment, and either finds your equipment and gives it back or pays to replace it. Worst case scenario, she reacts the same as the first time and you see that she isn't the person you thought she was. In that case, even though she did help you out as a teen, you should contact a lawyer and figure out how to get compensation for your stolen equipment. If that's the way it has to go, then she isn't someone who deserves your kindness anymore.",

Possibly another paster she's well acquainted to, and talk about the same issue again. \n\nIf that doesn't work, ask her to bring her son, and see if he doesn't admit having it. If he does, say that you need to have it back now, and follow him to his house. If he doesn't, request the pastor to do a full house search (without him) immediately because you don't want to escalate things any further, you just need the camera back. Oh yes, if you can, record all of your interactions secretly. It may become useful.\n\nI agree with you that going to the police may not be the best solution here to get your equipment back, it's very easy to hide if he needs to. What he did was a crime, think of what you think is the best solution to get your camera back. Pretend you didn't know about extortion too.",
            "The sad truth is if you file a police report, they will probably lie for the son. Then it's your word against his, with no real evidence. If the police want to question the son or his parents all they have to say is \"I don't want to talk about it\" and they don't have to say anything to the police. The police aren't going to charge him for theft with no evidence and they aren't going to get a warrant to search for your camera based on this. The most the police could or would do in this situation is go over there and ask for the camera back, but if the kid doesn't want to give it back he can just say he doesn't have it, and doesn't know what you're talking about. Basically it sucks, but there's not much you can do but always keep your camera at home and get insurance on it. Sorry. ",
            "Get the police involved, make the son buy you a new camera and tell them \"God will provide for his family\".",
            "The biggest crooks you will ever meet hide behind the cloak of Christianity, and I speak from experience that if it isn't nailed down in a church, it WILL get stolen.   If your church has a business committee, you need to take this matter to them and go from there.  ",

            "What does God have to say about all this?",
            "Enough with the bible verses as guidance and this gingerly attitude.   Pardoning them because they're \"good Christian pastors\" is exactly why people like them get away with murder. \n\n1 Timothy 2:11-15 \n\n*\"A woman[a] should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man;[b] she must be quiet. 13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. 15 But women[c] will be saved through childbearing\u2014if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety\"*\n\nHow lovely.  She shouldn't even hold a pastoral position according to the good book. She's nothing more than an incubator and that son of hers who stole from you is the key to her salvation. \n\nNow use your brain, not the bible, and go get your camera back.",
            "I think you're out a camera.  I understand not wanting to go to the police.",
            "You have really got to applaud the kid for not giving up.  He really wanted that camera and he got it.\n\nMaybe buy a new camera and then put the pastor on a payment plan that he can afford to pay you back?",
            "Idk if you'll read this, and it probably won't be a very popular opinion, but considering what they did for you at the age of 16, and considering what just occurred with the theft of your camera, I'd say you call it even and end your relationship with that church.",
            "Out of consideration for what they did for you in years past, I'd just let it alone.  And, of course, stop volunteering.  \n\nIn my opinion, this is a hidden side of being poor that few people talk about openly.  If you're poor, there are a lot of poor people down on their luck in your family and/or community and I'm not excusing theft but a lot of time there is a choice whether to burn bridges or let it go.  I bet this happens a lot of the time and more wealthy people wonder \"why can't poor people just get a job\" and a lot of times they do get a job and are called on to help support or forgive theft from other members of their families or communities rather than go to the cops.  \n\nAgain, I'd just chalk it up to experience and let it go.  ",
            "I wouldn't file a police report. Take this as you paying them back in full.",
            "I know you must feel betrayed, and that is an awful feeling. You didn't deserve that.\n\nAs for the cost of the camera - consider it a payment for all they did for you, and walk away. Go low or no contact. ",
            "I'm in the minority, but given your background with the family I would let this go if I were you. I don't necessarily call the cops when a family member steals from me. ",
            "It's spelled R\u00d8DE, not RODE.",
            "I would again try to convince them to get you to pay for it or return the camera.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, and considering the info in your edit, I would then just cut contact with all of them. \n\nIn the future if you own valuable equipment, keep it kept securely in your own house. Leaving your expensive personal property longterm in the \"media department\" was a bit of a recipe for disaster TBH."

People have all sort of disabilities, this is mine and it's not the worst thing in the world.\n\nMy problem is dating.

Should I tell her now? Should I wait a little longer? How should I tell her? Just an honest conversation and telling them directly, which is what I've been doing so far?\n\nI'm a little disappointed with my past experiences. I know and have accepted what this situation means for me in terms of sexual life, but I'm coming to the understanding that this might even mean I can't even have relationships, which isn't what I was expecting. \n\n**tl;dr**: I'm confused about how to communicate to potential partners about the fact that I don't have a penis.

Maybe is not something you tell on the first date of course, but not everyone could handle it and it's not fair to hold the truth for too long.\n\nYou can still have a healthy sex life even with your disability, don't forget that.",
            "Hi OP,\n\nOther have given some good advice so I'm going to go down a different route... \n\nHave you cut sex out of your life completely? Or are you still active? I mean, you have your fingers and tongue and there are ALL kinds of toys out there. I don't know if you're into this at all but I know a lot of women are into pegging and might even be turned on by your situation. \n\nCheck out /r/sex if you have any questions or feel like you need advice.\n\nSecondly, how you present the situation is important. If you DO wish to be sexually active then I suggest saying something like;\n\n\"There's something I need to tell you, I was involved in an unfortunate accident when I was younger and now I don't have a penis. This is something I have accepted and come to terms with myself and I understand you may need some time to do the same. Before you go and have a think about how you would like to proceed, let me tell you that I am still very interested in sexual activities, I can give oral like nobody else and I'm willing to play with dildo's / strapons. I'd really like for us to try this out and see how it goes, if it doesn't work out, then no hard feelings, I'll be content that we tried. I'll give you as much time as you need to think this over.\"\n\nI wish you the best of luck OP!",

            "It's tough. Disabilities (of all sorts) make dating much more difficult. I have a friend who is paralyzed and he knows that he is rejected on the basis of his disability by 90% of potential partners. Your disability is more hidden and affects your day to day life less, but is perhaps even a more deal breaker when it comes to dating and relationships.\n\nI don't have a golden solution for you but I wish you luck and I think it's fair in general to tell them early on, to avoid wasting their and more importantly your time and avoid emotional attachments and potential breakup problems.",
            "As a transman I can sympathize. With your current girlfriend rather than just telling her maybe you could turn it into an open conversation right off the bat. \"I really like you and I'd like to have sex with you. Unfortunately I was in an accident as a child that makes sex difficult... I can't do [specific sex acts] but I am happy to do [other sex acts] or experiment. Would you be comfortable with trying this with me?\" Worst case it's a dealbreaker and the relationship ends, best case you give her a chance to have an honest discussion on what she wants from sex and see if it's compatible with you. Good luck.",
            "There is, unfortunately, no magic way of conveying this information that wont scare off a lot of women.  The reason for your past experiences isnt the way you tell people, its that most people want penetrative sex as part of a relationship.\n\nThis DOESNT mean you are doomed to repeating this experience over and over however - you just need to be more selective about who you date. I would highly recommend looking into support groups for Vaginissimus sufferers (for whom penatrative sex is painful) or even asexual people who are not aromantic and telling your story there.  \n\nAs odd as it sounds, there is a lot of sense in trying to date women who have their own disability which will make them compatible or at least understanding of yours.\n\nI do think not telling girls fairly early on (a few dates at most) is pretty unreasonable.  A month is a long time!\n\nPS: Out of interest, is there a reason you dont want the fairly common and effective surgery to give you a prosthetic penis or even a transplant? ",
            "Well dude, it is pretty complicated.\n\nIn my case, I Have HIV, and normally go trough something similar, like \"When is a good time to tell them?\" \"Why if they run away ?\" \"what if I wait too long and they see me as a liar?\".\n\nIn my case, all the girls I have tol about my condition have been ok, I normally wait for a few dates, and when things start getting sexual I will have the talk with them, they deserve to know before there is anything sexual happen. \n\nSo , just be honest, and I think it is great you are ok with this and have come to accept it.\n\nBonus question : Can you ejaculate? are kids an option?\n\nAlso, read out the \"She Comes first\" book, and get your tongue and finger game to the next level, I bet there are tons of toys that can help you penetrate them if needed. ",
            "This isn't very helpful to you right now but might be in the future - have you considered seeking out bi/pansexual partners? I'm pansexual, which means I'm attracted to people of all genders. This includes men without 'traditional' penises (ie usually trans men but obviously there are lots of cis men without penises too.) A woman who's dated women and/or men without penises before might be less likely to walk out. I know for a fact I wouldn't walk out on you based on your genitals and I'm horrified and saddened that this has been a repeating experience for you. ",
            "I personally wouldn't care as long as you're willing to use a strap on at least some of the time. So maybe she's the same.  What a woman hears when you tell them you don't have a penis is that you can't have \"regular\"sex and can't have kids. But if you went into the conversation explaining the important parts as well I would lead with those.\n\n\nAnd not to make light of your situation but I would play up the fact that she would have the option of having sex with any kind of penis she liked. She could choose! Big? HUGE? Vibrating? Made of glass? Made of rotating pearls? Unlimited options and she'd never have to worry about the toy competing with your penis and making you feel insecure because you'd be the source of all the \n\nIf she doesn't go for it there's definitely someone out there who will. Maybe it's time you joined a dating website specifically for people with alternative sexual lifestyles. If she for whatever reason doesn't want to continue a relationshis you should consider fetlife or something similar but for actually dating someone.\n\n\nInstead of dating someone who you have to \"break the news\" to you could date someone who already knows from  when you spoke online and see if they are compatible in others areas of your life. \n\n\nGood luck with this girl. I hope she can see that while you not having a penis is a hurdle its not the end of the line. Im at least one heterosexual female who wouldn't balk if confronted with this situation.",
            "Hey, are you interested in phalloplasty? I'm a nurse, one of my friends is a urologist who can help you have a sensate penis you can pee from  and have sex with. There's like 5 guys doing this work in the USA. HMU for referral info.",
            "Side question: how much of a sense of humor do you have about this? I ask because I wonder how many women leave because of being *uncomfortable*, as opposed to the lack of possibilities. A sense of humor about this would help with discomfort. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that intimacy depends on a shared frame of mind, not the presence of genitalia.",
            "so i'm a guy without a penis too, except i'm transgender so it's not due to an accident. whenever i date people (men in my case) i have to tell them that my genitals are not what they are expecting at some point.\n\nfor me, i wait to tell people until it is clear to me that this person is interested in things becoming sexual. this can be as early as a first date or as late as a few weeks in - it really depends on the person and how fast things move. i dont tell people before that because i dont want to waste the stress of disclosing on someone who would turn out not to be interested anyway. sometiems its been as late as right before sex, sometimes earlier, sometimes its resutled in a long conversation, sometimes it hasnt cos they dont really care at all. you have to adjust to the other person i think.\n\ni dont want people to think that i am not interested in a sexual relationship with them if i am, so if its looking like things are heading that way and i am interested, that is when i will tell them. however, you may feel differently - you might want to tell people you want to take it slow or not. that's up to you. \n\nthe problem is is that the longer you wait, and the longer both of have to build an emotional attachment to eachother, the higher the stakes get for telling someone. you may find this builds a bond that allows you to overcome your disability, or you may find that you end up really liking someone and more hurt if it ends badly. so thats the disadvantage.\n\nyou havent really said here whether you want to have sex with people, or whether youre interested in using prosthetics etc to still have the experience of fucking someone (it's still fun i promise, even though i know its not the same). when you tell girls, are you taking penetrative sex off the table, or are you open minded to trying stuff to make it work for both of you? as i think thats important. and i think your disclosure needs to discuss exactly what you are and aren't ok with, so it's not just left for them to assume how sex is going to look with you.\n\ni think honestly the important thing is you do what makes you comfortable. you are the one who has to deal with this disability for the rest of your life - the other person can totally forget about this if they want to stop dating and move on, but it's your life, so you have to find a way that works for you.",
            "How would you imagine your sexual life?\n\nI think it's fair enough to not tell girls at the very first moment. Everyone presents their best side at first when dating, and for a good reason. What people think might be deal breakers before they start dating turns out to not be that crucial after getting to know someone a bit better. That's why people with huge lists of checkboxes for their future partner to tick don't do so well.\n\nAnyway, it's a tough choice. I'd say tell her when things are leading up to sex. Give her a little time to process, but be confident with her that even without a penis you can still make her feel amazing in bed.",
            "Hey bro, \n\nFirst off, that really sucks dude I can't imagine all the different levels this must affect you on. I honestly don't know how you should approach this situation but I just wanted to share something with you that maybe will help. \n\nMy girlfriend has issues with penetration pain. We've tried a lot of different positions, lubes, toys... A lot of stuff, but even 1 finger inside there feels like I'm ripping her apart. We've come to terms with the fact that we just can't have sex anymore, but that in no way means we don't have an amazing sex life. There are other things that can be done to scratch that intimacy itch. \n\nI've always felt everyone on reddit makes way too big of a deal about sex,  like oh your sex life is bad? You need to break up! Your injury is a serious hurtle to get over as far as relationships go, but you're not a lost cause. Casual dating is going to be hard for you but when the right girl comes along she's going to love you for you, not for your dick. ",
            "Something you don't mention in this post makes me wonder if you tell this to your female partners - you say your testicles are intact, does that mean you can still have children? Because while I understand that you are young and so children aren't necessarily on your mind, a prospective partner might plan them for the future. So if you're not sterile - or if you are - I think it's important that you clarify this when disclosing. You don't want a girl to leave because she thinks she can't have children with you when that possibility actually still exists.",

            "The closest thing I can relate this to is I once dated a girl who couldn't have piv sex because of a condition that made it extremely painful. She told me this sometime after the first time I slept over. She showed me a very good time that night in other ways and then dropped the bomb a few days later before the next time I came over. At that point I was pretty understanding :) I don't know if trying the same would work for you.\n\nYou can't really hide it (well... I guess you can, read up on Billy Tipton), but you can still show a girl a good time. I know a couple girls that would probably be OK with this as long as you knew how to make up for it and you had some man-made hardware to help.",
            "I feel like this is something that FTM transgender people deal with, when they pass as men, want to date people who are interested in men, but do not have a penis. There are women who are specifically not interested in this, but there are also women who specifically are. Some women are attracted to men but do not like penetrative sex. Other women may be fine with using a strap on. But I would focus on finding a dating pool in which people may be specifically attracted to your condition, and be upfront about your situation.",
            "I would just like to add my two cents to say that I, personally, don't think I would care. I'm a woman who isn't totally thrilled by penetrative sex, and if I was, you could strap on a penis of any size I desired. \n\nThat does not seem like a bad deal",
            "I know of a few girls (not many, but a few I've met over the years) that are in their 20's and 30's and are still virgins because the idea of a penis in them is terrifying. They don't enjoy sex or are too scared to attempt it. Some like to be fingered, and some like oral, but all of them would prefer a relationship and/or marriage without sex. \nI know this doesn't help with your current problem, but if she does walk away, you might consider trying online dating or something with that in mind. \"Looking for a Woman that Doesn't Need PIV Sex\" or something like that. They're out there, I promise. ",
            "The first thing that came to my mind (after, damn that sucks) is that in the chance this relationship doesn't work out, that perhaps you look into an asexual partner. There are people out there who want a romantic relationship without the sex aspect. I don't know what level of intimacy you are seeking, but I know there are people out there who would be happy to be with you because there wouldn't be the pressure of sex on the table. That being said, there are different kinds of sexual intimacy, and I'm sure that even without a penis you're like any other human and need something.\n\n\nOther than that, I'm not much help. :( sorry. ",
            "There are already numerous comments, but I'll throw in my two cents.  \n\nFirst, there are many people out there who won't care about this issue.  Some will, so perhaps you need to have a thick skin about it, but be confident that there is someone out there for you.  I knew a guy about 15 years ago who had recently been in an automobile accident, which left him a quadriplegic... I just saw a newspaper article and he was married with two kids and doing exceptionally well. So, be confident, stiff upper lip and all that.\n\nSecond, practically speaking, you will need to find a plan that works for you.  \n\nMy first thought was to find someone that is pansexual (which I used to think was a silly term to distinguish from 'bisexual', but your case is an example where there is an important difference between the two).  \n\nMy second thought would be to find a woman who doesn't care about penetration -- there are many.  \n\nMy third thought would be to think about having an open relationship so she can have sex with a penis if she wants.  \n\nThese are all just suggestions.  The key point is that you have to find something that works for you and your future partner.  We have this silly notion that love and sex are coupled together, but they don't have to be.  Also, sex can mean many things other than penis-in-vagina and a lot of women/people know that. You have many options... you'll be fine. \n\nMy final thought is that you have been doing just fine with communicating the lack of penis issue.  ",
            "Op - I knew someone like you. After he finally found a girl he was smitten for he killed himself because he caught her cheating. It wasn't so much that as it was a lifetime of rejection, I think. I don't know.\n\nBut, he died before internet dating was a thing. I've always wished he could have dated online - with that feature immediately out in the open. He was a great guy. And, doing that could have attracted so many great women who, for whatever reasons, didn't want PIV sex. \n\nI worry about you. Constant rejection is soul destroying. You need to tell her now. But, from here on out, you need to research out specialty dating sites and be open from the start. It will save you so much heart ache. ",
            "My husband is an FTM. When we met, we both felt an immediate connection to one another. He told me the day after our first date, and I wasn't phased. If he would have waited a while, I might have been less amenable.\n\nDo it fast if you think it's going somewhere.",
            "I think you need to continue telling them early on. There's actually a documentary, I believe it's called \"the man without a penis\", about a man who also does not have one. I think it may have been a birth defect? Anyway he kept it from his fiancee for TWO YEARS. When she finally found out she was absolutely outraged and called off their engagement. But not because he didn't have a penis, but because he lied to her by omission and she had to find out from someone else. Had she known from the beginning, she wouldn't have cared. It was the secrecy she was upset about. Don't be that guy, be upfront. \n\n\nETA: The man's name is Andrew Wardle in case anyone wants to search for the documentary. I am at work and don't want to sift through TLC documentaries right now.",
            "Telling someone at about a month in seems right to me. How you frame it will make a difference - if you act like it's a bad thing then it may feel like one to her. I think perhaps have the usual sex talk, and then you can say that you lost your penis in an accident so when it comes to sex if she wants much penetration you'll have to sit down and pick out some fun toys together. Sure, you don't have a penis, but you have tons of different toys to pick from that offer more penetration than fingers.\n\nThere are so many men out there who have lost their penises or weren't even born with one. It doesn't mean you can't have a happy  relationship or sex life, and if you have a prostate then perhaps you can still have orgasms from that, lots of women are into that.\n\nIt will likely be unexpected, but if she loves you and wants to be with you it may not matter at all. To a lot of women it wouldn't.",
            "i have some unrelated questions about your condition if i may ",
            "The longer you the wait the more unfair you are being to the both of you. Even on a first date as awkward as it sounds you could just preface it with. \"I know this will seem odd and out of the blue but I must be forward about this. When I was young I was in an accident that left me without a penis. If this is a deal breaker for you that's fine I'd just like to clear that up before either of us get to invested in the other. Thanks.\"\n",
            "I think it's in her best interest to tell her quickly. Let's be real here. This could be a deal breaker for quite a lot of people. And it's unfair to be in a relationship with someone who's 'hiding' something that could really affect whether or not she wants to continue the relationship. It's tough on you to have this conversation early and I get that but I think it's most fair to the other party to have this convo as soon as it's obvious the relationship might continue beyond a couple casual dates.",
            "You're asking when to tell, but I think you should also consider how to tell.\n\nIn other words, phrase it the right way: If you come across like you're ashamed, embarrassed, and sure that you're letting her down, she's going to take it as something tragic. But if you come across like you're confident, self-assured, and sure that you can still satisfy her sexually, she's going to take it pretty well if she's the right woman for you.\n\nSo, once you've reached the point where it seems like physical intimacy is going to happen reasonably soon, just say, \"I wanted to let you know that I lost most of my penis in an accident. I've made peace with it; this is not the worst thing in the world. I also want you to know that you and I can still have a fulfilling sex life if our relationship reaches that point, which I hope it does. I'll take my time with my tongue and my fingers in a way most men won't because they're too eager to stick their dicks in you.\"\n\nI hope that works for you. I assure you, there are plenty of women out there who will be cool with a man who doesn't have a penis.",
            "You know, it's funny. I've always believed that the key to true success (sexsess? sucsex? there's definitely a pun in there somewhere...) was learning how to use everything but your penis to pleasure a woman; learning all of the hot-spots on her, learning how to use your tongue, fingers, different temperatures, when and where to bite... That sort of thing.\n\n\nWhat a lot of other people here have said is that you can definitely still have a sex life. It's true, it will mostly be about making your partner happy. But believe me, there's a lot of pleasure to be had from that! You can still be a sexual person! Learn tips! Learn tricks! Get some toys!

If it's 2-3 dates in but no intimacy yet, when you tell a woman, my feeling is it gives her an easy out - I wasn't going to sleep with this guy yet, and now he has this disability, it makes it so easy to bail without even considering the rest of your qualities and that there's other ways to be intimate with a person other than PIV penetration. I do think it's wrong to lead people on endlessly by hiding the truth, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having a few more dates with this girl, and when it becomes apparent that intimacy is entering the relationship, to say that you need to have a serious chat.

More importantly, telling them is a win-win for you - either they're the kind of women who you deserve to be with, or they aren't, and this is the litmus test.\n\nMy advice for telling them would be to do it when the physical part of the relationship is obviously getting to a place where being naked is the next-step. So during a hot-and-heavy makeout,\n\n1) End the makeout gracefully - Pull back with a satisfied smile, say you need a short break. Offer to get her a drink.\n\n2) Tell her that you like her and love getting physical with her, and you need to tell her something.\n\n3) Tell her.\n\nThis kind of conversation is something that a lot of people have to do. If you're mature adults, that's (at the latest) when you have the STI conversation - you disclose any STIs that you have, and ask them if they get tested, and discuss use of condoms etc.\n\nAND this should also be the point where the two of you are talking about what kind of sex you're going to have.

Some women even find P-in-V painful. So there are a plethora of women for whom you have all of the critical tools for sex.\n\nAnd if you meet a great woman, and she's into you, and she needs vaginal stimulation, she'll probably be a fan of sites like Oh Joy Sex Toy, and you can have tons of fun in the bedroom with all kinds of toys. :)\n\nGood luck!",

Do you ask them if they would like anything explained?  Do you drop the bombshell and then close off because you've had so many bad experiences?

Trying to hide it most likely will end up with them more pissed/annoyed that you were hiding it than being upfront about it. The sooner the better.

Also give them space. Its something they are going to have to think about and make a decision for themselves. However sex is more than just PIV and make it clear that the two of you can still have a intimate relationship and connection physically it just will be with a strap on/prosthetic. There is also other methods that don't even involve a phallus that the two of you would be able to explore and have fun together with.

Depending on the people and the couple, that may be the first date or it may be a few months down the line. Either way, when you're just getting to know someone and starting to get comfortable, that's not a good time to start talking about your junk... normal or otherwise. When the topic of bumping uglies comes up or she makes a move or you are ready to progress to the sexual phase of the relationship and suspect she will be generally receptive to some mutual diddling, tell her. Don't grovel or apologize or be negative. Tell her that while your sex life may vary from the usual way of doing things, you'll make sure she isn't missing out on anything and you can show her how she can please you too.\n\nOr maybe even show her... if she gets frisky and you go to town on her she'll probably be more receptive to the whole \"btw, no wang\" thing than if you drop the bomb on her cold. Women get the warm and fuzzies after orgasms. It would be a good time. \n\nIf it were me,  I'd be less concerned about my own pleasure (most women I know get a lot more pleasure from non-weiner body parts than the actual weiner), it would be more about not knowing how to get you off. Men are (generally) simple to get revved up. While I'm sure many guys love sensual foreplay, most of us women are used to grabbing the dick, fondling the dick, and inserting the dick into the hole of choice when we're taking the reins, with no complaints from the dude. It would take some retraining to get what feels good for you, but as long as the communication is open there is no reason it has to be \"disabled sex\". \n\nYou seem to have a good attitude about your situation, and I'm sorry you dealt with women in the past who weren't able to see past the shock of the initial information to realize that a different way of doing things doesn't equal a bad or uncomfortable way of doing things.",

It just seems to me that women in these communities will be more expecting to have conversations about sexual likes, dislikes, abilities, disabilities, etc. than in the general population, who would take PIV as the assumed norm and would be more open-minded. You could put right on a Fetlife profile what your situation is and I'm sure there would be women who think it's hot, or don't want PIV, etc. If you had kink skills, good social skills, I bet you could even get quite a kink reputation in that community-- a guy who is a good dom, treats women nicely and doesn't ask for PIV might be quite the catch there.",

On the assumption that what you want is a monogamous relationship, a future means a lifetime of never having traditional sex again...which is a heavy burden on a new relationship that doesn't have a strong foundation yet. If you wait the months or years for deep attachment to set in before revealing your situation, the relationship will struggle with trust and anger issues on top of everything else. \n\nMy thoughts are that the best time to reveal your situation is at the gates, before the first date.

But having no penis doesn't mean you can't have a sex life, I totally wouldn't mind if a guy was wearing a strap on for example. Some women might want kids, and if they aren't open to adoption, this could be complicated, but with the advances in fertility science, not having a penis really wouldn't keep you from that issue either.\n\nMy only thought for myself would be, I mean, are you able to feel arousal at all, do you still have nerves in that area? I could handle a guy wearing a strap on instead of having a real penis, but if he doesn't get aroused and isn't \"into it\" I would very quickly want to end things because that would bother me if I was the only one getting off.\n\nEither way, this is a huge thing, I don't think you should prevent telling someone for fear they might not want to continue, you should definitely tell them especially once you are at a natural point in dating where it's time to start kissing, making out, etc. If they break it off, then it's understandable and realistically probably for the best, no point in building up a relationship only to have it fall apart later once this issue arises, best to be honest and straightforward  early on.

The kind of people you might be looking for will be the same kind of people that would date a trans man with no hangups.\n\nI think if you find yourself failing over and over you need to adjust your expectations in partners. A lot of straight women just need cock. It's not a failing on their part to want a hard dick inside them, and it's not an insult to you if they dump you because of it. You're just sexually incompatible. But there are plenty of women who, through either sexual preference or physical impairment themselves, don't need a dick to be sexually fulfilled. \n\nFind them. Figure out where they are and find them. An OKCupid profile that explicitly states your issue up front, and looking for bi/pan women is probably your best bet.\n\n",

            "A) I'd like any guy who claims relationships are only about sex for men to read this. \n\nB) I don't think it is disingenuous of you at all to not bring this up right away. Guys don't bring up if they are cut or not right away (unless you're on a hook up app...). \n\nC) Once you think things are moving into serious territory with this girl, I'd sit her down and have a talk about it. Explain that there are plenty of other ways you could make her happy (I'm assuming you didn't lose your hands or tongue in this accident?), including going to the toy shop together to buy her idealized member if you'd both be into that. Of course you don't have to go into details right away, just confirm that you understand she has sexual desires and you are totally happy to meet them (if you in fact are). You could even make some jokes about it to break the ice if you're comfortable like \"look on the bright side! No bjs!\" (assuming that isn't possible of course). \n\nD) If you don't enjoy sexual contact at all (I'm guessing there are things you can still do to get off, though I won't go into assumptive detail) you could consider dating an asexual. There are people who genuinely who have no interest in sex, but some still want a romantic relationship. \n\nE) There's also the possibility of having an open relationship. I know, I know - people think monogamy is the only option. But if you enjoy spending time with someone and maybe aren't able to meet 100% of their needs sexually, maybe you could consider polyamory. Of course it would take a lot of time feeling out the relationship (no pun intended) and knowing the person really well to even bring this up but...\n\nBest of luck to you. Also huge kudos for coming to terms with something like this. ",

I've had 4 girls that I've dated semi-seriously to seriously and none of them walked away, all but one were a little shocked.  \n\nThe one that wasn't shocked looked me up online and put 2 and 2 together and was waiting to see how long it took me to bring it up. That fact that I told her on the second date made her extremely happy and she said it made me even more trustworthy and to a lot of women that's more important than most things. \n\nI know it's not the same as losing your penis but I still can relate to the fear of a very hefty secret. \n\nSide note, I have a friend who has a penis that can't still up longer than a minute (due to an accident) and he just got engaged so I think you may be fine.

The appropriate moment to tell someone you have a fake dick would be once you know them better.  \n  \nIn your condition though I think you ARE unfortunately right that the majority of girls would not be interested in a relationship with you. Think about it. What would you do in their position? Especially at your age. I know there are alternatives to sex or even getting children, but it's not that easy to convince someone it's worth a shot so to speak, so not telling them might be one way, but it's not a very nice way and I'd assume that more often than not you would upset your potential partners, who are already emotionally invested in you.  \n  \nThink of the transgender problem. You're a guy dating a woman and 2 months later you find out she has balls and a dick...some might accept that, but I strongly believe the vast majority of people would walk away, feeling betrayed.  \n  \nSo, if a new penis is not an option, in my opinion you should look online, maybe there are special forums or boards for people with certain disabilities looking for a partner to share their life with, or if you meet someone you need to be honest with them from the start...that may be extremely difficult, but it's the right thing to do, and yes, most will walk away, but maybe they won't hate you and tell everyone you don't have a dick to make fun of you or get some \"revenge\"...that being said, you never know how people will react.  \n  \nObviously this topic could use a lot more discussion.

            "I really don't know and perhaps this is going to end up being shallow advice, but first let me explain why I might not want to date someone who didn't have a penis. It's not just that penetrative sex will never happen, it's the emotional aspect of your condition that will really get to me. One of the worst things I could imagine ever happening to a guy happened to you... I feel sick to my stomach when I hear of wives cutting of men's penises for cheating. I mean- they can never get that back and so much of what a man is(whether this is correct or not, we can all thank media, society, etc.), is tied up with his sexuality and his sexual organ, ability to perform, how big he is, etc.\nThere is also a lot of shame... in the same way that some men might be concerned about having a small penis, a lot of women might be embarrassed if others knew that their partner had a small penis or in your case, no penis at all.\nMy SO for example is not circumcised and I am completely fine with that and in fact prefer it... but where we live, it is not the norm and if anyone knew he would be laughed at and there would be gossip about it and it would become some sort of running joke. I just know it. And even though I'm the type of person who doesn't care what others think it would still affect me to some extent... I don't want anyone to think of my SO as dirty or whatever even though I know their opinions are based on ignorance.\n\n\nI'd also be worried about not being able to make love... to never have that feeling. I might imagine that we could simply have oral sex, use dildos, etc. I mean, that's what lesbians do and they seem to do just fine. But the thing that would bother me the most is the fact that I would not be able to pleasure *you*. Or could I? I would want to know. And then, if I wanted to have kids... could we? Even if we were just getting to know each other I would likely immediately begin to think of all these things... which is not fair, I know. \n\n\nNow let me tell you what might make it okay for me to be with someone who didn't have a penis... perhaps if we were friends first and that is how he approached it even though there is obvious attraction. Because then he'd have a reason to trust me and open up to me... it would give me time to digest the information, ask questions, and think about it without the pressure of having to decide then and there if this is a man I could be with romantically now or even for the rest of my life.  It would give me time to look beyond feeling sorry for you and would give you the time to remind me that there is so much more to you (and men) than penises.\n\n\nFor this current girl, maybe the first thing you need to do is reassure her when you first explain your condition... tell her that you are emotionally fine with what happened to you. Focus on the reasons why it hasn't been such a bad thing after all (even if it has been?) and try to focus on the positives... because I don't even know what to do with that information and I think that I would have so many inappropriate questions. You might as well go right in and be an open book... not every girl is the same but I know that if it were me, your being super open and honest about it would be a relief and would break the ice. If you are already at this point, talk about how great you are at oral and everything else. Maybe you can make little jokes like you would give a lesbian a run for her money? Sorry if that's a stupid suggestion, I am slightly reaching, but I am genuinely thinking of things that might make it easier for me to learn about this from someone I was interested in. She might appreciate it if you tell her that anytime she has a concern or something pops up about it in her head, to go ahead and ask you... that it isn't some awkward unmentionable thing.\nBut basically address all concerns she might have... as weird as it might be to talk about something so private with someone new, it might help. Women might be walking away because there is so much unknown and they just don't want to deal with that.\n\n\nIf there is any bonus information or hope- like the possibility of reconstructive surgery, go ahead and mention it. It might not be something you want but it might place a kind of bookmark in her head for you and will allow her to be more accepting of the current situation if you offer some kind of hypothetical solution.\nIn the meantime she can get to know you and you have time to show other aspects of you that don't have anything to do with your penis.\n\n\nIf this girl doesn't work out... there are many women out there who have different needs. Not everyone is interested in a penis. Perhaps someone who is bisexual would be more open to dating you, for example. Or someone who is A-sexual. I imagine that you would be the ideal partner to someone like that... although, if you like to give pleasure then that wouldn't be ideal for you.\nI think that you will eventually find women who will be willing to get to know you more... you are still young and I commend you for being so brave and straightforward about your situation to women you are dating. I think you are doing the right thing, you just haven't run into the right person yet. Who knows, this one might be it. If not, just keep going. :)"

        "selftext": "Posting this in personal issues because so far it feels more like a personal issue to me. \n\nYesterday afternoon I came home from work early because I wasn't feeling well. I assumed my husband Jake (5 years married) was at work still because it was early in the day. I went upstairs to our bedroom to take a nap and I caught him trying to stuff my diary back into its hiding place. Shocked, I asked him what he was doing. at first he said nothing and he was cleaning our room and found it and was about to put it back. but he was fidgety and I knew he was lying. I pressed on it more and asked if he was really reading my diary, like seriously...?, and I felt so weird saying that. It reminded me of the time my mom ready my diary when I was 13 and I caught her. I felt like a kid all over again with my privacy being invaded and being secretly judged. \n\nEventually he admitted that yes he had been reading it. I was hurt and still am. My diary is sacred to me and always has been. It's the one place I feel I can truly open up and be myself. I questioned him even more about it and he admitted he'd been doing this consistently for three years. He said he started doing it after my dad died because he was worried about me. The time was rough for me sure but I wasn't depressed. It was my dads time to go after a long battle with cancer and I knew it was coming. I don't think my behavior changed drastically enough to warrant my husband to invade my privacy and read my diary. \n\nHe said once he got started he couldn't stop it and it was addicting. He even admitted to have some pages photocopied. on the photocopied pages he would make notes and draw question marks. I noticed one or two of the question marks were drawn around entries and paragraphs where I talk about going out with my friends or seeing my family. I asked him why on earth he would draw question marks around that. Did he not trust me? I was so confused. He then deflected and snatched the booklet with the photocopies from my hand and said that I should not be so upset about this. Husbands and wives should share everything and I shouldn't be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he's just concerned about me. \n\nMy thing is, he invaded my privacy. I'm my own person apart from him... Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely... I can't even have that? I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids. I've already given up a lot of my life since I got married. I don't see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can't be attached to single life anymore. I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous. I don't know. I'm just getting sad writing this. Writing in my diary was one of the only things I had left and now it's been taken from me. I've been so sad I can't even process it. \n\nI don't know reddit. Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I'm overreacting and I'm sure that's what you're thinking right now. Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world. I used to have so many friends and hobbies and I feel like since getting married things have changed so much. My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive. \n\nI can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. I don't know how I truly feel yet about this diary thing. I feel like my privacy has been extremely invaded. It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won't even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I'll be okay. That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.. He wants me to stay home for fourth of July and not go anywhere and rest instead. I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back. \n\nI just needed to vent I guess. If you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Would you consider this a major breech of privacy or no big deal? Do you think I'm depressed ? :( \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: my husband has been reading my diary and more than anything I am just filled with sadness and regret. ",

            "What you've written is basically a step by step guide on how to ease a woman into an abusive relationship without her even realizing it.\n\nWhatever you do, don't give up your source of income, and for the love of God, don't get pregnant.  ",
            "Don't quit your job and double up on your birth control. Your post is full of abuse red flags - trying to make you financially dependent on him, alienating you from your friends, making you give up hobbies that take you outside of the home - and now this. It sounds like he's reading it for ammunition to see how to control you better. ",
            "Your entire post filled me with anxious nausea.\n\nThis guy doesn't have your best interests at heart. \n\nPeople are recommending marriage counseling. **I can't agree.**\n\nYou are already being isolated and stripped of your joys (out of \"concern\"? Hah). He is already in the process of easing you into abuse normalization. You are scared of his response if you left. \n\nAt this point, I honestly think marriage counseling would help him wound you more deeply. ",
            "I agree with everyone else - he is controlling and abusive and this will likely escalate if you stay. \n\nI just wanted to add: he's been secretly reading your diary for years, with such obsession he photocopies it, so *you need to clear your browser history and make sure he can't find this post*. I would honestly be surprised if he doesn't snoop on your computer given the rest of his behaviour. Consider googling to find a program which searches for keyloggers as well. Good luck, I hope everyone has helped you see what is going on here. ",
            "I don't tell this story often because it's so painful even still. My ex husband read my journals when we were married, towards the end. He not only read them, he copied them and gave them to his divorce attorney to use against me in court. It was pretty much my only healthy emotional outlet, and he took it away from me. We've been divorced over a decade, and I've never been able to write a single word since then. It was such an enormous violation, my only truly safe space to sort out my thoughts and emotions, and it was the moment I knew for sure our marriage was over. \n\nHere's what I see: He wasn't just skimming them to be sure you were OK, to check up on you, to see what you really thought of him, and so on. He made copies. He made *notes.* Snooping is absolutely not OK, but making copies and notes on it is absolutely beyond normal human weakness. It hints at something much darker, much scarier. It's a bad, bad sign. \n\nThe rest of your post sent chills up my spine. You about to quit your job to raise children that haven't even been conceived yet? I'd bet anything he's been encouraging and pushing and hinting at that. Then he'd have total control over what you do, where you go, and records of your every move. You could never leave him because you'd need him, you couldn't support yourself. He'd be able to, even have to, approve your every purchase, know your every whereabout, monitor your entire life. \"Not having to lift a finger\" also implies total passivity, at least in certain tones. It can imply a life of leisure, or a life of never going against him. Being a homemaker or stay at home parent is fine for those who choose it, but do you even *want* to quit your job to be home for children who are so far hypothetical? Do you feel safe and an equal partner if the only money is \"his\"? Will it also be yours?\n\nYou've given up friends because he says you have \"martial duties\" now. What duties were being neglected by having friends? Does he require all of your attention all of the time? Does he expect you to cater to him? Were you out clubbing with them until 4 am every night? Or were you not home once a month or so to cook him dinner or something?\n\nYou've given up your favorite hobby because he thinks it's \"dangerous\". Were you into extreme hiking in dangerous conditions and dangling off the Grand Canyon with no safety gear or climbing Everest without preparing? Did you go out without a map or communication or a plan or proper provisions? Or was it just normal hiking along a nature trail or something? Was it time to yourself to be you and feel whole and that made him feel threatened?\n\nA marriage should not make you feel like a prop to serve your spouse. A marriage should be a partnership where each party is loved and accepted for who they are and has an equal voice as that person. It's not two halves of a whole, it's two wholes making something better as a team. It's certainly not where one person dictates who the other is, takes away their autonomy, and chips away at everything that makes them themselves. \n\nYou do sound depressed. That doesn't mean you're the problem here. It sounds like he is purposely and systematically wearing down the person you are to make you into the perfect servant for him. It sounds like he's slowly gaining more control over what you do, where you go, how much power you have, whether or not you can leave, and who you are. He's isolating you, he's violating your privacy, he's taking away your autonomy, and he's wearing down at the person you are. And he's making you feel like it's your fault. \n\nDon't let him. Run. Run far, run fast, run now. If you stay with this man, you will wake up one day years from now and realize you are nothing but a servant to his wants, needs, whims, and moods. And you'll have no way out, he'll have you trapped. Do not quit your job, do not have children with this man, do not allow yourself to be trapped right now. Get help, seek a therapist, keep your own money, think for yourself, examine this with open eyes and a clear mind. Be absolutely sure that you will have a voice and be a partner if you follow through with this plan. \n\nMy feeling is that this man is dangerous to you and you will lose yourself completely if this goes on. Please make sure that this is what you want, and if it's not or you're not sure, get out. Now. ",
            "That's probably the biggest invasion of privacy I've ever read about on this sub. \n\nHad he picked it up once - accidentally, not knowing what it was - and read it before realising and then immediately putting it down it would be fine. However, what he's done is a systematic and calculating move to monitor you. Taking notes, questioning parts of your PERSONAL diary. And blaming it on you for not trusting him? That's incredibly warped. Don't let that thought get into your head. \n\nIn order to make him happy you're quitting your job? Why on earth would you want to do that? You've given up friends, hobbies to make him happy. That's not how marriage works.\n\nThe good news is that you know that and recognise he's wrong by making this post. So let's plan. You need to leave. Do you have anyone you can stay with? Are there any women's shelters in the area? Do you have access to money?",

If it's so not a big deal, then why has he been doing it behind your back for three years? If it's such standard behaviour then why didn't he bring it up on date one or five or ten or anytime before or after marrying you as that totes normal thing he expects to happen in your life together. He knows he's wrong. \n\nYou need to claw back enough of your sense of self to get the hell away from this dude. Do not make children with this man.

            "He has been taking away your autonomy, piece by piece, for years, until the only place left you had to feel like yourself was in the pages of a book, hidden away.\n\nAnd you know what? The only reason he let you have that, is because he was watching you there, too.\n\nDon't leave your job. Don't have children with him. Go now to whoever it is that you trust the most in your life, tell them what you've written here. Ask for their help to leave him. ",
            "Make a list.\n\n* What has **he** given up because it is dangerous or unhealthy?\n\n* What intimate and potentially embarrassing stuff of his are you allowed to check (without his  prior consent, \"you share everything, right\")?\n\n* Which friends did he stop seeing because of his \"martial responsibilities\"? Or doesn't he have any friends?\n\n* What advice of yours does he ever follow because it's \"best for him\"? Or is it clear that he is so much smarter and mature that it is of course unthinkable that you could ever offer something worthwhile to the relationship?\n\n>That he's just doing what is best for me and that he always will do just that and take care of me and make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us\n\nI have this terrifying picture of you laying in a bed overlooking the garden, paralyzed, watching the gardener and the maid and the nanny with your kids in the distance, and your husband sitting next to you and telling you how happy you are and that any woman would envy you. And if you say something, that you should rest and not be upset.",
            "I would not even go to counselling. This warrants divorce. This is basically a step-by-step guide on how to get a woman into an abusive relationship. Your husband is not a nice person, he is controlling you. I'd run while I still can.",

I assure you, it's possible to have a marriage where you can still be your own person, still have your private life, still have hobbies that you don't share with him AND you can have a career of your own if that's what you want. Plenty of people have kids and a family and still work. There are nannies, daycare, nursery homes and plenty of options to give your kids a healthy and happy upbringing. It's not an either-or situation. Please consider leaving because this is not \"just what marriage is like\". Not at all.\n\nAnd by the way, even though he says you staying at home and giving up your job is for your \"comfort\" and simply \"in your best interest\", it's really not. You will become financially dependent on him. How can anyone try to remain their own person apart from their spouse in that situation? You might even become more closed off from your friends and other people of the outside world if that's happening with him already. Please consider this and don't let him or anyone tell you that you are overreacting. ",
            "He's systematically isolating you and dictating your behavior. This should scare you.",
            "So, this is how abuse begins. Actually, this is abusive behavior. He is in the conditioning phase of abuse. He is making you entirely dependent on him. \n\n\n- He will be your source of income. I'm guessing he already is the primary account holder for bank accounts. And you have to ask him for extra spending money if you want something. His excuse, I'm guessing, is he is or will be the sole provider and just wants to make sure things are in good standing. \n\n\n\n- He has started to alienate you from your support system. Friends and family are often able to see things from an outside perspective. Alienating you from them is a power play. It's so he can continue to manipulate you without any interruption. As well as making you even more dependent on him. It's often used as a way for the abuser to make it less likely for the victim to feel they have a way to leave.\n\n\n\n- you are allowed to your own personal emotions and outlets of said emotions. As your husband, he should respect your boundaries. I encourage openness in relationships. However, personal space is also encouraged. One or two reads at the time of your fathers passing, I may overlook. Concern can and does happen among partnerships. It is an invasion of privacy, but in some cases, necessary. I'm not saying this is the case with you, but I would willingly excuse a one or two time offense. But he has kept up reading your diary. And copied it. This is an abuse tactic. The notations in his book are his way of trying to find blame. If you ever tried to leave or did something, he would use it against you. \n\n\n\n\nConditioning is all too common. It's a phase where the victim doesn't even really see it happening. The victim also makes excuses for the abuser in this phase. Why? Because in this phase, the abuser still comes off as the loving type. The abuser is only doing these things to ensure quality of life. Unfortunately, it's not quality....it's manipulation. You shouldn't lift a finger in life? Just enjoy the home he provided for you? What life is that? Is that the life you wanted? Did you want to never work? To never have friends? To just be home with the kids? For some it may be ideal, but you don't sound as if this is the ideal for you. \n\n\n\nI'm guessing the chores of the household are your chores. He doesn't want you to lift a finger unless its for him. His excuse is that he works and provides so you should be the one maintaining the home. If he hasn't started this behavior, it's coming. I'm sure if you really reflect on it, it's already started. Possibly in small, almost unnoticeable ways. Again, this is ensuring that you won't leave him. You'll be made to feel like he needs you and can't live without you. He isn't helpless, I promise. It's just another tactic. \n\n\n\n\nI was in your shoes. I was conditioned for a year or two prior to the more detrimental abuse. Actually, all of it is detrimental. I just mean, before the full on physical abuse began. I was so blinded by that point, that I felt like I was the problem. That I made him treat me that way, that it was my fault. I didn't see it for what it was until someone stepped in after too many bruises and broken bones. And vision/hearing loss that he caused. I let it get to that point because I was trained by him. I had no escape, or so I thought. But I did escape eventually. Barely. Now I work as an advocate for other victims (in various forms). Your situation is something I see all the time. \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease, please, please, get help now. Don't make excuses. Just get help. Tell someone everything he's doing. Even if they aren't fully listening, tell them. Find someone to stay with, find a new job or try to see if you can un-quit your current one. See if you can grab his book of copies and your diary. Grab only what you need and get out of there. File for divorce. \n\n\n\n\nNot prepared to file for divorce? Then stand your ground if you feel you can. Get into marriage counseling and continue to work. If he is not willing to compromise on those things, you'll need to revisit the idea of divorce. \n\n\n\n\n/r/relationships gets a bad reputation for always saying \"leave your SO\" or something similar. In some cases, yes, it's a drastic response and doesn't fit the bill. However, in your case, this is the best advice. This is going to get worse. I am certain of this. You are in a very unhealthy marriage with someone who is, very obviously, trying to take on full power over you. \n\n\n\n\nYou don't deserve this. You deserve to be happy and be an individual. A marriage is meant to be a partnership. Decisions are made as a couple, with the best intentions for both parties. You've had no say in any aspect of your life. It's time to get your voice back and speak up. It's okay to feel, it's okay to want to be your own person, and it's okay to want to run away from him.  ",
            "Aw honey :( this post makes me feel so sad.. I've been there and you aren't crazy. Honestly, I started reading this and was going to post that I don't think it's a huge deal to read a diary. But everything that followed after that.... this is an abusive relationship, or at least the start of one.\n\nMy ex I was with for four years. He was verbally abusive for a while which I knew.. but it wasn't until after we broke up I realized how much he restricted me. When I'd get excited or super into something, he'd make mean remarks about it making me feel stupid for caring about it. He didn't like that I wanted to hang out with my friends if he wasn't invited. He'd tell me since I was always invited to go with his friends he should come any time I hang out with mine... he did not understand the idea of me wanting to just have some girl time. He just always had a way of diminishing my feelings and interests, he yelled at me all the time when he didn't get what he wanted and threatened to break up with me... he also seemed to laugh the hardest the dumber and dumber I acted. He didn't like me speaking passionately about issues I cared about, but when I acted like a total dumbass he just seemed to like me more.\n\nI felt like a shell. I had a lot of interests but I felt like none of them mattered. I had been continually depressed for years. I felt out of it most of the time. I wasn't until my second to last year of college, when I had to take a class for my major that lasted the while school year and was 6 hours twice a week. I met a bunch of friends and it was kind of a clean slate. I got to joke around how I wanted, hang out with who I wanted, there were people I could share interests with who were excited to share theirs back. It was when I finally really realized how unhappy I was with my ex, and it wasn't just because I was mentally fucked up. \n\nI broke up with him right around our 4 year anniversary mark. I was sad... but not as sad as I thought I'd be. I ended up dating a guy from the year long class I took, and it was a huge shock to me to be with someone who encouraged me to do new and exciting things, who didn't care who I hung out with and when, who thought I was genuinely funny and smart. Sometimes to this day (I've been with him 3 years now) I still get \"weirded out\" when I think of how amazing being in a relationship with someone who actually respects you is. With someone who doesn't want to control you.\n\nSo hun, yes, you are depressed. This is not about the diary even a little bit. Your husband is controlling you. He is trying to stifle you and keep you to himself. Making you quit your job, your interests, your friends... that is very very manipulative and DANGEROUS behavior!! I really believe you should consider the option of leaving, for yourself but also your children. Imagine what will happen when he starts to control them as well.\n\nDon't feel ashamed about yourself. You are not wimpy or stupid or \"just depressed\".... the person you married us not respecting the person you are and is treating you like an object.",

Nothing to do every single day but wait. Wait for Jake. Wait for work. Wait for bed time. Wait for food. Wait for my hot baths. Wait for when I can lay down for hours with no one looking. Not even enough strength to get up and go for a walk or do something productive.\n\nI'm not usually part of the r/relationship \"delete Facebook, lawyer up, hit the gym\" brigade.

And I think everyone needs *someplace* or *something* to be private. For some women it might be their evening skincare routine, others it might be their hair coloring appointments, and some it's a diary. Men need it too (at least in my opinion).\n\nAnd even disregarding the **complete breach of privacy and trust**, you are in an abusive situation and need to **GET OUT**. You've been taken away from your friends, from your hobbies. You've become isolated and alone with a man who doesn't respect you as a person. \n\nDo not quit your job. Make a separate bank account under only your name, and have your paychecks deposited there - and don't get a debit card until you live apart from him. \n\nGet some counseling, yes,.... but *only for you*.

Woman, imagine that I'm holding your shoulders and giving you a gentle shake right now: *this is really, really not okay.* He's isolating you from your friends and your life, he's showing you that he wants to completely invade your privacy, and he's trying to make you become financially dependent on him. You will then be utterly at his mercy. And what about what you want? Maybe you work because you like being out in the world, you like having an income, maybe even like what you do...why does that not matter to him? This is really a dangerous situation even though maybe it just seems weird.Like I said, if it was just the journals it would be bad enough, but all these other details make it so much more sinister. You should get out of there. This isn't a marriage...this is a one-man show and he does not see you as an equal or a partner.\n\nNo wonder you're sad and your home makes you feel miserable.",

This is really really odd behaviour. I wouldnt ever think of reading my partner's diary, let alone take it, make copies, put them in a binder AND then make notes. As if they were some sort of study. Its really insensitive, and its also very weird to do that kind of thing. \n\nI cant believe that he's made you quit your job and your friends, your hobbies and your entire life. Marriage isnt something that controls you, it supposed to be a partnership, that is a pairing between two people that love and support each other, he isnt doing either for you. \n\nThis is huge issue for me personally, and I would be just as upset. It doesnt sound as though you've been happy in a while. So I suggest, if you have the money/insurance, that you see a doctor. Maybe a therapist, if you can afford it.

I got a phone call from him raging about how I didn't let him know I was going to be home. I had to report to him my every move. But he kept me in the dark about everything and if I asked him anything, I was smothering him. Turns out he was out on a date that weekend.\nI was stupid, fat, and couldn't do anything right. Everything was always my fault. \n\nWe stupidly moved in together and things got worse. \nEverything was on his schedule and it was all about what worked for him. He'd keep me waiting for hours for him so we could go out. He'd never call when he said he would or ignore me if I called him and again id be smothering him. \nI lost 7 years of my life.\nIt got bad, he started throwing things at me. He didn't like some of my friends. We stopped hanging out with them. He complained every time I had a family function and always made us late.\nMy friends and family were worried. \nI always knew if I ever ended things it would get bad. It did. \nI left, I was unhappy and had had enough. \nHe screamed, he raged, he banged his head against the wall and he begged me to stay. He lost his control over me and he did everything he could to get it back. \nHe called my friends, my parents, my aunt and uncle. When that didn't work, he changed the locks on the door. He'd call me at 3 in the morning and tell me I needed to come and get my things right that second or he was throwing them out. He followed me and would find out where I was going and who I was with. As tough as that time was, it was the best decision of my life. I stayed for so long because I didn't want anyone to think I quit. I gave in. \nAnd even though your husband will get angry if you leave him and even though you feel like your giving in or quitting. Your not. Quitting is quitting on yourself and what you need and want. This is living, living for yourself. \n\nI highly recommend counselling, but just for yourself. Not couples counselling. For you, so you have a safe place to go and talk about how you feel. It was one of the smartest decisions I made. It gave me strength and helped me work through the years of emotional and verbal abuse. \n\nI have now met an amazing man and we are happily married with a little girl. The best decision I have ever made was choosing me and making myself happy. I have never regretted leaving that relationship. Not for one second, and neither will you. Find your wings and learn to fly again. You deserve it. ",
            "\n\nAs a person who uses writing as therapy, you might have depression but that does not excuse what he is doing. Abusive spouses will cause their partner to become depressed and isolate them so they can control them better.  You don't have kids, so I don't understand why you don't leave instead of allowing him to run your life like this. \n\nEither go back to work and do what you love despite what he says or get the hell out of there. If he hits you, then call the cops so you can file a report and your divorce will be cut and dry. \n\n",

PLEASE read what others here are warning you about. They are 100% on what he is doing. DONT QUIT YOUR JOB! He wants you totally dependent on him. He wants that control.

            "Some practical stuff to consider...\n\n* Do not quit your job.\n* Talk to a divorce lawyer. You don't need to file right now, but you DO need to know the situation in your state. **Knowledge is power.** Most lawyers will give you a free or cheap initial consultation.\n* Change the password on your phone and/or tablet and turn off location settings.\n* Clear the cookies on your laptop and use incognito mode from now on. Assume that he's violating your privacy there and in all aspects of your life.\n* If you have a \"find your phone\" app, disable it so he can't keep track of your location.\n* Keep your birth control physically on your person so that he can't mess with it. This is not the time to be trapped by an unwanted pregnancy.\n* As soon as you can, when he is not home, gather all your important paperwork. Passport, birth certificate, photocopies of financial records, taxes, bank statements, that might be needed for a divorce, etc. Put them in a box and store them somewhere outside of your home. A safe deposit box at a bank that you don't currently use would be a good choice.\n* Get a post office box in the next town over. \n* Get a new bank account using your new post office box number as your address.\n* Make a list of things in the house that are important to you that you want to take with you when you go. Keep the list on your password protected phone where he can't find it. Even if you're not ready to pack up and go yet, make the list when you're calm and clear headed.\n* The day that you are ready to go, and I really hope that it's soon, wait until he leaves the house then pack the stuff you really need and get out before he comes home.\n* Change the direct deposit for your job to your new bank account in your name only. \n* Transfer half the amount of your joint bank account (or however much the lawyer tells you that you're entitled to) into your new personal account on the day you leave.\n\nEven if you aren't ready to leave, these are smart steps to take to protect yourself. They are your safety net so that you CAN leave when you need to. You probably understand by now that your husband is controlling and abusive. Even if he hasn't been physically abusive yet, it sounds like the potential is there. When you leave him, and he feels that control slipping away, he's going to get ugly. Be prepared for anger, then tears and remorse, romantic gestures, begging, pleading, then more anger, name calling, etc. if you don't cave in and fall for his tactics. Please be very, very careful. I hope you understand that this really isn't just about your diary at this point.",

            "First of all, please, do not quit your job, no matter what he tells you, and if you do nothing else at this point, keep working.  Working is key to your independence, which it seems like he is methodically taking away from you.  You are not overreacting.  You are not being dramatic or silly, but by saying this to you, he is minimizing and disregarding your feelings.  This is a huge deal.  You are your own person - you are an individual, with valid feelings, and being an individual does not have to stop when you marry in order for you to be a loving, committed spouse.  Being an individual is necessary in order for anyone to be a loving, committed spouse.  Your husband sounds insecure, and he is trying to isolate you.  It is okay for you to leave this marriage, if that is what you feel in your gut is the best thing for you.  Leaving an oppressive partner means you care about yourself, know your own worth, and know you deserve to have your privacy respected.  I think you already know, at some level, that your life can be much better than it currently is.  I believe that you have the ability to give yourself a better life, regardless of how initially difficult doing so may be.  Living as you are now is more difficult than moving forward with your life will ever be.  I only say this because I've been where you are.  Getting out and moving forward was really hard, but came nowhere close to how hard it was to live with someone who continually refused to allow me to be me. ",
            "I know I'm late to the party and you probably won't read this, but although my ex wasn't reading my diary, our relationship was changing me away from myself much like yours is.

I put up this shield and didn't speak to anyone when he was around because I am a fairly opinionated person and he wanted a more conservative Christian girl.\n\nHere's the deal: Your husband, and my ex fell in love with the ladies we were. If we need to change ourselves to appease them, then it's not fair to you or I. Your husband is taking you away from you. If you feel you have to act different around him than you do with your friends then there is a problem. I'd suggest couples therapy or at the very least talk to him about this.\n\nHiking is part of who you are. Getting into nature changes you for the good. He says that's dangerous? Shit, last week going to a club was dangerous. Everything is dangerous.

            "OP, this is textbook abuse. *Textbook.* Let's go through the signs. \n\nFirst of all, blatantly invading your privacy. Husbands and wives should not share everything, they should trust each other enough to not *have* to share everything. You have the right to privacy, even within a relationship. He has violated your privacy, and he is unapologetic about it. Besides, if you two *should* share everything with each other, why didn't he tell you he was snooping? \n\n> [...] I shouldn\u2019t be so antsy about my diary unless I had things to hide from him. He said that he feels he has a right to look at it as my husband and that he\u2019s just concerned about me.\n\nThis is what we call gaslighting. He is implying to you that your (entirely rational) desire for privacy is irrational, in order to keep you complacent. \n\n> I\u2019m my own person apart from him\u2026 Arent I? I really like having a place to be myself completely\u2026 I can\u2019t even have that?\n\nYou are your own person. You can have a place to be yourself. There is nothing wrong with that. Your husband is trying to take away your agency. \n\n> I\u2019m already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids.\n\n**Do not quit your job.** Why would he need you to do it if you don't even have kids yet? Most people are grateful for as much extra income as possible before they have children. A healthy stay-at-home situation would mean that you are choosing to stay at home because you want to do it, not just because you want to \"make him happy.\" You should not have to quit your job just to make him happy. He's doing this to control you so that you are dependent on him, which would make it very difficult for you to leave. Also, convincing you to quit your job is a good way to cut you off from the outside world, which brings me to my next point: \n\n>  I don\u2019t see some of my friends because Jake says I now have marital responsibilities and I can\u2019t be attached to single life anymore. \n\nHe's cutting you off from your friends as well. This is a classic abusive tactic; making it harder to leave and also isolating you so that you can't talk to anyone, because I guarantee that if you told any reasonable friend about what you said in this Reddit post, they'd immediately recognize the situation as abuse. A non-abusive partner would understand that you want to spend time with friends, and they would be *happy* that you're enjoying yourself with friends. \n\n> I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous.\n\nYou gave up your favourite hobby because your husband said it was *dangerous?* Presumably you had been hiking for a long time beforehand, long enough to develop a hobby out of it. Yet only now, suddenly, do you realize that it's *dangerous?*\n\nI would understand your husband's \"concern\" if your hobby were skydiving, or extreme surfing, or something. Even if it were one of those sports, you'd still have the right to do it. *You do not need your husband's approval to have a hobby.* The fact that he's trying to control what you do is *abuse.*\n\nLet me guess, he doesn't go hiking with you, does he? So he probably just sees hiking as another pesky way for you to try to be independent from him. Hence why he is trying to stop you from doing it. \n\n> Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage. But I feel like I\u2019m overreacting and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking right now. \n\nA healthy marriage should not have you feeling like this. You are *not* overreacting.  I repeat, you are *not* overreacting. Read the other comments, they don't think you're overreacting, either. The fact that you think you are is evidence of how much your husband has already managed to manipulate you. All of this stuff that you're realizing right now is your instincts telling you to *get out,* rightly so. \n\n> My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. \n\n> I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s my marriage or if I\u2019m depressed.\n\nThis is not what a home should feel like. It sounds like you *are* depressed; unsurprisingly, because *you are in an abusive relationship.* Anybody would get depressed in a situation like that. \n\n> It just makes me sad more than anything and Jake won\u2019t even apologize to me. He says I am being dramatic and silly and that I just need a good nap and I\u2019ll be okay.\n\nGaslighting. Absolutely textbook gaslighting. Do you not see how condescending he is being? Calling you \"dramatic\" and \"silly,\" saying you \"just need a good nap\" like you're a child, and not a capable, grown adult. Your feelings are *absolutely* valid. He is trying to convince you that they aren't because he is abusive, and that's what abusers do. He doesn't want you to become aware of that fact and leave him. \n\n> [...] make sure I never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home that he bought for us.\n\nHe just blatantly told you that he wants you to stay trapped in his home forever, like you're some sort of medieval princess. This is not healthy. This is blatant abuse. His intentions are to keep you *imprisoned,* under permanent house arrest. \n\n> I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back.\n\nListen to your instincts. This is what you should be doing. Contact friends. Contact family. Contact a shelter for women escaping abusive relationships if you have nowhere else to go. Grab your important documents and *run.* If you can't get access to those documents, then run anyway; documents can be replaced, but your life can't. The longer you stay, the harder it will be to leave. You are in danger,  OP. Listen to your self-preservation instincts, and GET OUT. \n",

Just because you're married doesn't mean you suddenly belong to that person it doesn't mean that you and that person are one person. You are still you. Honestly yes I believe you are depressed just from reading I can see a lot of the characteristics but I believe the depression is in direct correlation to your husband being a douche. Do not quit your job for him idc what he says good parents can raise their kids and work only do that if YOU want to. Go hang with your friends, go take a hike, and damnit girl do what you want to do. Hes your husband (hopefully ex soon..) not your damn keeper. What hes doing is a set up for complete control. He is isolating you. Taking away people that he doesn't like, making you quit your job, getting rid of your hobbies he is grooming you into a meek little girl that he can control. To me what hes doing is already mental and emotional coercion borderline heavily on the abuse side of things. Sweet heart strike out to those connections and remake them you're gonna need them..

If you don't have that reason pinned down, it becomes a little easier to make rationalizations for what your husband did or easier for him to make it seem as if you're overreacting by saying that you're \"keeping secrets\" by processing thoughts in a space that he doesn't share. \n\nThe idea that any thought unshared equals deception is troubling because he's in essence saying that you are no longer someone who has the right to autonomous thought- he's not someone you just share your thoughts with, but he also becomes the gatekeeper and the censor. He's saying that you're not allowed to have independent thought without his knowledge because he owns that part of you- he thinks that through marriage, you've become a piece of his property so he gets final say or control over what you do. In his eyes, you are no longer another person- you're just a vessel to serve his needs. You don't exist outside of your marriage. He's wrong, of course- he ultimately will never have the power to reduce you down to what he wants you to be and he's hoping you don't realize that.\n\nI hope some of this advice is helpful to you.

I have things I don't share with my husband and that is OK. He does, too. He are a couple, not a hybrid human.\nYou may be depressed because of your marriage. \nAll of your comments are signals of isolation and controlling behavior. Your body is signaling to you there is a problem. Be THANKFUL he read your diary and you caught him- it gave you a wakeup call- talk to someone, plan an exit strategy, and get out. You deserve to be with someone who loves who YOU are. You need to love who you are. That he doesn't want you to \"have a job or go anywhere but the comfort of our home\" is scary.

Well fuck that he sounds like an insecure loser actually. Once you get away from him you will feel fucking amazing I promise. If you need help leaving for a bit get a hotel room up to what you can afford if you don't have family or friends you can visit for a while (NOTICE HOW HE PROBABLY TRIED TO ISOLATE YOU FROM THEM SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T LEAVE) but right now you need to call in every favor you have and just get away for a bit. And tell people what's going on. The diary invasion sounds like the thing that's opened your eyes but it's not the only thing that's fucked about your marriage. Do not have sex with your husband and if you feel like you're in danger or he won't let you leave the house CALL THE POLICE.",

            "OP, your husband reading your diary is bullshit. You're not overreacting. The fact that he can't even muster up a fake apology is absurd. \n\nBut the rest of your post? It's much worse. Your husband is controlling and you're deeply depressed. \n\n>I'm already going to quit my job soon to make him happy so I can stay home with our future kids.

I gave up my favorite hobby of hiking because Jake said it was dangerous.\n\nThis is Abuser 101 stuff. Maybe your husband will never hit you, but he's certainly controlling you. You shouldn't give up your job to make someone else happy. If you *want* to be a stay-at-home mom, that's great. But you shouldn't do it out of obligation. You shouldn't be cut off from your friends. Yes, being married is different than being single. But that doesn't mean you stop having friends. That's an isolation tactic your husband is using on you. As for hiking, I can't think of a single rational explanation besides your husband wanting to control you and take away the things you like. Hiking isn't dangerous unless you're the kind of person to try to make friends with cougars and moose during the hike. \n\n>Sometimes I feel like a shell of my former self in this marriage... Sometimes I just lay in bed and cry and wonder if this Is all there is in the world... My home has become a place that only makes me sad and tired and feel gray and weak and pessimistic inside and even cold to the point where I just lay in bed with blankets over me. \n\nYes, this is depression. Been there, done that. Please seek support asap. You will fall further and further into this hole if you don't. \n\n>I can't decide if it's my marriage or if I'm depressed. \n\nIt's both. Depression can be brought on by life events. In your case, it's being in an unfulfilling marriage to a controlling man. You need to deal with both things rather than try to explain one of them away. \n\nBy the way, here's a question for you: Do you write stuff like what you've written here in your diary? If you've been expressing how depressed and unhappy you are in your diary for years and your husband hasn't changed a single thing or brought it up, that should tell you something. He's not reading your diary because he's looking out for your wellbeing. He's reading it because it's his way of keeping tabs on you. He's perfectly content for you to be where you are: stuck and hopeless. Please don't settle for this. There is much more to life.",

Think about the effort and the scheming that went on behind your back for him to take your diary, photocopy and put it back in its place. You'd have to be pretty deep in thinking some one is cheating. He's actually prepping!\n\nThe invasion of privacy is secondary to the \"divorce record binder\". That is absurd. What I would do is place your self in the scenario that he was really keeping a binder for divorce.

Either way, I would either go to a doctor or find some ways to improve your mindset.\n\nThat being said, the number one way to feel better is to stop going on in your marriage as you have been. I think it's very normal to feel bored sometimes in a long term relationship. The way I combat this best is by making sure we have time apart. Especially with our friends. But it sounds like he won't allow that. He's being abusive whether you realize it or not. Look into the signs of a mentally abusive relationship.

It would be good if you could reach out to your friends and family but he won't like that and you need to stay safe until you leave. If you can you should leave as soon as possible. Like now.

You should assume he has trackers on your phone and if you have a laptop or any other portable devices (iPod, tablet etc.) assume he may be tracking on those too. He might not be, but best to assume he does. In the circumstances you describe it's not unlikely. You might want to pay a tech support person to check them. A women's shelter will be able to help you plan a safe exit even if you don't use the shelter itself. \n\nYou can be happy. But you can't be happy with this man.

So he knows the intimate details of your thought processes and emotional state.\n\nThe fact he was systematically doing it suggests he would use that inside information for incredibly calculating and subtle manipulation. \n\nCompound that with him essentially telling you to change your whole life around to his preferences, aided by the recon he has gained from reading your diary possibly, I would lay it all down on the line. \n\nI would sit down and say you are not happy with your life the way it is and some things are going to change. \n\nYou are going to do what you want to do. Start hiking because it's your hobby and you love it. \n\nStart seeing your friends and doing things with them because they are your friends and you love them. \n\nThink about the decision to quit your job. Do you want to do it or do you feel you have to? You can work while you are pregnant and go on maternity and then make any choices once you have a child. You might not be able to leave him at home, and that's ok. You might want to go back to work, and that's ok too. \n\nIf your husband isn't happy or throws a hissy fit now or sometime in the future, you have given it your best shot and can walk away knowing you tried your best. \n\nGood luck OP, have fun hiking with friends :) \n",
            "You are absolutely your own person, and you deserve your privacy. If husbands and wives can be completely open and honest with each other, why do you think he was sneaking around behind your back to read your diary? Shouldn't he have told you up front that he wanted no secrets between you, and that he'd like to read it?\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, he sounds controlling - like he's deliberately striving to create a power imbalance in your relationship in order to cater to his own insecurities.\n\nA reasonable compromise, for example, if he feels hiking is dangerous, might be: to have you leave your itinerary with him (ie which trails/general route you intend to take, estimated return time etc); take a satellite phone, a few emergency items, and a good map; only go with a (preferably experienced) group rather than on your own.\n\nIt seems like you've conceded a lot for your relationship, but I doubt you'd ever ask him to give up his passions, his friends, and his career. Letting yourself be dependent on him is not healthy, and it can only hurt your relationship and your self-esteem.",

This is one of the scariest, most insane things I have ever read in my life. This abuse. This is not okay. This is not healthy. Please, for the love of all that is holy, get the eff out of this sham marriage. And please PM me. I will help you move or give you support in any way I can. Totally earnest in this. I mean it. ",
            "As soon as you said that your diary was the only place you can be yourself, I knew right away, you are in the wrong relationship. Yes a diary is OK to have bein Gmail in a marriage, but if that is the only time you can be yourself then you are not with the right person. It sounds very much like you are depressed. I've been with my wife for 6 yrs now and we tell each other everything. I feel like I am the most open when I am around her. She is my best friend and I'd much rather spend time with her than other friends. My opinion, you need to reevaluate this marriage and decide if you want to stay miserable your whole life or go out and see what else is out there. There is someone for you that will make you feel happy. We all have that person. ",
            "Op, you sound really depressed. This is coming from someone who lives like you. Reading your post about how everything is waiting for something in your day to day life was like reading about my own life. \n\nAnd this line \"I wish I could just go outside and walk in a straight line and never look back.\"  you've already shown how unhappy you are, how much you miss your old life, and how much you want it back. I read that part as you saying \"I deserve to be my own person.\" AND YOU DO. \n\nYou deserve your own privacy, the freedom to go out with friends, the joy of knowing you won't have to quit your job for someone, and the elation of coming home to someone who knows this about a relationship. That they don't own you. \n\nJake doesn't seem to get this. The fact that he's dismissing your legitimate emotional reaction is an orange flag. The fact that he's isolated you from your friends and soon your job is a huge red flag. \n\nI'd say counseling, and I hope he agrees to it. Op you deserve to feel like your life is filled with things you enjoy doing, not just waiting around for the inevitable.",

            "You should read \"Why Does He Do That?\" by Lundy Bancroft.  Your husband is controlling and emotionally abusive.

Is there some reason you're judgment on what's safe and what isn't safe wasn't good enough, so he needed to step in and make that decision for you? I'm focusing on the hiking thing, because that's my personal favorite pastime.\n\nMany of his actions dont seem right, to be honest. He's isolated you from friends, he wants you to quit your job in preparation for kids you don't even have yet..sounds like he wants to be finiacially in control too.\n\nReading your diary is not ok. Photocopying it and making notes about mundane entries makes it sound as if he is the one with mental issues. \n\nHe could be manipulating you into questioning your own mental health and judgement. Of course living that way would be depressing for you.\n\nIf I were you, I'd make an exit plan. At the very least both of you need to go to therapy. He is not respecting you, of he cannot understand why reading your diary is not ok.",
            "I've had a journal from before my marriage. My husband sees me writing in it and I know he would never read it. If he saw it lying around he would never read it. He understands what it is to me, an outlet, a way for me to get things out of my head. We've talked about it and he would never invade my head like that. \nYour man sounds like a narcissist to me. Everything is about him and when it's about you it's really about how it affects him. You need to run and run fast. This mans whole goal is to make you into what he sees as his perfect woman. A real relationship is one where you are you. Why did he start dating you? Did he not like who you are or did he see you as mold able? Someone that truly loves you, loves you just as you are. You learn to accept the little quirks that bother you, not make the other person change into what you think is right. Get out and get some counseling. You can't come out of something like this without doubting yourself. DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF!! You really deserve better. ",

I didn't realize how miserable I was until I was away from him and could really be happy again. \n\nI reccommend leaving asap. He is cutting you off from people, hobbies, and happiness.

I think the problem isn't in the fact he read or not your diary it's more about the fact he doesn't let you be yourself anymore. You are more than 'Jake's wife' you are a complete woman with her good and bad sides. Also continue the birth control and be very carefull about it. If you take the pill verify them with attention and maybe even think about switching to another birth control device like the shots you get every 3 months or an intra-uterine device which is effective for many years and with which you can become pregnant as soon as you want only by getting it out. Even if you have to change method behind his back, you can't allow yourself to have a child with that man, a kid would only be another person on whom he will be able to have some control.",

            "At this point you've probably had an overwhelming amount of responses regarding this... but what I read in this post is so very upsetting I feel the need to add my voice to the chorus.\n\nThis is textbook abusive behaviour. You should not feel isolated and alone, you are your own person and you have a right to having personal freedom and privacy. You have a right to your hobbies, you have a right to your own friends, and you have a right to your own life. Marriage does not mean that you are owned by your husband. Marriage is supposed to be a partnership between two people who love and support eachother. But part of that is encouraging and loving the individual that your partner is. He should love and encourage the hobbies you enjoy, even if they aren't his cup of tea. He should support and encourage you to have friends outside of your marriage. Most importantly he should respect your privacy and your right to having personal thoughts, feelings and desires that are only yours.\n\n\"never have to lift a finger in this world or have a job **or go anywhere but the comfort of our home**\"\n\nThat sounds like prison to me. \n\nI wouldn't suggest counselling either. I wouldn't suggest trying to work it out. Because this doesn't sound like a marriage or a relationship. It sounds like slavery. And you deserve so much better and happier of a life than that.",
            "You are definitely depressed. \n\nYou are also being asked to give up every aspect of who you are, in order to be with him. This will not work. Trust me. I speak from experience. I'm reluctant to say you're being abused, because that implies it is deliberate. But I'm not ruling out the chance that this is the early stages of grooming you for it. Cutting you off from your friends and trying to control every aspect of your life are two HUGE big red flags.\n\nMarriage no longer means that a woman gives up all her friends, interests, and job once she gets married. You cannot live every single second of your life for someone else. Doing what makes HIM happy. Doing what HE wants you to do. You mention quitting your job, to take care of future children. Are you pregnant now? If not, why are you quitting? What in the name of God does you husband think you're going to do all day? Put on pearls, heels, and a crinoline and vacuum the house? It's the 21st century. Women are actually allowed now to go out without a male escort. \n\nYou have to have your own space. He has his job, his friends, etc. You time and space of your own as well. Talk to him about this. There is something going on in his head that he's not communicating. I'm hoping that it's just insecurity on his part. (He \"doesn't feel like a man\" if you work, it's the relationship his parents had, etc.) It will only get worse once you have kids. And the depression will get worse. I suggest counseling. And please for the love of heaven, don't get pregnant until you guys get this personal space thing worked out. \n\nGoing out with friends doesn't mean you're embracing the single life. I don't even know what that MEANS. Does he think you're cruising the bars for men? \n\nSounds like you're  giving up everything that made you YOU. What exactly is he giving up for this relationship? \n\nNever give up all that makes you happy. And no adult man is going to realistically expect to be your entire world. Sit him down and talk. With our without a therapist. \n\nYou have a right  to privacy. \n\nYou have a right to a life. \n\nYou have a right to be happy. \n\nDon't give them up for him. ",

And don't buy his crap about invading your privacy. My husband and I share everything, but he would NEVER invade my space like that.

You can troll your husband like I did my mom, or you can change the aim of your handwritten diary to consist only of things you wish your husband to know.\n\nBut honestly, him reading your diary is only part of the content of your post. It can be addressed for sure, but the other things you mention are troubling both individually and as part of the bigger picture of your marriage. \n\nBeing married doesn't mean that you can't have hobbies or friends or privacy.\n\nYou actually CAN just get up and walk out the door and never go back. Although your life going forward may be easier if you spend some time preparing for that, and actually leave while he is at work, when he can't physically stop you or manipulate the situation.",

            "You basically just described the beginning of an emotionally abusive relationship. Especially when your husband tried to justify invading your private space with excuses of wanting to look out for you (if he wanted to look out for you, then maybe he should have spoken to you about your issues instead of reading them in your diary) and while yes, husband and wife should share everything, they should also have the option to keep small things for themselves.\n\nThe way you're describing your life also sounds like your depressed. And your husband who is trying to control every aspect of your life is probably a part of it. \n\nI would highly recommend taking a break. Maybe a month long. If you could somehow go stay with friends or your parents for like a month just to get a feel of how your life would be like without your husband you can really know if you want to end the marriage or try and work at it. Your husbands reaction will be a huge indicator too. Try to use the angle that you need this to know if you're really happy and if he tries to control you or whatever then you know he isn't right for you.\n\nYour husband should want what's best for you at all times. Even if it makes his life a bit harder.",

It's where I go to say whatever I want about whoever I want.  My venting place.  Everyone deserves that.  Everyone has a right to some privacy.  Yes a marriage shares a lot of things but that is WILLINGLY not unwillingly.  Everyone still gets to be their own person.",

I feel for you because I've been there.\n\nTake back your hobbies. Take back your freedom. Seek out some psychotherapy, see your friends again, and/or make new ones by joining a hiking meetup group or something. \n\nI can't tell you what to do regarding your marriage, but all signs point to your depression which is linked directly to being treated very poorly.\n\nIf you need another perspective (I am male) who has been in an abusive marriage (divorced a sociopath 14 years ago), conquered depression and happily remarried, feel free to reach out to me privately.\n\nBest of luck!",

Willing to travel a little if there's enough excitement involved!\"\n\nHis pictures do not include me, despite 9/10 pictures ever taken of either of us for the last three years having the two of us together in them.

Basically he completely invalidated my points and made *me* feel guilty for being upset by this, playing it off like I am being possessive. \n\nSince then I've avoided bringing it up and just tried to get over it. He hasn't been out and about any more than usual so it doesn't look like he has any 'takers' yet, but this is just *not* sitting right with me.

I do not want to throw away three years over something that might be ME being silly.\n\n**TL;DR: Boyfriend of 3yrs using a notorious dating and casual sex/hookup app to \"look for friends\" with suspicious bio and pics.**\n\nEdit: Firstly, thank all of you for all of your perspectives and advice in this quite frankly disgusting situation I've found myself in.\n\nI decided I'd play dirty as someone suggested and made a tinder profile, pretending to be a friend (with her permission!) whom he does not know. I hit on him. He reciprocated and made plans to meet with 'me' at a nearby coffee shop that we occasionally date at, minutes after making 'my' intentions clear. Wow.\n\nIn about 20 minutes he'll be headed out to go and meet 'me' and I'll be packing up his shit ready for him to leave when he gets back. House is my families, he has no rights to any of it.\n\nI deserve better.\n\nEdit/Update 2:\n\nHe sat at the coffee place waiting for 'her/me' for over an hour in the hopes to meet my, to be honest, gorgeous friend. Obviously she didn't show up.\n\nShortly after he left I called my dad to explain, and I must have sounded pretty distraught because he came over without me asking. Dave came home to his clothes packed up by the door. He came in yelling \"what the fuck is this?\" and, unbeknownst to him, my dad was sat by me on the sofa and responded on my behalf, telling him in no certain words to get his filthy unfaithful ass out of his house. I am glad he did. I think my dad knows I'm timid and prone to being pushed about.\n\nHis face dropped when he pieced it together and without a word he 180'd and grabbed his bags. I know he has places he can stay, and family nearby, so I'm not worried about him having no place to sleep. \n\nThis is going to hurt for a long time, but I can never forgive that kind of breach of trust. I'm not the type of person to move past it. I'll allow him back to collect his pieces of furniture and such in a week or so when he is situated, but that's as far as seeing him again goes. I am also dreading a phone call from his mother, whom I love dearly. She'll be heartbroken too. \n\nWelp, bye bye three years. Fuck you Dave! :')",

            "From my experience, Tinder is *not* about friends. I have never heard of anyone using Tinder for anything but hookups.\n\nThat said, let's get reddit's consensus before we make a decision. Maybe a ton of people use Tinder as a friend finder and you and I just don't know it yet! If it's a common practice, I'd let it go. Like you said, his actual behavior hasn't changed yet.\n\nIf no one has heard of using Tinder as a friend finder before, I'd have a serious chat with him about it. I'd say it all depends on the consensus. ",
            "Is he allowed to seek friends and be social? Sure. But \"why are you using a notorious dating/casual sex/hookup app to make new friends\" is a TOTALLY VALID question.\n\nEven if, for some strange reason, he is genuinely only looking to make friends on Tinder, his profile is incredibly misleading to other people on Tinder, which means that he's going to hurt a lot of innocent people's feelings and cause a lot of awkward conversations if he's not upfront and honest.\n\nMe personally, I would say that he can keep the Tinder account if:\n1) He changes his profile to include the fact that he has a fiance.\n2) At least one of his pictures includes said fiance.\n3) If he does decide to communicate with anybody from the site, he tells said fiance.\n\nBut TBH he will probably refuse to do those three things, which is pretty suspicious.",
            "Your fiance is looking to cheat. Period. No one honest claims to use Tinder exclusively for \"finding friends\". Yes, some people do end up making friends using it, but that is a side-effect of looking for sex. The fact his pictures include only him, and do not mention you at all is a pretty clear indication that's what is happening. \"Willing to travel a little if there's enough excitement involved!\" is not something you say to random friends you're looking to make.\n\nAlso, what the fuck is this: \"my best friend of 11 years is a 'nosy bitch'\" What an asshole. There's no seeking people out on Tinder, the profiles you see are random. So your friend saw your fiance's profile by chance, and *of course* she was going to tell you. Why the fuck are you allowing this massive disrespect to your best friend stand? For that matter, why are you letting this massive disrespect *to your relationship* to stand?",

            ">What can I do? Am I in the wrong for not being OK with this? I do not want to throw away three years over something that might be ME being silly.\n\nDump him. No. Read up on *The sunk cost fallacy*.\n\nIt's a hookup app. He does it behind your back. He is prepared to cheat on you. He doesn't respect or love or commit to you. When confronted about his actions he knows to be wrong, he gaslights you. Gaslighting is a tactic used by a users and cheaters to make their partners feel silly / crazy / wrong. Any outside perspective will reveal that it is not. Using Tinder to find hookups while in an exclusive relationship **validates immediately breaking up on the spot**.\n\nTrust me. There is no coming back from this. Don't try to save things. Save yourself the trouble, and walk away cleanly. You *can* do this, and you will feel much better for it.",
            "Sorry, but there is just no way his intentions are innocent. The *best* possible interpretation is that he doesn't plan on physically cheating but he enjoys the ego boost of girls swiping right for him, and maybe wants to get some flirty female friendships out of it. Of course, even that would be grounds to dump him.",
            "Why don't you make a tinder? Make your profile similar to his, with single pictures, one of you in a bikini. He'll run across you eventually and you'll explain you're just looking for friends",
            "Eek. Let me lend you my story since I was actually someone who used tinder once thinking I could meet 'just a friend'. \n\nI'd just had a breakup and was by no means in the mood for romance or touching. Most of my friend circle was close friends with my ex so I didn't have a lot of options or know where to start and tinder was super big so I downloaded it. I put in my little about me thing that I was only seeking friends and none of my pictures of myself were flirtatious or anything, just shoulder-up shots, some including my cat. Flipping through a sea of thirsty faces was pretty entertaining and distracting. I had it set to show me both males and females since I wasn't just looking for male friends (your bf should also have this setting if he's being honest, since looking for just female friends is weird). I judged who I'd swipe left (right? whichever one is \"yes\") on by how many common interests we had (I'm big into music and it had all of my musical preferences taken from FB), not by attractiveness or whatever. Weird ik.\n\n\nStruck up a conversation with a dude named \"Nat\". We liked a lot of the same music and video games. After a few days we agreed to hang out at a hip local coffee shop. I'd expressed to him very seriously that I was NOT in any sort of mood to hook up and I genuinely was using this app for friends (silly me...). We chilled at the coffee shop, it was cool. Talked about pok\u00e9mon and friend things. Got lunch somewhere else in town. He wanted to continue the hangout and I had nothing else going on that day so I said we could hang at my apartment. I thought my roommate would be home and we'd all chill and talk but I got home and we were actually alone. Nervously I continued the hangout to not seem weird. We went into my room and I asked him to show me a pok\u00e9mon online game he'd talked about. We sat on my bed because well it was my only seating option. I got very into the game but he seemed uh...distracted... Soon I noticed that he was trying very hard to initiate \"cuddling\" and I got very scared and only more insistently drew attention to the game I was playing. He seemed annoyed and all I could think was \"why are you doing this\" because I had so clearly expressed my boundaries. He thought they were a joke or me playing hard to get. He'd mentioned loving puppies before so I got up and broke free from his personal-space invasion and let my roommate's puppy out of her room to come play with us. This did distract him. He lit up and started playing with the puppy away from me. But...the puppy got too excited and ended up peeing all over this dude's chest. Ahahahaha, Souffl\u00e9 the yorkie-bischon frisse pup to the rescue. He tried to suppress his disgust but he left shortly after since I obviously didn't want to bang and he now smelled like piss. He never texted me again... :~)\n\n\nOk so, moral of that story is that even if your bf is going into this with the purest heart and most innocent of intentions (which the flirty profile pics with you cropped out make it seem sorta like no), tinder is NOT for making friends. It is absolutely foolish to think otherwise. If he wants FRIENDS and EXCITEMENT, tell him to look at Meetup.com and take a look at the clubs in his area. My town has a lot of adventure/hiking/cycling sort of clubs. You should absolutely assert to him that using a DATING and HOOKUP app to make FRIENDS is idiotic, disrespectful, and unacceptable. If he continues to protest, I think it's time to break up.\n\n\nEdit: I'm a girl if that was unclear.",

            "Sorry but, I'm single and have checked out diff dating apps and sites... when a guy's profile says code words like \"looking for fun\" \"exciting\" and \"hang out\"... that means he's down to fuck.

            "From your willingness to sit on this after he told you that you're being ridiculous about it, I take it that he's been working on manipulating you in general into disbelieving what you know is true for a long time. \n\nHe's obviously trying to cheat using that app.  No one uses it for friends. From what I've heard described,  it's almost entirely looks-based in terms of who you choose to talk to and casual hookups are the normal purpose.  It's simply just for dating. \n\nIn fact, it would be rude of him to meet up with these women if he *were* only looking for friendships because that's not what anyone on that app is trying to get.  If he is telling the truth (he's not) he would be leading on women who want to fuck him by using this app. There are even websites specifically for non-romantic meetups out there, so his story makes no sense in any way. \n\nHe must believe he really has you cowed to play this is off like you're the one with the issue.

Apparently it was because I have tits and am only good for sex. Uhm, all women have tits, so do all men swipe all women? And how the hell is anyone going to know if I'm good in bed from the pretty conservative picture I had on there. It was a messed up relationship. \r\rTinder is bad for relationships generally.

I hope for the future he is able to do so, not only for himself but for the countless individuals that may be cheated as you were.\n\nAs for you OP, I am so sorry to hear this. You must be dealing with so many emotions.

You will just drag them down with you and waste both your energy trying to stay afloat. You stay at rock bottom until your ready, until you have the fight to get back up for your own sake not for someone else who happened to come past.

If you have more questions- keep asking! That's good communication. And if you're still uncomfortable, offer him alternatives like meetup.com and such. Explain why you're uncomfortable. Don't let your relationship crumble over something that could easily be your boyfriend not caring about the stereotypes of a social app. ",
            "I use tinder, I have a 3 year long relationship with a wonderful girl who I would never cheat on. This sub will always jump to the \"leave him/her\" option and its kind of sad because I bet there have been some good relationships that never got to flower because random strangers tell people it won't work.\n\nHonest answer to this is actually a question: do you trust him? My girl was, understandably, EXTREMELY worried when she learned I had a tinder profile and i use it regularly. The best, and really only, ways to become comfortable with this is \n1) Be a part of the process. If he really is using it for friends or just to have a laugh, he should have no problem sharing conversations with you. \n2)Let him no you ARE NOT ok with him using tinder at all, but be aware that this might have some repercussions.\n\nI wish you the best but honestly don't freak out, he hasn't jumped in bed with any of them yet!\n\nEDIT: wow theres alot of untrusting people here :( well back to lurking",
            "As someone who uses Tinder everyday I am just going to say it is completely possible he is just looking for friends. I match with people at least once or twice a week who have profiles that say \" new to the area, just looking for new friends \" and similar things. They even post moments looking for people to do stuff with or looking for drugs etc etc. Tinder use to be for just hook ups but now a lot of people use it to entertain themselves , friends and more. Sure these people may only be a minority but they are something you will see daily if you use the app  I even have a similar personal story where I was helping my sisters boyfriend with a lot of work stuff and he was playing on Tinder. He was just using it as ego boost and my sister was mad about it at first but looked through all his messages and stuff and realized she didn't care and that it was pretty impossible for him to be cheating anyway since they live together and are together literally constantly.  I think if you see he has male and females checked under his settings and he's straight along with some other things its not an indication of cheating at all. I said all of this because its completely possible he isnt doing anything wrong it's also possible he's being an asshole and doing something wrong but just by having a tinder isn't a real indication of one or the other.

To complicate things, our wedding is in 2 weeks. \n\nMy husband played baseball in college. It was his dream to be a professional baseball player. He was able to play in the minors for a short period of time but was eventually cut. After this, he went to a foreign country to play for a few years. About a year and a half ago, he \u201cretired,\u201d moved back to the states, and got an office job. \n\nIn the meantime, I went to law school, graduated, passed the bar, and got a relatively high paying job. I like what I do and, while I don\u2019t know if I want to do this forever, I have no plans of changing jobs anytime soon. \n\nYesterday, Adam told me that he was thinking about going to a different foreign country (with lower standards) to revive his baseball career. He wants me to come with him. \n\nI did not react well, I\u2019ll admit that. I laughed and asked if he was joking and, when it became clear that he wasn\u2019t, got super pissed. I spent a lot of time and money building my career. I\u2019m honestly insulted that he wants me to give it up. \n\nHe says that I could always take a few years off and come back to it when he finishes playing baseball. I argue that I won\u2019t be a particularly desirable candidate to a law firm after taking years off of work. He says I could try to work as a consultant at a foreign firm or at an American firm\u2019s office in that particular country. This would involve changing the area of law that I practice. I practice the type of law that I do because I like it and am good at it. I don\u2019t know if I could be happy practicing in a different area or if I could even get a job with no experience. \n\nHe thinks I\u2019m being unsupportive and has threatened to go regardless of whether I agree to come with. I think he\u2019s being delusional. I know this is harsh and I would never say it like this to him but he tried this and failed twice. Why would he put himself through that again?  If he doesn\u2019t like his current job and wants to do something else, that\u2019s fine. I will support a career change. But I will absolutely not give up my job to chase a dream that will likely never pan out. I know it\u2019s his dream but most people don\u2019t actually get to do their dream job. I feel like he needs to grow up. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this comes off as insensitive. I am just so frustrated. I\u2019m looking for any advice about how to tackle this problem. Do I let him go on his own? Do I put my foot down?\n\nTL;DR:  fianc\u00e9 wants me to give up my job so that he can chase his dream career that he has already tried and failed at twice ",

Hopefully he will come to his senses, but if he doesn't... this is not the guy you should marry. \n\n**EDIT** Something to suggest to him... maybe he needs to search for a new direction for his ambition.

It sounds less like you are not being supportive and more like he has a dream that he needs to be ready to sacrifice for. He isn't willing to sacrifice for it, so he's asking you to sacrifice for it. That's unreasonable and you're not willing. That's the end of it. There's no negotiation to be made here. There's nothing else to do or say. You're not going. He gets to decide what he wants to do with that. If that's not marriage-ending you need to chart a course and STILL NOT GET MARRIED. I don't care how much it costs.

As soon as they show distaste (likely because playing catch with Dad no longer becomes fun because he won\u2019t stop giving pointers and coaching), pull them out and replace it with a new interest.

            "Along with everything else said, I have a suggestion. \n\nWhat if you ask your fiance to pursue baseball, but in a different light? Maybe he can be a school coach or a private coach. He can talk about the experiences he had both in the US and overseas to sell himself to parents that want to train their kids. It would allow him to learn baseball more, and potentially see kids flourish into minors/pros themselves. He is definitely delusional about wanting to go pro himself, but he has a drive to want to continue baseball. If he can channel that into something else, he could make a good living and enjoy it at the same time. \n\nEither way, best of luck!",

It annoys me when people think that because they have a dream that didn't work out everyone has to sacrifice their dreams so they can get more shots.\n\nPersonally I think you should tell him that he should be happy that he got to at least play professionally for a little while. And maybe office jobs suck, but sometimes you gotta grow up and do the things you gotta do. Maybe he can find a job that has a baseball team and he can be a ringer, little bit of a compromise there right?\n\nBut I mean if you don't have kids and you think you all can weather the time apart than that might be an option (albeit the infidelity risk is probably pretty high).",

If that\u2019s correct, he\u2019d probably need to pull off an unexpected success at his new team, parlay that into another Japanese contract, and then have another unexpected success there in order to have any kind of realistic shot at the majors.

Being a professional athlete has been a core part of his identity since he was a child, and he doesn\u2019t want to let go of that because he doesn\u2019t know who he is without it. If you want some insight into his mentality, the book *A False Spring* by Pat Jordan may be helpful - it\u2019s a memoir by an ex-prospect who struggled to re-integrate himself into civilian life after baseball was done with him. Jordan eventually ended up as a sportswriter, and your fianc\u00e9 may gain some comfort from taking a job that\u2019s still connected to the industry - lots of ex-players end up as coaches (pro, college, or high school), scouts, or members of sports media organizations. It sounds like he might also be having some marriage-related anxiety about you being the family breadwinner, which might mean that he\u2019s doing this (consciously or unconsciously) as a last-gasp effort to maintain parity with your legal career.

Getting married can feel like you\u2019re locking in a certain future and forsaking all other possible paths- not just in terms of your spouse but also for your career and generally what type of person you are.\n\nThat said, I have no idea what you should do with this even if it is cold feet. It may be more understandable, but it\u2019s still pretty crappy of him to doing this right now and to not realize how inconsiderate and selfish it is.

Second, it sounds like a financial risk if he\u2019s going to fuck off and go off who knows where, and if you get a divorce it sounds like you make more money than him... so yeah.\n\nPersonally I would postpone the wedding and ask for couples counseling or something. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re marrying him because you guys thought you were on the same page and you never expected him to ever ask you to sacrifice so much. Under the normal circumstances of people just having incompatible life goals, they shouldn\u2019t get married. This guy seems a bit, not mentally unstable I mean, but unstable in that you don\u2019t really know what decision he\u2019s going to make next that will affect your financial/living situation. It\u2019s scary living like that. You could easily marry him and he gets quiet about it for a while, and then he packs up one day and does what he said he\u2019d do, leaving without you.

If he can\u2019t do that for you then think about whether or not he\u2019s right for you and whether you\u2019d really want this to be the father of any kids you may or may not have or if it\u2019s healthy to have someone who doesn\u2019t seem to put you first or appreciate all that you have already done for him while completing law school. I know it\u2019s old school but do you want to take care of him for your whole life or do you want a partner that is more or less in the same pay grade and level of intellect as you? (Not saying he\u2019s not smart but he\u2019s being impractical right now at his age) It really sucks but you need to lay it all out to prevent resentment in your future marriage. Each person has their own deal breakers and this one is yours. I would ask him if he ever thought about your feelings and what his intent was when he asked you for your hand in marriage.

There's still gonna be hundreds if not thousands of people trying for that role, and who will probably be in their late teens/early twenties and just trying for the first time. He played in the minors and was cut instead of snapped up, it indicates that although he may be good, he's not professional level. I think this is all something someone needs to tell him. I'm all for following dreams, but when you have other people to consider and the likelihood is this low, someone needs to make him aware of all of this.\n\nI can 100% see why you're so upset he expects you to give up a job you've studied hard for, and now you get a great wage and you enjoy it. That's hard to find, and it's almost insulting he suggests you go back to square one and learn an entirely new bunch of laws, or just put your career on hold for his third attempt. He's had his shot more than once, this is your shot! He should support you like you've supported him. He already played in another country and had a career out of it, then he retired, which indicates somewhere along the line he wasn't happy with it, be that due to age, his skill, the hours, whatever. Why does he think it won't be the same here?\n\nAfter trying twice to make this work, he can't expect you to blindly follow him a third time, and this kind of disregard he has for your career which is very successful is shocking. It's not as though he can't play as a hobby or even get a job coaching a team, but he needs to start coming to the realisation his dream job unfortunately is probably out of reach now. He moved back home and settled down with you, if he wasn't ready to stop chasing his dreams in other countries then he never should have settled down, he now needs to think about what's best for you too. Marriage is about being a team and doing what's best for you as a couple, and it's a commitment he already isn't really taking seriously. He's being selfish, and I definitely think you ought to put your foot down.\n\nHope it works out!",

            "Aspirations, dreams, reality are all complex things.  From your post it sounds as though the husband has a real passion for baseball.  Perhaps the passion and capability are not well matched, but he is the one who must realize that.  A good friend of mine was married to a bicycle racer - he rose to the level just 1/2 tier from the top.   It was obvious to me that he had plateaued, but he did not believe that and continued on.  My friend had ridden in the Olympics, but she knew when it was enough, and became qualified and hired as a professor at a good university.   She stuck with that until she recently retired.\n\nThe husband kept chasing his dream - until he became ridiculous.  He hung around bike shops, had sponsorships that faded in time, and ended up sitting around the house disgruntled.  He never found a \u201creal job\u201d. he liked.  Finally my friend dumped him - and of all things the divorce court made her pay him support for 8 years, and he got 50% of the property that she basically paid for while he-was screwing around.\n\nSo that story didn\u2019t end well, and the bike guy (I have not seen nor heard from him since the split) is most likely unchanged. He was always waiting around for a new sponsor, but no one sponsors aging losers. I did hear indirectly from a friend that some woman was \u201ckeeping him\u201d at a beach city.  So- if your husband can grow up, assess himself and get in touch with reality then your marriage could be ok.  Keep your day job.  If he must go chase the illusive ball one more time simply give him a leave of absence.\n",

He gave up his wife and kid, friends, jobs, and everything else for \"The dream\" and used alcohol to push down the hurt of rejection. It sounds as your fiance can't see the facts from the dream he's worked his entire life for. I get that it's hard not living up to something they work so hard for. Does his stats match up to any pro? If he was that good, he would have moved up and made more money, and baseball teams are there to make money by winning. If he can't help them win, then he should face reality that he went farther than most ever do. Teams don't cut great players, but they do cut good players so they can get great players. It's a business, pure and simple. Losing a job that is also a lifelong dream is especially tough. His dream has a limited life span due to his body, and I'm willing to bet he's past the median age of a pro player. Sounds like he needs to face reality, as statistically, keeping that dream alive now will cost him his future life, and he can become a shell of his former self if he doesn't face reality.",

The simple fact that he's willing to leave without you is a huge issue, and should be given how many years you've been together and the fact that you've already supported him financially before. He doesn't respect you and your career and just how much dedication it took to get there. \n\nNot that this is anything close to being a lawyer but I tested for my black belt in Taekwondo when I was in my first year of university, before moving to a different city to pursue a technical career that I LOVE. About a year later my bf at the time and I went out one night to watch a UFC match with some of my classmates and their partners. Another woman in the group was also a martial arts black belt which I only discovered after she began critiquing the fighters technique, so we started talking about our style and everyone else asked a tone of questions. It was a good time. My bf had the nerve afterwards to tell me that 'no one wants to hear you talk about how you USED to be a black belt, that's like me talking about how I USED to play football in high school'. \n\nDifference is that I spent five years training multiple times a week to get to that point, broke more bones than I could count and continued to practice and instruct years after he was gone while he played a highschool sport for 3 months of the year and wasn't good enough to make the university team. \n\nIf a man is willing to belittle your dedication and hard work, your accomplishments, then he's either jealous or just self centered.

Even withought noticing, that is also why a lot of them expect YOU to move countries and YOU to stop working and stay home. This is sadly still common and some women see it as normal too.\n\nI agree that supporting your partner is important, but he is not supporting YOU. You are an independent strong self-made woman, this is what you have been working so long for. \n\nI suggest you go on about it like this; explain that your work is important to you and that you do not want to let it go. That this is your dream like that is his dream. But you are willing to give it a chance for him if he does something for you; he can go on his own... get a house/apartment and start his career.

You simply cannot make that kind of sacrifice for his dream of playing professional baseball. \n\nMore practically, he needs to spend some time with a career counselor to figure out what he wants to do with his life. Spending time with a therapist to learn how to move on from his dream is also something he should consider doing. It's not like there aren't jobs he could do related to professional baseball.

If it's really his dream, he'll find a way to make it happen without external support. \n\nIn the meantime figure out what you want. By my math, you two have only really been in a relationship where you're both living as adults in the same city for the past year and a half, and before that he was traveling for his baseball career. So take some time to figure out if you really want to marry this man because of who he is specifically, or if it was about marrying the man you've been committed to for the past 6 years because you've been committed for the past 6 years and you've fallen into a sunk cost fallacy. My guesss is, it's the latter. \n\nYou're 27. That's still fairly young but you don't want to waste another 3-4 years (or more!) on this guy and miss your primo dating and baby making years (if that's what you want) waiting for him to get it together. So as part of your decision-making you should try to figure it out what it is you want in life, and what kind of a partner you want to share it with, and if he is that partner right now.

It was a long-shot back then, it is incredibly hard and lucky to make it as a professional player, and now it just doesn't seem possible. You love him, you believe in him, but you don't believe that he is going to be a professional baseball player. You believe that he is more then that, you love [x,y,z] about him, and you believe that he can find a new dream and a career he can succeed at. Almost any other career has better odds of success then professional sports. There are many people who would have liked to be astronauts or professional sports players or movie stars or president who can't be those things and have to get other jobs. Many of those people are happy. He needs to be able to move on and find another way to be happy. \n\nAlso, you're hurt and disappointed that he seems to think his dreams and job are more important then yours.

He has to show you that he can support you and your dreams back. If he can't do for you what you did for him then he's not marriage material. A marriage isn't all about him and you just follow him around throwing away everything of your own. \n\nSo he needs to decide before the wedding if he is staying here and making a life with you or if he leaving you to run off and try again at almost thirty at professional baseball in a country with lower standards. You will not be following him. And you will not be marrying him if he can't promise to stay. (Fyi don't lie/cover to any friends/family for him. If this doesn't work be honest that 2 weeks before the wedding he decided you needed to quit your law job to move to random ass country so he could play baseball there with no notice or he was leaving you.

Each of those feelings represents an unmet need. You have to empathize with him. He has to empathize with you. Sharing feelings is where you will find common ground that will enable you to brainstorm strategies that meet your needs as a team. Maybe you'll end up deciding he goes abroad for a few months while you work here so he can get this out of his system one last time. Maybe you'll end up deciding that he pursue some schooling that qualifies him for a more exciting/physical job like a nurse or teacher or construction worker. There are 10,000 strategies that could meet your needs, but as long as you're stuck talking about strategies and not feelings you'll be stuck debating eachother instead of working with eachother to make sure all your needs are as met as they can be.

We moved to a town I hated and have lived here for 3.5 years. We are finally done now and though he\u2019s grumbling about the high cost of living, he is now keeping his promise to move home to the city we met in, which I consider home. He has committed to a marriage with you and that means accommodating a whole other persons life, goals, and dreams now too. I suspect he\u2019ll come around to this idea and if he doesn\u2019t, he probably would have made a shit husband anyway. I get that basketball is his passion but he\u2019s 28.

Korea, Taiwan, and Italy are one way trips for guys at the end of their career, or who never had a career. If he had true potential for the bigs, he would would have been signed after high school or college to a good feeder team.

My dad has been in a rec softball league since I was a kid. It\u2019s done through his work but I\u2019ve seen my dad play teams that are just thrown together by people on MeetUp.

Like it\u2019s just a given that because you\u2019re a woman you should be the one to give up your job. This is my bad childhood talking but as a woman, I don\u2019t think I would ever be comfortable giving up my career to let a man \u201ctake care of me.\u201d You need you own thing just in case. Personally, both myself and my male partner work, but I\u2019m happy that if someone HAD to give up their career, he would do it. Makes me feel more secure.",

            "His plan isn't viable and other posts have enumerated the ways it's not far better than I could hope to.  The problem is that his sudden desire to revive his well expired baseball career isn't your only or even biggest problem.  It is what this crazy situation has revealed about your relationship.\n\nThe first issue is trust.  Until now you thought you were on the same page and happy or at least content with the life you were building together.  He destroyed that certainty with his sudden 180.  Assuming you have the talk where he 'sees the light', there will be lingering doubt.  He has broken your belief that he has your back and that doesn't come back easy.  Marriage at this point would be very unwise.  \n\nWhat guarantee do you have that he won't suddenly decide he just *has* to give it one more go?  That it really is his dream etc. even after trying to settle back into his current career?  None.  If he is willing to forego his third comeback, give it a least a year.  Go to therapy together and alone.  Explore baseball related careers for him he might enjoy that won't nuke your career or the stability you've built.  Then decide if you feel safe and happy enough to marry.\n\nThe other issue is equality in the relationship.  You've sacrificed for him.  He's been allowed to pursue his dreams but suddenly you're not allowed to just as you've really started to make them reality?  This speaks to a power imbalance and a lack of reciprocation that may just kill this relationship.  Does he realize how foolish he looks asking you to give up everything for the *third* time and calling you selfish when you won't?  To be honest, him even asking is a huge red flag.  \n\nIf you do compromise, you need to decide if you can deal with the bitterness and resentment you both will feel.  How will you release it?  What timeline?  What help will you seek?  What thresholds/dates/progress will you use?  Don't go into this without a battle plan and an exit plan if the worst happens.\n\nOP, sit him down and have the conversation.  Tell him you've always been proud and supportive of his passion for baseball.  Still, you've had to sacrifice in x, y and z ways and it's been *hard*.  When he left baseball, you were sad for him because you knew how much he loved it but that you had hopes for a more stable and equal future.  Explain that you're sorry for reacting as you did but that this was surprising and you feel like it was a bomb to everything you've built.  Then tell him (maybe again) how much work you put into your career and that this is *your* dream.  List the consequences and how they are not recoverable if he goes.  He's had his two shots.  You need to have yours.  Then see where things go.\n\nI suspect that you've hit a deal breaker.  I'm so sorry for this but some things can't be compromised on and some things shouldn't be.  His crazy plan isn't something you should sign on for.",
            "Major red flag!! HE is the one being unsupportive.  He gives the impression of being uncomfortable having a wife who is more successful than him.  Strongly suggest you reconsider marrying him.  You will probably marry him anyway.  You will probably regret it.",

Not trying to denigrate him, but there is very little chance that this will work out in his favor.\n\nAs a fellow attorney, trying to advance in the legal field with that kind of gap in employment is ridiculous! Especially if you have to change practice areas. You might even have to go back to school. I don't think that going with him is in your best interests.",
