        "selftext": "So I started seeing my therapist a few months ago and after the first session I decided I liked him and felt like I could trust him. We've recently been doing some work on my lack of assertiveness/ inability to call people out if they upset me because I'm scared of hurting their feelings.\n\nI can't exactly remember how the conversation went but he suddenly said \"can I be honest with you? And I hope you trust me enough to listen and not take this personally but from the moment I met you I could tell you were very vulnerable. I knew that if I wanted something more from you than a working relationship, I could have had it. You're in a vulnerable position here, I'm a man who's stronger than you and I could see your vulnerability, I knew you wouldn't say no\"\n\nFirst of all this pissed me off because obviously I would say no, I'm engaged and also am not about to fuck my therapist regardless of my situation. Second of all I found it really creepy and unprofessional. I get the point he was trying to make, I just don't understand why he had to use that theoretical situation. \nThird of all, why the hell was he wondering whether he thinks he could take advantage of me or not in our first session?\n\nAnother important point is that I was raped in the past and he is fully aware of this. He brought it up and said \"I can see how it happened, you didn't give him the right signals that you didn't want to have sex with him. By the way I'm in no way suggesting that it was your fault\" I couldn't help but think that he totally was suggesting that and it really upset me. Also, that's not even true- my rapist was fully aware I did not want to sleep with him. I can't stop thinking about it but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not. Maybe I just didn't want to hear what he said so I'm thinking he's wrong to say those things when in actual fact he's just doing his job?\n\nHe's said other slightly weird things in the past that I've let go and assumed I was being oversensitive but I can't stop thinking about this.\n\nTL:DR Therapist basically said he felt like he could fuck me if he wanted and I probably wouldn't say no. Went on to hint that my rape was my fault. Do I sack him off?",

Chances are they are trying to convinced you. When someone tells you that they aren't racist, listen to what comes after. And when someone tells you that they aren't telling you that something is your fault the odds are pretty high that they just did that or are going to.

He suggested it is your fault you were raped!!! He suggested he would take advantage of you sexually!

He may be completely unaware that his behaviour is unhealthy and extremely unprofessional, but that's a mitigating circumstance that's also a bad thing in its own way.\n\nPlease, please report the incident to his professional association if that's something that can be done where you are.  At best, he is emotionally unstable, not aware of himself or in control of himself, and is likely to repeatedly betray the trust he has cultivated as a therapist with weird sexual overtures.  At worst, he is a sexual predator and a rapist.  No matter which it is, he has probably done this before, and he will certainly do it again.\n\n",

I have been clean since then and I am on a waiting list to see a therapist. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell him about the money for sex, and he didn\u2019t ask me how I was getting all the money.

I get why you'd be scared, but things like HIV aren't the death sentences they used to be - doctors can do so much now BUT ONLY IF ITS CAUGHT EARLY.

You can be a better person now than the person you were, and what happened in the past does not define you- your future, your potential is still unlimited. \n\nHold your head high, accept yourself as you are and strive to be more of the person you want to be. \n\nHold fast, and know you are loved.",

He only did suboxone from the clinic when he stayed there and slowwwwly cut back until his coworker and him made a pact to quit together. \n\nGetting tested is so worth it, most std's are treatable, even HIV has a pill now. I'm sure you already know why you should so I'm just gonna sympathize with being stressed and scared.

You're on the road to recovery, pamper your body like it needs you to and make sure you're healthy. Imo you should give yourself a break from everything else and focus on this ",
            "Congrats on getting clean! As for getting tested, just break it down into simple steps. Like tomorrow, make an appointment. First step. No big deal. Then, think of the next step as going to the appointment. No problem, you can go to an appointment. Third step, talk to the doctor. Not a big deal, that's what they're there for. Just think of it as one thing at a time.",

I know it's scary, but most things are curable, or close to it, and it's just fear holding you back. I promise you won't regret getting those tests, but I also promise that you will regret having put them off if it's too late to treat. And, you may be lucky and don't have anything, and that will be such a relief. Do not have any sexual partners until you're tested. I'm so proud of you for making it so far. Like, damn proud. Hugs.

If you're looking for a way to have someone to support you through getting tested (without telling why), tell your brother that you need to get tested based on your drug usage. I'm not sure if you did use needles, but either way, your brother probably won't press you for more information. And you're not being stupid--you're really not. We all do the same thing, even if it's ignoring bills or not going to the doctor. Set up a plan that will force you to commit (like telling your brother about your appointment) so that you'll be held accountable. Best of luck.",

It is literally one of the scariest things to have to go to the drs for but as I\u2019m sure you know it is very important. But you will do it eventually I know you will.

            "About avoiding getting tested.  All you are doing is preventing you from finding out.  If you're sick, you're already sick.  Being tested doesn't make you sick.  Being tested gives you a chance to get diagnosed and treated.  The alternative is wait and see which means you'd likely be in a worse state than you are now.  I totally relate and honestly I should take my own damn advice, because I get that you're just afraid of knowing.  If you have any reason to believe you actually might have something (and you definitely do), you should be more afraid of what you don't know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, congratulations on the recovery.  Whatever you're afraid of, just remind yourself that you've done the hardest part.  You've gotten clean. You got this. Even if you do have something, modern medicine is such that rarely is an STI contraction unable to be managed.",

            "Good job. It's scary coming to your family but they can detect the changes before you do and were probably waiting on you to come to them, it's obvious that they love you. \n\nThe best thing moving forward is to get tested and make sure you cut ties with the sketchy people that fed your addiction. Those will be the very people that try to drag you back. If you can make it for 2 months, you can make it for 6 months clean. Next thing you know it's a year, two years, and then it becomes a lifestyle thing. Most important to get away from the negative triggers that brought you to your addiction and to find constructive ways to improve yourself daily. I believe you can do it. ",
            "You should talk to your brother, you don't need to tell him everything, just that you need to get tested, sounds like you need support, and he's there for you. He supported you through the worst, he will continue to do so if you let him. best of luck dude. ",

They aren\u2019t you. \n\nWhen you are ready to get tested, you will. You already faced something much more difficult. It\u2019s just one more little mess to clean up. I think all of us want you to get tested now so you can get busy being the healthiest you can be. \n\nPlease know that it\u2019s okay if you haven\u2019t cleared that hurdle yet. I\u2019m very sure you will. Because you\u2019ve already shown that you are the kind of person who can handle facing the consequences of their actions. Now, do yourself a favor and face the testing sooner rather than later.\n\nCon-fucking-gratulations. You should be damn proud.",
            "I completely understand the fear of getting bad news about your health. What I've come to learn, however, is that it's better to know and address a potential health problem than it is to spend months or years worrying you might have one. It's entirely possible you were lucky enough not to contract an STI. Wouldn't it be nice to alleviate your anxiety by finding out for sure? Even HIV isn't a death sentence at this point--as long as you actually manage it.\n\nYou gain nothing by remaining ignorant about your health. And taking control of the issue will work wonders for your anxiety.",
            "If there is a need for medication, I\u2019m not sure what province you\u2019re in (I\u2019m in Ontario) and I got tests done at a public health clinic (came back clean) but during the blood test the nurse explained that they offer medications for STI\u2019s at a reduced cost and some meds were even free! Lots of people get testing done regularly so there barely any stigma attached to it at the clinics. I hope this helps, take care!",
            "Congrats on being clean from the drugs! 2 months is not nothing, and soon it'll be 20, or 200 months!\n\nIf you're scared about a positive HIV test, don't be. It's not a death sentence, and there's less stigma attached to it now. Before you get too freaked out, let me ask you some basic health questions, which you don't have to answer publicly. I've been studying infection and disease, so I know some details about it.\n\nSince you started the sex for money, have there been any times when you caught a really bad flu-like illness, but without vomit or high fever? I'm talking like a 2-week long stint of feeling achy, poorly, tired all the time, headaches, maybe mild fever, that just cleared on its own? This would likely not involve cold-like symptoms, so no congestion, runny nose, coughing, phlegm, or anything like that. \n\nIf no, then there's a very good chance you're completely HIV free, as that's the main signal of a new HIV infection. If you did have such a time, then it's still not 100% a diagnosis, but you definitely should get checked ASAP. The sooner you get checked, the sooner the infection can be kept under control and the likelihood of you experiencing NO side effects or illness symptoms increases!\n\nIt's not even like 20 years ago when you had to take 35 pills a day, religiously at the same time. You still have to take medication at the same time every day without fail, but the Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), I've been told, is down to a single pill once a day.\n\nIf it turns out you do have HIV, that's way different than AIDS. AIDS is the 'acquired immunodeficiency syndrome' that comes from the virus nuking all your CD4 T cells. Those dudes help regulate the response of the rest of your immune system, so if you don't have those, then you tend to catch a lot of other illnesses. Not all HIV patients progress to AIDS, but they are all considered immunocompromised, so folks around you need to make sure they don't come by if they have a nasty illness, or haven't been vaccinated.\n\nAs far as potential partners goes, don't worry about it. You can be HIV positive and still have romantic relationships. You are not broken, or destroyed, and you are still worthy of being loved. Any potential partner would need to know the truth, but there is also medication that they can take to prevent HIV from being able to infect them were they to be exposed. HAART can keep the viral load in your blood so low as to be undetectable and likely not transmittable. HIV cannot be transferred through your skin, saliva, or sweat - only blood and semen. So, if you did have HIV, your partner would take the preventative drug, and you'd have to wear condoms, and be careful about minor cuts and scrapes.\n\nThat's about as big an effect this can have on you, but only if you get tested ASAP. Like I said, most everything else can be cured or treated, so it's not the end of your life, or the end of the world. Please get some support from your brother and make a doctor's appointment for some blood tests :) It'll be okay, I promise.",

Yes, it gets easier with time but it is something you will have to deal with for the rest of your life.

HIV is incredibly difficult to contract, even if having unprotected sex with someone infected it is more probable that you won\u2019t contract it than will. Hope that helps ease your anxiety. \n\nAccording to the CDC you have around a 1.14% chance of having contracted HIV during any individual  unprotected sexual encounter (anal, receptive) with an HIV positive person. Rest easy knowing the numbers are on your side. people here are talking like it\u2019s very likely you might have it, when the truth is it\u2019s not likely at all.

Right now it may seem and feel insurmountable but the reality is, taking the initiative is the biggest hurdle. From there it is all about acceptance. If you have an STD, you KNOW, you accept, you deal with it. The idea of how terrible it *could* be and not knowing the unknown amplifies stress and anxiety. \n\nI'm glad you are taking the steps necessary for a successful recovery. A lot of people take short cuts and avoid therapy, which compromises sobriety. Although you have a long road in front of you, you will get through it.

The longer you wait, the worse things can get. \n\nCall your brother.

But I also hope you can take a lot of comfort in knowing that HIV treatments have come so far that they can actually suppress the viral load in your system with medications so much that for many people, it's not even detectable in your blood anymore. That's a tremendous medical breakthrough and gives HIV positive people a lot of hope and health. Even if you are positive for something, people won't automatically assume it's sexually-transmitted, or even if they do that it's for that reason.\n\nLots of other STDs and blood borne diseases have treatments and cures available for them too. The sooner you diagnose them, the easier they are to address! It's easy to let it go, but you don't want to wait and be guessing every time you feel a symptom if maybe that's what's happening.

And that can even be a woman btw, I\u2019m a female who has sponsored a gay man because he had had a bad experience with a male sponsor and felt more comfortable with me. I\u2019m in recovery from opioids and if you just detox and think that\u2019s enough it won\u2019t be. Look into post acute withdrawal syndrome and work a recovery program please, I want to see you beat this. Look into young peoples meetings in your area.",

            "Get insurance now before you get tested - some companies won\u2019t cover \u201cpreexisting conditions\u201d.\n\nThen please go get tested. \n\nThe earlier you know, the sooner you can start to deal with it. You\u2019ll always have that fear - it won\u2019t go away until you know for sure.\n\n(I\u2019m Canada. I looked into one company and they wouldn\u2019t cover my anxiety medications.)",

            "First of all, congrats on getting clean. As a former iv heroin user who's struggled with sobriety for a few years now, I know how hard it is to take that first step. The hardest part though, is **staying** clean. Do whatever works for you to do that. Meetings. Get a sponsor. Do the work. Its *worth it*. As for getting tested. I know what you're struggling with. Its fucking scary. I made some really stupid choices when I was using. Sharing needles, sex for money. It was bad. I was terrified of getting tested. But the truth is..if you have something..getting tested wont change that. But what it **will** do is give you a chance to fight it and stay alive. HIV and hep c are no joke but medicine has come a long long way in the last 10 years. Hell, Hep C is curable now. I know several people from my NA goups that are living normal lives with HIV. Its 100% not a death sentence anymore. It may feel that way but its not. And you're not alone. From one former addict to another, I believe in you man. You beat the grip opiates had on you and you got clean. Now you can beat this fear too. Take the first step and get tested. Then just take it one day at a time. Knowing your status is scary...not knowing is scarier. You got this. If you ever need to talk my inbox is open. Keep fighting <3",
            "Congrats! \n\nMost STI's are very treatable, but some could cause long term damage or lead to more devastating diseases if untreated. Even the untreatable ones can be managed. You can't change the past now, but you can do your future self a favor. \n\nPS I'm also from Canada. ",
            "Yeah, everyone thinks they are hiding their addiction, when really everyone else just has no idea how to say anything to you.",
            "The longer you wait to get tested the more scared you will get.  Rip that ban-aid off.  HIV is not a death sentence if you end up having that.  You can have a long full life.  \n\nGet tested today or tomorrow.  Just do it.",

            "I have immense respect for anyone who's detoxed off opiates essentially cold turkey. For people who haven't been through opiate withdrawal, it is impossible to explain how bad it is. Like the flu times 1,000.  Most addicts get to a point where it isn't even about getting high anymore, it's about not getting sick and you'll do things you never thought you would to avoid going into withdrawal. It's that bad. \nMost people don't make it through the first day much less a couple wks. It isn't like it's over in a couple days. It is at least a week of absolute physical and mental torture.  I applaud you, OP for having the strength and resolve to get through it.  \n\n\nTake it one step at a time. If you're not ready for the stress of STD testing then wait until you feel more stable but obv don't be having sex with anyone until you know.  You're still in a fragile state only 2 months out so no need to trigger yourself. Wait until you're ready. ",

If you did something that was harmful to your life and they didn't get mad it would mean they didn't care about you. \n\nAmazing job already at taking the necessary steps to improve the situation.  Remember your life isn't over when your family finds out about your problems.  Your life is over once the problems are too big to handle.  Every problem can be solved while its still small, I'm happy you solved it with your brother while it was.",

It\u2019s an outstanding and as soon as you get a sponsor you have 24/7 support.\n\nAnd by the way, even though denial is a hallmark characteristic of addiction, it\u2019s a pretty poor choice when you\u2019re facing a potentially serious health issue.

She was always respectfull and kind, intelligent, pretty. She was great to me while growing up, and she loved kids.\n\n\nLaura is adopted. We all are. Her biological parents died. Our adoptive parents are not bad people but they are very...weird. For example they do not say 'your T-shirt is ugly', they say 'you are ugly'.\n\n\nLaura was studying at University. Had good grades. 2 years ago she got a boyfriend: Jens. He was an asshole. He cheated on her, told her how he wanted to beat her, was mad cause she did not cheat on him etc. He went out with other girls etc. After4 months he broke up with her.\n\n\nLaura had never been the Same. She told us about how Jens would date all his ex's for at least a year. Even the ones he did not love. Laura felt like a loser. To top things of, she had been bullied by the girl he cheated on her with. She was threatening her etc.\n\n\n6 months ago, Laura told out mother that she did not want to return to the city she studied at. We had seen it coming,for 2 weeks she only slept, did not eat. Our mother told her 'To think long and hard' and How she was going to be a 'loser working at a supermarket'. They got into a huge fight and Laura went to bed. \n\n\nThe next morning she was gone. She took a train and further we do not know. She posted on Instagram 'Goodbye'. Police came and our mother was not able to answer a single question: her friends, hobby's, what she liked, the subject of her bachelorpaper,... Our mother could not answer a thing.\n\n\nIt's been 6 months. Police found her. But she told them she wishes to be left in peace. As an adult, they have to respect that.\n\n\nI miss my sister. I am also mad. At her. But especially at my mom, and Jens. For being so mean and hurting her, while in fact she was so sweet. I don't get why she ran away. How she could do that.\n\n\nI feel a lot of anger towards people. I would like to know how I could handle this? And if any of you know or could explain why people run away? Thank you\n\n\nTl;dr: My sister ran away,  I am very mad at people like my mom and her ex-bf for doing this. How do I handle these feelings?",

            "A lot of times people run away because they are being emotionally abused and they don't think the situation can change. They want to put distance between themselves and the abuser so they can heal. \n\nAnd make no mistake, calling someone ugly or telling them they're going to be a loser is very mean. The fact that your mother couldn't answer a single question about Laura is very telling. \n\nHow does your mother treat you?",
            "At 21, your sister is not a runaway. She moved out to be independent. If she wants to work at a supermarket and live on her own that's her choice. It stinks that you are caught in the middle of that choice, but your sister had a right to her own life. Even if that life does not involve your parents. It sounds like she was escaping a toxic situation. \n\nHave you or your brother tried to reach out independently? If you do manage you get her contact info, definitely do not use that time to convince her to come home or tell your parents about her life. ",
            "Laura left for the sake of her own mental health. That is why people go no-contact in these situations.\n\nI understand your frustration and your pain, but she didn't do this to hurt anyone. She did it to save herself.\n\nThe way you describe your parents is very concerning, but because you were raised by them, you might not see it. There's also the possibility that Laura was being treated worse than you realized.\n\n>For example they do not say 'your T-shirt is ugly', they say 'you are ugly'.\n\nThis is flat-out mean. It's not *weird.* Good parents don't say that kind of stuff to their own kids.\n\nYou're still a minor, so it would be difficult for Laura to maintain a relationship with you while continuing to avoid your parents. Once you're an adult, and you've moved out, there may be a chance to get back in contact with her again, provided you respect any boundaries she makes.",
            ">I don't get why she ran away. How could she do that.\n\nYour mom's only involvement in her life was the time spent insulting her. It sounds to me like Laura made a healthy decision to separate herself from the negative presence your mom had in her life. ",
            "Laura did the right thing. She left her abusers (Jens, mom) because there's no way she could be happy in their vicinity. \n\nDon't be mad at Laura, direct your anger to the correct people - Mom for being verbally abusive over the years, Jens for abusing her. ",
            "I am sorry, but your parents are not good parents based on what you wrote and commented. Even just what you described is enough of an explanation for why she ran away. Imagine being in her place where the person supposed to take care of you and love you calls you worthless? However she treats you, she is not a good mom and she has driven your sister away. I'm truly sorry but I think this is the truth and you should try to forgive your sister. If you want to be in her life after you no longer live with your mother, you will probably have to apologize for not standing up for her and be willing to respect her not wanting to see your mother. She may be upset with you and your brother for standing by and letting her be mistreated as well. This isn't your fault, but advise if you want to get back in touch with her and for you to think about how your parents really are. Do not blame yourself as You had no point of reference to know. \n\nEdit: some words",
            "+1 for talk therapy/counselling. It's totally understandable that you have a lot of anger around this. But if I were her, I would've probably run away too. Your mom and Jens are the people who deserve that anger.\n\nRegardless, especially with Jens, the anger is really never going to be productive and is only hurting *you*. Therapy to deal with it is the best thing you can do for yourself.",
            "I think you need to seek professional help. \n\nThere are charities out there that support the families of missing people. They must have had cases like this, where the person is found but wishes to remain uncontacted, before and may be able to point you in the direction of resources you can use, or of support groups that can help you. \n\nThis is an awful lot for you to cope with on your own and it sounds like outside help would be a good start. ",
            "\"You are ugly\" \"loser working in a supermarket\" maybe this has something to do with it, if you were in that situation you would have left too.",
            "Your mom is the real problem. She's abusive so who can really blame your sister for leaving? Perhaps one day she will come back around. It's her life, her choice. Sorry she hasn't given you closure but some times we don't get that. ",
            "My guess is that your sister is not out of your life permanently.\n\nWhile you are 17 - that is, under the age of 18 - she cannot contact you without getting your guardians involved.  That is because you are a minor.  She has wanted to be free of contact with them and it sounds like she has good reason for that.\n\nAlthough she has shut off her instagram etc, there are probably still ways of getting in touch with her.  When you turn 18 you should try.\n\nYou should understand that what is probably most important to her is that you not bring your guardians back into her life.  Until you can promise that you will not do that, she probably will not want anything to do with you.",
            "I agree with the others. You should try to contact her once you move out of the house. Me and my brother lost contact when I moved away from my mom (because of similar abuse), but now we talk pretty frequently now that he moved out, too :)",
            "This is a really tough situation. However, from an outside perspective, it seems that your family is much more dysfunctional than you think. When you've grown up in a dysfunctional family, things become normalized.\n\nYou can't link on this sub, but look up \"dysfunctional family presentation\" and click on the one from SlideShare from Lucia Moreno. Do you identify with anything on that list?",
            "When my sister went to university, she essentially went no contact with my mother since, this was decades ago. For a long time, she didn't contact me even though I missed her, from the age of 12yo-23(or 4) I had talked to my sister maybe 3 times very briefly with the last time essentially saying \"Hey, contact me when you're an independent adult\"\n\nShe kept far from me, because as a teenager I was a conduit to my Mother, when I become an adult I was able to see that what my sister did was smart, and we've had a great relationship without my mother being a part of it for the last few years.\n",
            "\"Our adoptive parents are not bad people but they are very...weird. For example they do not say 'your T-shirt is ugly', they say 'you are ugly'.\"\n\nHon, that isn't 'weird'. That's 'cruel'. It verges on 'emotionally abusive'. If that sort of interaction was common-place in your home, then your parents ARE emotionally abusive.\n\nThat is likely the reason your sister got with Jens in the first place; thanks to how your parents raised you, she is used to equating bad treatment with love. Your parents have literally raised her to believe that if someone is mean to you, it is a sign they love you.\n\nThat isn't normal - it's also very Not Ok.\n\nIn many ways, it sounds like Jens treatment of your sister did her a favour, because it was drastic enough that it broke her 'programming', and made her realise that being treated like that is NOT ok, and you DON'T have to accept it. She came home seeking comfort and support, and your mother literally threw it in her face. No wonder she left.\n\nI appreciate your anger, but towards her, it's misplaced. Don't be mad, be proud. She's broken out. She's taking actual concrete steps to get healthier and be loved, even if it's just by herself. She knew that there was no way for her to get or be treated better while she remained in contact with your family, and she took measures to change it, hard measures. She's forging the path that, if you're lucky, maybe you can take one day as well.\n\nIn the meantime, seek support from other people where you can - friends, or your school counsellor. Recognise that your mom isn't treating you well and try to factor that in when she speaks to you. And recognise that Jens may be an awful person, but something really really good came out of his relationship with your sister; her freedom.",
            "I'm a sister who ran away at a similar age from a (sort of) similar situation. I lost sleep at night worrying about my younger siblings. I missed them all the time and wanted to keep them in my life but I couldn't do that while getting the space I needed from my parents.\n\nIt's okay that you're angry. It's okay that my siblings were angry. She's doing what she needs to do right now and hopefully she will reach out to you when she's ready--and once you move out and start your own life that will be easier for her. Take care of yourself and know that she cares about you.",
            "Emotionally abusive mother, abusive boyfriend - no wonder she took off to find a better place. Try to understand her decision. I hope she's getting help to work through it, you should too. And there's nothing stopping you from contacting her, you weren't part of the problem. Her leaving wasn't about you. Don't take it as a rejection. Or abandonment. It isn't. ",
            "Your parents sound like serious pieces of shit. I suggest you run away as soon as you turn 18. Maybe you can have a relationship with your sister at that point. For now, you represent the life she left behind and she's better off without you. Sorry. ",
            "I don't know that I have anything to add other than what has already been said, but I'd like to reiterate the good things here. I'm glad your brother is here to help you, I'm glad you are open to talking about this and working through it, and I'm glad you have love for your sister. Hopefully you'll be able to find her, independent of your mother, soon. You sound like such a kind and strong soul. I'm thinking of you and sending you lots of love.",
            "Did you use their real names? Sounds very danish. ",
            "Your sister sounds like me. I cut off contact with my entire family because my dad was abusive (physically and emotionally). The sad thing was I had to leave my brother and other relatives in the process, because if I didn't, they would end up keeping me in closer contact with my dad. My brother also was not ready to leave my dad (not his fault), and I could not stay in that abusive environment anymore. I still want to talk to my brother, but can't because I don't know how close he is to my dad, or how understanding he would be of the abuse I feel that I experienced.\n\nI know you must be angry at her, but know that she must be hurting too. She is doing this because the alternative of staying at home is worse.\n\nThe best thing for you to think of is how to take care of yourself. I am so glad you have a brother to talk to about this. Keep talking to him if you both are on the same page. Reach out to your sister once she's had some time to herself.",
            "Your sister is 21 and an adult, she is well within her rights to live where she is happy. \n\nIf you miss her, then you can reach out to her after a while and start to develop a relationship with her WITHOUT your mom or anyone from her old life. \n\nThis is very important for her. If you are going to be in her life, it has to be just you and her and it has to be positive. You can't talk about your mom or her old life. You have to allow her to move and be happy. \n\nYou will be an adult soon and you can have a long and good relationship with her if you do it correctly by letting her live where she wants to live and be positive around her. \n\n\nGood luck.",
            "Im sorry man but it sounds like your mother is an abusive person. Tell me, if your mother treated YOU the way she treats your sister, would you want to stay living there? \n\nMy parents don't abuse me (anymore) but they sure did fuck my life up and my only way to heal and be successful is to move out. The thing is I was forcibly moved 500 miles away from EVERYTHING into a shit town with NO work so I'm wracking my brain and I cry a lot because nothing is going my way. \n\nThink about it this way, your sister is adopted right? Her parents DIED and out of all the foster parents in the world she got hooked up with your folks, who know NOTHING about her life after 21 years, and insult her to her own face and to you, her younger, more impressionable brother, WHEN SHE'S VULNERABLE AFTER AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. \n\nShe is definitely in a better place.\n\nThere's another reddit sub called r/raisedbynarcissists that I think you should read through. Don't post there though unless you think your mother is going to start abusing you. ",
            "Wait a minute. If mom is living off a disability pension, who is she to be slagging off supermarket workers?",
            "A little late to the show but...\nWhen my brother was 18 he left everything behind, blocked anyone related to him on social media, and basically, just vanished. This was in 2008. We still have no idea why.\n\nMy family believes that this is just a phase in my brother's life, and that he will eventually return home. As it has been almost 10 years, I am not so sure. It's hard to not blame yourself. It's hard to not wonder why, was it something I did? Something someone did? \n\nThe only reason we know my brother is alive and well is because of my mother's surprisingly high connections with members of the US military - for example, an admiral recently sent a photo of him getting off a helicopter on an aircraft carrier (he joined the Marines). And we now have some form of contact with him thanks to a stubborn sister who joined the Navy, ran into him, cornered him and demanded that he at least have contact with her kids if no one else. He complied, but that's the extent of the contact. \n\nYour sister is an adult, and it's up to her to stay in contact if she wants. If you know otherwise, don't blame yourself. Forgive her. Forgive your ex. Don't cast blame anywhere. You'll only hurt yourself. Believe me, I know. ",
            "If you can access therapy, it might help. DBT or CBT therapy could be helpful. It sounds like you were all raised in an emotionally abusive environment. There's also a reddit for children of narcissistic parents - you might find some resources there (I'm not sure of the link, sorry). \n\nIt's normal that you would feel anger over these circumstances. And I'm betting you also feel partially responsible and angry at yourself (not that you could have done much, but it's pretty common for people in circumstances like yours to also feel anger and disappointment or guilt). \n\nSelf-compassion in therapy could help as well as DBT or CBT. There are books on those topics if you can't afford therapy or if you're unable to access a service that would provide it free or inexpensively. \n\nYour sister got away. As hard as it is for you to be missing your sister, maybe she is happier and healthier because of it.",
            "Hey. I ran away from home myself when I was 19 - away from my mother, like your sister did. Left up out of nowhere when nobody expected it, and dropped out of uni also. Seems like we have very similar situations. I can try and answer any questions if you have any that may pertain to my situation too. ",
            "Alright, I  think I can give you a bit of perspective here as I was raised in a similar fashion.\n\nMy mother remarried and had essentially stolen me from my father's side. She was a very selfish woman who simply played the single mom pity card a lot. When my brother was born of her and the new husband, I had no value to them.\n\nThings said to me were demoralizing, I'm ugly, I will never achieve anything... Or if I did, it was all credited to them. My little brother, though I now bare no resentment towards him, was the favorite.\n\nGrowing up in that house was a nightmare for me and they encouraged other family members to pick on me and dote on my brother. I saw the abuse while he sadly was rather blind to it. Again, I don't blame him and love him dearly.\n\nBut when I finally decided that as an adult, I have had enough of being treated like less than a turd and cut contact with the parents, I knew it would cost me my brother. But at that point, I also understood that abusers like to be in control, they want to rope you right back in and keep picking at you. It makes them feel better about themselves.  But my brother still couldn't see that and he still can't see that they control him just as much as they tried to control me.\n\nThey use him as a pawn. So in order to regain sanity, I had to stop talking to him as well. Just because he's blind and usable. \n\nMy mental health has greatly improved since the weight of their horrible behaviour has been lifted off of me and I have learned who I am when I'm not reduced to ugly and useless. But I never would had found that if I had stayed in contact with them.\n\nI miss my little brother and if he could be able to see through the fog they have over him, then I would love to have him back in my life. But I doubt it will happen.\n\nSo from being in your sister's shoes, all advice I can offer you is to recognize what abuse, whether it's mental, physical or emotional, looks like. Think hard and long on how your mother treated her, how you and your brother treated her in response.  You were kids. That might have some damper on resentment against you and your other sibling. Maybe one day she'll feel strong enough to say hi. Maybe one day she'll want to reconnect with her siblings, but if she has not at the moment, it's likely because of fear of bring lured back in. Fear of being guilted for wanting to be more than an emotional punching bag.\n\nAnd if that day comes that she wants to reconnect with her siblings, the best thing you can do is to be prepared and start understanding what she went through and be supportive of her decision and respect her choice to have your mother in her life. That's what it would take for me and you have the awesome opportunity to start seeing things as they are and be able to break free from the normalized abuse. Because make no mistake, any parent that calls their child ugly or reduces their choices to ugly is also a parent that does it constantly and reduces a child to nothing. Many of us turn to drugs and alcohol or simply kill themselves.  \n\nI hope one day things are good for you both. But that will definitely depend on your understanding.  I wish you the best. I can assure you, she did not do this to spite or hurt you.",
            "I'm really sorry that this has happened to you. This may not be my place but I honestly thought when you said they found her, you meant her body. Anyways it's not my place to say it could have been worse. But I do think it's unfair to you, your brother, and your sister. If you're mad at your sister then it might be misplaced. I am not saying it is but it's a possibility. I suggest trying to reach out to her without your mother's involvement. Sounds like you love your sister. Your sister might not be ready to talk to you yet but maybe she will eventually. Good luck",
            "I haven't seen my younger sister since 1987. My parents were incredibly abusive. My sister was mentally ill, and rather than getting her help they scapegoated the life out of her.\n\n In the past six years, I have lost my mother, my other younger sister, and her youngest son, who committed suicide roughly 2 years after his mother's death. \n\n All that is to say, I wish I at least knew that my sister is alive or dead, but I can understand why she's gone underground. Verbal abuse is deadly, and compounded by every other kind of abuse that we endured was too much for her to bear.  I hope she found help, I hope she found peace - but I've really always known why she had to go, and I don't resent her for leaving.\n\n I think if you give yourself some time and give her some credit, you will understand why she felt she needed to flee.\n",

            "I'm really sorry, man. It feels really rough and shitty to be separated from a sibling like this. I can only imagine the kind of anger you're going through.  \nI'm not going to justify what your sister did, but I can tell you why I did a similar thing once. When a partner you love so much rips out your heart like this, all you want is to curl up in a ball and die, and you think nobody in the world loves you. It is then that it's imperative for family to show you that no, there are people who will always be there and love you unconditionally. In her case, instead on getting love, she got guilted and shamed. So shamed that she needed to distance herself away from it. She started seeing herself from your mom's (and what she imagined is also yours and your brother's) point of view and she couldn't stand what she saw. She felt ashamed being around and seeing herself as a loser, so she pulled away to save herself.  \nI imagine she needs to work long and hard to pull herself out of this dark hole she's in. But she needs to do it away from the shame. Hopefully she'll get back on her feet and surface again  \nWhat you can do is write her, tell her what you feel about her. Tell her that, regardless of what happened, you miss her and love her. That she's a good person. Tell her what you like about her. Make sure she knows that you're there for her if she ever does decide to make contact again. You can try asking the police if they wouldn't mind forwarding the letter to her",
            "As previously mentioned I've dealt with anger related problems in the past so i might be able to help in some way.\n\nThe loss of someone dear to you hurts us all in some way or another, and being rational beings we tend to try and rationalise our way out of the situation. We are however not always capable of finding an explanation that we deem to be acceptable and that angers some of us and saddens others. What you're most likely dealing with is exactly that. An anger for something that has no validity in the situation. What I'd reccomend is that you seek help. Dealing with this on your own is incredibly difficult unless you're capable of performing an insane level of self evaluation and not only that but you will need to piece the pieces that you gather from self reflecting into something that'll make sense. The help i recommend for you, seeing as how your situation at home doesn't seem to be very helpful, is that you start talking to school councilors and such. I don't know what your brother and sister's take is on the situation they share with you but they are most likely also having difficulties to some degree and thus they would not be as helpful to talk to without third party guidance.\n\nUltimately you'll need to reflect on the situation you're in and how you interract with the situation.getting good at self reflecting will aid you through out your entire life but it'll be difficult and you'll not like it when times are tough but eventually you'll be able to make sense of the tough situations and come out on top of them!\n\n(Writing on mobile...sorry for typos)",

I'm glad that your brother is supporting you and looking after you. \n\nIt's quite shocking that your mother couldn't answer a single question about your sister to the Police. What is she like towards you and your brother? \n\nTo handle your own feelings, it could be worth speaking to a councillor? That way you can let all of your feelings and emotions out to someone who can offer professional help and advice for you! Good luck.",

There are tons of reasons and facts that lead to unhappy situation, some lie under your eyes and make feel you helpless cause still you couldn t do anything to avoid them and some lie in the past and , while you don t completely understand them, you feel they are also  making you miserable, angry and, again,so doomed. \nI bet that lots of your questions  are the same which your sister was tempting to answer as she was leaving your home. Why your mum was so careless or unsensitive. Why she falled in love for that scumbag, how to heal and stop to feel angry, ashamed and worthless.  \nDon t be mad at Laura. Everyone makes mistakes, moreover when we are stressed and maybe in that situation your sister felt she coldn t cope anymore. Maybe you had made the same choise if you were in her shoes. Maybe even you'd rather stop communicate.\nBut I understand that you already understand Laura's reasons and forgive Laura.\nAs for your mother, let me say that parents are always very far from perfection, we make lots of mistakes raising our children even in the best situation. She could be narcissistic as someone pointed out or could have singled out your sister as her scapegoat when she couldn t handle situations simply because she was too ill or too anxious. Surely she didn ' t have a good relationship with Laura and it could be something that went on for long time. As you pointed out she didn t know lots of things about your sister. is it the same with you or your brother or is it different? Why, when your mum and Laura became so Estranged?  talk about all of this with your mum and let  her know your feelings. She owns you not an answer, but to listen to you at least. \nYou seems considerate respectful and pityful, towards your sister and your mum in all you have written with the help of your brother, that I am sure you ll find the best way to handle this disgraceful situation, don t despair.

I started doing martial arts when I was about your age, not from the US though, I know that classes there are expensive af (at least compared to what I pay).  \n But yeah, try doing something like running, body weight excercises (no need for a gym or equipment) or getting a hobby (if you don't have one). I truly hope your sister read this and notices how important she is to you. Take a hug from an internet stranger and keep rocking on :)",

Maybe you could write her a letter where you tell her how angry you are, and then burn it or tear it up? (Or even several letters?) Maybe you could do more exercise to get that anger out? Maybe just talking to someone about it? (though I guess you're already doing that if your brother is helping you, so good job!). \n\nThis situation sounds really tough to deal with. I bet your sister is sorry she had to leave you, as well, but hopefully with time you two will be able to speak again. In the meantime, do your best to work on the anger and let it out in non-destructive ways (e.g. unsent letters, exercise) so that when/if she DOES come back you are ready to listen to her. \n\nIf you're still struggling with this after a few months and you don't think it's getting better, it might be a good idea to find a counsellor or a psychologist to talk about it with. For now though, I think you are managing fine and it's perfectly normal to be angry. ",

        "selftext": "Sister's boyfriend is an aspiring MMA fighter. I think he is a middleweight. He also is a PX90 trainer and fitness coach. Stereotypical \"bro jock.\"\n\n\nMy husband is a science teacher and NOT a jock. Though he happens to have a black belt in judo, which he doesn't go around telling people.\n\n\nSister and her boyfriend were watching football at our apartment last weekend. Talk turned to mixed martial arts, and my sister's boyfriend starts pontificating and humble bragging about how tough it is, and by extension how tough HE is. He goes on and on about how he is \"not a huge guy but can take down anyone,\" and that he has moves that are impossible to counter.\n\n\nHe's about the same height as my own husband (my husband is Japanese; sister's boyfriend is Irish-American) but much more muscular. My husband is fit but very slender. Anyway my husband innocently says that no move is really impossible to counter.\n\n\nSo, since his jock sensibilities were threatened, sister's boyfriend offers to demonstrate an unbreakable hold on my husband. My husband doesn't talk about judo with anyone and not even my sister knows he's a high-ranking expert, so her boyfriend tries to demonstrate the hold, and my husband easily breaks it.\n\n\nSo, he says he was going easy on my husband, and offers to try harder. My husband consents, and this time not only breaks the hold again, but counters the move and holds sister's boyfriend in a compromising, embarrassing position, and tells him to break the hold.\n\n\nSister's boyfriend is totally humiliated and eventually \"surrenders.\" He is humble about it and shakes my husband's hand. Rest of the afternoon seemed to go just fine.\n\n\nBut later on Facebook my sister mentions to me that my husband was being a bully to her boyfriend. In fact my mom called me later and told me to tell my husband to stop showing off, and for him to stop messing with sister's boyfriend.\n\n\nOne would think my husband was stealing candy from children or something.\n\n\nI texted my sister back and said that her boyfriend was the one bragging endlessly about what a badass he thinks he is, and out of nowhere challenges my husband to break an \"impossible\" hold, and so my husband humors him and does exactly that.\n\n\nI personally think my sister is just butthurt because she knows my meek little husband would absolutely smack the shit out of her alpha dog if they had a fight, and she's processing it all like an immature ten year old instead of moving on with her job of... Unemployed.\n\n\nThen she went into a long spiel about how teachers are all corrupt (I'm a teacher too, for history) and just collecting paychecks and doing a lousy job, and how I think that now that I married a foreign person I think I'm exotic now.\n\n\nOuch. Tell me what you really think, sis!\n\n\nI told her that she was acting like some of the middle school kids at mine and my husband's work. Now she's saying that I'm bullying HER by saying that.\n\n\nBut is it true? Was my husband being a bully? It seemed like the other guy had a sporting attitude about being beaten, so I don't get why sister is so mad.\n  \n\nI realize she's proud of her boyfriend being fit or being a cage fighter or whatever but she should know that one shouldn't go around trying to act like you're tougher than everyone else, because eventually someone will check you.\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: My husband made my sister's PX90/MMA boyfriend cry \"mercy\" and now my sister is calling my husband a bully.",

Do you think he'd appreciate you condescending to him like that? Does he know this is what you think of him?\"\n\nOr \n\n\"What happened, happened between two trained fighters. It's between them.

            ">I told her that she was acting like some of the middle school kids\n\nThis is exactly what's happening, OP. They're throwing a tantrum and doubling-down on it.  Maybe, at worst, it was a little sneaky because boyfriend didn't know about your husband's training, but that's like a 0.5/10 on the Bad-move-ometer.  She's being wholly inappropriate and immature,  and probably throwing around the \"bully\" word because she knows it's a hot button issue at schools. ",
            "Your husband is not a bully. This other guy thought his shit didn't stink and your husband, IMHO, actually did him a courtesy - this humbling experience was a lesson to be learned. You are right - your sister is butthurt and being a poor sport. Calling you a bully is her simply pushing delusion to garner support, don't allow it to inflate the situation. I would expect more from someone her age.\n\nYour sister's boyfriend was puffing his chest and didn't have respect for the art - your husband knows more about martial arts, considering his demeanor, and he did something that wouldn't necessarily be out of place for a sensei to do to a student. \n\nWhen I was younger, I had a cousin who claimed that all you need to do to defend yourself, was hit someone in the nuts. He's like 10 or 12 and clearly knows jack shit. My dad works in a dangerous work environment and challenged him.  He ended up hanging my cousin by the ankle and told him, defend yourself. You either learn your lesson among friends or you get burnt hard by your opponents.",

Sysadmin by trade, likes video games and SF movies, he's just about the dictionary definition of \"unassuming.\"\n\nHe's also a kung fu instructor who regularly takes first place at the biggest tournament on this half of the country.  Can casually run across a room on his hands, knows dozens of different weapons, does all his push-ups on his fingertips, all that flashy stuff.\n\nSo, basically, I'm walking into this one already biased? But no, to me, it doesn't sound at all like your husband was in the wrong.  MMA Jock Dude huffed and puffed, and it accomplished nothing.  Some lessons have to be learnt.  People who go on about how they are unbeatable are frequently the easiest to beat. People who think they've found the Perfect Move haven't ever had enough practice, or enough practice partners, and in all honestly I feel like your husband did him a favor.  After all, if it'd been in a real bout it would have been a lot more humiliating.\n\n\n>Then she went into a long spiel about how teachers are all corrupt (I'm a teacher too, for history) and just collecting paychecks and doing a lousy job, and how I think that now that I married a foreign person I think I'm exotic now.\n\nThat sounds a lot like jealousy.

Unemployed.\n\nShe has tied up her own self-worth in her boyfriend's strength/fighting prowess. And, in her own mind at least, had done the same thing to you and your husband, allowing her to  feel superior to you to the extent that she believed her BF could kick your husband's butt. Your husband made clear how ridiculous that notion was and she is now looking for other ways of feeling superior. Like a petulant middle-schooler, as you say.\n\nHer striking out at you and your husband because of feelings of inferiority are the real issue here. Not the interaction between your respective SOs.

            "KarateYuppy, you're being mean and escalating things well beyond whats necessary and appropriate.  Your husbands had a play fight. That's all.  Hell, it was probably more of a bonding exercise if anything. From what I can tell, neither took the fight too seriously. You shouldn't either.\n\nHer husband didn't go about talking about the fight, your sister did. I think you're being a bit too hard on him. Your language shows your obvious disgust with him. \"His jock sensibilities were threatened\". Your husband is just as responsible for the fight as her husband. It takes two to tango. He didn't innocently say that no move is impossible to counter. He's a smart guy (he's a science teacher after all). He knew damn well where that conversation was going. He was excited about the prospect of putting that shit-talking MMA fighter in his place. \n\nAnd you know what? Her husband had it coming, he knew it and was thankful to your husband for not rubbing it in. He's probably pissed that your sister is making a big deal of this.  I don't think he's really at fault for your own problem and probably wants to stop this drama more than you even do. Try to be more open minded about him. Even if he is jocky, he might have other redeeming qualities. Your sister certainly thinks so. I think you can learn to like him.\n\nThe chief instigator here seems to be your family. Your sister for being exceedingly dramatic about what amounts to nothing more than a curfufle. The men don't seem to have any standing dispute with one another. She made their curfufle a much bigger thing than it really was. The men certainly didn't see it as bullying. Maybe ask your husband about how he feels about it. \n\nYour mother on the other hand had no business interfering at all. She didn't text you because she cared about the curfufle. It's because she feeds on drama. That's all this is. It's drama. Your mother loves it, your sister loves it, and YOU love it. Your language shows just how snide you can be. \"my sister is just butthurt\" You go out, and you get into unnecessary fights with your own family. You didn't start the fight but you fed the fire when you started deliberately antagonizing her. \"I told her she was acting like some middle school kids\" Why? Why'd you say that? You need to apologize. Her being mean is no excuse for your own behavior.",
            "Coming from a competitive background ... the interaction of both men was cocky. \n\nSister's bf is loud and bragging. \n\nOP's husband knows that you don't throw an \"innocent\" \"nothing is impossible\" out when talking to a cocky fighter. He knew that it would lead to a confrontation. To which he agreed to as well. \n\nWhich is not wrong. There's nothing wrong with a test of skills between two people. \n\nBoth were confident in their skills (you have to be), but only one will win. I don't see why the loser was \"humiliated\" (OP's words). He lost, shook hands and everything was fine. \nIf OP's husband really thinks that he \"humiliated\" sister's bf, then yes, he is a bully. But I doubt that he thinks that way. \n\nI think the real problem is the women. They don't measure their skills. They measure their own worth by proxy (skills of their bf/husband). OP is glad that her husband \"humiliated\" her sister's husband. To the sister she is worth more than OP, since her bf is not a \"bully\". They get their mother involved. They insult their employment status/job or the race. \n\nOP look at yourself and figure out what the fuck is wrong with your relationship with your sister. And then talk to her and try to fix it. All you talked about in your post are symptoms, but not the reason. \"The internet agreed with me that my husband is not a bully\" will not help. ",

            "This has very little to do with what actually happened, as I think you already know, and everything to do with jealousy issues between you and your younger sibling. You have a husband (who sounds like a catch by the way), she has a boyfriend. You have a career, she doesn't even have a job. \n\nShe was likely counting \"my boyfriend is a manly muscular MMA guy who can kick anyone's ass\" as part of what made her cool and interesting. This in turn is used as a bulwark against the stuff in her life that is not going so great. Your husband demonstrated that this was not in fact the case and she reacted negatively because her sense of sefl-worth is fragile right now. \n\nIf you're close enough with her to do so, try not to escalate this situation. She's being ridiculous, but she's lashing out because she is hurting right now. If you can find ways to be supportive and be there for her instead of making this into an even bigger conflict, she will remember this when she's in a better place, and likely be grateful (I mean, assuming she isn't just generally awful).

They normally have taken a couple of years of something or other at a school teaching cardio to non-fighters, and when nothing works like they expect it to, they leave a real school for one that fits there narrative and where they can get by solely on size and strength or in very very rare cases conditioning.\n\nYour husband is not a bully, and has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact he did bro-friend a huge favor. If bro-friend is really an aspiring MMA fighter and not just a professional MMA talker, and he is actually planning to take a fight, he had a bad time coming.

If the intent is to put someone in a hold they can't get out of, that is fine too, but intentionally causing pain and humiliation beyond what was tacitly agreed upon is not ok.\n\nAlso, a more experienced person putting a braggart in their place, say, in a dojo is way more acceptable because everyone in a dojo has agreed to fit into the teaching environment of the dojo, and someone with his attitude can be dangerous there, rather than just annoying if they are out on the street bragging about their skills, and they will be a continual liability until they are corrected, rather than just as a one off thing.",

I'm still so mad that he thinks those 2 things are at all equal.\n\nI just don't know how to get it through his head that I need actual time for stress relief. He always acts like if I want to go out for a coffee or have a glass of wine and have a nice bath or something that I'm taking extra time on top of all the \"me time\" he thinks I'm already getting. Like I am unfairly burdening him with watching the kids when he already works 8hrs a day. \n\nHe just was on 3.5 months of parental leave and said it's so stressful watching the kids 24/7 and would give me breaks a lot.

My sister has a similar situation and so did I 10 years before her. We both realized that being a single mom was actually easier. If you're doing all the childcare and housework anyway, may as well not have the added grief of a man that doesn't help and also wants his meals made for him and wants to be c leaned up after. My ex even called it \"babysitting\" while he cared for our kids when I was at work.

When he announces that he's going out with the boys on Friday, be ready with \"cool, I'm going out with the girls on Saturday, you'll be fine with the kids\".\n\nAlso, when he gets out of the shower, ask him if he enjoyed his \"self care\" time. Make the point that if your shower counts as \"me time\", so does his.\n\nFinally, it sounds like he's babysitting or \"helping with the kids\".

            "You work 24/7 because \"watching his kids for a minute\" is not him parenting. You don't get to \"come home FROM work.\" Meeting children's needs all day is work. \n\nI am a parent and was a preschool teacher for many years. Being with children is exhausting because their needs are many and constant.  Washing your hair, using the toilet, feeding yourself IS NOT ME TIME. \n\n\nChildren need a type of constant physical and emotional availability, planning and execution that takes being 100% on top of everything including everything else that is going on in the home, like maintaining it and doing laundry, cooking, Dr appointments, Dental appointments.....\n\nYour husband just thinks you can do it all with your eyes closed and that it's no big deal. He leaves his work at work, and gets to come home and have a change of scenery, a change of pace, some fun with his kids who were taken care of all day by you, so they are probably feeling pretty great when he gets home, if a little hungry because maybe it's dinner time.\n\nYou need to get out of the house, away from everybody. Get a calendar where he can see it and write in your time. If my husband goes sailing or goes off with friends, I count those hours and demand them in return. At first this pissed him off because it tapped into his own childhood crap of being forced to do more work if \"caught\" having fun, and he would complain that if he wanted to have fun he had to suffer for it or pay for it, and I had to raise my hand and remind him who would be doing it while he was out. \n\nHe tried to tell me that I was doing those things anyway, so it was not like I was working harder, but I reminded him that I deserved time away to do fun things too, and I deserved to have someone take up the work for me while I got to choose what I would do with several hours at a time just like he was doing.

By that logic, he spends 40 hours a week having \u201cme time\u201d. He just calls it \u201cbeing at work\u201d. \n\nPerhaps if you explained it to him like that the penny might drop? This is how resentment brews, however it\u2019s not beyond saving. \n\nTry to put things in terms he\u2019ll understand. The kids aren\u2019t just a burden, they\u2019re your children. Yes I know kids can be little bastards now and then but, as I\u2019m sure you know, this is part of being a parent. He shouldn\u2019t be considering *every* moment with them a burden and *every* moment away a treat. \n\nThat aside though, just express to him that just because the kids aren\u2019t present doesn\u2019t instantly equal rest, relief and relaxation.\n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude0a\u270c\ufe0f",

And honestly, half the time I would rather not even bother to ask him to watch her because I feel like he doesn't try to be more involved with her, like getting down and playing with her and her toys or just going to do something fun with her. I think it will get better when she's older and can talk more and walk more, but that doesn't help me now. I try telling him what bothers me, as well as try getting him to address anything that I'm doing that bothers him, but he just shrugs it off.\n\nEdit: a word",
            "Just go out for drinks with your friends? He can watch the kids. Or he can watch them 50% of the time after you leave him, the selfish ass.",
            "He works 8 hours a day. How many hours a day are you working in the home? \n\nWhen he gets home, he can take a short break to decompress, but then you and he should be sharing the chores for the rest of the day. \n\nWorking 8 hours a day doesn\u2019t absolve anyone from chores. We all have to do them. \n\nThere\u2019s an old saying. \u201cA man may work from sun to sun, but a woman\u2019s work is never done.\u201d  This is bullshit and we need to destroy this old idea. Men need to be just as involved.",
            "He doesn't think taking care of the kids is a real job. He doesn't respect it as real work.",
            "You guys need a couples therapist. Stat. Something is up here. You cant make him do anything. What he is doing speaks volumes about how he feels for you and your family together, however.",
            "Are you two Hispanic?  I don\u2019t mean anything by it I grew up in a Hispanic household and it sounds pretty close to that.  Mom took care of everything and dad worked all day and on his days off he would chill.  Mom never got a day off.  Im not saying it\u2019s right and I hope when I get married I have a different outlook, but it might just be a cultural thing which will be so hard to change.  Possible, but hard.",
            "I think more than one issue here. Firstly which is bothering you the most? His ignorance or your struggle with housework and forgetfulness? From what you\u2019ve written it sounds like you don\u2019t have anything outside of housework and the kids. Are they all young or at school? Have you tried writing a list every day of what you need to do or having an app that can do it. It might help with remembering. I wouldn\u2019t assume ADHD it could be many different things maybe even depression. He needs to grow up and realise that the children are his too and he needs to share the responsibility. You\u2019re entitled to do things independent of the children just as much as him. This might be partly why you\u2019re having trouble finishing things and remembering",
            "These are indeed stuff for you but you have you time as in entertainment/anti stressor and you got\u2026 wel the rest.\n\nAsk him if he thinks doing groceries or going to the doctor is fun or as fun as going to the bar, getting a manacure, spa day etc or anything equivalent for him.\n\nThhe answer is obvious and shouldn\u2019t even need to be said, taking care of your self is the most basic of basic. That\u2019s how it should be and to not live an empty life just maintaining your care, you let yourself loose and enjoy something as well.",
            "Your husband 100% understands these things. He just knows that he's in a better position in this marriage than you are and he can maintain that position by continuing to play dumb. It has worked so far. You have continued to allow him to get away with it. If you want the behavior to change, force the issue and stop making excuses for him. He doesn't have to \"understand.\" He just has to change his behavior.",
            "You can't make him understand. You can only schedule your time. \n\nStop justifying it and go. Get a sitter if you have to. You married a troglodyte, it's on you to protect yourself and your kids.",

            "I need some me time..to do the laundry",
            "There\u2019s a reason why he went for some a decade younger than him and this is it. He doesn\u2019t have to respect you and you don\u2019t consider leaving.",
            "Is he willing to consider couples counselling? Since he isn't listening to you, perhaps he will listen to a counsellor. The alternative is that you fit in all the self-care you can on the alternate weekends that he gets the kids.",
            "On his next day off just hand him the kids and walk out the door.  Go enjoy your day however you like.  Go to lunch with your friends, go to a movie, go shopping, go to the spa, etc...  Spend the same amount of time doing what you want as he does doing what he wants like drinks with friends.   Unless you are breastfeeding a newborn there is no reason Dad can't give Mom a real break.",
            "Your husband sounds horrible, OP. I\u2019m sorry but I doubt you can get him to understand - he\u2019s wilfully being selfish. If he loved and respected you, he would want more for you than this.\n\nOne thing I feel like many people misunderstand about stay-at-home-parent dynamics is that being a homemaker is your job. That means that while he\u2019s working, you\u2019re doing that job. When he\u2019s not working, household chores and childcare are both of your responsibility. So many parents are disrespected by their partners who act like because they don\u2019t work in an office, everything else is their responsibility. If it\u2019s possible, I would consider leaving this man. It\u2019s just so sad what he\u2019s doing to you.",
            "You guys need therapy so that an outsider can talk to your husband about how his actions are negatively impacting you. No offense but your husband seems kind of spoiled. You are enabling his entitled behavior and you need to speak up for yourself and explain to him in a more serious manner. If he complains, maybe suggest spending some money for a sitter. Mental health is very important!",
            "If he's acting like that already then either lay down the law or get used to it because it will not get better on it's own",

            "THIS. \n\nSO MUCH THIS. \n\nThank you for writing your post!\n\nIn our household, it's the opposite. Me, the husband, is so busy while the wife gets \"breaks\". We're just in different spots in our lives, in our careers, so... good for her, I guess. \n\nBut she's like, \"you haven't even seen the kids!\" After working overtime and then coming home and studying for licensure and running errands and doing work around the house... \"you barely see the kids how can you be so cranky\"????\n\nThey're all NEGATIVE activities. Running errands, doing chores, going to a doctor's appointment. I know I may literally be child-free while doing this work, but it is still NEGATIVE activities. \n\nIf your whole day is full of nothing but negative activities, of course you're going to be in a bad mood!\n\nHe's child free... out at a bar socializing. That is a POSITIVE activity. \n\nHe's child free doing something POSITIVE (bar)\n\nYou're child free doing something NEGATIVE (errands / chores)",
            "Sounds like a controling asshole. I love when my wife goes out for \"me time\" it gives me time alone with kids that I treasure, greatly. My only complaint is my wife doesn't go out enough. On some really special occasions the kids are at a grandparent's house and my wife is out with friends and I get some peace and quiet to watch TV, smoke pot, and get munchy food delivered. It doesn't sound like an exciting life, but as a former alcoholic and intense partier, I've never been happier.",
            "Your post history makes my heart break. You deserve so much better than this person. You deserve to be a full human, and you deserve life where you're respected.\n\nPlease, please, please. Get out of there.",
            "Dude I found you on Instagram and I found your account here. Leave. Your. Husband. He's an abusive piece of shit who has no regard for you or HIS children. He tells you to lose weight and never gives you time for yourself. You would definitely be considering divorce I wouldn't even give it couples therapy. You should keep going to the doctors to help with your mental health and focus on yourself. \nI'm assuming you don't have family support in this situation but I would try to see if you can make some friends somewhere? You need to be able to leave him. He's holding everything above your head as he's probably in charge of all the finances. You would be better off as a single mother with child support checks coming in from him. \nWrite down every shitty thing he's done in great detail and please realize this behaviour is not normal and he will not change. Don't be optimistic about this. \nAn idea is if you need money and he's the only one you can get it from, ask him if you can do things to \"make you prettier\" or play them off as ways to make you seem more attractive but pocket the money instead so you can get away. You're in Canada I think you should move provinces, somewhere more crowded with more people and more help as well. \nYou gotta get out before it's too late OP.",
            "From your post history he seems like a giant AH. Constantly yelling at SOMEONE, getting in trouble at work for arguing, treating you like garbage. You need to tell him to get his shit together or you need to leave. It's not going to get better for you or your kids."
