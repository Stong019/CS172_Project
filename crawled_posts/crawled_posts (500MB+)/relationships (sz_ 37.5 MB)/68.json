        "selftext": "To summarize the last post, I posted a Ryan Reynolds meme about Santa Claus not being real on Facebook which my 13-year-old niece saw. My sister flipped out about it and wanted me to publicly rescind and say how Santa is real, but I thought my nieces were too old to believe in that stuff and refused. It lead to a crazy fight between us. Link to the [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4ad97e/me_32f_posted_on_facebook_about_santa_claus_not/).\n\nAnyway, I talked to my nieces and neither of them believe in Santa, so they were baffled about the fight. I talked to my BIL and he said my sister has been flying off the handle lately. We agreed she should probably get a check up and he convinced her to go to the doctor. \n\nOnto the update. They did a MRI and nothing showed up. Then they did some bloodwork which looked fine, except some elevated cholesterol. She isn't pregnant. They pretty much wrote her off as a crazy person and sent her to a psychologist for stress. After a session, the psychologist told her to do some \"deep breathing\" and sent her away as fixed.\n\nShe got worse. She stopped sleeping and barely ate, yet still gained weight. Any small annoyance would send her into a rage. Commercials were making her so upset she would ugly cry. I asked my BIL if they tested hormone levels or anything like that and he said the doctors didn't feel it was necessary.\n\nShe called me one day crying and apologizing, saying she was the worst sister ever and I had every right to hate her. She was so devastated she ruined our relationship and such. It was weird and NOT my sister, so when I got a chance to speak I told her she was going to go see my doctor and I wasn't taking no for an answer. I set up an appointment and my doctor ordered a full blood panel including hormone and vitamins before my sister drove to town for her appointment.\n\nWhen my sister drove up we spent the morning shopping and she was unpredictable. One minute she was happy and the next yelling about some perceived sight (\"That fucking pretentious makeup counter bitch just looked at me funny for my cheap drug store makeup.\"). It was uncomfortable, So I just walked on eggshells to keep her from exploding.\n\nAnyway, results of the bloodwork and a good doctor: perimenopause. Her hormones are completely abnormal. None of her doctors would even consider it because she was \"too young\" for menopause, so they didn't even bother running the tests. She'll be coming up with a care plan with my doctor for hormone replacement therapy and diet change to hopefully get back on track.\n\nShe still a nutcase right now. For example, she called me crying the other night because she will never have more kids (wha...her husband had a vasectomy years ago). I'm driving to her place next weekend and we're going to batch cook a bunch of meals for her new diet plan (I'll be doing it with her as I could stand to eat healthier). So it'll be a slow process, but we have a diagnosis and plan. I'm just taking her outbursts as \"crazy hormones\" right now because it'll take awhile to even out. \n\nI got her a dark chocolate cake for Easter that said, \"Happy Reverse Easter (when the Easter Bunny takes back your eggs)\" because I'm kind of a jerk. She thought it was hilarious though, so we are good.\n\n**TL/DR;** Sister is going through perimenopause, so she's irrationally, but understandably nutty right now. Oh, and Santa Claus still doesn't exist.\n\n**Edit:** Removed the comment about being bipolar. Though my SIL has professionally diagnosed bipolarism and does have wildly swinging moods within minutes sometimes (though usually a manic high or low lasts weeks), it wasn't my intention to slur a group of people. My sister was acting very much like my SIL can act sometimes, so it was the best reference I could make. I apologize for offending anybody.",

            "> perimenopause. Her hormones are completely abnormal. \n\nHoly crap when my mom went through this (before she got onto hormone treatments to balance her out) she legit acted like a crazy person, so I know *exactly* what you're going through. \n\nMy dad gave her an ultimatum to get it checked out because her behavior towards us was getting so irrational and violent, especially me. That's the one and only time I've ever heard divorce mentioned under my roof, because my dad said flat-out to her in the midst of a terrible argument he could not live like that any longer. \n\nNow she's post-menopause after getting hormone treatments and you would have *never* imagined she behaved that way in the past.

            "Good for you!  As women who have had children, our hormone levels should be checked often.  I had the same issue as your sister.  I was told by my doctor that I was clinically depressed and was given pills for depression.  When they didn't work, I was told to double the dose.  That's when I knew something was off.  I went to a psychologist and was told I just needed to give the depression pills time to work, so I stopped doing that too.  Finally I found a doctor that worked in bio-identical hormones.  He did all the blood work and lo and behold, my body had stopped producing the needed levels of estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.  After a new diet plan (paleo) and some good compounding hormone replacement therapy, I'm as good as new.  \n\nI wish your sister all the best.  This is not easy to go through.  You can't control your emotions when your levels are off, no matter how hard you try.  Also, you are a great sister for not giving up and recognizing this might be the issue.  ",

            "I suffer from PMDD and can relate to what your sister is experiencing. Props to you for getting to the bottom of what has been causing it because so many people can be miss diagnosed with a mental illness when the symptoms are actually caused by hormone imbalances. These sorts of things can destroy relationships because it is awful being on the receiving end, it is really good of you to have stuck by her through this. The apologising thing in my experience comes from having a moment of clarity when you can truly see how irrational you have been and how much you have hurt the people around you, its horrible but it still doesn't stop you from switching back to crazy within the hour. I hope she gets better soon.",
            "You, ma'am, are an AMAZING sister. Well done. She will be so grateful when her hormones are back under control (as will her husband and kids). I hope I have someone who looks out for me as well as you looked out for her. \n\nI hope your sister starts feeling better soon, and take yourself out for a VERY well earned spa day. You deserve it.",
            "A lot of doctors just write off emotional disturbances in women as depression or, if they're less professional about it, \"just being an emotional woman.\"  Good on you for pushing to get a second opinion and find the root of the problem.  I have PMDD, and many people, including doctors, don't realize how much hormone disturbances can mess you up.\n\nAnd the cake sounds awesome, it sounds like she's got a pretty decent attitude about it now that there's a diagnosis.",

            "Good for you.  It is not actually too early for perimenopause at 36, doctors are sometimes just too prone to say \"Yeah, whatevs, you're just being a drama queen.\"  It's surprising with her mood swings her own doctors hadn't pulled the hormone panel.  Hopefully she will get some relief with proper meds control, but yeah - perimenopause is a bitch on your mood swings.  My sister had a tubal ligation in her late 20's and had to go back on birth control in her late 30's to get her mood swings to settle down.\n\nFor the record, I think the Reverse Easter cake is fucking awesome.",

I was like \"are you kidding???\" And my friend says no and that she wants her to still believe. Personally, I know the daughter has been made fun of in school for it, as if she isn't awkward enough.

            "This happened to a family friend, and the family just imploded. We were all hearing about things through the grapevine, and this was a mothering figure I spent every child hood summer with (all of us kids were the same age and we knew all the parents well, and were raised as a village until about college age and drifted apart). There were DV reports, kids started to fail classes and act out, and the couple divorced. The wife had been told *this is the issue, and this is how to fix it* and refused to believe she was the problem. In the divorce she went after everything, and when she didn't get the kids *she went after the kids' stuff* \n\nIt was really messed up and made me sad, but now the kids are grown up and she's just out of the picture. I'm friends with the daughter on Facebook and every family related post is just her dad. \n\nI'm so glad you're on her side on this, and that she wants to get better. It's a rough road because hormone treatment is finicky and different for everyone. Good luck!!",

It didn't get a lot of attention and it was a good result so I forgot about it. I believe I called her the night I posted and pretty much told her what I said I was going to tell her. I let her know that I really wanted her to get the job and then asked her if she knew she smelled (in a more tactful way - can't remember the exact words). She said she did know and the conversation went from there. She didn't give me the exact reason why and I didn't ask. I mentioned that since our work requires a uniform (I wear mine a few times before washing because it's an office job and I don't sweat), she should be washing hers often if she got the job. She was thankful that I brought it up with her. I followed up with talking about the job and giving her other advice about applying.\n\n\nShe actually did end up getting the job with me (yay!) and has become more hygienic. She's still not the cleanest but she doesn't smell like she used to and her car/room don't have the same heavy odor. To be honest, I forgot for a while that we even talked about this and almost forgot that this was even an issue before. I don't think she really remembers, either. It was a fairly easy conversation once I told her and it didn't change anything about our friendship. I wish I had told her sooner, but I'm glad I did tell her.\n\nKind of a boring update, but a good one. :)\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Told a friend a while ago that she smelled. She appreciated my honesty, we are still friends and she got the job!",

They gave her some extra cash for dry cleaning and a $400 gift card to buy some fresh clothes, but she was beyond offended. She couldn't believe they told her that. She did freshen up her wardrobe and began cleaning her clothes more often and showering every day, but that only lasted for a few months. ",

        "selftext": "Hello Reddit! I'm normally a lurker and can't think of a better name for this account right now.\n\nI met my husband 6 years ago when we both had just graduated college. He was a lovely guy, handsome and very well put together. He loved muscle cars and weight lifting and I loved everything about him. I fell in love with him instantly and was over the moon when he asked me to marry him.\n\nA year into our marriage, I became pregnant with our son and gained about 30 lbs. I was 5'3\" 125 lbs before the baby and 155 lbs after the baby. I still fit into the same clothing sizes so I didn't think I had gained too much weight and that it would come off with breastfeeding and some more exercise. \n\nAfter the baby, my husband started pressuring me to lose the weight. He said that his friends were making comments about how fat I had gotten and that he was not as attracted to me as he was before I had the baby. He gave me an ultimatum that I either would have to lose the 30 lbs in six months or he would leave me. I was very upset about the demand, but I didn't want to lose him so I tried my hardest to lose the weight.\n\nEvery day for months I would wake up and go to hot yoga for 90 minutes. After I got home from work, I would run or do some bodyweight exercises. I tried to keep my calorie count below 1200 so that I would lose 2 or more lbs per week. The weight slowly but surely started to come off and I was back down to 130 lbs by the end of the six months. My husband was happy and things looked like they would be okay.\n\nAfter I lost the weight, I noticed a shift in the attitude of my husband's friends. Most of them are perfectly nice guys, but a few of them are absolute pieces of shit (the same ones who called me fat). Once I returned to my old weight, these friends started to make comments about me and how sexy I was. I told my husband to make them stop and he said that he would speak with them, but the rude comments never stopped. I channeled all of my frustrations into working out and I lost an additional 15 lbs of body fat and got more toned.\n\nThis past weekend, my husband's friends were over at the house and one of them grabbed me and tried to grope me. I told my husband and even though he was angry at his friend, he was still angry at me. My husband said that I was leading his friends on by losing so much weight and that I was trying to make myself skinny so that I could cheat on him. I was disgusted by this accusation and packed my bags and left for my mom's house.\n\nLast night, my husband called me and begged for me to come back home. He says that he knows that he was unfair and that he won't let his friend come over anymore, but I am so tired of dealing with this that I'm not sure I want him back. He's the one that told me to lose weight, but now he's blaming me for being too skinny and I'm afraid he's going to make me develop an eating disorder. But I also still love my husband and it hurts me to be apart from him.\n\nI'm so confused and I'm not sure what to do.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Had a baby and gained weight, husband told me to either lose the weight or leave. I lose the weight and then some and husband's friends started hitting on me. Husband blamed me for it and I left him. He called me yesterday asking for a second chance and I don't know if I should give him one.",

You were leading him on.\" That's *never okay* unless you actually were intentionally, overtly, and unambiguously encouraging the friend. \n\nIt's another thing for a spouse to forget that he demanded that you lose weight, then accuse you of doing it to be able to cheat on him. \n\nIt seems from your story that he doesn't trust you (he thinks you want to cheat on him), he doesn't value you as a person (he threatened to leave you if you did not lose 30 pounds in 6 months, going from somewhat overweight to a reasonably light build), and he continues to associate with people who do not treat you with respect. \n \nYour husband does not sound like a nice man to me.

            "Do NOT go back to him. Threatening to leave you if you don't do what he wants is emotional abuse. You made the right choice. Be strong.",
            "Leaving him is the right decision. Not only is it not healthy for you, but if this relationship continued, there is a chance your child will see this relationship as an example of an acceptable situation. ",
            "Anyone that accuses their SO of cheating, when they clearly haven't is obviously feeling guilty of something. Dump him, take your baby, and tell him he needs help ASAP.",

            "Hey, the problem was never you - the problem was your husbands friends and his over reliance on their opinion. If my friends said anything negative about the weight of my partner, whoa, would they get their ears blistered. But that you were groped and harassed and he didn't take up for you? This guy will never be on your side when his friends are involved. That's technically assault and his impulse was to BLAME you!!! You will have a better life without him and his fucked up asshole friends in  it. ",
            "First off I want to say congratulations on the weight loss!  That is awesome progress in a short time,  and I can see you worked very hard to do so. Nice :) \n\nOn another note,  the way he's acting is unacceptable.  Even the weight loss ultimatum was unacceptable.  This guy sounds abusive,  at least emotionally.  You were strong enough to lose that weight,  you are strong enough to walk away from this guy, never look back,  you deserve better. ",
            "Tell him off why you won't go back with him.\n\n\n1) he) cared so much of what they said about you/him.( wanting their approval) \n\n\n2) he made you lose the weight BTW congratulations on that! \n\n\n\n3) he didnt stop them/ kick them out when you told him to make them stop. \n\n\n4) giving you that bs shit that you lost the weight to cheat on him.\n\n\n\n5)which leads to this: if they would have raped you he would blame you that you cheated on him.\n \n\n Until he really understands what's more important to him his friends or you, he will continue. \n\n\nTell him you lost the weight for him and only him  , he didn't defend you at all. He would rather have his friends approval then be by your side. And seriously he threatened to leave you if you didn't lose the weight and now he thinks you lost the weight to cheat him?!? Even though you told him to tell his stupid\"  friends \"to stop and he just let them be in your home after that? Wtf man! He so stupid. He cares too much of what they say and not your feeling .\n\n\n\nIf you really want to make it work, make him lose those friends for good, go to couples counseling, also he should just love you for you, but really great work on your hot body man.\n\n\n If anything you'll be hot for yourself and no one else :) good luck man! Sorry if my advise suck. I just wrote down what I thought.",
            "> He loved muscle cars and weight lifting\n\nConsidering you gave these as his two top selling points, I am not at all surprised at his behaviour.",
            "While I agree with most comments here, I feel like we're not getting the whole story. You married this guy, and you must have known what he was like. Maybe he didn't have an opinion on your size/weight but did he make negative comments about obese people? \n    \nI think that marriage is one of the hardest relationships and I truly hope you have the strength to lay it out for him and get through this. I lost 140lbs AFTER I was married and my husband loves to brag about my success and while his friends are respectful, I enjoy their comments about how great I look. He might brag about you which leads his friends to the belief that they can say inappropriate things. \n    \nLet him know that his friends are derogatory and insulting. If you plan to work this out, talk to his friends yourself. They will either respect you or not understand. At that point, you have stood up for yourself, stood up for your family, and earned respect. . . versus walking away from a marriage that maybe didn't need to end. I wish you the best. ",

            "I can see where this is difficult because your heart is saying one thing and your brain is saying another. 6 Years with this man. Your husband and the father of your child. Especially because a child is in the picture, it complicates things. This isn't so black and white, and while I get that, I still do think you are stronger than all of this, and that you and your child will be happier in the long run without him (or his disgusting friends).\n\nSo let's really think about this....\n\nHe gave you an ultimatum. You satisfied it. You get hit on. *You* **get** hit on. Not *you* **hit on them**. And he blames you for it?\n\nI think this husband of yours doesn't have his shit together. You need to do what makes you happy -- and initially, satisfying *his* ultimatum to make him happy was a way to also make *you* happy (if I may say so). Now, that you're healthier and toned and presumably more confident, it shows and naturally, this invites attention (even unwanted attention). It sickens me that you sacrificed blood, sweat and tears to satisfy his ultimatum only to be penalized and so degradingly accused of something like getting skinny so you can cheat on him. He is an insecure man and you rose to your potential. You grew into yourself. \n\nee cummings once said, \"it takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.\" \n\nThe ultimatum wasn't easy. The journey to becoming toned and healthier was also by no means easy. But it has taken you to where you are today--A physically and emotionally strong woman who **DOESN'T TAKE SHIT**. Packing your bags and walking out was the smartest and boldest move because you're taking control of your own life and happiness and not letting some egomaniacal insecure man, husband or not, shackle your happiness with ultimatums and hurtful (borderline emotionally abusive) tendencies. \n\nFight the good fight sister!

That kind of hypocritical, superficial thinking is something you need to stay away from.  Sounds like he is very manipulative.  Hope all goes well and we get an update of how things turn out.",

I'm sorry, but you should not go back to him unless you are willing to drag him to counseling and get some solo counseling as well. \n\nWould you even be friends with a person who does this? What if your BFF was like 'you know, fatass, you popped out a kid but come ON you're just not hot enough to hang out with me anymore, so lose that weight or I'm outta here.' Then when you do lose the weight, plus some, she says 'You're trying to steal my husband/boyfriend, I can't believe you would do such a thing.'\n\nSee where I'm going? It's just not cool.",

His friend groping you and him not immediately kicking that friend out is beyond bullshit.\n\nBut, you're married and have a kid and a long history together. I'd suggest a few things to start. First, you should absolutely look into some couples therapy. You're not in a healthy place right now in your relationship and that needs to change. Second, think very closely about your family and where you want to be in 5-10 years. Is he the person you want to be with and raise your child with, or would that do more harm than good?\n\nDon't just jump the gun and get a divorce or jump the gun and forgive. Think about it, talk to people about it who aren't family or friends, and then make the best decision for you and your family.\n\nBut to start, I'd tell him that things need to change immediately. Those friends are no longer welcome over, and his control issues over you also need to change. ",

            "I'm very sorry you and your child are going through this bad period.\n\nThe problem is much more than a weigh issue here. It's about his capability to love someone else in a way that will enable him to have a long lasting relationship. It would seem that his friends opinion of you is what is setting his own opinion.\n\nAsk him if he would want to spend the rest of his life with someone who is apparently only with him as long as he looks good.\n\nPersonnally, I would only go back on the condition that if he was ever to mention your looks (in any shape or form again) that it is understood that you are leaving him for good. Let him know that although it is not your intention, you could very possibly get fat in the future and ask him if he can deal with that. \n\nI would also inform him that, not only his toxic friends are not welcome any where within a mile radius of you, but that he should also let them know that any direspectful comments about you are off limit.\n\n",

He puts his male friends above you.\n\nYou did the right thing.  Maybe counseling would help but only if he saw the full depth of his wrongness first.\n\nWas there any sign of his disrespect of you or low opinion of women before you married him or did this come out of the blue for you?\n",
            "You are beautiful, you are amazing and you are STRONG. I don't know you, but for this I know that you are strong. Be that. He doesn't deserve you, especially after you went above and beyond and that still wasn't good enough. He doesn't respect you, he doesn't care. All he is thinking about is him. He didn't stand up for you. Not only do you need someone who is better for you, but also for your child. I hope you the best, PM me if you need anything, even to rant. Remember that you are strong.

            "Wow, sounds like a classic misogynist to me. \n\nAnd he won't \"invite his friend over anymore\"? Whoop-de-doo. He shouldn't BE friends with that piece of shit in the first place. \n\nIt sounds like he has no respect for you or your feelings, clearly. It's unfortunate that you've seen his true colors this far into the relationship, but either you take a break to let HIM work on himself and see if he can prove to you that he can change into a decent human being, or leave.

Damn. I'm getting mad just typing this. \n\nPlease leave him. You deserve better. WAY better.",

If you choose to follow their advice, I believe you'll be better off in the long run. \n\nIf you break down and go back to your husband, seek a marriage counsellor. If your husband refuses, make it a condition. If he loves you enough to try and make up for his grossly out of line behavior, he should agree to counseling.

            "I guess the way I'd put it is that good people can get emotional and and cross lines they did not intend to cross. This guy, however, had asshole motives all along. In that sense I think he knows he fucked up but I'd expect he's more interested in getting out of trouble than actually making things right with you. He strikes me as the kind of person who felt a sense of ownership over you and probably didn't expect you'd actually leave. Or perhaps he just thinks of respect as deference to his authority because that's how it goes in his life.\n\nI should also add that you know this person better than any of us. Ultimately you know better than us whether this guy is really trying to set things right and behave like a decent person. But do your best to determine whether he really cares about you or just losing out on hot, skinny you. After all, he had no problem threatening to leave when you had that extra weight. It's equally possible that he really is trying to control you, got caught off guard, and now knows he has to be more careful about it.",
            "He sounds like an incredibly shallow and jealous asshole.\n\nYou can do way better than him.",
            "Stay away.",
            "So he said he would leave you if you didn't lose weight, but thinks you should keep him when he blamed you for being sexually assaulted.\n\nWhat a baby-man.  Hope he's happy with his friends instead of his hot wife and adorable baby.",
            "Tell him to lose his friends and work on his insecurities, if you really want to be with him he needs to work on himself. He is insecure and will just find flaws in you and blame you for things. It never gets better until he confronts his issues and gets help for them.",
            "It is clear that the man has some growing up to do. He behavior is inexcusable, yet it is possible that he has never had the facts of life properly explained to him. If it is possible that he could grow personally to truly treat you properly you may want to give him that chance. With that said, zero tolerance for the superficial BS he has displayed in the past is needed on your part. Every marriage that lasts has moments of trouble that the couple chose to work through together. Emphasis on together. Wish you the best.",
            "You can tell a lot about a person based on the kind of company they keep, and your husband's friends (who think it is appropriate to comment on their friends wives body, positively or negative) are creeps. If you go back to him, which sounds unlikely, one condition should be that he dumps these losers. Keeping them around will only encourage him to continue the cycle of mistreatment. \n\nAlso, couples therapy is a must. He has some fucked ip ideas about a woman's supposed \"role\" in a relationship. The story about his friend groping you and your husband blaming YOU is an ACTUAL storyline from the series \"mad men\"-- a show dedicated to demonstrating how fucked up things were in the 60s. If that's not an indication of how antiquated and fucked up he is, then I don't know what is. "

        "selftext": "I'll try to be be brief.  I'm still fuming.  My husband (M29) comes from a big family, four brothers, two sisters, raised by a single mother for the most part.\n\nThe youngest of his siblings is J (M19) in the six years I've known J he's always seemed awkward and a little too quiet and socially inept.  I have always had a special fondness towards J because he's such a sweet person and I was a little awkward growing up myself.\n\nJ has been struggling with some classes and I've been helping him.  My husband took me on a special dinner night to thank me for this and it was there that he revealed why J sometimes struggles.  Apparently, their dad who is now dead left their mom over accusations that J was a product of infidelity.  He was not.  But their dad was super paranoid about infidelity and treated his wife like property.  The father started abusing J when J was as young as two, beating him.  He left shortly thereafter and passed away a few years after that.  \n\nThe abuse didn't stop there.  My MIL picked up where the father left off.  The beatings and abuse is too graphic and unspeakable for me to detail it here.  It's disgusting and inhumane.  My husband said that all the siblings took part including himself.  When I could no longer take listening to the details and the extent to which my husband participated I asked him why and how he could do those things.  He went into full on defense mode when he saw how furious I was and said they were told he was not their brother.  Like that's a valid excuse?  He said the family buried it and doesn't talk about it.  That J started defending himself at about 13 and the abuse stopped then.  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J.  He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.  \n\nsince that night three weeks ago I have been unable to be affectionate in any way towards my husband.  It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one.  Last weekend we had a back yard cook out as we often do.  Most of his siblings were here.  J knocked over a pitcher of Iced tea.  He's a little shaky and a little clumsy but it was an accident obviously.\n\nMy MIL went off and started berating him and called him an idiot and a few other names.  She started to berate him about his hands and how they shake so much and told him to get control of it and stop shaking.  I gave my husband a look, like, \"hey jump in here.\"  He didn't do anything.  I lost it.  I went completely crazy on her and told her that maybe if she hadn't beat him and other things...\n\nAt this point my husband jumped in and told me to take it easy on his mom.  I told her to leave and she told everybody to leave with her.  J only stayed because I practically begged him to stay but she told him to leave too.  I tried to talk to my husband about what happened and why I went off.  He told me to mind my own business about his family business.  I told him to leave at this point.  He reluctantly left and has been calling, and texting me non stop to forgive him.\n\n\n**EDIT**  Finally heard back from a friend I had emailed.  She's a counselor.  She told me I atcually victimized J by bringing up the abuse that Friday night.  She says I should have simply stood up for him for what happened that night.  She says I should apologize to him for that and I will tonight.  She also said it's probably going to be the first and only apology J ever gets that's even remotely related to all the abuse he suffered \"so be ready for anything\".  I'm picking him up at his friend's house tonight.  His mom kicked him out over what happened.  Everything is happening so fast now.  My parents have stepped up big time and offered to move him in.  My dad is going to teach him how to drive and help him get his DL.  He's going to give him his old car that nobody drives.  Now we just have to convince him to accept our help.  Haven't read all your comments but I will.  Just things are happening fast I need to keep up.  I know my kids will be fine.  Right now I'm in full \"get J help mode.\"  I have not read all your comments but I will.  Thank you all.\n\nOh I almost forgot.  I spoke to my husband on the phone finally.  He thinks he's going to talk his way back.  I asked him why his mom kicked out J.  He said he had no idea what I was talking about, he didn't know.  J told me that my husband has been staying at his mom's and he was there when J was kicked out.  I will file divorce, no chance I'm taking him back.\n\n**EDIT**  Some of you have asked about the details of he abuse.  I left them out to spare you.  Something inside you breaks when you hear the details of what they did to J.  I wanted people to read this and not have to visualize it.  Horrible and tragic are not big enough words.  \n\n**Edit** Sorry I can't respond to every comment and thanks for some kind words.  But just too add some clarity to some questions I keep seeing.  No, he has no remorse, nor does he think an apology is needed.  He also feels no therapy is needed for anybody, just time to heal.   But at the same time he acknowledges that J's shaking and struggle are a result of he abuse.   I don't get this contradiction but I will get therapy for myself as well and try to get more answers.  Also Yes, my dad is pretty awesome, I knew he would spring into action if I just talked to him.  My mom is great too.  I knew dad would get her to sign on as well.  They like J, and they had reservations about me marrying my husband but that was for other seemingly petty reasons at the time.  I swear on my life that I did not know my husband and his family had this secret.  \n\nI only knew that they all seemed normal but J was clearly damaged.  He is very sweet natured but you can tell he has endured some things.  I always wanted to get close to him and try to understand him but I never would have guessed.\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr** **My husband participated in disgusting inhumane abuse of his youngest brother.  I want a divorce, I think I want him in jail**",

If you tell your husband to hit the curb then those feelings of abandonment will resurface, and then this will just become another relationship that J ruined in that family's eyes.\n\nYou can probably save this kid's life.  Kick your husband out and offer for J to stay with you if you have the means.\n\nI wish you luck.",
            "I am sorry you are going through this. I want to offer some perspective that other people have not quite touched on. Were you raised in a fucked up family? If so, there might have been some behavior you did, that is in fact, not normal. Families insulate children and make them think it's normal everyday behavior. \n\nTake me for example. My mom stole, used drugs as a coping mechanism and beat her husband and children. Guess what I did as a child and teen? I stole, used drugs, and got into a lot of fights. \n\nThe difference between me and your husband is that I am forever ashamed of my past. I am deeply guilty and have dedicated my life to helping others as a way to gain some karma. \n\nThe other difference is that your husband was twenty fucking three when they finally stopped torturing J. He was old enough to say, 'wtf this isn't right,' 5 years before it ended. I got my act together at 17. \n\nIt very well may be that your husband is just massively immature, and not necessarily an evil person. \n\nThis is not advice for you, but I just want to say how sad it makes me that the only reason the torture stopped is because J stood up for himself at 13. Somehow, the fight in him had not been beaten down. He had to stand up for himself bc noone else would. How lonely do you think he was? How fucked up are you going to be when you are raised in a house where everyone, literally, hates you? I don't know you, but I love you for standing up for J. The little abused and neglected kids in all of us say thank you. ",

It's your family too at this point. His family sounds fucking terrible. Do you feel comfortable raising a child around these people (assuming you may have them)?\n\nDoing the math, your husband was into adulthood when this was still going on.\n\nI can't imagine being in your shoes. This must be infuriating and amazingly depressing at the same time. ",

            "Hmm, this is tough. I *wanted* to say your husband was a child/teenager and has likely grown up since then, probably regrets it, was coerced by his mother/siblings, he's changed since then, etc....\n\n*But*you say that the abuse sopped when J turned 13. He's 19 now, so that was only 6 years ago? That puts your husband at 23 years old? At that point, this is a *23* year old *man* abusing a *13* year old child? And he doesn't feel like he should apologize for that *at least*? Yeah, no. \n\nI would say talk to J, tell him you're there for him and are willing to help him through any sort of legal action he may want to take, and then *leave* your husband. Talk to him, give him a chance to explain himself *I guess*, but I highly doubt there is going to be anything that he says that is going to make it worth considering staying with him.",
            "Your husband sounds like an absolutely horrible human being, and I am really sorry you are going through this. It is one thing to have been involved because it was just the \"family thing\" to do, but it is another entirely to take up for it. To be honest, they should all be prosecuted. I realize that this sucks a lot right now, but this is not something I could ever live through. I don't know if you have children, but if you do that kind of abusive history would be something that he might do to your own children but also would be important in any custody disputes. \n\nHe is despicable. I am sorry you found out this way and not sooner. \n\n**Edit**: When I mentioned being involved with it because it is a family thing, I meant while OP's husband was an impressionable youth, but if this happened until OP's husband was 23 if my math is right then even the family pressure thing doesn't fly. We are talking about someone who was abusive well into his 20s. ",
            "Making him partake in the abuse was a form of abuse to your husband as well. Famliy pressure can make people (especially young people) do really fucked up things. So keep that in mind.\n\nThat said, he lost my sympathy when he said his brother doesn't need an apology and that time will heal it on its own. That's not how that works. I think a big part of this on your husband's part is denial and a fear of confronting his own actions. Take heart that this probably isn't who he is deep down, but it's still something he needs to fix.\n\nI'd consider taking him back under 2 conditions: he agrees to apologize to J and make some actual headway oward healing that relationship, and he agrees to therapy. That kind of fucked up upbringing will have left other issues that he needs to address to have a healthy life going forward.",

            "You need to talk to J and get his perspective, for your own sake. Your husband is only capable of giving you part of the story, and right now your imagination is filling in the gaps as to how J feels about everything.\n\nDo keep in mind, OP, that living through the abuse of a sibling is traumatic in its own right. It is impossible, in my opinion, to only abuse one child in a household; when fear reigns, all the children are being abused. Your husband likely has a very damaged psyche because of what happened. I'm not saying that he is as much a victim as J, but he is a victim. It is possible to be both an abuser and the victim of abuse.",
            "Wait, you met J 6 years ago?  You might have met him while the abuse was still ongoing?\n\nYou were likely dating your husband when he was still abusing his little brother?",

It wouldn't be normal not to be.\n\nJ should call the police and fill a complain against them, but you can't force him to. But you can talk about it",
            "\"Mind my own business about his family business\"  - that right there shows that he has never accepted you as being part of his family.  Good for you for standing up for J!   I would recommend starting with counseling for yourself and your husband.  If your husband refuses to go to counseling, that in itself is very telling as to the state of your marriage.  When I was contemplating divorce a line from my favorite book kept going through my head - \"I've seen a marriage of love and I've seen a marriage of obligation.  Having seen one I can't live with the other\".  I knew my daughter deserved to see a marriage of love even if it wasn't my own.  Best of luck to you. ",
            "You're a wonderful human being. Thank you for existing. Unfortunately it does not sound like your husband and the rest of his family are and what's even more unfortunate is that it took this long to find that out. It is one thing to \"make a mistake in his youth\" (although if it were me this would still be something I could never get over like animal abuse because I just can't understand that mentality - it makes me sick), it is another to feel no remorse and to still feel justified in his abusive behavior of his sibling. Also even if his justification is that his brother might be a bastard (literally) how can he support his mother who made the bastard? \n\nI'd leave him. God forbid he ever suspects you of anything delusionally. A non abusive person would just leave you at the worst maybe not give you a chance to explain, but he, an abusive person, would go out of his way to punish and physically hurt you as he clearly lacks empathy and has been taught to treat people like property/personal source of amusement for his cruelty. Imagine bringing a defenseless child into the mix. \n\nYou are right to trust your instincts. This is the biggest red flag of all. You are someone who fights for the defenseless - you are not going to stand there and see someone bullied, abused, molested or neglected. He unlike you is someone who will not only stand by and let it happen but join if it is convenient or advantageous to him. He likes to hurt the defenseless and doesn't feel bad about it. Leave him and save yourself from further shittiness and heartache. ",
            "Whatever you do regarding your husband, get that horrible mother of his out of your life forever. She is evil. She should not be allowed to interact with your kids EVER. Your husband may be able to enter counseling and come to terms with his participation in her abuse of J, but she is beyond redemption. If you stay with him it should be conditional on him cutting all ties with her and anybody else in that family who defends her. ",
            "> He told me to mind my own business about his family business. \n\nSo even though you've married this man and bore him two kids, he still doesn't consider you family? If the shit show you described wasn't bad enough, this certainly clinches who your husband is as a person. \n\nYou sound like a real stand up person, which is a sad rarity in this world. I don't blame you for your response. If I were you, I wouldn't want to stay either. But **PLEASE** talk to a divorce lawyer first, and in secret. Your husband has just revealed what he's capable of. It doesn't sound like you and your children are safe around him.",
            "This is completely awful. I'm so sorry. Maybe it's worth having one last talk with him, seeing if he has seen reason since you told him to go. Growing up in that type of fucked up household is horrible for the children taught to be \"enforcers\" too. \n\nBut ultimately you are doing what's right, what needs to be done. Your priorities are in the right spot, protecting J and protecting your children. ",
            "I was like \"Ok, everyone needs therapy\" but once your husband stepped in to protect his abusive mother while she was actively abusing their collective victim I'm well in the \"Tell that whole family to fuck off, help J out as best you can.\" camp.",
            "Your view of your husband has changed. To the point it doesn't seem salvagable. One part you should realise is that the abuse he inflicted came because it was taught to him. The MIL and father instigated it, so for your husband and siblings it was a normal way of acting. Problem is that it doesn't sound like any of these people ever looked for mental help after growing up. They still are in the same cycle emotionally, the physical parts just have stopped. Your husband doesn't view his family background as strange. It's part brainwashing and part fear. He's a victim of shitty parents as much as J is.  \n\nJ is staying because he doesn't know anyone else as a family. It's better to have a known enemy you belong to, than to be solitary. Because if your family treats you this horrible already, how on earth would it be better cutting them off? You likely won't be able to get anything investigated. It sounds like J is an adult now, else you could've involved CPS. J himself probably does not know/realise that he has been abused or if so, that it's something he deserved; he's not ready to view this as a criminal act and report, and he's still dependent. Which is why you won't likely be of help to J in the future as a confidante, until he's ready to take a step to get away from them. \n\nYour husband is still the person you fell in love with, but you're now discovering a side you never were told about. And because your husband applies the cover up instead of healing method, it sounds like this is still unresolved. You could ask from your husband to go into counseling with you, but if he's not seeing a problem, it's going to be hard to address this. Think hard about the future you want. These people are still your inlaws. Your husband won't cut them off. Do you want kids? Do you want pets? Could you still deal with them being in your life, helping them bury such secrets? Because they do work as a team against one, and you've shown that you're not on their team. \n\nI don't think you're overreacting, but do take some time to consider a divorce is really what you want.",
            "You are not overreacting in the least. Abusing a helpless child is one of the most despicable things a person can do. I personally would not be able to stay married to someone who committed such acts and showed no remorse. Fuck that. There are plenty of people in this world that would never ever ever do such a thing, your husband is NOT one of them. ",
            "Good for you. I hope you do leave him. There is no excusable behavior for abuse, especially within family. You'll be much better off without being around people like this.",
            "If it is what he did in the past then work on it with him. If I was burdened by my sins growing up then I would be a horrible person right now. \n\nRight now you are isolating your husband because of his past instead of trying to work with him. If he has been good for the past few years aren't you going to just lead him towards a darker side now? ",
            "I don't at all condone what he did, but I want to side against the masses on this one.  Divorce is nothing to take lightly, regardless of the revelations.\n\nYou aren't over-reacting, but there's much to consider.  What we have is a man who has learned from his family to participate in an unspeakable act.  This is what he has always known.  I don't buy the \"He's an adult, he should figure it out.\"  True, he's responsible for his actions, but in the same situation would you be any different?  I've met too many sons and daughters of bigots to believe that we suddenly gain an open mind when we are 18 and finally culpable for the sins of our fathers & mothers.\n\nI'd issue this with an ultimatum rather than an outright war declaration.  He must recognize that what he did is wrong in order for him to continue to be a part of your life.  You have kids with him, so you don't want to remove a loving father.  But by that same token, you don't want to enable a monstrous influence in your home.\n\nYou took a stand against the MIL (and seriously, good for you!).  He now needs to chose between his responsibility to his current family and the responsibility to his old family.  Once that decision has been made, decide then if you will pursue criminal charges against his family.\n\nPut into perspective that while you are empowered to act, you are not the victim here: J is.  You can make rules for your home, and you can demand that the MIL and siblings are no longer welcome based on those interactions.  You are well within your rights to determine what damning dangerous influences are present in your home, but I'd stop short of going on a crusade against his whole family (even if they are assholes for doing what they did).  You are angered and hurt, yes, but you have responsibilities as well that must be considered over that hurt and anger.\n\nThis is an incredibly serious situation, and principles must be weighed carefully against the needs of your family.  You have to decide carefully if the actions of the past are a clear and present danger to your kids, regardless of your convictions.  Removing their father is a danger to them, there can be no denying that.  But if you honestly feel that you must side with that lesser evil, then you must do what you feel is best.\n\nAs a personal aside, a similar thing happened around the time I was two.  My situation was no where near as serious, but it just so happened that my mother issued a similar ultimatum to my Father, for which he was adamantly opposed.  Threatened with the loss of his family and the ultimate failure of his vow to us all, he sided with my mother... and they're happily married still.  They moved states, and years later were able to struggle a hostile relationship with her in-laws that lasts to today.  All of their children (myself included) recognize the in-laws (my grandparents) as the monsters that they are, and have taken it as a personal and hard lesson that we should NEVER be like them.  Their presence serves as a warning.  Were we never able to know them, we'd doubt our mother's story.  By knowing them, we both pity our father and respect our mother's strength.\n\nBut I iterate: your situation is more extreme than mine, and this may warrant more extreme measures.  If it's not a danger to yourself or your children, I'd consider a mediated meeting between yourself and your husband, and possibly with J as well.  If he still thinks what he did was okay, then you have your answers.  If he can humble himself and admit fault and seek atonement, then you have a chance of a happy ending to this tragic story.\n\nI don't want to underplay the severity of this, and I do not envy the hurt you must feel right now.  Regardless of the outcome, I hope for nothing but the best for you and your children.",

For what it's worth, it's common for very dysfunctional families to pick one child to be the \"scapegoat\" and for the other children to participate in the abuse.  It's a matter of self-preservation as much as anything else. They don't want to incur Mom's wrath on themselves by standing up for their sibling, so they participate.\n\nAt a very minimum, your husband needs some serious counseling to understand what went on and to grow a pair to stand up to his mom.

            "You need to remember that growing up in that environment makes your husband a victim as well.  He had 2 abusive parents, who abused his brother and could have easily abused him as well, that means he grew up in an emotionally abusive environment with the threat/fear of physical abuse being turned on him.  Then they want he and his siblings to abuse J as well, and out of fear they would have.  You did actually victimize J by bringing up the abuse, because you brought it out in front of a whole group of people who abused him, and he probably had no idea you knew which is a betrayel of his brother's trust.  You didn't handle this well, though your intentions were good.  I think you definitely need to talk to a counsellor before you get involved with J in anyway, or discuss things with your husband.  I know you wanted to help, I totally get that, but you may have made things much worse.  Your husband absolutely needs therapy as well, because he was a victim, and he clearly has suffered a massive shift in what he thinks is \"normal\" because of his abusive childhood.",

I can only assume that your husband seemed like a great guy, but was there ever anything off about him? It's scary to think that there are charming, normal, functioning members of society capable of such cruelty.",
            "So you married into a family of monsters. There is a cure, it's called divorce.\n\nThere is no saving this as he truelly doesn't think what he did is wrong and is a full blown adult.\n\nWash your hands and walk away or suffer at their hands inevitability.",
            "You know what? Your husband is 29 years old. He really can't plead ignorance at this point. He knows it was wrong. But he chose to ignore it instead of fixing his wrongs, in fact he would rather seek tons of excuses than even attempt to fix his wrongs. When push came to shove, he showed you clearly where his loyalties lie: with his abusive mother, not with you. Not only did he not stand up for the weak, he actively defended the bully when you stood up for J. Not only did he actively defend the bully, he also slammed you when the bully left. \n\nI'm sure large percentages of murderers and rapists come from extremely dysfunctional households and have suffered unspeakable abuse at the hands of their parents. But they could have chosen to break the cycle. Instead, they chose to perpetuate it. Your husband chose too, when he defended his mother's horrid behavior. And he did not make a good choice.\n\nHe's 29 years old. It's too old to still be defending his mother. He defends her because he defends himself because he thinks he should be given a pass for his behavior. But his behavior was abhorrent. Still is, really. Your MIL now doesn't beat J but she still abuses him verbally and emotionally. He could put a stop at least to that, but he didn't. He had so many chances to do the right thing. He hasn't taken one of them. That tells you all you need to know about him.",
            "This is a very touchy subject that I think a couples therapy between you and your husband might be better off handling. Your husband in a sense has been groomed to treat the abuse of his youngest brother to be normal. He'd rather NOT confront the elephant in the room because that would required years of tearing down wall of conditioning. It would also mean introducing chaos into his family as well, which he seems to not want to become a part of (hence the ignoring and letting time pass by).\n\nSeriously, no one here commenting can give you good advice. Your husband is suffering silently, because he's conflicted between the mother he has left and you. \n\nA couples therapy isn't a magical cure, so I apologize if that seems like the only way out. Obviously you can always just find another husband; I wouldn't want to be in touch with his side of the family.",
            "I did some additional math. You've known your husband and J for six years. J was thirteen when the physical abuse stopped, and he's nineteen now, so... That means there's a chance that your husband was still abusing J when you met. That's just sickening.\n\nI saw you mentioned in another comment that you and your husband have two children, and that reminded me about something we talked about in our sociology class today. People's behaviors are the products of their environment; they can grow up hating their parents for being strict or abusive, but because it's the only example they know they often end up being the same way when they're parents without noticing it.\n\nPeople CAN change learned behaviors like that, but that requires conscious effort. Your kids are still young and your husband probably doesn't have any reasons to instantly abuse and hate them, but I'm worried about how he'll view them when they get older. He won't even acknowledge how awful his OWN behavior was, so if your kids fight and start to escalate into violence, he might just totally ignore it and let them hurt each other. Hopefully he'd know better, but... You don't want to wait to find out if he does.",
            "I don't think you are overreacting. Finding out that someone you love has participated in and encouraged abuse has to be one of the most horrific discoveries you can make. What's more, he continues to rationalize it and doesn't seem to feel remorse. Whether or not you should get divorced is something I think is beyond anyone on here's pay grade, especially since there are kids involved. I think you ought to take this to a counselor ASAP.",
            "Wow. from reading the title I thought this was going to be a situation where your husband was being deemed guilty by association. I was dead wrong. I am on your side here, hands down.\n\nYou can't completely fault him for his actions when the abuse began (I'm guessing he would have been somewhere around 10) You would think at that age he would know enough to understand his actions were wrong, but you would be shocked at how the perception of authority can alter our behavior. Even if he knows what he was doing was wrong the fact his mother was doing it, and encouraging him to would cause most children to follow suit. If you aren't familiar with the Milgram experiment I would suggest you give it a read, fascinating insight into human behavior. \n\nThat being said, he is now old enough to reflect back and realize the mistakes he's made. His complete lack of remorse for his actions and those of his family speaks volumes about him.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if he mistreats any children he may eventually have. It doesn't sound like he fully grasps the damage that was done to his brother. I definitely would not be comfortable leaving my children in the care of his mother or siblings knowing their history.\n\nShitty spot to be in OP, I am sorry!",
            "Whoa, I was originally going to say that as a child himself surrounded by that environment, your husband was not 100% responsible for the abuse he perpetrated.

It sounds like you've got everything sorted - best of luck.\n\nAs someone who was abused and severely beaten by one parent as a child, and then blamed for it by the other parent, it's taken me a long time to come to terms (if I even have) but I have a some resources handy.

A kid between 12 and 15 will just do what his aprents are doing. At 23 he should have known better, yet many who have been abused in their childhood have troubles educating their children, because their experience of \"educating\" a child is \"abuse\". They don't know what is normal to do.\n\nHis refusal to acknowledge that can be denial, insulation (he still doesn't really get it), or being an asshole. If it's the one the 2 first, he needs profesional help - though convincing him to go might be tricky.\n\nDoes he have a good, diplomat friend or fatherly figure outside of his family?",

He feels absolutely no remorse. But hey. Look at who raised him.",
            "After reading through a lot of the responses, I want to say that I agree that your husband was abused, and that it was awful for his mother to involve him in the abuse of his younger sibling.  That said, the fact that he has zero remorse for his actions AND still participates in the abuse (by refusing to stick up for J and by lying to you about him being kicked out) AND is definitely still his mother's little robot (i.e. if she told him to hurt his own kids he'd obey without question) says to me that you need to get away from him.  And you will probably need to testify in family court about what he and his family did because the WORST thing that could happen is that you divorce him, become The Enemy, and then have to share custody.  Don't let your children near his family.  Be really really smart about the divorce.\n\nAnd thank you OP.   You may have caused some slight harm to J for your outburst but I'm certain that can't touch the good you've done by being the first person to ever be on his side in his entire life.  \n\nI would encourage you to check out /r/raisedbynarcissists and definitely suggest J check it out, to connect with others who have gone through \"similar\" things.  It might help you understand if he's reluctant to leave his family despite all they've done, and it might help reassure him that he's not the bad one.   ",

This is his chance to see the treatment of vulnerable people through your normal empathetic eyes, rather than the sick sadistic eyes of his family. \n\nIf he comes to you, unsolicited, with a full acknowledgement of how brutally wrong J's treatment has been and his role in it, an appointment with a therapist for himself, and a real commitment to supporting J in getting away from his family and getting the help he needs, you could consider reconciliation. Anything short of that, don't waste your time. ",
            "So, to sum up, your husband effectively told you, \"I used to viciously beat my youngest sibling. It's okay though, the whole family was doing it. Now, looking back on my past behavior, I can honestly say... No biggie, little bro should just get over it.\"\n\nHoly shit. All I can say is cheers to you for being the only decent human being in that family and sticking up for J. You're totally valid in finding your husband reprehensible based on this revelation. \n\n> It's like I went from totally in love, the totally repulsed by him. He's suddenly somebody I don't even know.\n\nListen to your gut, OP. Your husband's past behavior & current perspective on that behavior are both totally messed up. I definitely encourage you to get divorced *yesterday* and talk with police/a lawyer about the best ways to protect you, your kids, and J from this demented family.",

            "This is very serious.  Your husband has been raised to think that it is okay to treat people like this.  What if the two of you have children?  How will he treat them?  I have been in Js shoes in my past and I still hangout and talk with my family.  I am 32 years old and I will never forget the horrible things that happened in my childhood.  While I have forgiven my family I would give anything for them to actually sit me down one day and tell me that they are sorry.  I know they never will but I would love it if they did.  \n\nJ is likely a lot like me in the sense that he likely sees the hurt and anger in his family and he does not want to cause more by cutting ties with them.  \n\nYou are a good person for standing up for him and your husband is not a bad person he just made some mistakes.  Talk to J.  Get his point of view.  Talk to your husband.  But if I was you I would reinforce with your husband that there is no way that you are going to be okay with him just standing on the sidelines anymore.  That he is a man and he is a big brother and it is his job to protect his little brother.   ",
            "Your husband was abused.  He is also a victim. Even if your husband was never physically hit, it is still abuse.  And like many victims of abuse, they learn to become the abuser. It isn't surprising he doesn't want therapy, because that requires him to bring up his own pain, but it is desperately needed. \n\nI am not saying he is without consequence, and does need to be accountable. I am saying that he is an inadvertent victim of the abuse as well. ",
            "Ok, I only read the first few replies in this thread, but something drastic seems to be missing here:\n\n\n**Your Husband was abused, and this behavior is also the result of deep trauma he experienced at the hands of his parents.**\n\nThat he thinks J doesn't need an apology and he should move on is a textbook psychological defense against extreme trauma. It's like being forced at gunpoint to kill someone, then deciding over the decades that it was actually alright to kill them because _____. It's that or be a quivering wreck for the rest of your life. It's a defense mechanism against terrible abuse, designed to keep your husband sane in the face of the insanity he faced and still faces.\n\nOn that note, it's also totally expected that a victim of abuse will react in extreme ways with their abuser. Think of a rape victim who walks into a room and finds her rapist--she'll probably freak the fuck out. Now think of a rape victim who was systematically raped for her whole childhood, and the deadweight helplessness she would react with when her rapist walks into the room. \n\nIt's the only strategy she'd have for staying alive.\n\nThat's the precisely identical behavior you're seeing with your husband.\n\nSo, he's doing the wrong thing, OF COURSE... but you're also revictimizing someone who is definitely one of the victims, *along with J*. \n\nThe bad guy here is the Mom. \n\nJ needs help, good for you for helping him.\n\nYour husband, who you said was a great guy, you you've been with a long time, is acting crazy out of character because his perception on this topic is warped by the abuse he suffered. He fucked up, but I think he's recoverable. He needs therapy though.",

J is lucky to have you in his life and standing up for him, your kids are lucky to have such a strong woman as a mom and the world is a better place because of you. I know it's gonna be very hard but I hope you follow through on all this and I wish you all the best. x",

            "I'd probably get out of there ASAP, how long untill you do something worthy of a beating, or any of the unmentionable things they did?\n\nI'd probably stay in contact with J if possible, he could use someone like you in his life, but that's up to yourself.\n\nSorry I couldn't be more helpful I'm in work but I had to say something.\n\n",
            "I am so very sorry you are going through this. I would leave. Especially if you don't have any children yet. Main reason is that he *still* thinks there is no need to apologise to the poor kid. Sounds like no real remorse there, from what you are saying. Also, he is a fucking moron if he truly thinks that kid will EVER be able to \"forget in time\". Fuck that guy and his family. They deserve each other (edit: except J, of course).",
            "J is not going to ever \"forget\" this abuse. It has helped to forge him into who he is, it has changed him.\n\nI don't know if I have any advice for you, but I sympathize with you.  I hate abusers.  Animal abusers and child abusers I hate the most.\n\nThese are some sick, twisted people.  The mother needs to be committed.\n\nEdit:  maybe this is my advice:  kick your husband out, and have J move in and stay with you.  He needs to feel safe for a while. ",
            "No, you're not overreacting. Start looking for a divorce lawyer. You're doing the right thing, helping J out. I would have done the exact same thing and contemplated (and carried out) divorce. That's not something you just sweep under the rug. Your husband feels absolutely no remorse and justified in his actions. Huge red flag. They sound like one majorly fucked up family I would want nothing to do with. ",
            "This was hard to read for me and even made me a bit teary eyed\n\nBest of luck to you and J",
            "I'm sure this will be buried and not seen at all but I would like to recommend a book for J (and you if interested), it's called \"Toxic Parents: Overcoming the Hurtful Legacy and Reclaiming Your Life\". I come from an emotionally abusive home and this book has brought so much perspective and understanding to me. It has seriously helped me in an incredible way and I hope that J can have the same benefits that I have from reading it. ",
            "Your husband didn't act the way he did because he's a terrible person - he did it because that's what his parents trained him to do.\n\nHe was a victim of shitty parenting as well.  What he did was wrong and should illicit patience and understanding from you, not accusations and blame.",
            "Honestly, you didn't see any signs from your husband, and all this because of one conversation? Usually there are signs that show a persons personality in a relationship. ",
            "People who grow up around abuse are often groomed to think of it as normal. Your husband needs counseling. I'm not saying you're going to be forgiving, but encourage him to seek counseling. \nThis is my insight: I grew up in a shitty, neglectful household and it messed with me. I thought all families were like mine. Even when I'd say something horrific, I'd justify it. It took years for me to see that I was groomed to see those things as okay. \n\nLook, I'm rambling. But just know that your husband can legitimately be a good person, and have done these awful things. In a way, he's also a victim.",
            "You did the right thing, even though I know to some extent the kids were conditioned to be cruel by an adult. Yeah, there is always that piece of them that can know it's wrong and defy the mother but it was probably 'easier' to comply and be cruel with the whole family.\n\nWhat others have already said is true--this family is sick, sick and you cannot make them better. J needs therapy like yesterday and who knows if even that will help as much as what he needs. \n\nThe problem is that here you are with a man who you can have kids with (sorry didn't read if you have kids or not) and, well, I could not trust your husband's judgement, especially after he justified what he did to his brother.\n\nAnyway, this is beyond any normal person's capabilities to deal with. I could not deal with it. \n\nHonestly, I am not sure (it depends) but you might even still be able to call Child Protective Services on his mother even though J is older now and an adult. I mean, the creep (the mother) might have grandchildren around someday and she is a mindless, idiot who needs to stay away from children.\n\nThey all need therapy but that doesn't mean that you have to participate with them. If it were me, I don't think I could stay.",
            "Wow what a messed up family. I'd be curious to know the ages of the other children during the time when the abuse occurred. These people need more therapy than there are therapists in this world. \n\nThank you for being such a caring and compassionate person, /u/soccermomontheedge. You and your family are wonderful people. I don't know enough about law, but I believe if you can somehow legally hold these people responsible for what they did to this poor boy, then you will be doing a great service for J. There are so many children like him and not all of them get support from loving people like you and your parents. Thank you so so much.",
            "OP, you need to take a look at /u/jmwest23ut's comment. Your husband has not fully accepted the fact that he did such a horrible thing. Kids are very impressionable. If you can't stand being with a person who was programmed poorly as a child, then fine, leave him, but don't blame him fully. His actions aren't excusable, but it's not like he thinks it was the right thing to do.\n\nI guarantee you he feels awful about it but is too ashamed to even know where to start. Additionally, he probably got defensive because even though he knows what you said was true, he just still can't accept that he did such awful things. He needs counseling/therapy just as much as J does and just as much as the parents need to be locked up.",
            "I'd be surprised if J was the only one being abused in that household.\n\nI can believe that one child would be disliked by the parents, but the level of abuse you are talking about is so extreme. J may have gotten the worst of it by far but the other children probably experienced their own forms of abuse at the parents' hands.\n\nYour husband has probably had his head seriously fucked with. I understand wanted to leave and never see him again but since you two of kids together and he is likely going to continue being apart of their lives you need to convince him to see a couples therapist with you.\n\nA therapist can help him understand how messed up what he did and experienced was. Can probably deprogram some of the psychological conditioning his mother did to him.\n\nSaying \"fuck off and die\" is nice, but it's not really applicable when the person has a legal reason to be around your children. For their sake and everyone else's convince him to go into therapy.",
            "Where do people meet people like these? It's scary to think out of everyone I know they are hiding a sick twisted and disgusting side to themselves.",
            "OP, you have wonderful parents who have raised you to be a kind and caring person. It saddens me that J has had such a terrible life but I'm happy that you and your parents have stepped up for him.\n\nJ will always bear the scars of his abuse but with a safe home and counseling he may overcome this and lead a happy fulfilling life. Thank you. As far as your husband goes, I hope his future is filled with pain, unrelenting pain.",
            "It sounds like you're doing the right thing.",
            "Can you really hold childhood actions against him?  If both his parents did this, he didnt really know better?\n\nStill, it is terrible.",
            "Now how do you keep him and his batshit insane mother away from your kids?",
            "I agree with what you did, however, one of the problems of doing bad stuff as a kid is that your belief system is kind of shaped by your parents, so if they're asshats you have a higher percentage chance of being an asshat.\n\nAs a kid, my mom had to go overseas to do family stuff (my grandmother was ill probably).  My father was however convinced she was going back home to have an affair and convinced me to continuously call/harass her at a regular time where I am, but in the asshole middle of the night.  I however realized how asshatty that was and stopped, however it could be easily understood how in an abusive system how going along would be less bad than trying to stop it and it's hard to be extremely moral when you are just a kid.\n\nFor jail purposes it should go first to his mom, who well is the ringleader of this circus of terror.  I know you feel more strongly towards your husband but he may have been too young to know what to correctly do as he would have been 10 when this scenario started and he may remember everything in a very coloured manner.",
            "Your husband and his family have stopped the *physical* abuse.\n\n\nI am so sorry you are going through this stressful time, but I want you to know that I admire you. You are being the difference in J's life.",
            "I think leaving him is fine, but remember that you are probably one of very few people who are close to J so you need to be super careful about the history he has and not making him uncomfortable. \n\nI dont think I would try to do anything legally because chances are that will just bring more pain to J. If you did decide this was the option to go please talk to J beforehand because it's going to be a really shitty situation for him to have to live all over again as he's questioned by many people.",
            "Situations like this take years to develop. If this actually did take place; the whole family will have been groomed for a very long time to treat this younger sibling as less than human. Your husband will have been as much a victim of abuse as the sibling. If you really think your husband suddenly chose to join in with this, you're wrong.",
            "Why did he start telling you all of this at dinner?",
            "Man your husband and in-laws are pieces of shit. No scratch that. They're subhuman trash that should've been euthanized once they slid out from under neath they're mothers filth. Ditch that scum bag, take up a maternal role for J and move to another state. Neither of you deserve whats happened.",
            "What the fuck is wrong with people?",
            "I clicked this post because I figured you would be overreacting and was looking forward to the comments, then I read your post....\nWHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE!\n\nGood on you OP, you are a fantastic person and it's disgusting that his entire family still thinks it's okay. \n\n>  I asked him if anybody had apologized to J. He said he doesn't need an apology, that he just needs to forget and in time he will.\n\nThis was the nail in the coffin for me, it showed that your husband has absolutely no compassion, which would only result in him eventually treating you horribly, or your children horribly.\n\nGet out while you can OP. Sorry that you have experienced this, but you should be incredibly proud of yourself.",
            "I agree with your decision to divorce your husband.  \nBut I think you really need to have a plan for helping J.   I think you should ask him what he wants to do.  Even though he's being abused, it's still his family and sad to say, he's used to it.  It may be hard to convince him to leave his family - or even get therapy.   \nGo back to your counselor friend and see what see says.  ",
            "So the children blame the mother, who blames the father for blaming the mother for having an affair (which she denies) as justification for abusing the youngest sibling. \n\n\nyeah,.. OP, be prepared to be blamed by the whole family for everything that happens from here out.",
            "I don't have any advice for you. Just wanted to say that you're amazing and I wish there were more people in the world that would stand up to abuse. ",
            "I think you need to be more open to the idea that your husband also needs some help.\n\nAnd dont lie to us: by not disclosing the details of the abuse you are only trying to spare yourself the pain of telling it. I cant imagine a single thing on this earth too much for my ears, and I guarantee many people here also feel the same. Redditors yearn for those stories -- it is half the reason many people even come to post here and give you advice; it is 21st century soap opera.\n\nThat little omission in addition to the overall message here, and your (understandable) refusal to look at your husband as another victim here, seems to reveal that you have a bit too much of a protector complex in yourself. Beware of self-righteousness. It is a poison.",
            "This is a terrible, terrible thing that has been happening, and I commend you for standing up for J ad trying to help him. It sounds like you've already made up your mind regarding your husband, and you have every right to make the decision it seems like you already have. However, I would like to address something regarding your husband.\n\nWhen this started, he was still a kid. From the ages you have he was 11 or 12? I don't know what sorts of reasons or motivations he gave you for participating, but there's a very strong chance that it wasn't truly by choice. I would suspect very much that there was a decent amount of coercion from his mother and wouldn't be surprised if he suffered a fair deal of emotional abuse. The fact that a family of twenty-somethings stood by, watched, and blindly obeyed their mother (to me as if they are still scared of defying her) says something to me about how the mother has positioned herself in this family. \n\nYou have every right to kick your husband out. But another valid option is to begin with intensive therapy, for him to look at what happened to him and try to work out what I imagine are a host of issues stemming from this, you to work out your feelings having witnessed this, and together to see if there's a way to rebuild your relationship. Of course, there's every chance that he will refuse, that he will say there's nothing wrong with him. If he isn't willing to get help, then I think the decision is being made for you.\n\nAnd I definitely needs intense therapy. You don't get over that level of abuse by ignoring it and hoping to forget or by just apologizing and hugging it out.",

            "You're husband is so desensitized to J's suffering he doesn't even see J as a person. Can your husband even imagine what he did to J happening to your kid? That might be the only way to get him to start seeing how fucked up his actions are. Your husband and J both need help separately: your husband to realize what he did and J to learn how to cope. I do not even you and I hope you are able to figure out what is best for you and your children. Awful.",
            "As someone who was in J's position don't expect the world. It's hard to process kindness as an honest emotion. And it's a coin flip if I would spit in someone's face or become afraid and overwhelmed and run away myself. Even now 10 years out I find kindness strange and slightly infuriating. \n\nAlso, it is unlikely he'll fully side with you against your husband. ",

No way you can stay married to a person with a history of abuse that you didn't know about beforehand.\n\nI do not get how so many people including the counselor think it's ok to pretend this never happened. The family needs to know it is totally unacceptable.\n\n\nAlso, your husband does not have the same values as you. He abused another human like a disgusting animal. You'll be much happier not married to a man like that.\n\nThe whole thing is toxic, get out!!!",
            "One thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you seem to have a strong relationship with J which means you've spent some significant amount of time with him.  This wouldn't be happening if J and your husband didn't share some form of kinship connection.  It doesn't make sense to me?  J wouldn't want to be around your husband if your husband actually hated him or used to abuse him in the way you claim?  Something doesn't add up.",
            "Here is something to consider.  The abuse of J was a learned behavior forced on to the family by the mother and most likely a defensive mechanism.  Because let's be honest, more than J was abused by the mother, in a family like that J became the target so the others could avoid being abused.\n\nAnd think about this, the fact that he revealed this abuse to you, and was pleased you showed an interest in helping J is his was of expressing guilt for what he has done. Until he can talk through everything and apply reason to the events, he can't accept what he did as wrong.  The act of accepting his place in the abuse would most likely break a lot inside him, his whole world view is tainted by this. He NEEDS counseling.  So does J.  Ask them if they would both like to attend a counseling session together, J may turn it down, but if your husband wants to fix what is broken inside of him he will eventually agree to go.  And I say they should go together because your husband needs to work on rehumanizing J in his mind and J needs to confront his abusers, doing it in a controlled setting will make sure it goes smoother.\n\nNow, if this is a deal breaker.  I recommend you attend counseling with your husband during his counseling over his abuse, it will be easier to explain to him why it's over in that setting.  Either way you decide, make sure there is some sessions done and progress made before you make a decision and act upon it.",
            "Your husband is a victim too. I posted a response to another commenter about this so I don't want to be redundant but he needs a real chance. If, AND ONLY IF, you can convince him to go to therapy, I think you two have a shot at getting back on track with your relationship.\n\nHe is a victim of your MIL. He was a child when it all started and she fucked him right up. Yes, young adults have the ability to decide between right and wrong, but this is largely dependent on upbringing. If he grew up in her reign of terror, if he thought that if he didn't participate she would turn on him, then he had to find a way to survive. He had to cope by making what he was doing okay. \n\nI am by no means advocating for any kind of abuse. I think J's situation is awful... I feel a visceral hatred for your MIL after reading your post. And I do not excuse anything your MIL did. But your husband and the other siblings need to get counselling to get their heads straight and to come to terms with all of this.  ",

It was just abuse against the mind instead of the body.  And generally speaking, it is very difficult for people to recognize when something in the way they were raised is not normal.  Your home and early childhood *defines* normal for you, and that's really hard to break out from.\n\nYeah, you need to make him recognize how you see it, but people do sometimes have these massive blind spots.  Not to mention that he may be pretty traumatized by the things he committed.",
            "This is horrific. Your husband is someone who can participate in torturing a child without any remorse.

It's horrific and disgusting.\n\nFrankly, he needs to grow a pair and accept that he did a horrible thing. He needs to apologize and try to build a better relationship with his brother.

If these allegations are as serious as you point them out, this will likely end up in divorce, because he won't dare to go against his family... but in the off-chance he actually does it, it will probably do **much** more good for J than if you try to report this to the police yourself, because all of them will just deny it. If your husband really is willing to go that far against his family, then, despite everything he has done, I believe he seriously deserves a second chance (with lots of therapy etc... of course).\n\n\n>  I honestly don't know why J has chosen to stay around all these animals and I'm disgusted with myself for marrying one. \n\nYou heard about the test where they give electric shocks to animals, and at some point they don't even try to stop it, because they sort of go used to it? It's learned helplessness, essentially... J can only overcome it, if he stays away from his family, gets good therapy, and has a social environment which is vastly different from his family.",
            "You took a stand for the poor guy, and that's what's important. It's unreal that your husband is only penitent because you called him on his and his family's abusive treatment of their brother and you kicked him out but there you go, consequences have finally been given. Stand your ground.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't want to have anything to do with anyone like that either. I can totally see legitimate reasons for divorce here. What a scumbag family.\n\nUnfortunately, I think the brother would have to press charges for jail to apply. ",
            "Good for you! Now after divorcing take J under your wing and teach him compassion, how to be socially functional and be his wingwoman. ",
            "People can always change, and you can get past these horible things your husband did.  \n\nBut the first step to this is always, always, always contrition.  Your husband is not sorry for what he did, or are anything wrong with it and therefore can not be forgiven, and can not change. \n\nGood for you op ",
            "I don't know if someone else has said this yet, but I want to encourage more discussions with him. Push and push for him to realize that what he did was wrong. Maybe he was abused too, and can't admit that yet. Maybe a part of him realizes that what he did was wrong, but is afraid of the guilt and can't admit it yet. A safe, non-judgemental place - like with a therapist - will help him come out of this toughened shell that he created to help him survive in an abusive, dysfunctional environment. Good people do terrible things in the name of survival, and he may be suffering from a form of PTSD, not being able to come to terms what he did - yet.\n\nSince you already yelled at him and kicked him out of  the house, he probably doesn't feel comfortable opening up to you anymore - to no fault of your own! Lots of people would have reacted this way. This is why we have professional therapists! Please encourage him to seek therapy. If there's any indication that he wants to come to a full realization of his actions, there's hope for your marriage. He just needs to feel like he's in a really, really safe place.",

There's a lot of really good advice here, and I encourage you to find time to read it. \n\nThat being said, there are three things I feel you should consider, moving forward. \n\n1. You *must* involve the authorities. This is too big for you to take on by yourself. \n2. Your husband is a perpetrator, and also a victim. He grew up in this household being taught that this is normal and maybe in some ways being victimized himself in ways. I have a hard time with the idea that his brother received all of the abuse and he was treated perfectly normally. Regardless of whether he was victimized or not, you are correct to leave your husband. You cannot have children with this man. Who knows what he will do to them. It's unfortunate, but that's the way it is. \n3. You may be tempted to handle everything for J, to take him in and be everything his mom never was. Be careful though, the desired end result is that he is a rehabilitated independently functioning adult. Get him help, teach him to stand on his own, and make sure he doesn't end up using you as a crutch for the rest of his life. \n\nYou've done an amazing thing by standing up and taking the lead to help address this young man's lifelong struggle. If there was more people like you in the world, it wouldn't be such a bleak place. ",

            "I don't know what you should do, but I think I'd divorce him if it were me.

            "J should have some control over this as well. If he knew his brother is going through a divorce because of him, who knows what he would feel or do? Or what sort of backlash he would get from his family? If you must, you should speak with J and get his perspective on this story, privately so he can be 100% honest. From what you've said and done, I'm sure he can find some sort of comfort around you to open up.\n\nTo be blunt, you shouldn't be the one trying to 'fix' anything about J's situation because it doesn't involve you. Sure, you married into this family but that doesn't give you the right to do a complete overhaul with how their family works. You have every right to leave your husband as how you see fit but this is J's life and the fact that he's still there and hasn't ran away or contacted any authorities shows that there could be more than just fear that's keeping him there.",

I would wager bad shit happened before J was ever born, and possibly to your husband. He has been BUILT from the GROUND UP to normalize this abuse and propagate it. He can BARELY realize how fucking monstrous it is now, which is probably why he told you what he did. He's not in a place yet to begin to process how fucked up he is, or begin any process of healing or improvement. Until he admits to himself that he is an abuser, and seeks SERIOUS professional help, he should be a no go for you. He needs deprogramming super bad. \n\nFurthermore, you and your parents are absolutely fucking heroes for helping J as you are. Please, no matter how hard it gets or how much time, please be there for J. He needs someone, and you're probably the first person whose ever known the extent of what has happened to him. Take it slow, with patience, and support him as much as you can.\n\nAs for justice, or at least restitution; I'm no lawyer or cop, but the ones who said there's likely little satisfaction to be had, are probably right. He's an adult now, he'd have to face them in court if it ever got that far, they'll all turtle up to protect themselves and each other. I burn for justice and want to see the lot of them hanged for this, but we don't live in a world where that's likely to happen.

There is a sickness in them, and it has gotten down to the bone, and probably shapes a large part of who they are as adults now.

He doesn't sound interested in getting therapy, apologizing to J, or confronting his mom and siblings, but even if he did ALL that, it's reasonable for you to feel repulsed.

It's subjective-- but I do think you should consider that J was probably not the only \"victim\" of his father. The other siblings, and probably your MIL also were subjected by him. Just in a different way. Young people are impressionable, and the other kids likely fell in line doing what they were lead to do... Which is awful, and wrong, and bad-- but they probably couldn't see that at the time. Once that behaviors becomes the 'norm' there's no longer a right and a wrong. A MUCH more extreme example of this situation are the children who are born and raised being force fed anti-Western propaganda and eventually taking up arms against something that they don't really understand. My advice would be to step in and try to educate your husband. Crack that shell. Break it down hard... And once he can see the wrong in what he was led to be a part of and eventually came to know as \"normal\", he will come to understand the devastatingly negative affects of those actions.",

What's it got to do with him?\" and then I read the rest. I'm sure that with the right kind of help, your soon to be ex could become a good person. However, based on your story, he would never consider that an option because he doesn't believe he's done anything wrong. Even now, he's nonchalant about it. In the process, there's a teenager turned adult who might have some real world issues as a result.  \n  \nYou need to stay far away from these people. They're dangerous.  \n  \nI may be speculating and even fear mongering but it's true. This is sociopathic behaviour, among other things. There's not one spec of regret or remorse. For all we know, they enjoyed it. You wouldn't be safe with him if he ever lost his temper and neither would the children you have with him. Plus, he'll clearly take his family's side over yours regardless of whether it's right or not. I assume they would support him in the same fashion, even if he did some seriously bad shit to you.  \n  \nHelp his brother. Get him out of that. Let him know that you won't replace a parent, won't take care of him directly, but you'll support him and help him get his shit together and be his friend. He's on the downslope of this now but it's still a rocky terrain. He'll need a place to vent. Be sure you're ready for that before committing to it.  \n  \nYour instincts are bang on and you should go with them.",
            "I read in relationship spineless OP's all the time who try to justify the shittest behavior. Honestly you have an iron will OP kudos. ",
            "You need to leave, this sounds crazy. And if they do it to this guy, they could do it to someone else.",
            "This will probably get buried but I'm so proud of you. It takes balls to stand up for J, most people wouldn't do that. You're courageous and I hope J will heal from this mentally. ",
            "So you are doing a lot of good things, but there are some realities to accept.\n\nNo matter how much good you do for J, it's not going to go as well or as quickly as even your lowest expectations.\n\nHe probably doesn't have a functional model for a loving nurturing relationship in his mind yet, he might react in odd ways to you and your families help because he won't understand things you take for granted. He's going to feel a lot of weird emotions that he will have no idea what to do with, they might manifest in weird ways. There are therapists who specialize in PTSD from childhood trauma and this would be a good place to start if you can get him away from his family. \n\nAs for your husband... Yes he is bad. Yes he participated in abuse, but he was raised in an unhealthy environment with his parents and family normalizing and reinforcing this behavior. Obviously he should have known better, but this became normal for him when he was just a kid himself.\n\nIt could be that at 29 he's an old dog and won't change his ways, but he deserves a chance to see the error of his ways and make amens.\n\nIt wouldn't be ridiculous to offer an ultimatum where he has to talk to some professionals and get some perspective on what was going on. It's not impossible that he could become an ally to J with your help. Of course this means accepting that you're the villain in your story, which you could imagine is hard. \n\nJ is absolutely the primary victim here, but your husband was too. Everyone here who puts themselves in your husbands shoes is going to pretend that they alone would have been the voice of reason, but the truth is a lot of people would have done just the same because that's how it works when you are a kid.\n\nOne last thing... The narrative your husband gave you is one he pieced together as a child when he interpreted the words and actions of crazy people. The details are probably accurate in spirit, but again there was probably a lot of ret-conning and shoehorning to come up with a story that made sense of crazy people's behavior.\n\nGood luck OP. You're doing a good thing, don't forget to get professionals involved because this is way above your pay grade. \n\n",
            "Wow, I feel bad for J.  Your husband is an asshole and was probably abused as well by his prick father.  I'd have a hard time living with someone if I knew they did that to a child.",
            "If he'd do that to his brother, its not a far cry from doing that to your children.",
            "OMG, could you imagine if you were both brunettes and had a blond haired son.  This could be your child if your husband ever thought that the child wasn't his...\n\nI hope J is able to move forward and accepts your family's help.  You and your Parents are amazing to be able to step in so quickly!",
            "I am sorry for the fuckery that you are going through with your soon to be ex husband ( he sounds like a total trash especially after pretending he doesnt know y j was kicked out, along with the regular beatings he doled out) and his trashy family.\n\nBig love and props to your family for taking in J and giving him the life he deserves to live.\n\nI think maybe try marriage counselling and see if that works, if not, then at least you will have no regrets in the future , but be warned a guy like that is serious mental damaged goods ( your soon to be ex) since he had no qualms being 20 beating the shit out of a 10 year old..... if he ever becomes a father, the shit will hit the fan.",
            "That poor kid. You may think that it made a situation worse, but this could be the break J needed to get out of a really bad situation.  Just because they don't physically beat him anymore doesn't mean he isn't emotionally or psychologically abused by these people which is basically what you witnessed in your own home. \n\nHealthy people with healthy family dynamics don't bitch at their son for \"shaking to much\" (obviously something he can't control). Normal people would ask if he was okay, have him sit down and relax, or offer to help. \n\nI am not sure how else you could have handled that information.  That is a big bomb to process, and they don't even realize or empathize with how this young man feels and that is almost as bad as the abuse itself. \n\nI hope that while he is hanging out with your parents and building a better life he is able to get therapy for everything he has gone through and everything he is going through right now. His whole world has been flipped upside down. Even though it was horrible what he went through, that was his version of normal. I hope that he has a wonderful future full of opportunities because someone finally saw him as a hurt little boy which he has desperately needed his whole life. \n\nAs far as your husband, I don't really think you ever reacted, but that is a matter of opinion. A lot of people are capable of doing terrible things in their lifetime. Just because he has gotten over it does not mean anyone else has to. Forgiveness is given, never assumed. It is your choice whether or not you ever decide to. ",
            "Food for thought: if he was a kid at the time the abuse occurred, he was taught that was what he should do. He was basically coerced into by his mother. If it stopped and if he isnt abusing anyone now- can you hold childhood actions over him now?\n\nThere are a number of books on the subject. Family stuff is super complicated...I would be wary of basing a divorce over his actions while he was under the control of another.\n\nBut, my math could be off and I could be wrong. There could be more to the story. This is reddit.\n",
            "So did your husband participate in the abuse as an adult or as a child?",
            "> I know my kids will be fine. \n\nWait, do you two have children together?",
            "On one hand your husband is the product of his environment.  On the other what happened in this family is so deeply fucked up that I would help pack your bags of you decided to leave.  Sure you shouldn't have brought up the abuse at the cookout but the fact that your husband, knowing what he knows now, didn't intervene on J's behalf shows you that he doesn't think what he and his family did was wrong.  I would not want to stay married to a person that had such an ingrained loathing  of another human being.  It's like J isn't even a person to these people.  Smh",
            "Just my two cents here: call the lawyer before you make any moves involving law enforcement. I can't really think of anything that could happen besides the family fucking with your property but just in case I think that would be the safest route. \n\nSide note: your a phenomenal person OP. Not only have you helped J but you've helped myself as well. I was never really abused I'm just a little off in the head. I don't think like most people I'm just not your average 20 year old I guess. But I do know what it can feel like feeling as though there isn't anywhere to turn probably just like j does. Your post tugged on my feels and really got me to thinking about how I could help. I may not be able to help your situation but that doesn't mean I won't encounter a similar scenario down the road. It was clear you acted fast but were uneasy and I would be too but just the results help me understand what I would do too. I just want to see people smile, the genuine smile not the kind you pose for a picture. I think taking on J will be an immensely long journey for you and your family but I have no doubts it will be rewarding and of all people you can handle it. If there is anything I could do please feel free to PM me. Even if it's money got tight I think I speak for all of us when I say, we would be more than happy to help.",
            "Damn",
            "Marry J and beat your husband.\n\nIts the Hollywood way of doing things.",
            "I thought this was going to be another \"psycho bitch angry at husband for kissing his dying ex\" story. I'm glad it's not. I have no \"advice\" and can't even imagine what the right thing to do is. What I do know is that you're a damn awesome woman. To feel so passionate about this kid that you are repulsed by your husband's inexcusable actions and incapability for knowing he did wrong, is just massively impressive. You are definitely walking your talk. \n\nGood job. Good luck.\n\n....I do suggest though, for whatever it's worth, to reconsider keeping your husband if he and his family acknowledge their cruel acts, apologize and admit they were wrong. Otherwise....fuck 'em!",
            "I think by now everyone's pretty much convinced you that no, you're not overreacting and that entire family sans J are complete pieces of shit.\n\nGood luck, and I hope J cuts off contact with them and accepts your help.  ",
            "You are doing the best thing by divorcing your husband and his disgusting family, and you are an awesome person by helping J",
            "This reminds me of a book titled A Child Called It. If you are looking for some perspective on what J may be feeling and experiencing then I recommend reading it even though the descriptions of abuse are heartbreaking. Reading it when I was younger was the reason I got into my field in education so I can help these kids. ",
            "I'm just sitting here thinking how horrible the abuse must have been in order for a person to divorce someone that they have kids with. It must have been really bad. \n\nI really wanted to know what happened, but now I don't think I want to anymore.\n\nPoor J. Hopefully he willingly accepts your help. Your parents are super awesome for wanting to help and get him out of there. It's interesting hearing about how horrible some people are, followed by hearing about how genuinly great some people can be.",
            "OP, words can't describe how grateful I am for people like you.",
            "Just wanted to say how proud I am of you for what you did, in standing up for J.  You're an amazing woman.  If you had kids, I would be worried that your husband may inflict similar behaviours on them because that's what he learned was proper.  Definitely time to get out before that damage is done.",
            "OP did the right thing.   Husband is and will be a sadistic husband and father.",
            "You are a beautiful human being. I hope you get through this and I hope J gets the help he needs.",
            "Yup, I'd peace the hell out.  You're talking EXTREME Character flaw, to do nothing, let alone contribute.  This is a sick family.\n\nOf course it's easy for a stranger to recommend peacing out.  But behavior like this, this messed up is learned, remembered, and passed along.  \n\nJust saying, that in a case like this, where the abuse was so widespread and twisted?  Complacency is just inexcusable and honestly scary. \n\nI don't think you're over reacting, and I think that removing this family from your life is the only safe course of action.  That's a lot of twisted folks.",
            "Stanford prison experiment ",
            "You are strong. I'm glad there are people like you out there.",
            "The world has hope because of people like you and your family (your Mom and Dad) I have great respect for you. God bless you.",
            "Is hubby and family American? I don't know why I ask this but just curious if there was some cultural vibe here -East European or something. The pride and obstinance reminds me of some People I know.",
            "Yes. ",
            "So, this is probably ignorant of me to say, but the unrepentant bastards who cause suffering like this in the world can't be reformed, taught, or changed. To refuse to apologize to someone who they've tormented so, it's like admitting defeat. Or something. Like it's a point of pride for them to never admit being wrong. IMO, people like that would benefit from having their *********** ripped out with pliers, their ***** cut off, their ****** ripped out, and then being **** in the head. Censored for dramatic retribution.",
            "You're a good person. This world needs more compassionate people like you. \n\n/hug",
            "I'm a victim of child abuse too. I really applaud you, OP, for supporting J like this and taking a stand. I wish someone had for me.  Thank you, it's like you're standing up for me too, further affirming that what happened to me what unacceptable. ",
            "Omg that was horrid to read....\n\n\nI think this will forever leave a mark inside me to wonder if the person I'm dating has done something similar to anyone.\n\nI'm so sorry that you had to go through this.\n\nThe way your husband had no remorse is shocking and haunting.\n\nPlease do divorce him, you have no idea how he will turn out one day, what if he gets suspicious of you? What will he do to your kids?\n\nJ needs help.\n\nJ needs a lot of help.\n\nI hope you can help him in someway, legally adopting him and get him psychologists, but this will be unfair on you.\n\nOh Jesus "
