            "As someone who works in a lab, I'm super pissed off that happened to you. There are *so many* protocols in place to keep that from happening. Goddamnit. I'm so sorry that you had to go through this.",
            "As a lab worker I just want to point out that the doctor's office is probably the one who sent a mislabeled sample.   Most lab errors are clerical and take place before we even get our hands on it, but the lab takes the fall a lot! ",
            "The best part of this seems to be your undying trust and support of your wife. Most people are weak and jump to conclusions in these types of situations  (for good reason). But from reading the first post, you seemed calm and trusting of your wife. \n\nCongrats on the good news and soon congrats on the new member of your beautiful family.",
            "I know doctors are overworked.  I know doctors are doing the best they possibly can.  But when they say things like, \"It's is very rare for these tests to be incorrect,\" I get upset.  For me it was, \"Oh sorry, based on the test results it looks like your wife lost the baby, we should schedule a D&C right away.  These tests are never wrong.\"  Doctor read the test results incorrectly.\n\nEdit: Not DNC (Doh.)",

            "I'd like to add, for future reference, that pregnancy weakens the immune system and often underlying diseases dont show until pregnancy. I see ops wife is negative, congrads! But even if she was positive, it would have been possible that you had been a carrier all along, and she got it from you eventually, but didn't have a flare up until she was pregnant and her immune system was weakened.

She did have some sort of infection but to her it didn't look like herpes and didn't itch. She's never had anything like that before or since, and neither have I. We've been together for 8 years now and haven't been with anyone else in that time. Could it remain dormant for that long, and never show in one of us? Or is it most likely just a false positive on the blood test?",
            "False positives can be a bitch, they really don't care enough to test twice or just once properly because it saves them money. Even if there's a chance it's a false positive, with drug testing at least, they'll try to \"catch you in a lie\" before double checking their results just because it could save them a few dollars.",

All sorts of wonky shit happens when you are pregnant but most likely a positive result like that was a mess up. Even still, she needs a copy of her results to make sure they didn't miss anything else like a yeast infection or HPV. HPV, by the way, is extremely common and in no way indicates she has cheated. It can stay dormant for a decade. ",

            "Can gonnorhea be apart from sexually? I don't know about this in particular, but I know that there have to have been cases where a previously dormant STI from a previous partner, or infection caused by a different transmission method have caused relationship trouble. I had a mild scare once with a red spot, and at no point did either I or my partner accuse the other of cheating. There was a casual \"well, you haven't been with anyone,\" but in a very gentle tone just to cover everything. She also knows that I've only been with one person before her (no penetration either) so it wouldn't have been a dormant thing, so I give her tremendous credit for that level of calm, and I would react the same to her if the situation were flipped around.\n\nWent on a little tangent there, but my original question was what I actually meant to post. Other point still stands though: people, trust your partners, so a negative result or a bit of rug burn that looks like the clap doesn't cause undue harm to the union!",
            "A week after my ex gave birth to our daughter, she got a voicemail from her gyno's office, \"Please call us back immediately, we have your results in.\"\n\nShe didn't know what was up, and in all the business of birth didn't remember one test from another etc. so she calls the office.

        "selftext": "Original Post: https://rr.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/55zq1c/me_26m_with_my_livein_girlfriend_26f_10_years_she/?st=iu45ko64&sh=99d7b298\n\nHey guys I got some really good feedback to my post that made talking to my girlfriend a lot easier and I'm so happy so I thought I owed those posters an update!\n\nAfter reading all the comments and reflecting on our relationship I decided the recent lack of sex was not the problem but just the symptom of a much greater issue, my girlfriend's stress. Like I said in the original post, I was weary to bring these issues up because I did not want to add additional stress to my girlfriend's situation, she has enough to worry about right now.\n\nI had mentioned that weekends are her least busy times and that is when we get things done around the house and hang out with friends. Some users said we should focus less on being social and more on ourselves, and someone else suggested that I try to get more done during the week so we can relax more on the weekend. So on Thursday and Friday I got up early and did everything we needed to do this weekend, cleaned the whole house, did our meal prep (something we usually do Saturday) and got all the laundry taken care of. We're finishing our basement and this weekend was going to be the carpet, so I went to Lowe's and bought everything Thursday and banged it out alone on Friday.\n\nShe noticed the whole house being cleaned Friday night and was really relieved that we didn't have to take care of it this weekend. On Saturday we got up and that was when she realized I had taken care of the carpet and everything else. It was awesome, she was giddy with excitement because she pretty much had nothing to do all weekend. So I asked what she wanted to do and it was stereotypical Fall couple stuff; went and got pumpkins and mums for our porch, went and got some new Fall decorations and candles and then just hung around the house being lazy. While I worked out and walked the dog she did a bit of work to get ahead so she wouldn't be as busy this week. We ate dinner and since we were in a Fall mood we watched Hocus Pocus. \n\nOn Sunday we slept in for the first time in ages... well first time for her, I sleep in all the time, don't judge me. We continued the fall theme and went apple picking. We came home and I made an apple pie. She started doing some work but after about a half hour she said screw it, went for a run and then came home and relaxed. We went to her mom's for a big Sunday dinner and when we got home I decided it was time to talk to her about her unsustainable stress situation. \n\nI told her I loved her and was in it for the long term but that I was worried about her and that her current situation wasn't healthy. She started crying, she thought I was sitting her down to break up with her! She knows that the way she's working isn't healthy but she didn't think it would go on this long. She kept thinking to herself \"just a few more days and I'll get into a flow...just another week...\" and before she knew it it's been 3 months and she's still pulling her hair out. I wasn't going to talk about the lack of sex but she brought it up and apologized. She said her problem isn't the lack of a sex drive/attraction but that she's just exhausted all the time. \n\nAfter we talked, I gave her a big hug, one thing led to another and we ended up having sex! woo! It's Columbus day today so we both are off and it happened again this morning, double woo!!\n\nSome people had suggested I say we schedule some times to hang out which I was against, but my girlfriend suggested something very similar. Saturday night is now the night we make a point to have sex. It used to happen naturally a couple times a week, but with her new schedule that probably isn't going to happen. Saturday night is now our designated night to stay in and make dinner or go on a date with just the two of us and then go home and have sex haha.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'm going to take care of more of the housework so our weekends are less busy and we are going to make it a point to have sex at least once a week. We used to divide it pretty equally but I have a hell of a lot more free time during the week than she does. Also, communication communication, communication. I was thinking this was the beginning of the end, and after a few days and one honest conversation I think everything is going to be just fine. \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Busted my ass last week to get all our housework/responsibilities taken care of before the weekend. Hung out and had a great weekend together. Discussed our situation Sunday night, we figured out a system that will work, and then we finally had sex! I'm going to shoulder more housework/random crap during the week so we can relax together on weekends. \n\n**Edit**: so I guess this post is locked so I'm sorry if I was unable to respond to you guys but I did read all the responses. Thank you for all the support I really didn't think this post would get so much attention!\n\nTo everyone who who just said congrats or gave further advice: thank you so much, your advice really helped me work this out. /r/relationships never fails me!\n\nand to that one guy who came over from /r/TheRedPill keep your chin up, you'll lose your virginity some day",

            "Bravo and congratulations! If I may offer one final piece of advice, Dan Savage (who writes the wonderful sex advice column Savage Love) often advises people to \"fuck first,\" meaning have sex at the beginning of date night, before you go out, rather than at the end. This mitigates the common problem of arriving home after the date very late, drunk, and with a food baby, which too easily can stand in the way of having sex, and if you fuck first it jump-starts the wonderful feelings of romance for the evening. Afterglow is a wonderful thing to bask in.",

In your last post you said you want your girlfriend back, and by putting in just the slightest bit of extra effort, you've got her. Amazing communication. Just makes me feel all warm inside. \n\nBy the way, a scheduled date night will do wonders for you both, even if the concept doesn't seem so fun.

            "Most people miss this one - if something isn't working, try doing it differently. And talking about it. Lots of couples will keep silently banging their heads against the same wall until the relationship is dead and buried. Good for you for shaking out something workable.",

            "I'm similar to your girlfriend in terms of stress and anxiety, and it took me 6 months at a new job before I got 'into the flow.' Up until then I was having issues with insomnia and even broke out in hives. Then I got my positive performance evaluation, found out everything I was doing was fine, and my stress levels dropped to manageable overnight. But it took a full 6 months, which I think is a fairly typical \"getting used to new job\" timeline. So it may still happen for her!!!",
            "Wow. Good for you. Good for her. You handled this amazingly. I'm so happy that things have turned around for you! Another win for good communication! Also, major props to you for stepping up and taking care of more work around the house to make things easier for her. That's incredibly mature of you. Well done all around.",
            "I just want to congratulate you immensely for recognizing that you have so much free time and stepping up to take over some of the housework. That's a really mature and respectful way to help your partner out. I want to applaud you guys, I was really happy reading this, it sounds like you guys are very good for each other!",
            "I'm not trying to be negative, I just want to share my personal experience. I was in a dead bedroom situation for the past 2 years. I'm pretty sure it was stress related, as it began shortly after she had to pickup all the work of a coworker who went on maternity leave, which added a significant amount of unpaid overtime.\n\nThe initial effort and communication was well received and I was hopeful, but it didn't actually last the week. The scheduling (her idea) didn't work because it turned into, \"do you mind if we wait till tomorrow\". And I wouldn't press it, and it would just go months, until I'd bring it up again (rinse repeat). Even after things normalized with her job, the damage was done and we never recovered. Her sex drive never came back.\n\nI'm not saying this is the case for you, I'm just saying that you've made the very first steps and depending, it could be struggle ahead of you, or hopefully, smooth sailing. Though for your SO to go months and not show any interest in sex, even with her busy schedule, is telling. Especially so, since she recognized the problem already, but didn't actually do anything until you made it an issue.",
            "Glad it worked out. Stress is so much easier when you have someone to understand and help you through it.",
            "Awww I loved reading about your organized weekend together !!!! So sweet. Best of luck :)",
            "That is great news and a good update.   I would tell you to be cautious.   I had a deadbedroom for many years and the talk you described happened between my wife and I many times.   I ended up doing many chores and hiring help to do those that I couldn't do in an effort to reduce stress to help our sex life.   Eventually my wife would gravitate back to little to no sex.  The next time I did bring up the issue of lack of intimacy my wife would have one more thing that caused her to lack a libido.   Keep focused on the positive but I am concerned that you didn't have any intimacy Saturday or Sunday until after the talk.   Those two days were stress free and she didn't offer sex even though during the talk she admits to thinking it was a problem.  ",
            "I'm truly happy for you mate!",
            "Hell yeah. My bf and I both work and go to school and we definitely let sexy times slide. We finally dedicated Saturday as the scheduled day and refer to it is \"sexy Saturday.\" It totally helped.",
            "What a pleasant update. I wish you two the very best. Thank you posting and for updating, OP! ",
            "It's good I guess that you talked, but your contribution seems a little uneven.\n\nBasically you're going to take on more housework and she's going to do ... nothing really. Aside from just enjoy the time you've freed up for her by your doing more than half the housework.\n\nWhy doesn't she try to cut down on work? In your first post she seemed to be admitting she doesn't actually need to work that much for the job, she just overachieves because she's a perfectionist. \n\nSeems like your the one doing all the relationship work here and she doesn't have to make any of the changes. If she's financially contributing more to the household then it evens out. But if things are financially even and you're doing more housework... basically you're subsidising her high stress lifestyle simply because she refuses to pull back her excessive work life and you really want to get laid for once.\n\nYou have more free time because you have the brains to work smart not hard... seems a shame to blow that spare time cleaning because she refuses to do the same.",
            "Yay! This is a great start to resolving the issue and kudos to you for getting all the chores done so you two could hang out and reconnect over the weekend. I had a feeling that your SO was also worried about the lack of sex, so it's great that you didn't even have to bring it up to her, she brought it up herself. \n\nOne thing that works for me and my SO is if for some reason one of us doesn't want to have sex on our agreed upon \"schedule\", the person who declines must initiate within 24-48 hours later. It's never 100% on target, but it makes sure that things never feel one sided. To the haters who dislike the idea of \"scheduled sex\": no, we don't have a spreadsheet. It's just a mutual, often unspoken expectation of timing which generally has a pavlovian affect for that specific day/time/set of circumstances. It works for us, YMMV.",

I think a lot of couples overlook taking time out for the purposes of spending time with each other and wouldn't even consider it. I think you're gonna be great.",

I really like family history (not 24&me but like tracing the family tree), so I\u2019ve been doing some research. My dad asked about it and when he mentioned some previous research his first cousin \"Karen\" had done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Me: \u201cwell yeah but that might not be our side of the family, right? She\u2019s technically only your half your cousin right?\"  \n>  \n>My Dad: \"What do you mean, no she's not, Karen is my Aunt Betsy's daughter so she's my cousin.\u201d  \n>  \n>Me: \"Well Grandma and Aunt Betsy are half sisters, right? So you\u2019re only like 25% related.\u201d\n\nTo back up for a second, my grandma is in her 80s and does\u2019t have dementia or anything.  She definitely didn\u2019t just \"get confused\" and say something inaccurate, but it\u2019s very possible she forgot that she hadn\u2019t told her own son and therefore should tell him before she told his daughter.\n\nWhen my grandma told me, it was in a casual context with my parents present (but evidently not listening to our conversation). She said she\u2019d known/suspected since she was young that her younger sister Betsy was a product of an affair. She didn't really frame it as a huge secret, more just a family tidbit that she and Betsy had long since set aside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My Dad: Wait, what do you mean 25%?  \n>  \n>Me:  \u201cWell, Grandma and Betsy don\u2019t have the same father so technically-\"  \n>  \n>My mom: \u201cWHAT? Great-Grandma Name had an affair?!?!?\u201d\n\nI stumblingly apologized and my dad sort of acted like this was something he knew about his mom/grandma, but I could tell from his recovery that he did not know, and was a little rattled by both the revelation and the fact that it had come from his daughter of all people.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t immediately affect his personal self-image - his parents/grandparents are still the same people, we don\u2019t really see that cousin and her family anymore, and obviously all of the adults involved are long dead, but still.\n\n**TL;DR: I told my dad that his own grandmother had an affair and his cousin was his half-cousin. Should I do something? Should I say something to someone? Warn my grandma? Apologize to someone? Or just keep my mouth shut?**",

            "You've done nothing wrong. Your grandmother told you within earshot of your parents and never said it was a secret. However, you might want to check in with your dad. Something like, \"When we talked about Aunt Betsy, I had no idea you didn't know. I'm sorry if it came as a surprise. Grandma mentioned it to me when we visited, so she could probably tell you all about it. I love you and I hope you're ok.\"\n\nNot acknowledging what happened may be more uncomfortable for you and your dad, and also gives far too much importance to this decades-old secret.",
            "I wouldn't listen to the \"mouth shut\" people. The thing is out now already anyway. Go up to your dad and tell him this situation is bothering you. Just openly say that your grandma told you when they were there too so you presumed he knew. And that you're sorry if you upset him, you didn't mean to (and love him). That's all you need to do. If he wants to bring it up to your grandmother, then he is an adult and he could do that perfectly fine himself. Don't fret it too much, you didn't know.",
            "This is honestly unfortunately common with family secrets, especially when you go back a couple of generations and people were making more effort to cover up certain things. My great aunt was a product of my great grandma \"having an affair\" with her 50 year old employer when she was 16 and in domestic service (in reality it's heavily implied in the family it was a rape), with my great aunt subsequently being sent to a home until great grandma was married and they could pretend great aunt was a product of this.\n\nObviously everyone alive in the family at the time knew this but it was never spoken of, kind of an open secret. My grandma (her (half?) sister in law) ended up very matter of factly referring to this at a family event just after my great aunt had passed away decades later much to everyone's shock as we had no clue. My grandma had genuinely just been so used to the idea of it being an open secret that she'd just lost track of who'd actually been told this information and still just assumed everyone knew (like they did back in the day).\n\nI suspect your grandma is in a similar position, especially given she said it in ear shot of your Dad previously. It's easier than you think to lose track of who knows what, especially when the secret in question has been going for decades. I'd not make a big deal out of it but maybe mention to your Grandma that this came up and it seemed like your Dad didn't know or had forgotten, just in case she wants to explain anything to him herself.",
            "I don't think there's anything to really say. This might have shaken your dad's view a little bit, but you didn't do anything wrong and there's nothing to apologize for. Just let it blow over.",
            "Side note: If you\u2019re tracing genes (ala 23&me) the half relationship matters. If you\u2019re tracing family history, it doesn\u2019t. That person was and is part of your family.",

            "It\u2019s a weird feeling when family secrets come out. I recently found out that my aunt secretly had a baby that she gave up for adoption when she was 20. No one in the family knew about it until my mom got a match and message on ancestry.com.",
            "Haha this happened to me in my family. It's a shocker to learn that people who are older, parents, and grandparents are real people too but now you all have a more complex understanding of who they are as people. It's ok :)",
            ">24&me\n\nIs that the version for great apes?",

If she did thorough research, she would still have more information on her mother's side than you would without talking to her, and she might have researched her \"dad's\" side as well.\n\nIt's just a weird reason to not talk to her about the research she's already done.",
            "No biggie, i don't think, since grandma casually mentioned it and he was present.",
            "Naw you\u2019re good. You didn\u2019t tell him anything a DNA test wouldn\u2019t know.",
            "Don't apologise. You didn't do anything wrong. You were told with your parents right there and weren't even told that it was a secret. Just give your dad time to process it.",
            "I don't think you did wrong, my grandad came out with some unknown truths to me and my brother one day, like it was something he talked about casually to people. My dad was a little surprised when he found them out",

            "All you really have is that gossiping grandma said she \u2018suspected\u2019 that her mother had an affair.  If Karen isn\u2019t aware of the gossip either, I suggest you keep quiet about it.",

            "This is late but, I want to say - this matters a whole lot to your Aunt Betsy. And to Karen. And to everyone at the time who were to have this revelation. But it really doesn't matter now, like at all. If you treat it like a bombshell it will become one. Shit happens. Be open with your family about it, invite the idea of your grandma and dad discussing it so she has a chance to defend why she didn't mention it (I forgot, I thought you knew, we weren't discussing it with anyone at the time and I guess I just never mentioned it, etc). And just move on.",
            "This is dumb. Any family that does the half sibling shit is a shitty family.",
            "Since it\u2019s \u201cknown/suspected\u201d, it\u2019s probably only Grandma\u2019s opinion and may not be the case.",
            "There is actually no such thing as a \"half\" cousin. You can maybe use that description among siblings with different parents, but with cousins, whoever is the parent doesn't matter, you would always fully be a cousin. As for siblings, there may be something separated in the genetic pool, but in reality, that is always your full sibling by sharing just one parent.. you either come from the same egg pool or semen pool. These are made up descriptions to help children know who the parent is, when the adults have had children with multiple partners. The term \"half\" is kind of an illusion.",
            "Keep your mouth shut and let it blow through....",
            "Your dad had every right to know too. You're not in the wrong, I think you Grandma should have told him this years ago. It doesn't change the nature of his relationship with his family. Blood doesn't make family, bonds do. So you are ok. I know you feel bad, but really the only thing that changes is the way things are referenced, not the love that is felt.",
            "Oh well.  The truth shall set you free!",
            "There's nothing for you to say. As you said, you believed he knew.",
            "I'd not worry too much about. I would maybe explain you just thought he knew because of how grandma told you, but you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nThese sorts of things tend to be a big shock at first, but that tends to fade quickly. At the end of the day it doesn't really change anything and was in the long distant past.",
            "Wow! Yeah, things said between grandma and grandchild are another level of honest. I tell my gram EVERYTHING! She does the same. You should probably apologize to someone, I guess. It\u2019s not really that big of a deal.",
            "I would bring it up and just say I wish I had handled that with more tact, I'm sorry if I upset you. I love you Dad. \n\nFollow his lead from there. \n\nIt's not about fault. It's about keeping your yard clean and nurturing important relationships.",
            "You're okay. You did nothing wrong. Your adult if a father needs to handle this one. Grandma was in the wrong for not telling him as an adult.\n\nThe funny thing is that before ancestry, stay at home moms definitely had affairs (since single income households were the norm back then). There definitely are stories of people finding out they weren't 100% related through ancestry.",
            "Talk to him about it privately. It's possible he knew, but is more upset at the rest of the family finding out. If he didn't know, you should tell him that you assumed he knew. He's probably not angry at you, just a little shocked that you knew.",
            "NTA. All families have \"secrets\" that older generations aren't always open about. But if they come to light, they come to light, and with DNA testing now, that's more likely than not. I think the advice to reach out to your dad that Freckledfrida gave is good. You didn't intend to do any harm.\n\nWe had this happen in my own extended family:\n\nA few years ago my oldest sister and I went to San Francisco and met a whole raft of 2nd and 3rd cousins she'd uncovered while continuing the genealogy research our mom had started decades ago.\n\nMy grandfather had two brothers, one of whom had a falling out (over a will? not sure) with the others and disappeared around the turn of the twentieth century (my dad was born in 1906). \n\nSomehow my sister had figured out that he'd moved to California, maybe following the gold rush, and once there had settled in, doing well for himself. He'd married and had kids, but refused to tell his new family anything about the family he'd left.\n\nHe was long gone, but once my sister and the cousin she'd reached out to over a forum connected all the dots, they figured out he was my dad's uncle who'd disappeared. \n\nWe had a wonderful time and a couple of family gatherings with these newly-found cousins, and they were astonished to realize that between my grandfather and his *five* sons, and their 19 children, there dozens and dozens of 2nd and 3rd cousins all over Texas and the rest of the US.\n\nWonderful people, and who knows *what* the start of the estrangement actually was. My mom always disliked my dad's father, but would only say \"He was a son of a bitch.\" But who knows?\n\nFamilies are weird sometimes.",
            "Honestly I would bring up that they were literally there for the conversation, and *clearly* not paying attention. It's not like it was a secret conversation where you learned everything they've been keeping from your dad, y'know? It might help a lot to know that it's not specifically been kept from him on purpose.",
            "I just want you to know we have all slipped up at times and it's normal. I know how you might feel but don't beat yourself up too much about it. I do agree with many of the posts here stating that you should check up on your dad.",
            "You're fine your grandma didn't care it's old news and if your dad acted like he knew then let him hurting no one so it's all good",
            "I would give grandma a heads up to your Dad's reaction, but other than that I don't see an issue. \n\nI'm also a genealogy buff and in the 90s I was pestering my grandma for info on her first marriage  - I couldnt find the marriage info anywhere.  She finally gave in and wrote me a letter with a lot of personal info that her children did not know. I had to promise to never tell her kids the info, but was free to record it and use in my research records. \n\nGrandma willingly told you this info, in front of your parents.  She clearly did not intend to exclude them from the info, so I see no wrong doing on your part.",
            "Okay but was Aunt Betsy in contact with her supposed biological father who wasn't your grandma's father? It seems like if it she was the product of a secret affair (which you don't actually know, just suspect) that she wouldn't have been, so why would the research she did not be relevant to your \"family history\"?",
            "You could say that, since grandma told you in front of dad, you assumed he knew.\nI agree with those who say that it's far enough in the past that it's not a big deal anymore, and your dad is far enough removed that it shouldn't upset him, but you never know. Some people just can't tolerate any insinuation that things were not as they imagined. I would just stress that this was unsolicited information that you thought he knew.",

            "Personally I'd let it be. It's not your problem and you've done nothing wrong. In fact, the only ones who have are deceased. Not being told is something your dad will (likely) forgive his mother for and hopefully understand that it's a piece of information that's best kept from a child and just never came up when he was an adult",
            "I fail to see an issue here. Sure it was awkward but how were you supposed to know if it was a secret?  Maybe it's not even a secret. Just something that was never mentioned. \n\nIf he's upset he can talk to the people he needs to talk to to clear things up. Otherwise, just move on.

            "Nobody has proof and it's way back in the family tree. \n\nJust don't discuss it more.",
            "NTA it wasnt your secret to keep either. I busted my g-grandmother too. Did DNA and family tree. Oops. Ah well. Some stats estimate a full third of kids are/were raised by a man who isn't their father and neither of them are aware.",
            "Mouth shut mouth shut mouth shut.\n\nThis is always a risk when digging into family histories and genealogy. People lose track of who knows what, people die and leave behind bombshell revelations among their belongings, all sorts of messiness can get dug up and cause problems. You learned a valuable lesson here, and it\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t assume that someone knows a thing if they have never directly told you they know the thing.\u201d \n\nThis information is now in your dad\u2019s hands and he gets to decide what to do with it. If your grandmother told you in casual conversation, she won\u2019t be shocked if word gets back to her that the secret is out. Your dad may prefer to drop it entirely, and I would give him the chance to do that before running off to sound the alarm.",
            "I'm failing to see the issue here,  OP. You found out a slightly interesting history based on Christian tradition, otherwise it's -no- thing.  Nothing. Ask yourself, and then ask your father, \"does this change anything? Anything at all?\"",
            "Who gives a shit about any of this?",
            "I don\u2019t believe in family secrets, the truth always comes out- Fear, Obligation, and Guilt won\u2019t stop me from telling the truth.\n\nMy advice is to get out of the FOG and don\u2019t let anybody tell you to lie on their behalf or withhold the truth for that matter",
            "> When my grandma told me, it was in a casual context with my parents present (but evidently not listening to our conversation).\n\nI don't think you should feel bad for revealing this family secret.  If anything, your grandmother should feel *triply* bad about how this went down: first for actually cheating, second for not coming clean, and third for placing the responsibility of the knowledge on you.\n\nPersonally, if I was told this by a relative, I'd *immediately* spill the tea to see if it's a secret or not.  If it wasn't a secret, you're just being a bit crass with something people dealt with already.  If it was a secret, you're doing a solid to everybody in your life that was kept in the dark.  Holding onto someone else's dirty laundry is just a good way to get dirty yourself."

You\u2019re mature enough to see it; she\u2019s not. \n\nAlso, six months is often still a \u201choneymoon\u201d period, in which you\u2019re both still infatuated with each other. It sounds like you are, but she isn\u2019t. (I maintain that it isn\u2019t \u201clove\u201d until you\u2019ve farted, pooped, or vomited in front of the other person and they still see you as a romantic and sexual partner, albeit not at that moment).\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that had you met five or ten years later, your relationship would truly have the potential you saw in the beginning. But it doesn\u2019t at this time. You\u2019re better off making a clean break.\n\nAs for her - I can empathize because I was immature and selfish and over dramatic at that age. I was dumped by someone I loved, and who loved me, because I was not capable of having a healthy relationship then. BUT the break up was part of what taught me how to behave, how to get my own shit in order before being in a relationship. Poor actions have negative consequences, and nobody is required to sacrifice their mental and financial health for the sake of love that isn\u2019t mutual.\n\nGood luck!",

You can't stay in a relationship where the other party refuses to compromises and always wants their way to be done. I think you should just focus on getting high grades and completing your studies for now. Being immersed in your study will distract you from the heartbreak and hopefully help you move on. \n\nI'm personally against having the 'final chat' as this leads to reconciliation and a cycle of regret and toxicity. Please think hard on this. Can you stand another day of an unhealthy relationship? Another week? Month?\n\nDon't let other people take advantage of you again specially when you're currently not in the right headspace after the break up.

Thanks for all the comments.  \n\n\nAfter the post, I talked to her. Telling her that something felt shady about the whole cheating accident, I asked her for details, that I needed her to be honest.  \n\n\nJust a reminder, before this, she told me it was not a big deal, just some sexual texts. Turns out, it was that, plus nudes, plus bonding, plus other sexual stuff. It was at the point she thought about leaving me for him.  \n\n\nI was dumbfounded. She admited that despite telling me she stopped talking to him, she didn't. That, in her point of view, he saved her life, as he was the only person in the world she felt comfortable enough talking in details about her suicidal thoughts, and that \"sex was just to thank him, he deserved it\".   \n\n\nShe refused to stop talking to him. I told her that, in this case, we'd break up. She told me to grow up, we broke up. She went CRAZY and sent me images of her hurting herself, saying she's kill herself and asking her friends to tell me she'll kill herself.  \n\n\nAfter some time, she calmed down and apologized. I told her that at first I wanted to break up to heal, trust her again and maybe build a new romantic relationship, but that it was impossible after the crap she did.   \n\n\nI'll focus on myself rn, but I'm still feeling dependant, and I still... love her. We agreed on a friends with benefits kinda relationship if everything was cool between us at the end of the quarantine (which could end at the end of the month, or in a month, depending on the situation.)  \n\n\nI know you told me it was a bad idea, but heh, I need time to change everything.

If they were in the same college class \u2014 same thing, but they shouldn\u2019t study together outside class or work on class stuff together like essays. \n\nAn RP server is legit way down on the list of acceptable places they HAVE to meet up. Asking her to block him on the server and on other platforms would have been perfectly reasonable because RP and Smash are fucking hobbies. Sometimes this happens in friend groups - two people can\u2019t associate. People work around it. \n\nThe fact you thought that \u201cof course\u201d the RP server contact should be allowed shows you are willing to put up with and accept more shit than you should be. \n\nMy point is, take care of yourself first, and your boundaries. I\u2019m a strong believer than most boundaries are non negotiable. Prioritize the important boundaries to protect yourself.\n\nYou\u2019ve seen first hand what happens when someone  keeps talking to a sexual partner. Your ex is now with that guy. You\u2019re going to catch feelings again if you keep seeing her. Just cut the losses and move on unless you want this to repeat. \n\n\nBy the way, regarding geek social fallacies, here are the two I think apply\n\nGSF1 - Ostracizers are evil\n- idea that excluding someone from a group makes you an asshole\n- there is a difference between petty reasons for exclusion and good reasons for it\n\nGSF5 - friends do everything together\n- you don\u2019t have to do everything together as a group\n- this includes doing stuff with people like the guy\n\n\nEDIT: I snooped and saw your post about how the ex won\u2019t admit cheating. \n\nAdvice: relationships aren\u2019t courtrooms. You do not need evidence to believe what you believe. Some things cannot be argued. \n\nEx admitting they cheated changes nothing. You know they cheated. You know at the least they did shitty things. A search for admission is a search for validation or closure or communication. The first two come from within and you certainly don\u2019t need the third with her.",

She doesn't care about your wants or needs is immature as fuck. She's the one who has a lot of growing up to do.

She'll pay lip services and say whatever is needed to keep you staying there a bit longer but we have seen this play out so many times before. \n\nUltimately, don't have sex with her just because you are dependant on her. Let the scan heal because the sooner you heal the sooner you can get back in the game and find someone who will love you.

Look at it from her perspective, she had a relationship with you, then she found this other guy she was interested in too. She realised you'd never be ok with her pursuing a sexual relationship with him, so she cheated and kept it a secret. Now you've 'broken up' but you're still in contact, and you're still sleeping together. So basically, you've given her the greenlight to do what she wanted all along: be with both you, and GIH. She said the nudes were a 'reward' but you're not stupid, she enjoyed the attention, imagine there was a girl out there who got off on nude photos of you, and was willing to reciprocate? Wouldn't that make you feel gratified? Now she gets the both of you fighting over her, win win for her.\n\nWhat is this FWB arrangement not giving her that you two's relationship was? And how are you going to feel when she starts talking to/sleeping with other guys? Because that doesn't sound like it's going to be healthy for someone already struggling with depression.

Eventually she cuts contact with you to make her new bf happy, and you end up having to try and move on however much further down the line anyway.\n\nb) neither of you are able to get over each other, and find no one else permanent before eventually getting back together because it's the easiest thing to do.

I'll do that.\n\nI'm not a mental health professional by any means, so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I'm a bit dumbfounded that your therapist would give you this advice when your gf is clearly demonstrating abusive manipulation behavior.\n\nShe cheated on you and gaslit you into thinking it was a \"you problem\" that you had an issue being around the person she cheated on you with and when you tried to break up she threatened suicide. These are textbook abusive behaviors. Your girlfriend is extremely, profoundly, and deeply unwell and it  seems unhealthy to continue to expose yourself to a person who is so incredibly toxic right now. Having a mental illness is a challenge, but it's not an excuse. \n\nI think even having a fwb type situation is ill advised given her demonstrated propensity for manipulation. My suspicion is that for folks like this it's a one-way kind of deal: *they*  get to sleep with whomever but expect you to be committed to hooking up with them only and will get upset when you see other people. \n\nBy all means, you do what you think is best for you but I'm just a bit shocked that you'd be given that advice by a therapist. \n\nAlso, this guy sounds like a MAJOR creep. If he slept with someone as \"thanks\" for helping them through suicidal ideation, that is disgusting. Your gf is mentally ill and he took advantage of her in a moment of weakness.

It is ultimately your decision, but I must chime in with the \"don't do FWB\" crowd.\n\nFurthermore, I think she knows she screwed up and is using your feelings for her as a bargaining chip.

She's not fucking stupid, she understands what she did. No normal person would even conceive of doing such a thing if they were genuinely remorseful and trying to win back their partner. THEN, she obliquely tried to make you feel bad by saying, \"Only HE was there for me and understood me when I was ~~attention seeking by~~ threatening suicide!\" Trying to imply you're not good enough. Straight from the negging handbook. Yuck. And THEN she tried to manipulate you again by threatening to hurt herself when you actually tried to stand up for yourself. And now you may keep some type of relationship with this awful person?\n\n\nHoney, she's got you pegged good - she sees you as a sucker she can steamroll. You deserve better than that shit. You have the right to stand up with self-respect and say, \"I deserve far better than you and your shitty manipulation and total disregard for me as a person.\"\n\n\nYou love the idea of her, and the ideal of her; because in reality, she is not what you want her to be. \"When you have rose-colored glasses on, all the red flags just look like flags.\" She is *everything* she does, not just the times she makes you feel good.  Ted Bundy was a swell guy to lots of people lots of the time. Doesn't mean you should fuck him! How could you love a person who cheats on you, lies to you, and manipulates you? Because sometimes she's fun to be with and \"gets\" you? Because you feel like she's unique and special and it's you two against the world? Honey, if it was you two against the world, she wouldn't be sexting some other dude and trying to make YOU feel like you're to blame for it.\n\n\nIf you are afraid of being alone, you need to absolutely be alone for a while, and learn to be comfortable with that. Because people like her definitely target those that they believe will put up with their shit, and so far she's not wrong; you put up with all of her shit so far, and she's slowly tugging you back in. You deserve so much better.\n\n\n I know all of this may sound harsh, but I'm telling you this as someone who wants to help you avoid painful mistakes. You are only 20, and have a whole life ahead of you to find someone who would never dream of cheating on you. You just have to be willing to believe you deserve it. When you're needy, and maybe clingy, and obviously worship the person you're with - bad people can take advantage of that. You go back with this gal, and you're going to be in this same situation in a year, 3 years, five years - but with added heartbreak and wasted time.",
            "Omg I think you need a new counselor. I can't imagine having someone this unstable and manipulative in your life is good for your mental health at all. \n\nDon't do the FWB just break up and block and never look back.",
            "Look, I know you can't turn off your emotions like you can flip a light switch, but that's all the more reason you need to truly DISTANCE yourself from her - she is TOXIC and like radiation, she will only poison you the longer you stay around her. \n\nHer threats of suicide and pictures of her hurting herself is EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION. And even if you really, truly think she'll kill herself, you call the police (if that's the protocol in your country) and ask them to perform a welfare check because someone you know is threatening suicide. It is NOT YOUR JOB to rescue her. You are not equipped to do so, and even if you were, you're too close to her to give her the help she needs. Not to mention, you need help yourself.\n\nFWB? Have you asked yourself how she could so easily move to FWB, which is all sex with no emotional attachment (which rarely happens - someone always catches feels - you already have them BEFORE going into this arrangement, good grief), after supposedly being in love with you? Either 1. she plans to use this an opportunity to \"win you back\" which would be all gain but all pain for you or 2. she never had the emotional depth you thought she did to begin with (aka: she was just using you from the word \"go\"). I'm not your therapist, but I don't think this is what your therapist meant. I don't see how FWB would make your situation better AT ALL.",
            "I'm glad that you're focusing on you. Just as a tip from someone who has done FWB with someone who had similarly extreme reactions to things, having a FWB with someone like that is a bad idea. Toxic relationships can still be toxic outside the confines of a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship.",
            "Hey, here is one thing that I want to voice, reading the other comments... there are some strongly opinionated people on reddit. You should read what people have to say, but take it with a grain of salt (even this one). In the end you should do you, not what others think! \n\nI understand why many would not want such person in my life, (knowing what you wrote from this and the previous post) I (probably) wouldn't want it either. But you know the situation far better than anyone and you know what you want! \n\nSo keep asking yourself if you are fine if things are as they are and if you are okay with them. (asking because it is not something that you should ask before you make a decision but also after the decision, in a week, in a month.....)",

You need some deal breakers in this relationship and what she did should definitely fall into that category.  She's manipulating you.  She's keeping the guy and forcing you to deal with it   She threatened to hurt herself and forces you to deal with it.  Now she's asking for a FWB relationship and made you think that was a good idea.  After you kick this chick to the curb, find a new therapist.",

            "Erhm. She sounds nuts. Don\u2019t stick around for that to blow up.",
            "First off dont be FWB with this person , ever..... She sounds (all mental bs aside) like a very selfish and toxic person. 2nd. Move on. 20 yo is WAY to young to hung up on this shit when there are PLENTY of better people in the world. Start fresh. No other advice needed.",
            "FWB is never going to work. She is not your friend. She is not even friend material.",
            "I don't think your gf is gay from your descriptions. Are you sure this isn't a phase for her.",
            "So, I have mentioned this a couple of times... but boy I never thought it\u2019d be something that 100% applies. I wish I didn\u2019t have to use this anecdote, but I have to. \n\nMy old friend before he kicked the bucket (suicide) had a girlfriend just like that. She cheated on my friend any chance she could. Whether your situation be some one time thing or not, people who especially have mental health issues are susceptible to doing it again. They try and attach themselves to someone not out of pure love, but out of dependency of someone carrying the baggage of their emotions. Which could be why they cheat. Because the more people you have, the more emotional and sexual (people use sex as a coping mechanism; I know I have) support on that level of intimacy you have. \n\nMy friend went through all the works. Whenever he wanted to leave, she\u2019d show photos of her self harming as well as saying she\u2019d kill herself. She put all of this responsibility on him by saying that his response will determine if she does it. I dunno if she was doing it out of selfishness and malice or if it is from a pitiful yet unaware place in her heart. As someone who has watched this being done to someone else, who has been the receiver of this situation, and who has been the person who remorsefully has done it, it is severely not okay to put all of that on you. \n\nNonetheless the tactics worked. No matter of the intention is maliciously manipulative or unawarely selfish, the person doing this ultimately wants you to know how upset they are and what emotions they have. They want you to come and comfort them for validation. So in my friend\u2019s case, she continued the cycle. She blamed it on mental health. I broke seeing how he would just passively say, \u201cWell you cheated again...\u201d and her response would be to blame my friend or to blame her depression. When things got better, he was forced to associate with these people that knowingly had sex with her while they were together. All because she forced him to. People this emotionally unstable can be harmful in ways you don\u2019t expect. \n\nIf you can\u2019t see by now, my friend actually committed suicide in that relationship. All of the pressure, the hatred, the deceit, and him expected to take all of this cost his life. We told him to leave her, but he was too blindsided by the adrenaline of the abuse to ignore it. He was so compassionate for others that he forgot his own needs. \n\nThat was his ending and it\u2019s not certain that it\u2019s yours. But I\u2019m telling you as someone who sympathizes that you need to cut contact. My friend tried breaking it off multiple times, but found himself back in her arms. More bruised than the last time. If you keep coming back whether it be a friend, a partner, or an enemy, you\u2019re enabling them. You\u2019re telling them that their behavior is acceptable since it hasn\u2019t deterred you from their life. Don\u2019t do this whole FWB thing. You\u2019re fueling her to throw more baggage and responsibility on you. She will use it to keep you within her grasp. It is a tough time during this pandemic, but you have a plethora of hotlines, especially an abuse hotline specifically for the pandemic that will be of a great aid to you. Suicide hotline is also important once the dust settled and you\u2019re left alone in your thoughts. God knows suicide hotline helped my ass. Please take all of these things I said to heart. I and everyone else wants to see you get through this adversity with sunshine around you and a big, confident smile on your face. What you laid out in your update will most likely give you the opposite. Take this seriously. It cost my friend his will to live succumbing to the abuse.",
            "So now you two aren\u2019t dating, she gets to keep you and him in her life with zero commitment to you? Sounds like she\u2019s getting her way because now she gets to have both of you in her life. I\u2019d honestly distant yourself and cut her out",

            "She's not trustworthy at this point and wants the benefits of two people chasing her. At this point, it's best to instantly break things off with her and go cold turkey. Your therapist may believe otherwise, but it's not healthy to stay with someone who's this unstable. It's not your job to ensure she maintains a stable mind and it's immature of her to expect that from you.\n\nNo matter what she does, how she'll threaten to hurt herself and whatnot, do not answer her. A 'friends with benefits' situation is just the way for you both to cling to each other when it's clear she's moved on and is wanting to have you only as a side-partner.

What do you think she\u2019s doing? Banging some dude while she can have you at the same time? I don\u2019t want to be judgemental, but you need to reevaluate your life goals. \n\nIs being stepped on helpful to your emotional well being? Do you like being devalued by your girlfriend like this? This is all infuriating. Besides you\u2019re only 22. The only obvious path for your own benefit is block this person and never contact her again.

            "So, here's what I did when I was in somewhat of a similar situation.\n\nI had a girlfriend who, when we broke up, went off the deep end in a similar fashion to how your girlfriend did. Pics, suicidal threats, etc.\n\nI immediately called 911 and informed them of the suicide threats and I sent the pics to her family with the message \"Please make sure she gets the help she needs.  I'm very worried for her, but I can't be with somebody like this anymore\".\n\nOf course the cops did a wellness check on her and she Lost.Her.Shit. and they put her in a psych hold. Her parents were shocked by the pics but understood and thanked me for reaching out.\n\nI never heard from her again.\n\nTL;DR is that that kind of stuff is WAY above your paygrade. You can't fix her, and you shouldn't try. it's not your job. Let the people who are responsible for her handle her.

All the while was talking about how she loved me but I knew she couldn't stop thinking about him and wanted him as her side dude just in case things between them could work out. In some of our big fights she threatened to hurt herself to the point where I'd have to stop fighting just to ensure her safety or prevent her from doing something like throwing herself down the stairs.\n\nShe also tried to make me feel guilty. She tried to make me feel like I was abusive. She tried to make me feel like I was responsible for any of it.\n\nTruth is that I was abused, just like you.

I'm not here to tell you what to do but I would encourage you to keep a few things in mind going forward.\n\n- If you do get back together, it is very likely that SO cheat on you again\n\n- Your SO is emotionally manipulative. I want to make one thing clear, *your SO did not go crazy.* She knew exactly what she was doing when she cut herself and sent you those photos of her hurting herself as well as trying to rally your friends into guilting you. She only apologized when she realized that this tactic wasn't working on you\n\n- It may be in your best interest to take any apology and/or promise with a grain of salt. I strongly advise against giving this woman the benefit of the doubt. Like...ever. She has demonstrated that she is untrustworthy, manipulative, and doesn't respect you. *She will not change.*\n\n- You mentioned feeling \"dependent.\" It is very likely that, at some level, she knows this about you and knows how to exploit this.\n\n- Most importantly, if you do decide to take her back, understand that it is extremely unlikely that she will get better from here. In fact, she will most likely only get worse. I've met people like the girl you're describing and I've seen how they ruin their SOs, it's all bad.\n\nIf you truly feel that you wanna take her back, so be it. Just understand that *cheating,* *lying,* *and emotional manipulation* will all be issues with which you will constantly have to deal. It will never stop. *She* will never stop. These things will likely be a regular part of your relationship should you decide to take your SO back. It's up to you to decide whether or not she's worth it",
            "Your therapist has a point about asking for advice on Reddit and it is great that you are being honest with your therapist.\n\nBut I am telling you from experience. An FWB situation with someone like her is a BAD idea! I have done the same thing with exes that were bad news for my wellbeing and EVERY TIME it hurt, it was nasty (not in a sexy way) and it took a toll on me.\n\nIf you need an FWB, go on Tinder, OK Cupid or something and be clear that you are looking for something casual. You will find someone. Don\u2019t do the \u201cmerry go round\u2019 \u201c with exes. I have been there and done that. It was a waste of my time, energy and sanity! \n\nGood luck in whatever you do!

I know, It's hard when you love someone. That was my problem too. Some people have a very broken personality. They will show you a very sweet side of themselves, that you get attached to, but then do things like this. When you are in a healthy mutually respectful relationship things like this don't happen. I know that you love her and I'm sure that she has lots of good qualities but, if you continue this with her you are heading down a very dark path. Look up borderline personality disorder because, from experience, this is whats happening with her. Just remember that there is only so much that you can do for someone else.

I'm sure that you still believe she is a good person, and that might make you disregard some of the opinions here. While none of us truly know how good or bad of a person anyone in your life is, it does seem like the two of you together brings out some very unstable parts of each of you. Nothing that you have described sounds like a healthy relationship, and I think you would agree with that if you were reading your posts as an outsider.\n\nI feel like you need a lot more time away to heal and try being with other people. Continuing a fwb relationship, or even holding onto the possibility of one, wouldn't help you reach any closure. It also could put you two at more risk of harming yourselves or each other. It does seem like a clean break is what is needed for a good while (not just a month or two), but ultimately it is in your hands. Good luck, and I hope that you both can continue on your path to improving your mental health! :)",

            "Hey, sorry for being late to the party, but I might have life experience to draw from. I'm a lady who dates ladies and I have definitely been through stuff like this. My current gf & best friend have also been in the same situation. I'm 29, and I feel like this kind of relationship seems like a shitty, but common milestone in queer lady relationships.\n\nAll 3 of us had that girl in our college days. We had someone that pulled us around their drama storm. We wanted to care for them so they can see the light & become their best self. They had a legitimate problem that pulled on our heartstrings. They were beautiful enough to cloud our judgement. We wanted them to bond with us.\n\nAll 3 of these women cheated on us. All 3 of these women played it off as less serious than it was. All 3 of them emotionally blackmailed us with suicide, fake pregnancy, or homelessness. We all took them back because, well, we missed them. We loved them.\n\nWhen you're 20, you're an adult who's still growing. It's weird. The part that grows is the emotional & communicative part of your brain. It's easy to be attracted to high maintenance people at this point. Some people have an experience like this, decide to move on, and later realize that's not what they want from love at all. This is the lesson of your 20's.\n\nSome people never learn that lesson, or it's the only thing they know so that's what they expect. Unfortunately, my friend falls in that category. She's dating a demisexual (plays out as straight in this case) that has a sketchy past, some serious daddy issues and super controlling behaviors.\n\nSome people, like me, need to repeat the class, so to speak. I went through a few of these relationships before I met someone that never expected me to bear major emotional burdens for her. She was just happy to have a good time. She was very positive, motivated towards self-improvement, and was a very confident gal. We were only casual for a few months, but that was okay. That's all either of us wanted, since we were so burned out from the stuff you're going through.\n\nAfter that, I started finding more emotionally grounded women. It turned out that they were just as enrapturing as the drama llamas, but it didn't hurt anymore. Mature discussions regularly occurred. Things like needs, wants, & boundaries where discussed & encouraged. I can't even begin to tell you how good that feels. It's like wearing glasses for the first time, or losing 100 lb of dead weight. It feels safe & exciting at the same time.\n\nThese are shitty growing pains, but in a way they're good for personal growth. When you're a queer gal, dating only gets easier from here. It gets better. Right now it hurts, but enforcing boundaries is better for both parties, even if parting ways is the healthiest choice (and let's be real, it definitely is at this point). \n\nGood luck man. Love happens more than once. I believe in you.",
