        "selftext": "Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3uopmm/i_27m_proposed_to_my_girlfriend_26f_of_2_years/\n\n\nSO, after confirming that my relationship was a massive communication disaster, I am writing this update to you all after a week of couples therapy with Ashley. I'm going to share what we have learned about each other. \n\n\nTo start with me: I am way too \"chill\" in relationships. I've always been this way with everyone. Nothing ever bothers me, I go with the flow really easily, I react minimally to unexpected situations. While this is a blessing in some ways, it turns out Ashley had a really hard time with this. Since I never fought or had any issues with her, she felt like SHE couldn't bring up any issues with me. She basically did not want to always be the one starting fights (or even, I guess, discussions). \n\n\nIt also was (surprise) a HUGE fault of mine to never tell my girlfriend, who I love deeply, that I loved her. I should not have presumed we were equally nonverbal, especially after two years. And, more importantly, it's not OKAY for me to be this nonverbal. Communication skills are something I am severely lacking. \n\n\n\n\nNow, on to her: As it turns out, in her last THREE relationships, Ashley said I love you first. All three times, it turned out poorly for her. They didn't say it back, or they said it without really meaning it, and they ended up leaving her. That's why she never said it to me. She had actually been making a really big effort to also be \"chill\" because she didn't want me to react poorly to her. But, as it is clear now, she was just not being herself at all. I understand and empathize with this.\n\n\nAfter this blowup, Ashley now realizes that it was a mistake for her to keep her mouth shut and be silently stewing for YEARS. There was no reason to be so passive aggressive. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, proposing to somebody without having a thorough discussion of marriage and our future was a mistake. I thought it was a romantic gesture, but it was really a sign of poor planning and lack of communication.\n\n\nOur therapist has given us homework. She has basically told us that we, daily, have to \"check in\" with each other. We need to assign a time to voice our concerns about each other, share how we feel about each other, talk about how we can improve our relationship. \"I love you\" will now be a frequent exchange.\n\n\nOnce we get into the habit of doing some mandatory communication, it should come more naturally to us in the future. For now, all weddings and proposals are going to be put on hold. We're nowhere near ready to be married until we figure out ourselves and our relationship better. \n\n\nFor now, we are both happy and relieved that we are taking positive steps towards improving our relationship. It's clear (and now stated) that we both love each other very much. \n\n   \n**tl;dr**: We're doing couples therapy. We've learned a lot about each other and how to communicate. Things are getting better. Weddings and proposals are on hold until we figure each other out. ",

            "I want to bookmark this thread for when people with different communication styles make posts that say they've been \"blindsided\" by something their partner did! You explained so well the types of problems that couples tend to have when they communicate differently. I'm so glad you're making it work and that you've taken lessons from what happened. That's a great foundation for marriage. I wish you both the best.",
            "Oh, you are my husband. It used to really bother me that he never said those words to me, and when I brought it up to him, he wondered why I didn't KNOW he loves me. \"Didn't I just fix _____ for you? Didn't I just tile the bathroom floor for you? We have sex all the time.\" He will speak those words about 3 times each year and that's it. But we've been married for so many years now that I can tell what that twinkle in his eye means. He just shows his love differently. He then brought up my abusive, narcissistic parents who say all the right things, including *I love you* only to turn around and stab me in the back. \n\nHappy to see such a nice update. You will both be on the same page soon!",

I thought it was a romantic gesture, but it was really a sign of poor planning and lack of communication.\n\nI think this is such a huge thing. When I got engaged, so many people asked me \"was it a surprise?\" No, we had discussed marriage, and our future together, several times. And I knew the proposal was coming, just not when.\n\nI imagine it has something to do with movies/media, where the idea of a Grand Gesture/Surprise is so important, but really in my mind a marriage proposal should never be a true surprise",

            "Who doesn't say I love you within 2 years? I'm really not trying to be condescending... to me, I just don't see how it's possible when it happened within 3 weeks to 3 months in my past relationships. And good job! I hope that you both get what you want out of this relationship!",
            "Okay. Break up with her. Go no contact. Hit the gym. Contact a lawyer. \n\n/s\n\nThere are a couple of books I would highly recommend. One is The 5 Love Languages by Gary D. Chapman. Briefly, there are 5 different ways that people receive love and fill up their love tank. Each person generally has a primary one and a couple secondary and then one or two ways that they do not respond well to (not that they respond poorly but they just do not pick up on the gesture... it is not big deal). These 5 languages are Physical, Verbal, Service Oriented, Quality Time, and Gifts. Read it with your girlfriend and see what ways she receives love and doesn't. It gives practical tips and tricks to meet her needs. Likewise she should do the same for you.\nThe other books is called Please Understand Me II by David Keirsey. It is a personality type book (like the MBTI). It allows you to see how she processes things and if there are any points of tension between you two. It is important because if there are disagreements it could either be because there is a real problem or that both of you are just leaning into what feels most natural (it can lead to conflict). For example an extrovert may get frustrated that an introvert does not go out as much (the introvert may appear to not care about the extroverts need to socialize but that is not true at all, introverts just like quiet time). \n\nBoth of these books can really help you understand the other and communicate love better.",
            "Great news, OP! I don't have much to add to what everyone else has said here, but I did want to talk about one thing. I am just so impressed with you and your SO, not only for taking the initiative to go to counseling, but for owning your own shortcomings and working on them. I have no doubt that you are laying the framework for a wonderful, happy marriage. \n\nGood for you, and best of luck to you both!",

            "man, people make a really big stink about a few fuggin words. people, if you love someone just fucking say it. it doesn't mean you're married after that.",
            "I'm glad to see you didn't listen to everyone telling you to break up, which is way too common on every relationship post. Reddit is forever alone because he doesn't work through things and runs for the hills at the first sign of struggle. ",
            "Good on you for getting into therapy while the relationship is still okay and things are fixable. That's pretty rare.",
            "This is why therapy/counseling is always recommended. Good on the two of you for working together here.",
            "I'm so glad to read your update. It's great that you two are working on it. After all your proposal wasn't such a disaster. You might not be engaged but more importantly you are now openly communicating and you both are aware how much you love each other. Your relationship will be better off because of it.",

            "All I am seeing here is \"we both didn't communicate well, but the issue lies solely with you OP.\"\n\nYou both didn't say I love you, but it's your fault. \n\nYou both didn't talk about issues or have discussions / arguments...and that's your fault. \n\nYour GF doesn't bring anything up with you...and obviously, that is your fault.\n\nYou didn't read her mind about her past relationships and the \"i love you's\"...so obviously, again...your fault. \n\nThe only issue I see here is that you didn't discuss a proposal prior to the actual proposal. That is a huge \"no-no\" as proposing is a pretty huge deal in a persons life. \n\nOther than that, I would suggest looking at the advice with a grain of salt. \n\nYou are both to blame here, yet you are shouldering all the responsibility.

            "\"Nothing ever bothers me, I go with the flow really easily, I react minimally to unexpected situations.\"\n\nHonestly that is a really good trait and you shouldn't try to lose it.\n\nObviously you need to work on communication. But just because your SO is threatened by the fact that you don't freak out when bad things happen, don't get it into your head that that is a bad trait.

She just needs to nut up and have adult conversations when she feels they need to happen.  I agree you did other stuff wrong, but I hope you don't actually internalize the message that you are too \"chill\" because you don't fight or get upset that often.  You aren't a mind reader.  If she has a problem, she needs to tell you.\n\nYes, you need to communicate more often, but reacting minimally to unexpected situations is admirable.  ",

So I want to start off saying how much I appreciate all your feedback and support! I did read **every** comment in the thread! I really didn't expect my post to blow up the way it did but the support has helped me in many ways!\n\nI talked to my boyfriend last night after we had settled in, ate dinner, and relaxed. I asked if I could talk to him about something and just told him \"I really don't like it when you come up to me and say things about my body like 'hey babe you need to hit the gym, when are you going to do squats, etc'. It's not very nice and I don't say things like that to you.\"\n\nI could see the gears turning in his head and he really did seem surprised it bothered me so much. He apologized profusely and told me he didn't mean to hurt me. He told me he thinks I am beautiful and he loves everything about me. I told him I appreciated his apology and that pretty much summed up the conversation. He apologized again a little bit later so I think it was still on his mind.\n\nSo that was that. It truly was as simple as most of you told me it should be. However this has brought my relationship with my dad to my attention and made me realize why I put up with those comments from my boyfriend for so long. I really have been conditioned to brush those things off because of the reaction I expect when I say something about them. Habits die hard I guess!\n\nI put a lot of thought into how to handle the situation if my boyfriend did anything but apologize. I plan on using those ideas and what I have taken from my last thread to confront my dad. Next time he says something rude about me or one of my siblings I plan on asking him why he does it and telling him I don't like it. When he tells me it's a joke I will tell him it isn't funny. I will ask him if a joke is really worth damaging his relationship with his family. I have realized that I have to approach this situation differently than I have before and I hope in resonates with my dad.\n\nI do want to say my dad is not a bad person. He is definitely an asshole sometimes but he is a product of circumstance and there is a lot going on in our lives. This is no excuse for the mean things he says but I do want you all to know that he loves his family deeply and has sacrificed all of himself to keep our heads above water. I wouldn't trade him for the world!\n\nMy boyfriend is also not a bad person. He does stupid things and so do I but we do love each other. It's always easy to demonize someone by getting only one perspective and knowing nothing about the people involved. While it will never be okay to say things like that to someone, when his comments initially started I did not properly communicate with him about how it made me feel and by laughing it off I was condoning it. I know why now, but that also doesn't excuse my poor communication with my boyfriend. I will learn from this!\n\nI will add in that I of course expect him to follow through with this apology. Sorry only counts if your actions reflect it as well. I don't expect to encounter this problem again but I do know how I will handle it if I have to, thanks to you all!\n\nSo I do want to end with another thank you! Sometimes the psychology behind small problems can reveal large problems and it takes a lot of support to face those! All of you that take time to think critically about other's problems and type up advice are really doing something great!\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend apologized when confronted. I intend to also confront my dad in the future and have learned some lessons about communication!",

Her parents are horrible and practically kicked her out in the middle of the night. My son had to pull some strings to even get her a flight.\n\nFor her birthday, I bought her a necklace. It was before quarantine so I bought it overseas. It made me think of her. I care for her and I wanted too. It was pricy but I can afford it. I remember her face when I gave it to her. She looked terrified like I pulled a gun on her. She kept looking at it then at me. She stuttered so much before thanking me. Throughout our stay, I noticed her watching me several times. My son told me later that she is scared of me. After prying, I learned how bad her family actually is.\n\nFor my birthday, she got me an expensive necklace. I know the brand and there's no way she could afford it. She looked at me so scared and just asked if I liked it. I told her I did. She keeps watching me. \n\nNow, I worry about where she got the money. Her classes are all remote this semester. She can't decide whether she wants to be with my son or her family. She loves her younger siblings and has all but raised them. Then, her parents kick her out or threaten her.I worry so much about her at home. If she has money to take care of herself and her little siblings. I feel like she got me the necklace to pay me back but she did not need too. I feel so guilty \n\nWould I be a horrible person if I gave her a some money no questions asked? Or if I got her and her siblings expensive gifts she could sell or gift cards. I don't know if she would. She is not the type to ask for help. I remember my son on the phone for hours trying to find a hotel for her to stay at in the midst of quarantine after what her parents did. I want to make her a bank account or trust fund. I don't know how to do it. I also don't want to embarrass or cause her to fear me. My son says she looks up to me and wants to make me happy. I feel so guilty. I never should have gotten her that necklace when she has trouble feeding and clothing herself and the little ones.\n\ntldr I got my son's girlfriend an expensive necklace. She got me a similar one but I worry about how she can afford it and take of herself and little siblings",

            "I think you should talk to her, maybe even write to her.\n\nMy guess is that she doesn't know what to expect from you. So, in my family, there is no such thing as generosity. If a gift seems generous, then there are ALWAYS strings attached. She told your son that she's afraid because she doesn't know what you want from her in return. So she felt obligated to reciprocate the gift evenly because she doesn't have any experience with generosity.\n\nMy mother in law is a truly generous woman. And the first Christmas I did with her was incredibly confusing. She gave me SOOO many gifts. And of course I had brought her something, her son helped me pick it out. But it was one gift, and she'd bought me a house full. And because my family does gifting with strings, it was very uncomfortable.\n\nSo, my advice is to be very frank with her if you want to buy her any gifts or give her any money. Tell her the real reasons you want to do this for her and ask her if she's comfortable before you give her anything.\n\nEdited to add- Thank you for the silver kind friend",
            "I also came from an abusive home, and I have always had difficulty with receiving gifts, especially expensive ones. In my home growing up, gifts weren't given without strings attached. Any time I did something considered \"wrong,\" I was reminded of the gifts I'd received or things that were done for me in years past and called ungrateful, or worse. It's possible her situation is similar. My upbringing caused me to feel like I'm constantly on one side of a scale with each person and I always need to keep it level.\n\nWhen you've been raised that way, it can be hard to get out of that bubble and realize not everyone you meet has those expectations. I had the same issue when my in-laws started including me in holiday gift giving before I married my husband, or when they first asked to celebrate my birthday with me. My best advice would be to sit down with her and have a conversation. Maybe take her for coffee and spend some one-on-one time. When you feel comfortable, and when she seems more comfortable with you, explain that you gave her your gift to show that you care about her and that nothing was expected in return. If she seems receptive, then bring up that while you like and appreciate her gift, you don't want her to feel that she owed it to you. Go from there.\n\nIt took me a while before I was comfortable opening up completely around my in-laws. Now, I'm closer to them than most of my own family. Your care for her will do her lots of good.",
            "My mother in law noticed that I was kind of freaking out whenever she was really generous with me, and she gave me a nice little speech that made me feel better. She said something kind of like \"One of the nicest things about being my age is being able to spend more money on whatever you want. I like to be able to give you and my kids nice things, and I have no expectations that you get me anything. It's something I do for you because I love you.\" It was really sweet and helped calm me down a little.",
            "I'd first talk about this and your concerns with your son.  It sounds as if she may feel the need to keep \"even\" with you so giving her money and buying more gifts could cause more harm than good.  See if your son thinks sitting down with her to reassure her that your gifts are given without strings or any need to reciprocate equally is a good idea.  Some people respond to overt kindness while others are more comfortable when given space to approach on their own.",

            "Just talk to her. Open up to her a little bit about you and she will probably open up to. If someone is comfortable and knows you are a safe person they will lean on you no matter how independent they are...",
            "I want to add to the comments suggestion that you talk to your son about this before you do anything. He knows her best and should appreciate that you want to build an open, caring relationship with the woman he loves. He can hopefully help you navigate the best way to communicate to her that there are no hidden expectations when you give a gift and you hope she can receive them without feeling obligated to reciprocate. \n\nMy impression is that you already know this, but it's worth repeating. Definitely don't offer to return the gift or pay her back directly. Even if she gave it out of fear, she may be proud of the hard work and sacrifices that went into buying it. If you like it, wear it often. Instead of paying her back, maybe you and your son can come up with ways for you to help with her day to day expenses that won't make her feel burdened with reciprocal obligations. Giving her grocery or clothing store gift cards every few months would lighten her burden while still letting her control her own budget. When I was in college, a $100 Whole Foods gift card would substantially change the way I shopped and cooked for a solid two weeks. You could also mention to your son that you'd be happy to help with her medical expenses (physical or mental). There's no good way for an almost-mother-in-law to suggest that her son's partner might benefit from therapy, but you could offer a broader support in case she decides that she would benefit from talking to a therapist about her family situation.",
            "First let me say, you sound like a lovely person. \n\nMy sons have had a few girlfriends and wives that I have fallen absolutely in love with. I love doing things for them, but I try to make sure before holidays that I tell them I remember what it's like to be young and struggling to make ends meet and how bad and stressed it makes one feel at the holidays. \"This is why we have a no pressure to buy gifts rule. Holidays are for spending time with people we love and there are no expectations. I love you and I am happy that you show up. If I get you something,  it's because, well, I'm just a mom and it's what I do.\" When I do this, I can see them visibly relax. Like you, I just want them to know I love them and I don't want them to feel obligated to reciprocate.",
            "Others have left great advice, specifically on talking with your son and also really trying to talk to this gal.\n\nJust wanna step out here and let you know that it sounds like you\u2019re a great, caring person and you did well to solicit advices on this sub. I hope you follow through and it works out as best as it possibly could.",
            "I had an in-law aunt that used to give me a big check for my birthdays. I didn\u2019t ask for a cash gift. After a while I started buying her jewelry to assuage the guilt I felt for her spending money on me. I couldn\u2019t afford it, but I felt like I had to keep up with her so the rest of the family wouldn\u2019t be mad that I got money from her. It didn\u2019t feel like the healthiest of relationships, to tell you the truth. I now think I should have just never cashed the checks, but I did need the money at the time. I\u2019m about to be a mother-in-law myself, I hope, and I\u2019m worrying about the holidays with my daughter-in-law to be. The best advice I\u2019ve gotten is to treat her like a daughter. But to tell you the truth I have concerns about giving her what I give my own daughter. I tend to splurge on the holidays. Obviously we have a good life now. And I don\u2019t want her to feel obligated to my husband and I because we treated her well, or to feel like I\u2019m in a position of power or control and will use it later to use this power for bad. Lol. I just can\u2019t seem to win. So many things could go wrong by giving your son\u2019s girlfriend money. She already paid for an expensive gift she can\u2019t really afford. Compiling that with giving her more may tip the feeling of awkwardness in the wrong direction. I think we should both go slow.  I want to be a good, welcoming mother-in-law and to make our  budding relationship about building a family with love and respect. Good luck.",
            "I think something you should do is see if you son wants to talk to her about getting therapy and then you pay for it. She clearly has issues caused by her parents and I think having someone she can help talk through her issues with is the best thing you can offer. This needs to be something your son talks to her about because she might take it the wrong way if you bring it up. This might even help your relationship with her improve for the better. \n\nAs for the money, talk to your son about it. He knows more about her than you and if you try and give her money she might think you are angry at her. If she needed that money, you can always give your son the money to spend on her/help with her bills.",
            "You are a wonderful person and mother. How lucky your son and his girlfriend are to have such a caring person in their lives. I would start by talking to her, she may need your emotional support more than anything else.",
            "Have you spoken to your son about this? Talk to him and see what he thinks",
            "This literally made me cry. Made me remember my old mother in law in looked after when she was ill. My first boyfriend mum. Your lovely, and maybe just have a nice sit down with her and tell her you care about her alot and want to help her and her siblings.",
            "I think that in addition to explaining that your gifts have no strings attached, it might be a good idea to casually include how you calculate how much to spend on gifts and how you calculate how much you expect someone else to spend.\n\nLike, maybe you'd expect that someone who has less spare cash available to bake cookies or give a framed photo or maybe handcraft something small, then the next level up would be someone who has some spare cash but not a lot and that gives them an additional option of something in $XX price range, and then the next level would be someone who has a lot of disposable income available, and those people have the option to give gifts of any cost because they have the income to do it, but those gifts are not more appreciated than gifts that cost less.\n\nI wouldn't explicitly bring up the necklace because you might make her feel bad about it, but I think it's a good idea to reassure her that you love the cheaper gifts too and you understand that everyone gives things that are within their means and the important part is the thought behind it. Maybe even take a second to remember (out loud) a favourite inexpensive gift you have received in the past. She may have trouble believing you at first, but if you're consistent in your message and supportive and appreciative no matter how cheap the gift, she'll see that its true and she'll start to trust what you say.\n\nIf you want to help her out with groceries and finances and things, I think a good way might be to buy extra food \"by accident\" and then drop it off for her because \"I'll just have to throw it out otherwise\". Framing it like she's doing you a favour by taking the stuff will make it easier to accept. (Of course once you understand each other better you can just pay her directly, but if you're not at that point yet then this might be easier for her.)\n\nAlso - are you sure she didn't just trade in the necklace you got her for a different one to gift back to you? That's what I'd do if someone gave me something expensive and I thought I had to return a gift of similar value, but had no money.",
            "So my life is a combination of people just not doing nice things for me, and an abusive ex accusing me of being selfish all the time.  \n\nWhen I am given something nice my mind goes into overdrive, wondering why this person is doing a nice thing for me - and feeling incredibly selfish for accepting the gift. It's fucked up and I resent the people in my life who got me here.\n\nBased on my experience, and the experience of many others in the comments, I really feel for your son's girlfriend. I think you're very kind to be worrying about this and looking for a solution. Talk to your son. Try to work through this with him and eventually with her. It takes a lot to learn to trust again. Whatever happens in the future, please do not break her trust once you have it.",
            "Her heart is too sweet to sell anything you give her. She might also feel like she needs to pay you back for gifts to her siblings the same way that she felt compelled to get a necklace for you. Money is best.",
            "Coming from an abusive family, help and gifts always come with strings attached and ulterior motives.  I'm nearly 40, I've been estranged from my family for seven years, and I still struggle with asking for help.\n\nMaybe instead of directly giving her a gift, try taking her out for a coffee or lunch occasionally.  Let her get more comfortable with you.  You can offer assistance if/when she opens up about her situation.",
            "*Talk* to her about it ... directly, ... privately.  Mention your concern about the cost/value of the gift she got you and her (in)ability to afford it and impact to her finances and such.  Figure out where to go from there - who knows, maybe she got some great deal on it - maybe doesn't even know how much it's worth (and, is it's fair market / \"street\" value - including used, anywhere near the new MSRP price?  Often the actual \"value\" starts at about half of MSRP or less, and goes down from there).  Maybe it's a (high-ish?) \"quality\" fake/look-alike?  Who knows.  Maybe she'd be more than happy to accept financial assistance or gifts that would mostly go to/towards that ... or maybe she wouldn't want that or would be uncomfortable with that.  Generally won't know if you don't ask, so, ... discretely, privately, ask, have those conversations, ... figure it out from there.  And ... probably a lot less (potential) hazard/stress inducing, than trying to guess and trying to guess correctly, and without specifically knowing.",
            "It\u2019s obvious she got you the expensive necklace to reciprocate what you got her. But you didn\u2019t mess up either when you got her the necklace, she misinterpreted, and reacted the wrong way.  Maybe she isn\u2019t sure how gift exchanges should go between the two of you since her relationship with her fam is so bad, and thought it\u2019s suppose to be of equal/similar value? \n\nDefinitely bring it up because you are genuinely concern with her. You can start by inquiring through your son, and take it from there. If you are addressing her, don\u2019t forget to say how much you love and appreciate the gift from her, even something handmade from her or affordable you would feel the same because it\u2019s the thought that counts;  but am concerned about it\u2019s value at this point in time of their lives. That there will always be chances for pricy gifts later on in their future when they have graduated and making money. Remember to give  her a warm hug too, she needs all the parental love and welcome she can get",
            "You'd be an amazing person, and if she cannot stay at home, maybe open up your home to her? I've been kicked out before and when my girlfriends parents opened up their doors for me, I owe them a debt I can never truly repay.",
            "I think trying to help secretly only reinforces the idea that getting help is something shameful. \n\nSo I would just be straightforward with her. Talk to her about her situation and what is going on in her life. Get to know here better and when you see a need be honest that you want to help. It's going to be uncomfertable at first and she'll probably take some time and reassurance, but a compassionate attitude goes a long ways. \n\nWhen I have helped out people in my life I usually share the times I have needed help. Now I am paying back the people who helped me by helping someone else. They can pay me back by doing the same. When it's just everyone helping everyone no one has to feel ashamed because of what side they happen to be on at any given time.",
            "You would be a wonderful person if you gave her money with no questions asked.  But, she will not respond the way you expect.  \n\nShe is used to being mistreated and will think it comes with strings attached.  \n\nYou may want to tell her and your son that there is a price limit on what gifts they can give while they are in college.  Say 20 dollars.  (that's what I told my kids).  I don't have a limit because I have a full time job and a budget that I follow.\n\nShe may have purchased it second hand.  I know I do a lot of that.  Friends get name brand purses that are still brand new that I was able to purchase for less than 10% the new price.",
            "She most likely feels like she has to return the favour as her parents have never given her proper gifts or if they did, they brought it up to make her do something or to use it as a leverage. I'm not sure it is the right thing to do, but just ask how come she chose that necklace for you. Remember to tell her that you appreciate the gift and the gesture, but you are worried that she'll feel obliged to give you something back. I think being gentle but straight about it is better than throwing more money at the issue because I'm afraid it'll just continue.",
            "If she is uncomfortable with physical gifts, you could try non-physical, it won't solve her issue with gift giving but it might help you show that you do this simply because you love her. My mum offered to teach my friends and SOs skills she knew, like how to cook a lovely roast or how to crochet, which meant they got quality time and when my SO did that for her it was an extra special gift back! Other people have said to sit her down in a comfortable place and say that you have the means to do so and there is no expectation of returning. Maybe suggest handmade things are just lovely and you love handmade gifts (out of context, not in this conversation), and she may file that away and make something of love.",
            "Talk to your son and find out if she can afford it. Find out what he thinks is the best way to help her. He knows her best and he should take the lead in this. You\u2019re a good person to care about her so much.",
            "Many years ago, an aunt I barely know - and who was horrible and abusive to her own children - bought me a diamond and a custom-made prom dress. I was a teen from a not-so-rich background and was so flustered I had no idea what to do. It turns out she had other agendas, and expected me to behave in a certain way back to her in return for gifts.  \n\n\nSome cultures (and, I think, probably some dysfunctional families) are transactional life this. If she's never been treated with genuine kindness or generosity -- or if she comes from a background where a nice necklace is really shockingly luxurious -- she may think that some payback is required.\n\nI really liked the way your post was written. Why don't you just tell her what you wrote here? She didn't have to buy an expensive gift. Your gift -- one you could more easily afford -- was from the heart.\n\nThe problem with the gift cards -- no matter how generous -- is that it will just keep the cycle going. The more monetary presents you get her, the more she'll think she owes you something.",

If I didn\u2019t comply I was abused and treated like a criminal. She\u2019s prob never been given a gift without strings/consequences. You might want to just sit her down and let her know you\u2019ll never do that to her. Let her know this is a safe place. It\u2019s going to take a long time to get past this thought process. I\u2019m 10 years into therapy and I still catch myself thinking this way. I\u2019m just now starting to trust in SOME woman in my life. I would start with just talking to her more. \n\nHonestly the best thing I did was cut off my family. Eventually my brother did the same and we are so close and so much stronger. It hurt so bad leaving my brother to suffer all alone but it was the best thing for my mental health and safety. I wouldn\u2019t be here today if I didn\u2019t looking back.

            "First of all, don\u2019t doubt yourself for having gotten her a necklace. You did a nice thing. The issue is that your son\u2019s girlfriend comes from an abusive household, so doing nice things for other people, no strings attached, is a foreign concept to her.\n\nMy father is abusive and people constantly point out the nice things he buys for us. I like to say they\u2019re ornamental rugs for him to pull out from beneath our feet on a whim. They aren\u2019t nice, they\u2019re just expensive, and a method of control and a part of his mask to outsiders. He also buys people to bolster his reputation and buy their adoration. Then they\u2019re indebted to him and won\u2019t question him.\n\nI think giving her any money or anything of monetary value could be dangerous. I don\u2019t know her actual family dynamics, but it could make things worse or even make her family target you either as someone to use or tip them off that you care about their daughter so they\u2019ll isolate her from you so that you can\u2019t threaten their control.\n\nI think the best thing to do is to continue to be a good person and model that to her. Research abuse. Abuse hotlines have an option for people who know someone is being abused but aren\u2019t being abused themselves.\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how to handle the necklace, so I\u2019m just going to submit this for now. It\u2019s possible she\u2019s not financially literate (her family may have made her that way as a method of control) so maybe teaching her about money would be better than giving her money. Maybe act like you\u2019re setting something up at the bank for yourself or your son and ask if she\u2019d like to open a savings account with a credit union because you have a referral? Don\u2019t make it directly about her.",
            "I come from a family where gifts were always a form of manipulation. A nice gift meant I was going to have to do/put up with something horrible. Because of this I HATE gifts.

Say you want to take her and her siblings to do something fun? I know that may be hard during the current pandemic but maybe there\u2019s something simple they would like to do?\n\nI know personally the best birthday I had was when the guy I was dating at the time went hiking with me and we got Chinese food after. It could be as simple as that.",
            "Semi side note: gift givers of the world, please keep in mind that while it may feel great to give... and this is a good thing, the world needs more generosity... some of us are made uncomfortable by gifts, and receiving is unpleasant. Instead of just asking us to relax, consider toning it down.  To me an expensive necklace from my boyfriend's parent would have been over the top, no matter how beautiful the item is. It's just not an 'expensive gift' relationship. A nice token would be more comfortable.",

An example is how your son's gf is freaking out on having received your gift and now, somewhere and somehow, has felt the stress and need to give you back something similar.\n\nInstead, you can give them reasonable things that don't just make them think about how money solves the world's problems.  Even an experience that they will remember.\n\nFor example, instead of $100 gift card, take them to the arcade and blow $100 on bowling, arcade, etc , assuming that kind of activity is safe to do around your area.  Take pictures to show your love and friendship, and they will remember the time they went bowling with you and their sister more than whatever they end up spending $100.\n\nAnother idea along similar lines is, don't take them to eat at a fancy restaurant with steak and crab and say, \"buy whatever you want\". instead, take them to low-key local fast-food or small restaurant or even family-owned restaurant, and eat normal things together.",

Let her know that you do absolutely love the necklace, but that the reason you bought her the necklace you got her, was because you like her and it made you think of her. And that when you do things like that, you don't expect anything in return",
            "Think of her upbringing, we learn from our parents. The poor girl doesn't know how to react to normal things. \nI'd say take her our for coffee, or write to her, explain that you expect nothing from her, that you're in a position where you can and want to help. That some people are kind not expecting anything in return and that's ok.",
            "Go through your son. I had the same issue with my wife's family at first because my family has expectations of purchasing similarly priced gifts vrs her family just loves to give (and they have a lot more to give) It took me awhile to realize that A, there's no way I can keep up and B, they know I'm not in a position to give like they can and have no expectations I should. I remember having those conversations with my then girlfreind/now wife and she was the one to explain her family to me, not them. It takes time, but it's your son's job to work through these things with her not yours.",
            "While the spirit of some of these comments is very sweet, I would not advise directly funding her through gift cards, funding her therapy, et cetera. They are not engaged, only dating, and if their relationship turns sour for whatever reason then she will feel obligated to stay in the relationship and not do the healthy thing and leave. Even if it's just \"I'm not feeling this anymore,\" she won't feel like she's able to leave the relationship since she'd be so indebted to you.\n\nIf you want to help her out, I would phrase it carefully as though it is just coincidental. \"My neighbors gave me all these childrens' clothes to donate to my church, do you want to look through them and see if there's anything here you like?\" \"I won this grocery store gift card in a work raffle but I don't like to shop there as much, do you want it?\" This will also probably help her feel better about accepting it and not as \"on the hook\" for repayment.",
            "My heart goes out to you and her. She probably felt like she needed to repay you for your gift and thus she gifted you the expensive neckless.  \n\n\nI wouldn't say that you would be a horrible person if you gave her money no questions asked. In fact, quite the opposite actually. If I were you, I would try to have a conversation with her about her financial issues and see from there.",
            "You can give your some money and throw some her way in smaller increments.  My wife's mother used to do this for me when I visited knowing I came from a less than fortunate background.  I thought it was because she considered me one of her own and it was true.",
            "I buy things for people all the time. I love making people happy. I even gave a friend an old transmission/transfer case that he could sell, when it came with an engine I bought. Just dropped it off one day and said, \u201chere. You know more people who would want this than I do. I know times are tough for you. Sell it and make yourself a little money.\u201d\n\nI always make sure when I randomly give a gift, if someone says something or acts nervous, to say, \u201cHey. You\u2019re my friend. This is part of the way I show I\u2019m thankful for you. I don\u2019t need or want anything in return, other than your friendship and honesty.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re really really concerned, you could send her a card with cash from \n\u201cA concerned friend.\n1234 Friendship road,\nSomewheresville, your state, a zip code from nearby.\u201d Then drop it in a post office mailbox in that zip code so she can\u2019t trace it back to you. \u201cThe best acts of kindness are the ones no one can trace back to you\u201d or something like that..",
            "If you love the gift, tell her that! She would appreciate you actually liking it instead of some repayment transaction. If you would like to give her something in return \"just because\", may I suggest a gift card to a grocery store, gas station, or any place that is practical but not \"gifty\"? I know I was always pinching pennies when it came to these things in college. It must be extra difficult for her to take care of siblings as well.",
            "What about talking to your son, which happens to be the boyfriend and help her financially (apparently you can afford it) through him.",
            "A low key way to give her a gift card would be to just say you found it and you think it\u2019s still got a fair amount left on it but you just figured you\u2019d give it away rather than use it yourself.",
            "I would thank her for the kind gesture, say \u2018it\u2019s beautiful and I love it but save your money\u2019, and return the necklace to her.",
            "I don't have any advice to offer because I have no experience of this kind of situation but I just wanted to tell you that you seem like a lovely person.",
            "You sound really nice. I think you should write her a letter. I have a nervous nature and people being direct with expectations and motives and everything is really helpful, but I freeze in conversations or get nervous so I can't remember afterwards. Writing a letter means that there can't be any doubt about your thoughts and feeling towards her or expectations of her, and she can think about it a bit, you could end the letter with an invitation to talk about it with her and then she can approach it when she's ready. Put all the care and love and explanations into it like you did here.\n\n  Also, about the gift, don't give it back. Wear it. And then maybe start a conversation somehow about how the important part about gifts is the thought put into it. How you bought the necklace for her because you thought of her when you saw it, because of how she likes x or does y, make it a casual story focusing on the motivation for choosing it - that it made you think of her when you saw it because x and y, and you thought she would like it and you really enjoy giving gifts to the people you really care about. Also talk about how you love the one she got you, but again focused on how it means so much to you that she thought of you and and how you like it because of x or y (like, \"I love the blue stone in it, you know I love blue and this is just the perfect color\", not \"i love this ((really expensive brand))\" but \"you didn't have to get me anything but I really love how you noticed that I love blue and got a blue stone\" etc). Focus on the important part being that someone thought of you and got something specifically for you because they know what you like. Shifting it from being equal in money to being equal in thoughtfulness might be a way to let her spend less but still do equal things for you. The currency can be changed to effort and care instead of monetary value.",
            "Once in a while, when I know someone is struggling, and I have the ability to help, I will send them something anonymously. Mail some gift cards with their address also as the return address, or something equally secretive, with a note that says \"just because you're awesome\" or something.",
            "Aw, you sound like a really nice person.  I think your sons gf would be lucky to have you in her life.  It sounds like she needs some guidance and just general living and caring people around her.",
            "I dunno, but if you're just giving money to people who need it.... I would be more than happy to help you out",
            "This is such an awful situation and I'm really glad your son's GF has both you and him in her life. You're a good, caring person.\n\nIf you think you can talk to her and get her to open up, that might be the fastest path to getting her to let you help. Make it clear that there are no strings attached and you just care about her. However - if you think she might be too shy or too proud or too afraid to tell you the truth, you might consider doing it through your son. Give him money or gift cards and see if he can help her in subtle ways - give her gift cards for any conceivable occasion, her sibling's birthdays, etc. Maybe he can buy groceries for her, invite her to stay with him, and so on.",
            "I couldn't give better advice than what other already gave you, so this is all I'll say:\n\nIf I needed money, but couldn't possibly just ask for it or accept it as is, I'd be glad to get it for work. Babysitting, tutoring, walking the dog, doing some cleaning, cooking, anything to justify getting the money.",
            "When I was a teenager my mum was constantly emotionally abusive, throwing me out in the middle of the night, arguing, upset.. emotional turmoil. My point is, if my boyfriend's mother noticed this and talked to me, it could have made me realise that it's not \"normal\" just because I was used to it. It's not right for her to be scared of you. An honest conversation and a motherly hug can go a long way if she's comfortable. \n\nBuying expensive gifts if you don't know the entire situation could be dangerous. I'm not giving examples because none are given, but please don't give expensive items to younger children, that can potentially be claimed as leverage by an unstable parent. Or sold and misused. But please talk to her, on her own. Say you care for her and will help with whatever she needs, but don't push for information she doesn't want to give. It's a wound, and healing takes time.",
            "You sound like an amazing person and a wonderful mother. I come from an emotionally abusive background and can agree, the best thing to do is to talk to her openly. I've just begun to feel safe with my partners parents after 3 years of living in the same space with them, even though they are lovely people. It will take time, but it sounds like all you want to do is help and she will come to understand this. Again, you sound like such a sweet and caring woman, trauma is a real difficult thing to overcome don't beat yourself up too bad if you misstep while trying to help her.",
            "I\u2019m just wanted to say that you\u2019re an awesome mom. You read the room and noticed something wasn\u2019t quite right. This just further demonstrates that you\u2019re totally doing this out of love and concern for her, and not because you want to make yourself feel good. Just by having you in her life, she\u2019s going to learn more about what real love looks like.",
            "In my experience she is probably trying to reciprocate gift giving in a way that show you that she appreciats you as much as you showed that you appreciate you, and in her mind that meant equally expensive.\n\n-Talk to her, and let her know that while you really do like the gift that you would prefer that if she does have spare funds, she puts it towards supporting herself. Stress that you understand how it can be a struggle to cover all your costs when you are young.\n-If you can figure out a way, suggest that you feel guilty that financially it may have been too much for her current situation, but seeing as though you like the gift you would like to go halves in the cost of the necklace. This way she can still see you appreciating the gift she gave you. \n-Find a subtle way to let her know other less expensive thing that you appreciate, so in the future if she wants to get you a gift, she has an idea where to start.\n-Separately let you son know and why. He can help guide her.\n\nFor me money was always tight growing up, and I have always struggle with accepting gifts of value. Even simple things like if my in-laws pay for accommodation on a trip or something. I just want to pay my own way, even if it ends up costing me more than what I would have chosen. It just hasn't improved with time (15 years).",
            "Start showing her kindness and affection in a way that isn't gifts or money. Ask how she's going. If she describes issues or problems, don't jump in with solutions. Just...listen. Empathize. If she talks about things she enjoys, take note. And if you do want to buy presents, maybe buy ones for both your son and his girlfriend - there's plausible deniability that it's really for your son (ie, in the event of a break up, he'll keep them), but she'll get the benefit of the objects when she's with him. \n\nThese kinds of relationships need to be built up over time. It took a few years before I had a relationship with my future mother-in-law that wasn't through my fiance, but now she and I will talk (making plans for visits or family events, exchanging recipes) in ways that don't include my fiance at all. But it did take a few years, and there were often times their gifts/generosity spooked me rather than comforted me. \n\nLove and treasure the necklace she gave you. Wear it for her and tell her how much happiness it brings you. Then build a relationship through connections, not gifts.",
            "practically it behavior is a ritual hereditary from her family isn't how expensive is the fact is that she felt appreciated by someone and she doesn't know how act, if you really want to help i think talking to her openly and show her affection will erased bad memories and print new good behavior.",
            "Maybe, and hear me out, you could ask her to help with some household tasks, use that time to chat, and then give her gift cards as a thank you?   I am a person constantly seeking approval from others, worry if I hear any sign of even mild discord and I know if I was asked to help out, it would help me feel as if I were contributing and is also an easier way to get to know someone on a really non-threatening level. Bless her... She sounds so sweet and obviously wants nothing more than approval. You sound so lovely, and it's really great that you're not forcing anything on her. X",
            "Your a kind and thoughtful human being. Thank you.",
            "Thank you so much! I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. That must be very hard for you. Big hugs.",
            "make her do things to give her money\nlike sexual favors \nno, like gig works, make her thinks what she does worth the effort so shed accept it\n\ntalk to your son, and talk to her",
            "Why don\u2019t you just talk to her about your concerns? Family life? Ask what she wants. All the concerns and info youre posting here needs to be communicated to her and your son. Just talk to her...christ dude",
            "I logged in to tell you, you seem so loving and caring and if she isn't used to kind, loving - yet powerful women. I can see how she'd be intimidated. maybe suggest a virtual shopping trip with some wine (dont know if shes legal yet where you are) and pick those gifts for her siblings and maybe broach the subject of the necklace then and tell her what you told us about why you got her HER necklace and reiterate you would never expect her to match your gift budgets as you're in totally different financial situations. they seem very lucky to have you! I got a little tear in my eye and I could feel how much you care about her and want her to he safe and secure <3"

I just wanted to give an update to those that may have read my post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ukz4w/me_24f_with_my_boyfriend_25m_he_puts_himself_in/\n\n\nI learned a lot through your responses. I decided that I would fully accept my boyfriend for who he is, and that I can't change him. \n\n\nThings since then have been great. We had a talk where I told him that I love and fully accept him no matter what. I made it clear that it's not my place to try and change him and that I would support him. He decided to seek out help on his own accord. I found out later that he was concerned as to why he was feeling the way he was. He ended up being diagnosed with depression and anxiety and his current treatment plan is going really well. He stopped smoking and made lifestyle changes too, in order to live as healthy as he can. He still seeks out experiences that give him an adrenaline rush which I am happy about because it makes him happy. We've started doing adrenaline junkie activities together and fully understand the risks. We recently celebrated our anniversary by conquering some class 5 rapids while whitewater rafting a few weeks ago and it was so exciting! \n\n\nI have also taken steps to deal with my anxiety. Therapy is helping me a lot. Things are going a lot better for me too. Any disagreements we've had over anything have been minor and are always resolved on the spot. Thank you /r/relationships for helping me see a different perspective and for overall just being awesome!\n\n**TL;DR: I let my boyfriend know that I love and accept him for who he is. He made some changes on his own. Things are going great now.**\n",

We were less than half a meter from the edge of the cliff dropoff when the plane came to a halt.\n\nWhen we got to the hotel bar, the bartender looked at us and said, \"Why didn't you use the other runway?\" None of us had seen it, that's why!\n\nI don't remember taking off from the other runway, but the landing was spectacularly memorable, and quite fondly.

I was in my room and I heard my sister scream, it came from the bathroom.  She was freaking out, saying he was hitting on her and touching her/trying to touch her and she had told him to stop and he wouldn't back off, so she screamed at the top of her lungs for me to come.  He was denying everything, saying she was making it all up, saying she was overreacting.  I told him he had to leave the house immediately or I was calling the police, he wouldn't, and I basically pushed him out while my sister called our dad.  When he heard her calling our dad, he finally left the house, still insisting we were the crazy ones and he had done nothing.  I reassured my sister, she was in a very shocked state, my dad came over and we comforted her and helped her feel better.  He called mum and she came back and we all explained the situation to her.\n\nThat was the last time we ever saw mum's creepy boyfriend, he broke up with her shortly afterwards. I don't know why, but I guess after that situation, he didn't want to come back ever and had no interest in our mum.  I'm really scared that he was maybe just pursuing our mother to get close to sis the entire time and had no real intentions for our mother.  My sister was kind of traumatised by the whole ordeal, and I convinced our dad to sleep with us for a few nights at our place just to be safe and so my sister could feel safe.\n\nNaturally mum was upset by how everything turned, but we convinced her it was for the better that he was gone, and we finally got her to accept and admit he was a creep all along and should never have been allowed in our house.\n\nUnfortunately, family problems didn't end there.  My sister was way on edge for the next week, way more cranky and irritable than usual, I didn't blame her.  She still wanted to move out, she said she hated living at home after everything that happened, she didn't feel safe.  I told her the dude wasn't coming back, but she still wanted me to move out with her.  She said stuff like \"you don't really love me, I knew it, I don't love you either\", stuff like that which was clearly attempting to guilt me and which I felt was extremely childish and immature.\n\nUnfortunately our mum wasn't too helpful either.  A couple of weeks later, she was already dating a completely new boyfriend.  We didn't see much of this one, but from what I did see here and there, he seems nice enough and not too creepy.  Unfortunately mum started acting the same way again, telling my sister her clothing is too revealing, telling her to wear a bra, telling her to cover up in her own home, even when it was just the three of us around.\n\nI agreed to move out with my sister, and I talked the whole situation over with both our parents and told them of our plan.  My sister and I would borrow some money from mum and some from dad, both of which we intended to pay back in full as soon as we could.  We stayed a couple of days at dad's place, and from there we moved out into our own small place.  Its small sure, but pretty good considering its within our affordability range.  Things are going good so far, and we're moving forward.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Creep tried to make his move on my sister, she screamed.  He ended up breaking up with our mum.  Our mum found a new boyfriend and she started acting the same way towards my sister, and the two of us have now moved out and are living elsewhere.",

She said stuff like \"you don't really love me, I knew it, I don't love you either\", stuff like that which was clearly attempting to guilt me and which I felt was extremely childish and immature.\n\nThese are all totally normal reactions to being sexually assaulted. She will do and say whatever she has to in order to get out of the dangerous situation that got her assaulted. You call her childish, but it worked. Everyone finally took her seriously enough to get her out of the situation. Since no one took the necessary steps to make sure she didn't get sexually assaulted, she had to behave in ways she is not proud of in order to take care of herself. That would make anyone cranky.\n\nIt's great that you stopped things from going further, and that you are moving out with her. I don't mean to detract from that. I just want you to be prepared for the full emotional fallout for the trauma she experienced. She would greatly benefit from some quality counseling. She will continue to exhibit behaviors that may seem childish or irrational. It may take a lot of patience, and she probably has some buried resentment that may feel unfair to you.",

You're a good person and I hope your sister is happier now.   \n  \nYour mother sounds like she'll end up very unhappy in the long run if she keeps taking her own insecurities out on the people closest to her. Good luck with everything, both of you!",
            "Your mother is desperate and pitiful. You did the right thing moving out.",
            "It's really sad that something serious had to happen before anyone took this seriously. Even then your mom still doesn't realize the trauma she's given her daughter both through the assault and breach of trust. Now your sister probably won't be able to trust any potential future partners or anyone else really ",

            "Man, I feel bad for your sister, she got the worst of it all. And now she doesn't even feel in her own parent's house; mom is over controlling and incompetent and dad is a bit selfish and perhaps a bit self-centered or narcissistic to even want to take care of his own kids for a longer period of time (Sorry if that sounds harsh, but that's how I'm seeing him from what you at saying. He sounds nice to help out as far as he has, but he hasn't helped as much as a father should, in my opinion.)\n\nI hope things work out for the both of you. I'm curious how you guys found an apartment so quickly and seemingly affordable, but you guys probably don't live in the U.S. Look out for one another, because it doesn't seem like there aren't many people looking out for the both of you. Update us sometime in the future if you can though.",
            "Ding dong the creep is gone!\n\nI'm sorry to hear your mom is continuing to act as though her daughter is a romantic rival. Ick. You may find this sub helpful r/raisedbynarcissists",
            "depressing part of single parents, they're a common target for abusers to get their kids through dating or helping out. Awful her knee jerk is to get jealous or not watch out for signs. Glad your sister is safe. ",
            "Please file a police report against him. It will help next time he dies something",
            "OP, I hope you make a police report. Not to press charges, necessarily, but to have a paper trail and history when the creep eventually hurts someone else.",
            "Your mother lacks all protective capacity for her children. The fact you both made it to adulthood is astonishing.",
            "Your mom needs to grow the hell up, seriously. You are a grown ass woman, if your man is preying on your daughter you need to step the fuck up and talk to him about it and/or dump him, not get pissy at her. ",
            "You know why she said you didn't love her? Because of what you said when she asked you to move out with her before he could hurt her *\"nah, I'm not too interested in that. I kinda like living at home with mum, its comfy as hell and I have someone to look after me.\"*\n\nThen a few weeks later, she fucking got sexually assaulted because not one person  in her family took preventative measures to protect her. You are very lucky she's even speaking to you.",
            "Sounds like you made the right call, OP. I hope your mother gets her shit together someday. For now, enjoy your freedom.",
            "Get your sister into counseling.  It was a traumatic experience for her, and she needs to learn how to process her feelings.  Manipulating you with stuff like \"you don't love me\" isn't a healthy way for her to be conducting her relationships.",
            "Went through similar situations with my mom growing up and even now. Always getting jealous over me getting attention that I didn't ask for from my stepdad. Always making me cover up and wear a bra in the privacy of my home. My current situation is somewhat similar to yours (she is 40 her new boyfriend about 9 years her junior) nothings happened so far but I get strange vibes from him. When your on the other side of the looking glass its so easy to tell if someone really loves your mother, and he definitely doesnt. He uses her for food and shelter. And to invite his friends over to ogle anyone in the house who isnt my mother. Hoping for the best for you guys, it sucks when either parent cares more about love/sex than their own kids and puts them in uncomfortable situations >_<",
            "Just want to say good on you for all you've done to resolve this situation, and to give your sister a safe place to live. You're a really good brother. ",
            "You're mother's a horrible person. Please don't let your sisters weird, cranky moods push you away from her. I hope you can see past it for what she's going through.",
            "OP u need to show your mom both threads you made.. she needs to know how bad she fucked up and continues to fuck up... she wont listen to u \"kids\" but she might listen to internet adults (crazy i know, but true)",
            "It's healthy to move out of your parents around your ages, it's good you went with you sister as well. I really wish your mom wasn't like that, making your sister her competition is really creepy and immature. Glad things turned out well enough, thanks for doing an update.",
            "Sounds like you did the right thing in my opinion. That's really cool of you to move out with your sister and support her through a tough time, and your relationship with her will only get stronger. As for your mother, it sounds like she has some problems with trust and jealousy, and I don't see it changing any time soon unless she gets some professional help. It *sounds* like your mum is afraid to end up alone, and she'll attack anything that looks like it could threaten her relationship, which is obviously completely irrational.  \n\nYou should be proud of yourself, you seem like a very mature young woman, and it can only get better from here. ",
            "You guys should go no contact with your mother.",
            "Exactly what u/alonelyturd predicted turned out to have happened. Well what a surprise. ",
            "Hopefully your mom makes better choices next time.",
            "Internet stranger hugs. I've been here, my mom is still married to the creep, they are both broke asses, I don't hear from her unless she is angling for a, \"loan\", what she means as free money. It took me 25 yrs to realize cutting this type of person, regardless if they dropped you out of their womb, is okay. ",
            "I'm glad you guys got out of there. Must have been awful. ",
            "SO HAPPY THAT SHE HAS A BROTHER LIKE YOU! \nGood luck with everything and it seems like you guys are really close and will have each others backs no matter what! ",
            "All the bases have seemed to be covered, so a word for you. I don't know how to say this but don't let her guilt you into taking care of her forever. Get her some protection (pepper spray or taser?). She's probably safe now, and she's a grown woman and will need to take care of herself eventually.",
            "Sibling powers activate!\n\nGood job on everything, well done on your part.",
            "Your decision to live separately is probably the right one. It will allow you to avoid any accidents like this in future. Moreover, it will give you a good chance to become more independent and to have more interesting life. \nYou should also point to your mom that her actions are insulting. And to clear out her motives of behaving like that. \nIt's very important to support your sister now and you are doing right being near!\nWe hope that you will never face the situation again and we wish you to get rid of this insulting memories soon! ",
            "I'm so glad you moved in with your sister!!! I know you think it's childish that she said you didn't live her, but having been in her position once I still can't tell you how lonely life is when you're a target of a sexual predator. \nI hope you can fully appreciate how much you being there for her means. \n",
            "Be very careful about maintaining boundaries with your sister. I was concerned with her manipulation in your first post and I'm still concerned here. Stand up for yourself. It is fine to say \"no\" to family.\n\nETA: I understand she's going through an emotional time, but that does not mean that you should allow her to manipulate you or guilt you. That's a pattern of behavior that is not healthy for you or for her.",
            "I'm sorry you and your sister had to go through that but I'm glad things worked out somewhat ok in the end. I think your mom needs therapy because she obviously has some pretty serious self esteem issues. \n\nGood luck to you and your sister. ",

            "At first I thought your mom was a 18 year old male. ",
            "I'm not suggesting she was, but even if your sister was making it up to get the guy out of the house, a parent's first and foremost responsibility is to their child. If mum isn't making great choices in dealing with any given situation let alone one that can be dangerous to her kids, then no wonder sis wants out.",
