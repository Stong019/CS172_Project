        "selftext": "I've had my cat since he was 6 months old. He was an \"unadoptable\" rescue. He had so called unsurviveable pneumonia, and when healthy, was nothing but fear aggression. I was basically cat hospice. \n\nWell, he lived. And he loved. He's the purring-est, snuggliest, sweetest cat. He is now a chubby 16 year old with arthritis (treated with Dasuquin, which has helped immensely, but he's not a kitten anymore).\n\nWe used to live in a first floor apartment where we could sit outside and I could read and he could be on his tie out and watch birds. Now we don't anymore.\n\nShortly before his 16th birthday, he slipped and/or fell off the bathroom vanity. I didn't see it happen, I only saw the cat who couldn't stand without screaming afterwards. We rushed him to the vet and miraculously nothing was broken, but that left the question of what he DID do. Even in a bad sprain, it may always be weak and he may never walk normally again, or walk at all. If he tore a tendon or ligament, it was basically over. Orthopedic surgeries and senior cats don't usually end well. \n\nFor a week and a half, we brought him food and water. We gave him his pain meds. We set him in the litter and held him up. We lifted him onto and off of the bed. It was basically a cat nursing home up in here. \n\nJust when we thought he would never get up again, he did exactly that. Then he walked a few steps. Then it was cat PT. Making him go a little further every day. Getting his strength back up.\n\nA month later, aside from sitting over on one hip when he sits, you would never know he had ever been hurt.\n\nFor his 16th, I loaded him into the car (which he doesn't mind at all) and took him to a park by the lake. He spent a couple hours watching ducks and warming his old bones in the sun. \n\nMy boyfriend was indignant. How the cat doesn't even know it's his birthday, what a waste of time, who does that, etc etc. \n\nNo, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys. He knows he feels better than he had been. He knows those things. \n\nNow it's 3 months later and my BF is STILL on about cat birthday outings. Idgi. He helped care for him when,he was injured and did probably more than I did, because I work 10 hour shifts. So I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is? I mean, there's whole parks devoted to dogs where dogs can see their dog friends. So what's weird about taking a cat out for one afternoon? He's really starting to make me feel like shit about it.\n\ntl;dr Senior cat was seriously injured. He recovered, and I took him to the park to celebrate his 16th bday. BF is acting like I murdered his family over it. Am I crazy?",

            "My dog recently collapsed while we were on a walk.  The vet treated her but told us she could live for a while...or not. She was thirteen years old. I had to give her pills four times per day. During the three weeks that she had left, we went for walks, she snuggled with us on the couch and we tried to make it special for all of us, a time filled with her and our favorite things. Then the pills stopped working and she died. \n\nI am so glad that I did the silly things and the happy things and the just sitting around things with her. I am so glad that she didn't die when she first collapsed. We had time to adjust, time to remember how much she meant to us rather than take her for granted. \n\nI don't know what is going on with your boyfriend but taking your elderly cat to the park was for you as much as it was for the cat. It doesn't sound crazy to me, it sounds like appreciating a life that has profoundly touched yours over the years.",
            "> No, he doesn't know it's his birthday. But he knows he's doing something he enjoys\n\nExactly. It's like giving a pet a food treat. They don't realize the occasion, but it's still pleasant for them. And looking at a park is a better view than being stuck in between 4 walls.\n\nYour boyfriend is making a really big deal out of nothing. It was a few hours of your time. No big deal.",
            "I gave my cat breakfast in bed (yes, MY bed) for her first birthday and I filmed it. My SO and I regularly drop her off at 'pre-school' on the weekends (there are no kids at the pre-school park on the weekends). We have a reel of original songs we sing for her. He takes her on walks sitting on his shoulders. Over the last two years we have taken her on most of our holidays. In terms of crazy cat lady, you have a lot to catch up on. ",
            "[removed]",
            "Your BF is being dramatic about this. Your furball was on a lead and being supervised; no immediate danger.  As long as all his shots are up to date and you have him on a flea/tick treatment, nothing is wrong. \nI work for an animal rescue; you are fine and he needs to lighten up. I understand his concern, he obviously loves your furball, but he needs to relax, because this is probably causing unnecessary strain on your relationship. Have him talk to your vet, if necessary.\n\n**You were giving your kitty a better quality of life, that doesn't make you crazy. He needs to chill. ",
            "> I guess staying home to care for an injured cat isn't crazy cat person, but taking the cat to a park is?\n\nIt's politically difficult to complain about the former, so he complains about the latter.",
            "First of all... I love you. I absolutely would have come up to you/your sweet cat at the park and taken pictures/given you a hug.\n\n\nThis is adorable. You did this for your baby! Who gives a FUUUUCKKKK about being a cat lady, you treat animals with the top shelf level of care. You're a GOOD person!\n\n\nIf my boyfriend ever wanted to harp over something like this instead of being stoked about taking him out I would find it unattractive. I get shit for being a \"cat lady\" but my best friends know I love the fur babies and respect it. Don't question yourself over this, you did an adorable thing.",
            "I think your boyfriend may be feeling some resentment over the time, anxiety, and money spent by both of you over your elderly cat, and it's only bubbling over now.  A straw that broke the camels back, if you will.  I think what you did with the park was sweet and funny, but it's possible he is feeling more frustrated with the cat and it's problems and it's attendant impact on your own behavior, than he is being up front about.  Forget the park thing, sit the bf down, and try to get to the bottom of his feelings.  This is a communication problem you have as a couple, not a spat over a particular day at the park.",
            "Ok, let's take the cat himself out of the picture. It made YOU feel good to go to the park with your cat, right? It made you happy to think you were helping him feel young and healthy. And your boyfriend is making you feel bad about that. \n\nYour cat sounds very brave and inspiring and I would like to give him a boop on the nose and let him know how strong he is. ",
            "Three months ago and he still complains? I would ask him exactly what his point is and how long I'm expected to listen to this.",
            "I buy my cat an expensive filet of salmon and cook it fornher every year for her birthday. If she wouldn't be traumatized by an outing she'd get one. Your bf needs to get over himself.",
            "No, you aren't crazy. That sounds really sweet.\nHow weird is it, that the idea of taking your pet to a park is somehow strange to some people. Why not? ",
            "I actually had a birthday party for my cat.  I bought some pizza and cake and invited family over. I dressed her up in an adorable dress and everything!   \n\nIf my boyfriend ever judges me for that, he can go take a hike because he's known I've been a cat lady for as long as I can remember.",
            "I had to put my sweet, 17-year-old kitty to sleep this week, and I wish I had one more day to do everything she loved and bring her happiness. Tell your BF to pound sand. ",
            "A crazy cat lady is not someone who takes their cat out once a year, and helps them with an injury. I mean, you've had him for 16 years. That's something anyone would do.\n\nNow if you were knitting your cats sweaters and being antisocial because you have to get home to your cats, I'd say yeah, there's a problem. But I agree with the poster who said that this is less about your boyfriend thinking you are a crazy cat lady and more of the resentment he feels towards all the energy/time you're devoting to him. That said, you likely don't have much time left with your cat. Cherish the time you do have.",
            "You're the sweetest cat mom ever, and you didn't do anything weird. I fostered kittens and lived in an apartment and I used to take them to a quiet little park down the street when I could. I'd load them into a picnic basket, carry them down, then watch them frolic and chase bugs and pounce in the grass for a few hours while I read a book and supervised. A great time was had by all. If that's wrong, I don't want to be right.\n\nI also used to make them special little treats and throw a little kitten graduation party when they hit a weight of 900g, since thats when they were big enough to go to their forever home. Fuck anyone who thinks its weird, cat life is best life. ",
            "My cat's birthday is in April and I had a party for her. Got her new toys and gave her wet food for her special day. My partner even chipped in and he got her some new toys as well. I made sure to open the window so the ground was extra warm for her nap and I \n took photos. Did my cat comprehend it? No. But like you said, she knew she was getting things she enjoyed! And on top of that, it made me happy to see this creature I've cared for have a comfortable and good time. \n\nPets are little family members and they are important. You and this cat have an intensive history and your bond is deep with him! Honestly, your kitty is lucky to have such a dedicated and loving cat mom. The park date sounds really lovely and it wasn't just good for him, but you as well. You are more mentally at ease knowing he still has pleasures in his life. That little kitty cat will always be your baby, as silly as that may sound. People form very intense bonds with their pets, and to talk it down like that is just rude in my opinion. \n\nIf he tries to bring it up again in a  huff, cut it off. Say something like \"what is it that bothers you so much about me taking him to the park? You seem rather stuck on the subject.\" And if he just spews off the same nonsense as before, tell him to seriously cut it out because it benefits no one. Not everything has to \"make sense.\" That's not why people always do things that make them happy. Maybe there's some underlying issue but honestly if that's the case it's on him to communicate, not on you to be essentially berated for wanting your senior cat to have a nice day. ",
            "I haven't had a birthday party in almost 15 years where I invited anybody.  My dog turned 3 and I threw a birthday party for him that cost me north of a thousand dollars inviting all of his park friends and other dogs.  He had a grand old time....  Cherish the time you have with your pets and love them completely.. its so fleeting.",
            "My Alzheimic grandmother probably had less understanding of what was going on than your cat, in the end stages anyway, but family still took her out to the park and to lunch. Quality of life matters even when we aren't sure what level of consciousness is there, whether it's appreciated or not. \n\nDoes he feel neglected and this is just making him resent the cat getting attention he feels he misses out on?",
            "So what that it was even your cat's birthday?  You did something that made him happy and it didn't even cost you anything.  What's the purpose of even having a cat or a dog if not to bond with it and make it happy?  I think you should start doing this for your cat with some regularity just because it's a nice thing to do that your cat enjoys, he no longer has access to the outdoors and you two don't have a lot of time left together, might as well do nice things.\n\nIf you start doing that, you are 1) establishing that you are hardly sorry about it, as you have absolutely no reason to be and 2) might possibly get your bf to stop harping on the fact that the cat didn't know it was his birthday.  If he then starts harping on the fact that you do this at all... he's your pet, you're supposed to spend time with it, what Bluetootsmagoo said - would he have any issues if your pet were a dog he took to the park?  What difference would that make?\n\nIf BF is actually angry about something else and not being direct, he needs to Use His Words and actually get to the point.",
            "Story time: My family was adopted by a cat last year. He was abandoned once he got past the cute kitten stage. He came trotting up to me out of nowhere one day, and from that time on he simply decided we were his new home. Two days before we were going to take him to the vet to be checked out prior to bringing him indoors, he impaled his left front paw on some kind of sharp spike. By pure luck, my son and spouse happened to be outside at the time. We ended up racing him to the vet for emergency surgery (on a weekend, so $$$$). The vet said he would have died if we hadn't found him and gotten him medical care so soon after he hurt himself.\n\nThe day we brought him home after all of that is his birthday. And you're goddamned right we will be celebrating it. It doesn't matter if our cat knows it's his birthday. It matters that our cat is part of our family. He loves us and is loved by us. We want to do something nice for him and he will enjoy his treat.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with that, just as there is nothing wrong with the kind treat you gave your cat. I'm guessing your SO is reacting badly because of the extra care your cat needed and the prospect of more care and expense in the relatively near future because of your cat's age. To me it sounds like it's time to have a serious discussion with your SO about what's really going on and the impact of his belittling comments (e.g., \"Who does that?\") on you. If he won't discuss it or is dismissive of your concerns, then there are larger issues going on in your relationship. ",

            "He's mad because you spent what, two hours at the park with your cat? Was he affected by this in any way at all? Maybe it is a little nutty, but so the fuck what? It made you happy and it made your cat happy, and your cat may not have too many more birthdays. Is BF jealous because he gets less attention than the cat?",
            "Next time he starts about it shut him down. I suggest something like this:\n\"Dear boyfriend, I'm not really interested in hearing you complain about the way I celebrated my cat's birthday any longer. This was three months ago, my cat and I enjoyed it but I consider it to be in the past. If for some reason you have an issue with it or if I offended you in some way by taking my cat out for it's birthday, please let me know so we can have a serious talk about it, but I'd appreciate it if you could stop making these kind of comments\". Repeat ad nauseam.",
            "Why does he care so much about is??? It's so sweet what you did for your kitty. He seems like a selfish jerk. :/",
            "Small story.  I was the crazy cat lady who was putting a harness on my elderly cat and walking him in our parks.  I adopted Krampus as a stray because he was way too old for the shelter to take him beyond the 10 day hold.  So we decided to let him live with us and we got about 18 mos out of him (he seriously looked like an 18 year old cat).  In his previous life, he must have been indoor outdoor because I noticed that he would follow me to my mail box or to take the trash out.  So I started putting a harness on him and taking him hiking with me.  When he got tired I would put him in my backpack to ride.  He loved it so much, he would get in his carrier and purr all the way to the park.  People would pet him and marvel at the cat on a leash.  My husband started taking him \"camping in the backyard\" at our fire pit too.  So not a lot of people do that but it is not unusual by any stretch and a town full of dog lovers who use the parks welcomed me to walk my cat on the trails.  \nSo the thing that jumped out for me is that it's been 3 mos since the cat got taken to the park.  Unless boyfriend has a serious concern (like the cat reinjuring himself) he needs to drop it.  Your cat is 16.  I count any cat over 14 as bonus years and a bunch of them make it to their 20s, but not all of them.  You said it yourself, if he hadn't shown improvement to his quality of life that was probably going to be the end.  Boyfriend needs to understand that you have limited time left with your buddy who has been a part of your like for 16 years.  ",
            "I'm very sceptical of anyone who criticises you for a sincere act of kindness. It's also a worrying sign that he's bringing this up three months later. Does he bring up old shortcomings regularly? Do you guys have regular quality time together? What's your boyfriend's work situation? When you say to him, 'That hurts my feelings,' does he seem remorseful? Something's clearly off, but I can't tell if you have an unhappy boyfriend here or a jackass, though personal experience is nudging me towards the latter.",
            "I love this story. I had a mental image of your robust kitty sunning himself as the ducks swim by. Ahh, the life. \n\nIs it weird to take your cat to the park? Sure. But it's also weird hold a cat over his litter box to relieve himself or creating your own cat physical therapy.\n\nYou love your cat and you would do anything for him. I say just own the weirdness. \n\nYour boyfriend is probably one of those people that does weird things but doesn't want the world knowing he does them. That's his stuff, don't take on his insecurities.  ",
            "Ditch the boyfriend. Keep the cat. Life is too damn short to not surround yourself with people who cannot truly enjoy life's silly pleasures. ",
            "Are you sure your boyfriend really likes your cat at all? Maybe he was okay with paying extra attention to the cat when it was due to its severe illness and imminent death, but now that the cat seems healthy he doesn't understand why you're so willing to go out of your way for a cat. \n\nIf that's not the case, it's possible he just thinks it's an affectionate in-joke and hasn't realised it bothers you at all. \n\nIf that's not the case, it could be something else. \n\nI think you need to talk to your boyfriend about what exactly it is that's bothering him, and share how he's making you feel. There is no way of knowing what he thinks without him telling you. Please talk to him. ",

            "There are 3 types of animal lovers out there. You've got the borderline neurotic hoarders, the anything-goes regardless of money or time spent people, and the I love my pets but not THAT much people.\n\nI am smack dab in the middle of the neurotic and anything-goes types. I'll do anything and everything for my pets to keep them happy and healthy and I have done some things that most people would never bother to do. Much like you have.\n\nThen there's my husband. He's a wonderful man and he loves our pets just as much as I do but not to the same, crazy extent. I'll happily throw my dog a birthday party and he'll poke fun at me for making her wear a hat or for baking her a doggy cupcake. He applauded me for doing everything I did for my progressively paralyzed rabbit last year but he'd never think to do any of it himself. I don't like people. I like animals. He likes both. That's where we clash on some of the \"silly\" things I do.\n\nLong story short: sometimes other people just don't quite understand the level of love and appreciation we have for our pets. They never will, either. And sometimes it's a simple matter of jealousy over the time we spend with our fluffy friends. In the end, the best thing to do is sit him down and have a chat about how he feels and go from there.",

Sounds like you have a special relationship with you cat and he is the kind you can travel with like a dog.\n\nThere was a cat someone dumped at my last apartment and I took him in. He was the most amazing cat ever. We didn't know it at the time, but he was very sick and the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong. He still had a great year and was very happy going to the playground and having everyone pet him, going on walks with me, and going for rides in the car.\n\nIf I got mad at a bad driver behind the wheel, he would mew to tell me it's ok. When died of cancer and I still hurts more than most people I've known who have died.\n\nIt's because he wasn't an animal, he was my friend. Sounds like you have a good one too. \ud83d\ude04",

Crazy cat ladies sacrifice hygiene, finances, and personal relationships in order to fulfill their compulsion towards their fluffy horde.\n\nIf it's been a whole three months, either he doesn't realize how much it's bothering you, or he wants you to be bothered. If you've made it very, very clear to him that this type of teasing is not appreciated by you, then it's time to question him in person the next time he goes on the offensive. Why the hell is he bothered/jealous of you and a cat?? Why is he insecure about about you ensuring your feline companion is happy? Why does he think it matters that you took your cat outside? If the cat is supposed to be insignificant, why the hell does he let what you and the cat does affect him? If none of his answers are logical (\"I don't like people thinking of you as a crazy cat lady\"), then it might be time to question other aspects of the relationship to see if there is a pattern of manipulation, especially if he claims YOU are the one blowing it out of proportion. (Seriously, three months and he can't let it go?? Even if it did really bother him, something's wrong with how he communicates or how he deals with things that might make him uncomfortable.)\n\nEDIT: I asked my hubby about this. He called your BF a colorful term, and stated if there was no incident involving the cat bring at the park, and if you did not choose to take the cat out over a prior engagement or personal human event or emergency, then he should be happy that you did something that made you feel happy. As he put it, \"No harm, no foul. He needs to shut up and allow himself to be happy.\"",
            "This doesn't seem like it's about the cat. I can't see why the cat would bother him that much. ",
            "Is it possible he's jealous? Maybe he wanted to come too? Or maybe he just suddenly hates your cat idk",
            "So I know this is a little off topic, but severe arthritis can cause extra structures to form between vertebrae on the spine.  It's possible your cat may have broken one of these when he fell, which I'm sure hurt like hell but may be why nothing seemed physically wrong. I had a dog who did exactly that when she got old and arthritic.  Just a thought.  But more importantly, there is nothing wrong with taking your cat on outings! Enjoy your time with him to the utmost. He doesn't understand the reason behind these things but I'm sure he still enjoys them - as do you.  Your boyfriend may not understand but he has no reason to be angry or embarrassed or jealous and no right to ruin something you enjoy.  \n\nEdit (after I'm more awake): I also work at a pet store and I see plenty of people who don't take proper care of their animals.  People who care about their animals like this - about their animals' emotional welfare as well as the physical - make my day.  Keep on keeping on.",
            "I think he's jealous of the cat, especially with him bringing it up three months later. He's really stuck on this. I think he could be jealous of the time you devoted to the cat. First, I would really just \"and, so what about it?\" next time he brings it up. And maybe take him to do something nice, because I think it really boils down to a jealousy thing.\n\nFor the record, I think what you did for your cat was beautiful. That's a wonderful things you did for him. :) And even if it was or wasn't his birthday? So what if he isn't aware of his birthday? What matters is the end result here: you did something special for a pet - a member of the family that you deeply love and have a strong bond with. I don't find anything weird about that, at all. Maybe it's not as common to see people take cats out to the park - but that doesn't mean it's wrong in any way. I think it's just as normal as taking a dog to the park. You spent quality time with your pet relaxing, and I bet the cat loved it, especially being able to be outside and watching things close up, not behind a window, and warming up in the sun :) And I bet you enjoyed it, too! \n\nPlease don't feel like shit about it, even though it's tough with your BF bringing this up over and over again. What you did was definitely wonderful and you're such a great and thoughtful cat owner :) Your old kitty is super lucky to have such a caring and compassionate owner! Please take pride and happiness in that at least!",
            "I mean, it might be a little \"crazy cat lady\" to do something for a cat's birthday but in reality it's just a harmless, fun little trip to the park.\n\nYour BF's reaction is what's *really* weird. Bro you're still on this? Chill the fuck out. What's his *real* problem? Did you forget his birthday or just get him a shitty card or something, so he feels like you care more about your cat than him?",
            "Your boyfriend is being an ass I would just shut that down once and for all. Tell him (and this is toned down to what I would  really say) \"Hey, you know what? You're repeating yourself. It's over- drop it.  Let's agree to disagree. Move on.\" And if he persists - something like \"you're kidding right?\" and walk away.  Don't let him get to you!!",
            "Addressing only your title: Even if you ARE a crazy cat lady... so what?",
            "If You've only got one cat then you're not a crazy cat lady.\n\nI celebrate my dog's birthday and he gets to unwrap a present, so I see nothing wrong with this.\n\nTell him to not be a complete jackass or you won't celebrate *his* birthday.",
            "If I die and get reincarnated into a cat, I'd hope to have an owner as loving as you are. \n\nI'm not sure what to say about your boyfriend - others here have given good advice. I just wanted to commend your commitment towards giving your cat a wonderful life :)",
            "I honestly think your story is very sweet and hearing about the cat made me super happy",
            "Not a clue what is up with your boyfriend.  You sound like an unbelievably lovely person.",
            "Not crazy at all. The cat needed some time out, and his birthday was an opportune time for it. This is no different than taking a dog out, and I hope you're able to do it more while the weather is still nice (depending on where you live, anyway). Explain that it wasn't just for the cat, but for you too. Maybe invite him on a picnic and take the cat with so you can all enjoy yourselves together.",
            "You're not crazy, you're caring and adorable. Your bf needs an empathy transfusion.",
            "Bringing a cat to a park may be a little uncommon but I dont understand your boyfriends issue with it. It doesn't sound like it even impacted him at all, so why does he care so much?",
            "Tell him to get over it. It's not that big of a deal and he should not be hurt about in now that it's been months.\n\nYour bF probably thought it was weird you took the cat out, (I understand this, my gf is a crazy cat lady) but it's beyond normal human tendency to still be going on over something so little.",
            "I take my apartment cats for walks when I think they'll enjoy it. It's showing kindness to animals. Maybe your boyfriend is too hung up on the birthday bit (rather than it being about giving enjoyment to your cat) or appearances. Crazy cat ladies unite!",
            "You are a crazy cat lady, you go above and beyond what a normal person would do for their cat. Own it, be proud of it. You have compassion. It's not a bad thing. He's a dick and he'll get over it, IF he's worth your time. I say just smile and say yeah, so what? And then ignore the rest of his statements until he moves on",
            "I make my cat a little \"cake\" every year out of tuna, and the neighbor brings her a card round. Life is too short not to enjoy these things your boyfriend sounds like no fun at all ",
            "I'm not a 'pet person' but I get it when others form strong bonds with their pets. Your boyfriend is just wrong. You've shared many years with an animal who's old and in pain. Your sense of compassion and love for your cat deserve admiration, not mockery. He's just a shitty guy - question is whether this is our of character for your BF or just the tip of his iceberg of shittiness. ",
            "I have five cats. My mom grows catnip for them and when it's out of season she buys organic catnip from an expensive tea shop in New Orleans and calls them her grand kitties. We celebrate their birthdays and they get Christmas gifts every year. They dunno why they get awesome canned food for Thanksgiving, but they like it. And they take their meals on breakfast trays and drink from a fountain on our breakfast bar. \n\nYour BF is overreacting. My advice is to replace him with cats! :D",
            "Have you told him that he is making you feel like shit about this?   Maybe he just thinks it's a funny, harmless thing to tease you about.  \n\nOn a side note, I want to know why you only took your cat to the park once?  If the cat likes it and you like it then I would think you could make it a regular thing.  ",
            "You are an amazing cat mother and what you did for your baby was wonderful.",
            "Fuck that guy. Animals are incredible creatures. Your cat is 16! That's amazing! and no he doesn't know it's his birthday, but I bet you he truly enjoyed his time at the park. I do nice things for my cats all the time, sometimes the kitten likes to be on my shoulder, so I let her sit there while I'm getting dressed in the morning. \n\nI think what you did was lovely and very caring. Your boyfriend needs to back off. Has he never had animals?! I don't get this mentality. I don't see the problem in you doing something you enjoy with your companion, so he enjoys himself. It's a treat. It's a nice thing to do! My cats don't know it's Christmas, but they still get extra special food and treats. \n\nNo, you're fine. Don't worry about that shit. You would have felt terrible if you hadn't done something nice for him, you know he deserved a nice day. \n\nOn a side note, my ex told me I take too many pictures of my cats. Kept telling me constantly to stop. I didn't. Mainly because it's my phone and my photo library, so no jurisdiction there, and secondary but pretty much even to that point, was that I lost my beloved black cat around a year ago. I wish I'd taken so so many more photographs. Because I've looked at every single one a hundred times over and I wish I had more to look at. I miss him. Don't let other people dictate which nice things to do for your animals, they don't know know him like you do.",
            "What's baffling to me is that, as far as I can tell, had you gone to the park alone and spent a few hours relaxing and enjoying the scenery, that would be totally acceptable\u2026 but add the cat to the equation and it's suddenly crazy person behavior? That's just silly. ",
            "Im a veterinary assistant and a cat lady. I'm fully willing to admit I often go above and beyond for cats and kittens. I've army crawled in the most disgusting barn rafters to save 3 kittens, I've drivin hours to save a 9 y/o cat, I've spend 3 months nursing a burn victim cat back to health on my own dime and found her a home. I do things out of my own pocket and I love cats. (And dogs)\n\nYou are amazing, but you are not a crazy cat lady, you are just a fantastic cat owner. Your the kind of owner I wish I saw at work more often. Thank you so much for loving him the way you do. And congratulations on all of the success! \n\nIt sounds like your bf is looking for a reason to pick on you. He sounds like he lives cats too. This issue probably goes a lot deeper. You could probably use a good sit down to find out how he really feels about the current state of your relationship.",
            "Sorry not sorry, your boyfriend needs to get the fuck over it. I wish every animal had a hooman like you to take care of them the way that you take care of your cat.\n\nI do the same things with my Maine Coon and my Miniature Schnauzer,every year my family celebrates both their birthdays with something special that they like. Oddly enough, the Maine Coon and I go to the park and sit by the butterfly garden so he can watch the butterflies fly and watch the geese swim. They also get special meals on their birthdays. \n\nYour boyfriend is making a huge deal out of something that is not a big deal at all. By his logic, tiny babies and elderly people shouldn't be celebrated. It's fine that he doesn't want to do those things with you, but there is no reason to berate you for it for either.\n\nIt's time to put your foot down with your boyfriend. The next time he starts going on about it, look him square in the eye and ask him why is he so obsessed with something that doesn't affect his life in the slightest. Tell him how hurtful he is being and that he is really making you feel like shit because of how he is acting. You could also ask him if when he gets old and senile if he would like you to do just the bare minimum to keep him alive and do nothing enjoyable for him. Basically, if he can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. \n\n\n",
            "You're not a crazy cat lady. You're caring and you treat your beloved pet with great compassion and kindness. These are good things! ",
            "Your bf is being ridiculous, and I would tell him so. Childish, even. You love your cat, and you gave him something nice. When my cat was dying from cancer, I read him stories out of a fairytale book. I knew he didn't understand what I was doing, but he did know that I was spending a lot of time with just him and he loved every minute of it. I have never regretted it, and I think that everyone should do something like that for their beloved pets.\n\nPets really are like children, and if he's so unattached emotionally that he not only can't understand it but actively refuses to support you, even to the point of ridiculing you, I would worry about that. Never feel bad for what you did, it was a good and loving thing. He should feel bad for what he's doing to you, it is neither good nor kind. It's quite rude, and I wouldn't feel afraid to tell him so.",
            "As others have stated, nothing wrong with this action at all. Since when is going to the park a waste of time and money?  Potential red flags from that of your boyfriend: doesn't understand the value in caring for a pet, cares what other people think ('crazy cat lady taking her cat to the park') and insecurity as a result. Sounds controlling as well.  Would you be saying this to him if he took his pet to the park? ",
            "I throw a bday party for my Aussies almost every year. We had to skip last year because we had to stay with my MIL for a bit while we sold our one home and bought another. She refused to let them have a party. Now that we moved into our new house they can have their bday party again this year. I also make them a dog friendly cake, rack of lamb, and buy them pressies. This one Redditor is making crocheted plushies in their likeness.  So taking your cat to the park for a bit is not even on the crazy radar. Just take him to the park for a few hours for his birthday so he stops being jealous of your cat. ;)",
            "No you're not crazy at all!! You just have a lot of love for your tiny little friend. And our animal friends deserve to be shown that kind of love because they show it to us unconditionally. Your boyfriend is completely overreacting!",
            "Why does your boyfriend care what you did on your own time? You didn't endanger anyone. You didn't spend any of his or mutual money. You didn't disappear without telling him. You didn't lie to him. You didn't manipulate him.\n\nWhat is so wrong with giving an animal some pleasure? Would he be pissed if you took a dog to the park? It made the cat happy. It made you happy. Why is he angry about an event that had no hurt? It was purely positive.\n\nDoes he want kids and you don't or something? What is he projecting here?",
            "FWIW, I don't even think anything you described is \"crazy.\"  Walking cats is a thing, and when I used to walk mine I'd get all sorts of interested comments.  Cat-walking seems weird to a lot of people, but it's something the animal enjoys.  Most people understand that and move on.\n\nWhat you did for your cat was really sweet, and I hope I'll be as loving a cat owner as my kitty ages.\n\nHas your boyfriend said anything more explicit about what's bothering him?  This seems like a strange thing to latch onto for that long.",
            "I don't get people with your BFs attitude towards pets. We've had our dog for 11 and like your cat, he was a goner before we rescued him from a shelter. He'd gone from pound to shelter to pound to specialist shelter and was almost on his way back to the pound to be PTS when we took him. He's got a birth defect which really amounts to a minor cosmetic issue that we never even notice but apparently it made him unadoptable. ANYWAY. We celebrate his birthday, buy him Christmas gifts, treat him to special dinners and take home literal doggy bags from restaurants, buy his comfy beds and write his name on every birthday and Christmas card we send. I couldn't give a HOOT if people think I'm crazy; that old boy comforted me when I was pregnant and my husband worked nights, he's sat by me when I've been ill, he's been patient with my kids and he's never expected more than a walk and some grub in return. He's better than most people I know and I'm guessing you feel the same about your cat. Seems to me that there's some other deeper issue at work here for your BF to still be bringing it up. Ask him to be straight with you or drop it the fuck out because it's petty and unnecessary and most of all because it's hurting your feelings.",
            "I'm not exactly sure why he's so upset, but I just wanted to tell you that you are a fantastic pet owner and I give you much respect. Thank you for being such a good friend to your cat.",
            "I have a parrot that's 5 years old.   I take her out for walks (she sits on my shoulder) and get her toys for her birthday.   What's wrong with loving another creature?  And animals are smart, they know certain things we think they won't. ",
            "Good for you for caring for your pet.  I'm not sure why your BF would object to something which doesn't affect him?  This gift to your cat didn't require of him anything, so why is he so bothered by it?  The only thing he takes offense to is the fact that complete strangers may think you're a crazy cat lady.  So, it seems that would make him the BF of a crazy cat lady.  Seems very childish to be concerned with such things.",

            "I just gotta say this story is soo cute and your boyfriend is being really weird about this whole thing. He needs to give it a rest, it's not like you did anything unnatural like dress the cat up or put it in a baby stroller. ",

            "You sound like a wonderful person. You can tell a lot about a person from how they treat animals. You've loved and cared for your cat for 16 years. That's a long time. I think it is normal when our animals get old to want to give them special treats and times because they have lived so long and making them happy is important. \n\nFrankly your boyfriend is sounding like an asshole. I think it makes him even more of a jerk if he did help so much with cat care yet STILL cannot see why you did this. What the hell is wrong with him?  Three months later and he is trying to make you feel like shit over something that should only be a sign of how much you love your cat and that you are thoughtful. I would have a serious talk and turn this around. The fact that he can't let it go is just insane. You know what someone is your partner maybe you don't always agree with things they do but purposely making someone feel bad isn't ok. Sometimes you just let something go. Or learn to accept it because it is important to the other person. If you talk to him and he doesn't stop that's a big sign that he will do this about many other things ahead. ",
            "I just wanted to say you sound like a wonderful loving person. My cat is going to turn one next month and my brother and I plan on having a little party for him. Your cat's birthday sounds great. Don't let your boyfriend think you're a crazy cat lady",

He might be thinking your affection for your cat is overboard because he has no experience of his own to compare.

            "Your boyfriend doesn't like your cat, and think it's ridiculous that you spent ten days lifting him into the litter box. Since he'd be a heartless monster for saying so, he's complaining about the outing. \n\nMaybe he is concerned you're not careful enough to prevent another injury by taking him out. After the ordeal of nursing an old cat 24/7, he probably doesn't want to do it again. \n\nWhat happens if he injures himself again?

I get my dog anniversary presents (being the day I rescued her) and let her unwrap them because it's a lot of fun and makes us both happy.\n\nIt's no different than people with newborns who get them a Christmas stocking or wrap presents for them or decorate cakes for them.  The kid doesn't know what the hell is going on but they know they're having a grand ol time and it makes the family happy to watch.\n\nYou're fine.  I know so many people that get their pets birthday and Christmas presents and they're perfectly normal.  I'm willing to bet your boyfriend just hasn't had an animal that was truly **his**.

Even if he thought it were a stupid thing to do, it's not something to be THAT upset at you over, let alone this long. \n\nTalk to him in general about how he's doing/feeling. If anything is bothering him. Don't bring up the cat unless he does. Focus on hearing him out and understanding if he has stressors in his life that may be causing him to try releasing his tensions in less constructive ways. You may want to suggest he see a therapist if he reveals stuff you feel is out of your breadth to support. \n\nIf he does bring up the cat, tell him firmly that 1) you did nothing wrong, 2) it was months ago, and 3) that he needs to stop berating you about it. You can ask what his goal is with nagging you about the cat. Neither of you can change the past and undo it, so what's his motive? If he just wants you to feel bad, it's a red flag. If he wants to make sure you don't repeat the event, tell him he needs to say that in the first place instead of trying to make you feel bad (also you can dig into why, I know I'm curious, but it's not necessary). If he doesn't know, reiterate that he needs to stop and that he can bring up his real issue when he figures it out. \n\nIf he doesn't want to talk or seems to have nothing to talk about (or even if he talks a lot but the cat doesn't come up, and then he continues to bother you about it) then at a separate time try having the cat conversation above.

Parks for dogs, I've always just assumed were because they have so much energy to get out & a place for people to take their dogs who don't have yards, and to socialize. Things cats do less of, and in your case I would imagine your cat isn't up for much socializing right now. So, in short, its nice you want to do something special for your cat.

When they got older, on their birthdays, she would go buy them a little box of the mini-cupcakes you can get at the bakery in grocery stores. Her husband would fuss, saying they don't need sugar because they're so old (and it's bad for them anyway), but they had already lived to their life expectancy age. If one cupcake (half the size of regular cupcakes) was going to kill them, it was meant for them to go anyway. None of them had any blood-sugar problems, so - why not? Anywho, this year on their birthdays (they were all within days of each other - Zelda - 11, Buster - 10, and Thor - 9) she got the cupcakes and 2 of her old dogs were getting down in their old age. She gave them 3 cupcakes this time instead of just the 1. She took so many fun pictures with them. The looks on their faces was priceless. They were very obviously happy, and she wouldn't have given anything for that moment. The 2 (Thor and Buster) died two weeks later from complications from being so old and frail (Thor was a Great Dane and Buster - a red retriever who chased many cars in his day). Her husband never gave another thought about those cupcakes being bad for them. He was glad that they took the time to have mini-parties for those sweet old dogs because they knew they were loved.

Don't be accusatory about it, and try to open a dialogue about why he feels the need to do this all the time. He might feel like the cat is getting better attention than he is. It sounds crazy, but he might not even be aware of it. He might just be trying to connect with you, and not he aware of the harm that how he's going about it is doing.\n",
            "I just wanted to say I think you're an amazing person for doing this. I'm sorry that he doesn't get it. It may be worth checking in to be sure that he feels like his needs are being met in the relationship, and that there's not some old wound he's passive aggressively digging at by going on and on about this.

            "IMO there is a good chance your boyfriend feels like he is not getting enough something in your relationship and is transferring those feelings onto the cat.",
            "You're not a crazy person. I would take my cat to the park if he would walk on the lead... But I do buy him birthday presents, couple of toys and some cat treats. He doesn't know it's his birthday but he likes the stuff",
            "Would he not celebrate a babies birthday because the kid doesnt know its his birthday? A baby and a cat arent the same but the point is the same- a celebration is for everyone involved, not just the guest of honor. It was a sepcial day to YOU and you did something special with your pet for it. Thats fine and shows a great deal of love and care for your pet. Tell your bf to stfu. ",
            "You are not crazy. You knew it was the cat's birthday and the cat enjoyed some time outside. Your boyfriend is being really weird about this.",
            "How is this any different than taking your dog out somewhere? Down at the local lakes it always full of people and their dogs. I'd take my cats if they weren't afraid of their own shadows. If the cat had fun, and you had fun, what's the big deal? Hell, sometimes I take a book and a camera and sit in nature for an hour or two myself. ",

            "If I had to guess, he's either anxious over the cats well-being and doesn't think it can handle the outdoors yet, or he just doesn't get it. I have baked a cake for my dogs on their birthday, its crazy but its just something a little extra for them and makes me feel like they truly are a part of the family. So sure, its crazy, but who cares? Everyone has their own way of expressing their appreciation for their pets. A lot of people who don't share the same amount of love for pets will never understand the \"babying\" and love pet owners give to their pets. Some people think its weird when someone lets their dog lick their face so I'm sure they'd flip out finding out you threw a party for them. I think its cute and thoughtful. Just let him know thats what you want to do for your cat and if it bothers him he should keep it to himself. I highly doubt its anything detrimental to him. If it is, thats concerning. This is a small issue that should not bother him whatsoever. Argue about bills like a normal couple, not about a kitty party lmao.",
            "He needs to let it go, but on the flip side if he is actually helping take care of the cat (you say 'we' alot) then he does care for it. I think this is just a way to poke fun but he needs to stop ifbitbupsets you that much.",
            "I'm also a cat momma OP, I just nursed a very sick kitten back to health and it's a night and day transformation.  I also have a 12 year old girl who survived cancer but is still on her last leg due to a heart problem.  Her birthday is Halloween this year and I WILL celebrate it for her.\n\nThe cat might not know its birthday but it understands love.  And the birthday outing is also fulfilling to you because it allows you to express your love which is equally important.  \n\nJust do what you want, you're a grown adult and BF might not understand but it's none of his business and puts him out none. At 41 I would imagine he should have seen far stranger things by now than a cat outing to watch birds.\n\nIf he keeps poking you about it just tell him that this is how it is there's nothing he can do about it to change your view so he might as well get used to it.  it's nothing that should bother him beyond \"a cat birthday? that's different. it's not for me but you must love your pet, and I love you, so you do you\"\n\nI will only date cat friendly people.  People who love cats 'get  it' and can at least find humor in a cat birthday.  I recommend if you ever find yourself single to make \"must love cats\" a  point.  A lot of men out there, especially older, are not cat people and in fact feel it's a cornerstone of masculinity to be  non cat friendly.  A cat loving man with a good sense of humor is a keeper.  \n\n",
            "I think your cat's birthday was as much a celebration for you as it was for your cat. You needed the touchstone of having it be his 16th birthday, especially since it looked like he might not have made it that far. I'm happy that you and your fur baby are both happy!\n\nNow, on to your boyfriend. He might be upset that you're spending so much time and energy on what he sees as just a pet. My dad is much the same way with our family dogs. He can't fathom why we pay for surgeries and medications to keep our family dogs (now dog, our older has moved on to the Great Field of Dreams) happy and healthy. He just doesn't feel that bond the way the rest of us do. Could your boyfriend be upset at the relative lack of attention he's gotten from our household being so focused on the cat's rehab for so long? I don't pose this as a rational or reasonable argument, but as an emotional once based on the past few weeks you three have had. He could be jealous of the cat in that way. \n\nI'd suggest talking to your boyfriend and thanking him for his patience with you and the cat these few weeks. Tell him you appreciate how he's helped out and how much it means to you that he gets your love for the cat. Also explain to him why you felt so strongly that you and your cat should celebrate this milestone together, as much for you as for him. Hopefully that kind of appeal will at least make the gesture make sense to your boyfriend!",

Is he checking out of the relationship and looking for reasons to act like you did something wrong? Is he feeling neglected and jealous of the cat? Something is going on.",
            "I don't know what your boyfriend's problem is. You spent your afternoon doing something with your cat and he wasn't even there. He doesn't get to dictate how you spend your time. I take my ferrets to the park on occasion. I get them little toys for 'birthdays'. It makes me happy and I know they don't care about birthdays but they like toys and it brings me joy to see them happy. My grandparents throw real parties for their dogs birthday. That to me is a little weird, but it makes them happy and they aren't hurting anybody. Spending time with your cat is not crazy. ",
            "Whether the cat enjoyed the outing or not is not known for certainty.\n\nWhat is known:\n\n- this outing didn't harm the cat\n\n- you enjoyed the outing\n\n- you have an older cat who is not long for this world, and you have (or had till he spoiled it) a lasting memory\n\n- your bf is unhinged\n\nHe needs to figure out why this outing bothered him. He needs to stop making you feel bad about this.",
            "You and or your boyfriend should read the science of cats (good book). They are wild animals with wild instincts. If any creature should get outside time it is your cat. Maybe make a point to take him out more. And I think your boyfriend must have some other issue - it is ridiculous to feel like this. On my cat's birthday he gets spoiled too. He doesn't know it is his bday but he sure has an overload of happy. It's not like you had a cat birthday party and made people bring gifts- you did a normal everyday thing for* some owners on a day that was also his bday. Anyways if he is still going on about it I'm telling you there is something else there. ",
            "My 16 year-old dog doesn't know it's her birthday. But she knows happiness when given a chance to do the things she loves. And that, in turn, makes me very happy. That's what should matter to your boyfriend- that seeing your cat happy brings you joy.\n\nAlso, I'd wonder what the true reason is behind his comments. There's something else there, not necessarily about you. ",

            "Who cares if it's crazy or not why do we have to label it? \n\nI think it's awesome you're taking the extra time to care for your cat you sound like an amazingly compassionate person. Keep taking your cat to the park. He's old and clearly enjoys it, you're creating memories you are going to have forever and your cat is living an awesome life! These are acts of love don't let anyone make you feel bad about doing things like this. ",

            "You are not crazy. You are a good, loving person and your boyfriend is being an ass over a very sweet (and most importantly absolutely harmless!) gesture. ",
            "Based only on what he's saying about the cat birthday, I'd say he was just an unkind asshole who couldn't empathize with animals (which would be a huge red flag).\n\nBut with the other stuff that happened, and the fact that he clearly has done a lot for the cat, I'm guessing he is just finding an extremely poor way to handle resentment he feels about having provided that amount of care for the cat/possibly not feeling appreciated for what he did/possibly feeling jealous of the care you give the cat.\n\nIf my partner's 16 year old pet needed that level of nursing, I would consider that their responsibility and I probably wouldn't make myself available to help at the level it sounds like he did. I understand it could put a strain on a relationship, but for me if a pet is very old and of declining health and suffering debilitating injuries where they can't use the bathroom or do much of anything else without my help, that is a cat that has hit the end of the line. I am absolutely okay with other people making different choices in their pet's healthcare, and I'm glad you were able to get a few more years for your cat. But if I felt like my partner was signing me up for providing extensive care to a sick cat that I personally thought should have been euthanized, that would be a total nonstarter for me.\n\nI'm guessing he basically felt that way, but did not establish the boundary he needed to because he was afraid of seeming like an asshole. And now he just managed to find a whole new way to seem like an asshole instead.\n\nI'd ask him what exactly his feelings are about the cat situation besides just a birthday party, because I'm guessing it isn't \"you gave your cat a nice birthday\" so much as \"your cat is 16 and instead of putting it down when it suffered a serious injury and was in a lot of pain, *I* somehow ended up being tasked with nursing it back to health and now I'm so bitter about having done that that the cat's continued existence chafes at me and all love you show towards it just feeds my resentment.\"\n\nHe's definitely being a shit about this but perhaps if you talk it through and he can express what he's actually feeling, he can stop being a passive aggressive prick about it.",

            "Dude I know a lady who takes her cats with her EVERYWHERE! No joke. I mean she probably is a bit of a crazy cat lady but she's a perfectly normal human being with a great career, home etc. she's just single and her cat are her babies. She post pics every day of their adventures. They go for walks, they are with her in her car when she goes places all the time. Granted most people don't do that but I wouldn't say it's abnormal. I used to live in an apartment and would take my cat on a leash to a park a block away where I would read and he would lie in the sun. \n\nYou are not a crazy cat lady. You just want to give him a good life while he's still here and your BF is an insensitive ass. Show him this thread so I can tell him that to his stupid internet face. \n\nKeep taking him places if you and the cat both enjoy it. Rub it in your BF face haha ",
            "What you did for the cat was nice and really sweet and no matter what you should feel nothing but good that you thought to take the time to make your cat feel more like.. well, a cat.\n\nIn regards to how the bf feels, I wonder if it's because of the rationale behind it?\n\nFor instance: I can't stand when people 'humanise' animals. Love them for what they are, but don't mistake them for having human feelings and thoughts. A cat is a cat, a dog is a dog. A dog doesn't watch TV for the storyline, it craves pack mentality and guidelines set by the pack leader. It craves running to burn energy, sleep to rest, and loyalty from the alpha. It doesn't get excited to see your nan anymore than it recognises that your nan is a pack member that you are excited to see, and so it follows suit.\n\nBirthdays are human concepts. If my partner took a cat out to 'celebrate it's birthday' I'd be pretty mentally turned off to that, because it's humanising an animal; applying a purely human concept to an animal.\n\nHad my partner just taken an ailing cat to the park for the day and not added the human twist to it, I'd have felt a lot better with that process.\n\nIt's a strange one, because it seems heavily dependant on the rationale behind it. I can't help but feel that theres more to this behind the scenes. OP's actions described here don't come across as crazy cat lady massively, save for the 'birthday celebration' as being the reason cited for taking the cat out, but I'm wondering if OP is the kind of person to dress her cat, sing songs to it, treat it like a human perhaps, and the bf is the kind of person who is bothered by this. The park could simply just be the straw the broke the camel's back, so to speak, hence why it keeps coming up, but in essence it's just one more incident that the bf feels uneasy about?\n\nWho knows.\n\nEither way, you keep loving that cat. If nothing else, no-one can take how good of an owner you are.\n\n(Please forgive any spelling or grammatical errors. Typing this on a phone app.)",
            "It's sad to read this thread and hear how good some animals eat and realize that there are children who starve to death every day. Just an observation. ",
            "There is nothing wrong with your behavior especially for a senior cat, that may not be around for too long. Enjoy every moment you get with him. You never know when something happens and suddenly your 16yrs companion is no longer there. My 12yr old cat suddenly died of cancer one day, if I hadn't been home sick I wouldn't have noticed anything. Within a week he was gone.\nLike it or not our pets are part of our family. My cat loved to sit on the patio, watch the birds and sit in the sun. I always found apartments and homes with him in mind, always looking to accommodate the little things that significantly improve his quality of life as well as mine.\nYour BF needs to grow up and get over himself. The better question to ask him, is really what is really bothering him? Why does it suddenly matter how much time you spend with your cat????",
            "Yes you're a crazy cat lady. But you're also caring and thoughtful. All of us pet owners are crazy. We invite these 4 legged creatures to share our home. To scratch up our stuff, pee and poop where they are not supposed to, and we love them all the same. What you did was awesome. You gave an amazing afternoon to your feline friend. Whether it was a birthday or not, that doesn't matter. If anything, it's sad that your BF doesn't realize what a big heart you have. He's probably jealous that you took the cat out instead of him. Tell him to either support your crazy ideas or., at least, leave you alone about them. If this is the craziest thing you do for your cat, you're still pretty sane by \"crazy cat lady\" standards. ",

            "Thats amazing! For someone to make you question your sanity over a beloved pet makes me think it's him who should be questioning his. Tell him to get over it. And was your boyfriend with you when the injury happened to the cat or was he somewhere else in the house? Im just curious because Im a bit suspicious as to why he's trying to make you feel guilty about caring now. "

        "selftext": "Hey all. So my brother and his fiance have been together for around 7 years now. To be honest we didn't start off great to begin with, my family and I were really nice with her and tried to treat her like part of the family. But she was just weird with us, she didn't talk to us or eat in front of us. If we went out for dinner she demanded that her and my brother have a separate table away from the rest of the family. She didn't let him go on vacation with us.\n\nShe did a lot of different shit over the years, if I was talking to them and she wanted to eat they would just kick me out of the room. When our parents were away she purposefully left a mess that I would have to clean up. Planned her birthday party on the day of my birthday so he couldn't go. Rummaging through my room while I was gone. Petty stuff like that. But what was worse was what she's done to my brother, when he got with her he had a lot of friends, he's always been a happy go lucky, outgoing person. But she stopped letting him see his friends and going to family get togethers. (My other brother and sister live in a different city so we don't see them often)\n\nAbout two years ago they both moved in together in a city 3 hours away for university. We see him once every one or two months now which is okay. But she doesn't let him go out or have friends, which just seems so bizarre to me, I feel like he should be enjoying himself in university, but she just has him cleaning the apartment all the time.\n\nThe latest thing that's happened was that my sister (27)  had an engagement party. My brother's fiance came out with this demand that either they go home with her friend before the party or that my parents drive them home (again, 6 hour drive all in all) afterwards. Oh, and she wasn't even going to the party, just him. Basically just she wasn't letting him go, she wanted to ruin the party for my sister. \n\nHe ended up going regardless and as punishment, she ignored him on the phone for two days, and that he was allowed to come home when she was away to work. \n\nAnother thing is that she's been trying to plan their wedding, even though he's expressed openly that he doesn't want to get married yet. She texted my mum from his phone (he's dyslexic and doesn't type the way she did in the text) demanding that my parents would have to give them \u00a34,000 for the wedding.\n\nJust to clarify, this isn't some petty thing just because he's my brother. I adore my other brother's boyfriend and sister's fiance, they fit so well into the family. My family have tried so hard to make my brother's fiance fit in and feel comfortable.\n\nI don't know what to do now, he reconciled with her as soon as he went home. I don't want to associate with either of them anymore, I just feel like they bring in too much stress. Is it childish for me to just stop talking to them? The thing that pisses me off most is the engagement thing, my sister has gone through a lot and is the one person who deserves to  be happy, it hurts to know that my brother's fiance wanted to ruin that for her.\n\nTLDR: Brother's fiance controls his every move, including which friends and family he sees. Didn't let my brother go to sister's engagement party. Brother is too immature and doesn't stand up for himself. I need some advice on how to deal with them.\n\nSorry for the super long post but I feel like you needed that context \ud83d\ude05 Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your advice and responses. I'm sorry to hear that some of you have been through something similar.\n\nJust to explain a little more, my family didn't just lie back and let this happen, they've tried so many times to help and make him see that this behaviour isn't normal but I think he's too far deep. \n\nHe's told us that he isn't happy and I can tell he hasn't been happy for a while. He's tried to get her to change mutliple times, even asked her to go to therapy but she always gets around him again.",

            "They have been together since they were 16 and 15, so it's important to bear in mind that this relationship has zero frame of reference for what is and isn't healthy. (It's not BTW).\n\nNot putting it on your parents or anything but why were they entertaining some teenage girl telling them where their son could eat at a restaurant or go on vacation? It seems her unacceptable actions have gone unchecked by your broader family (and possibly her own), hence why she thinks she can act how she wants. \n\nYou are not obliged to have a relationship with her by any means, and frankly - why would you want to? I would suggest, advising your family 1st that this is something you are planning to do, to sense if they will support you. \n\nBe prepared that they may not, given that they haven't called her out over the years. Then you need to decide are you willing to stick your neck out and do what's right for you.",
            "Wow, this girl is horrible and abusive. I can\u2019t blame you for wanting nothing to do with her, but have you expressed these concerns to your brother?",
            "Your brother is in an abusive relationship. She sounds like a vile person who has isolated him from his friends and family, she's invaded spaces in the family home, she's demanding, sounds like a drama queen, and controls his life/the relationship. She's planning a wedding despite him not wanting to get married. What even is that?\n\nIt is 100% ok for you to no longer want anything to do with them. If your brother comes with this vile woman, then the consequence is you don't want to see him.\n\nI think you should talk to your parents, maybe just one of them at first, and tell them how worried you are for your brother. Imagine what kind of dynamic is happening at home between your brother and the gf. He is being abused and controlled and I think you should get your parents and other siblings to see this too, and then stage an intervention for your brother only (he needs to get away from her, so she's got NO part in his intervention). If you can make your brother see that he is in an abusive relationship, then you can help him get out.",
            "She is not toxic. She is abusive.\n\nThis is what an abusive relationship looks like (one version of it at least) .",
            "This happened in my family with my uncle. He married someone just like this, and we lost contact with him for probably 20 years because she didn't want him to have anything to do with the rest of us. My uncle started to visit us once again when my grandfather got really sick and we all needed more help since none of us live close to my grandparents, except for this one uncle. His wife is insane to the point where she screams at him for simply wanting to help out my grandmother and even throws things at him when he mentions visiting any one of us. \n\nMy grandfather has since passed away, and my uncle has become an alcoholic. I feel so bad for him, yet I don't at the same time. He had so many chances to reach out to us. \n\nMy advice to you is to talk to your brother. Get to him before it's too late. He may be upset that you even bring it up, but it's worth not losing him. He's going to regret missing all of the chances he had to see his family while he could. I'm sure your brother's fiance is extremely manipulative and has some kind of hold on him, and he needs to step back for a moment and think of the consequences this kind of relationship can have.\n\nBest of luck, so sorry this is happening to your family.",
            "I recommend you contact your local abuse network or abuse survivor support group - each county/municipal area has one though they are quickly losing services. \n\nThey will be able to furnish you with more information and on how to address this issue - whilst a confrontation or intervention may seem the best idea, it is not always the case for people in abusive relationships and can serve to further isolate them from the one remaining lifeline that they have. They will also be able to provide you with information on services he can access such as counselling or shelters, so that if you do talk to him about this, you can at least give him some options.\n\nIn many abusive relationships it can take years or even decades for the victim to reach the point at which they want to leave. Even then it can take many attempts to finally leave for good. \n\nI counsel patience, research and understanding; despite this woman, you clearly love your brother. So let him know that you'll always be there, ready and waiting for him when he finally has the courage to leave. \n\nChoosing not to close off communication doesn't mean actively communicating, but it does mean allowing your brother to know you will pick up the phone for him if he needs you. Sadly, when it comes to people in abusive relationships, all you can do is wait for them to make the choice.",
            "This girl sounds exactly like my brothers ex. She isolated him, made up lies, faked pregnancies, threatened suicide....literally everything abusive you can think of. We pleaded with him over and over to leave her and he kept going back. \n\nI hate to say it but he had to make up his mind on it. We all told him she was bad, and he agreed. But he did not leave until he was ready. That's unfortunately how it is. Just explain to your brother that you will always love him, but the way she is, is unacceptable. Leave it at that. Hopefully he will see it soon.",

They now have two beautiful children I never see.\n\nAfter years and years (and years) of me trying to navigate / impact / control the situation while experiencing an increasing amount of pain and confusion arising from the situation, I finally let go. I cut the cords that had connected me to my brother - the cords I had grasped so ferociously.  \n\nFiguring out how to let go was one of the hardest things I've  ever had to do. But letting go was one of the biggest, most important decisions I've made in my adult life.

Also, when you speak with your brother I would suggest asking how he is feeling, and show more concern with his well being rather than shit on the gf because this might avoid him from getting defensive over his relationship. \n\nFor example \u201cit seems you had a hard time trying to get to sister\u2019s engagement party, I noticed your fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t with you, are you ok?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m sure other redditors will have a better approach, I\u2019m not great with wording.\n\nYour bro\u2019s gf is attempting to isolate him so he is dependent on her, if you try to show that you are always there for him hopefully he will realize that he doesn\u2019t need to be in this abusive relationship. I wouldn\u2019t cut your brother out just yet, but you don\u2019t need to keep trying to build a relationship with her, since it\u2019s obvious she doesn\u2019t want one with his family.",

            "There's a quiz on the Love Is Respect website about whether you're in a healthy relationship.  If you have a way to get it to him without her seeing, send it to him.  Many in your brother's situation find it eye-opening.    \n\n\nIt's up to you whether or not to keep the channels open.  If you're up to it, leave the lines open, make occasional contact, and let him know you're always available to help him. (Susan Brewster refers to it as being an anchor.)  Don't bash her, but neutral observations about her behavior are okay.  If you're tapped out, then stop talking to them.  But give yourself some time to think about it.",

Im very worried about your relationship with gf.  She seems to go out of her way to damage your bonds with us and isolate you form the rest of is.

That means listening as much as you talk. I was in an abusive relationship and it all started with very similar circumstances. He may be looking for a way out but doesn't know what to do. I was lucky enough to have parents who were willing to take me in until I got on my feet. Is that an option or can you offer? \n\nIf he's receptive, make concrete plans immediately.

I'm really sorry to hear about how your brother's abusive fianc\u00e9e has been mistreating you and your family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people are saying you should cut off contact from your brother as well as his fianc\u00e9e. I disagree. Abusive partners isolate their victims from their friends and family, which she has already been doing very successfully to your brother. I understand that dealing with her must be wildly frustrating and ruining your time with your brother. But stopping spending time with him will play right into her hands. It's what she wants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKnowing they're loved and accepted unconditionally by their family and friends is one of the only lifelines victims of abusive relationships have. I would tell him that you're concerned for him and only want him to be happy. Ultimately, only he can get himself out of this relationship. Give him your unconditional love and support, whether or not he decides to stay with her. A friend telling me she loved me and supported me, without any judgement, no matter my decision when I was weighing whether or not to stay with my abusive ex, was one of the best things anyone has ever done for me. It's a hell of a hard high road to take, but one your brother will be grateful for.",
            "I'm not trying to blame your parents or anything but wanting separate tables would have put me off of her.  I see that as bright red flag. Glowing even.\n\n That level of control is not cute. It's not out of love. It's all about control. Shes just wants him to do whatever she says. She has rules on top of rules. Its probably a nightmare for him where nothing is ever good enough. \n\n  Society likes to pretend this is cute. Like its extra love or super jealous like she just loves him so much.  But it's the same as when a guy does it. She has the same insidious reasons as a Male abuser. She feels bad inside she she wants to make him feel bad inside so she makes up more rules than he can follow just so she can berate him when he messes up. Your brother is miserable and he needs help.   \n\n  The problem is its hard to help an abuse victim. The abuser spends 24/7 fucking with their heads and you can only speak to them when you're allowed. Plus it's so hard for men. Women have been more educated on how to spot red flags and when a man is being controlling or dangerous. Yet we still get fooled all the time. It's super hard for men because they've been trained to think that sort of behavior is about love and I feel like they almost never spot the danger.\n  \n You and your family should read up more about emotional abuse and try to come up with ways to support him. Unfortunately there's not much you can do as pushing might push him away. Just hope he's not in physical danger and that he comes to his senses. Good Luck!",
            "All you can do is tell your brother how you feel. Just realize that while they're together it might ruin your relationship with him. But if you're thinking of stopping talking to him anyway you might as well.   \n\n\nHe may very well ignore you and in that case there's very little you can actually do, other than forgive him when and if they break up. People have to make their own mistakes.",
            "It's clear your brother is in an abusive relationship, but I would not be surprised if he has rationalized his fiancee's behavior as normal and told himself that things cannot be all bad if they have good times together. From the outside, people always act surprised when someone *chooses* to stay with their abuser, but most of the time the one being abused cannot see what is horribly wrong with their relationship. \n\nAs another comment noted, find resources on abusive relationships to send to your brother. Reaching out directly and telling him that his fiancee is abusing him may cause him to withdraw, but if you help him see the bigger picture with patience and kindness, then he will hopefully leave of his own volition.",
            "You've already received wonderful advice here. I will just add that just because your brother caves into her demands doesn't mean your family has to. Your parents do not owe her 4k,and I pray they refuse her even if she threatens to cut their son off from them further. You are not her personal maid. Refuse to clean up after her. Confront her about going through your room. Absolutely reaffirm your love for your brother, but stand your ground against this abusive witch.  \"I will always love you, Bro, but I refuse to let her mistreat me.\"",
            "Please please please let your brother read this thread. Or rewrite it in a way that highlights the concerns and red flags more and send it to him.\n\nYou don't want to be family of this person. This is a valid concern. I am sure you can get some family members to join in on this opinion. Voice it to your brother. If he still wants to continue date (or even marry) her despite of it, then he must be willing to suffer possible consequences such as not being welcome in your or your family's houses.",
            "Not only is he in an abusive relationship, but he may also have a time-spent fallacy. They've been together 7 years, that's almost 1/3 of his life. If he can't get her to go to therapy, he might benefit from going to therapy on his own.",
            "This is why marrying your first partner (ESPECIALLY high school sweethearts) csn be dangerous. You have zero idea what you want and deserve from a partner. Some people find that, but for most people, it takes a few tries. Your brother doesn't know how he's supposed to be treated, and his fianc\u00e9e doesn't know how she's supposed to treat him. And as a result, she's turned into a majorly abusive and controlling monster. There's a lot of good advice here, and I wanted to combine my favorite two pieces here:\n\n* Don't expect your family (*especially* your brother of course) to immediately accept what you're saying. Denial is a big factor in why other people don't step in when they see abuse. Because that would mean that they enabled it, that they didn't see it happening sooner... Basically it makes them feel like they helped abuse their loved one. Or, in the case of the victim, it would mean that the person who they think loves them actually doesn't. And since the abuser makes themself the center of the victim's life, the victim thinks that without the abuser, they have nothing. I know that one all too well.\n\n* DEFINITELY do not talk to your brother by outright telling him he is being abused. That will create a defensive, emotional response due to the reasons above. Ask him questions that will prompt him to come to that conclusion on his own. And it might not be immediately. I liked the suggestions of \"Are you happy? Is there anything you really want from life?\" and maybe asking about those friends she's cut out of his life. \"Hey, remember that time Frank did xxx? Oh man, that was great! Have you talked to him lately? You guys used to be so tight!\" \"Hey, I feel like we haven't gotten to spend much time together, and once you're married we'll see each other even less, so I would really like to go do [insert activity you guys do together, or something sentimental from before his fianc\u00e9e] with you sometime.\" I'd say the most direct you should get is \"Hey, are you doing alright? I've noticed you've seemed really stressed out (or frustrated, or anything like that) lately. If you wanna talk, I'm here. Cuz I'm your brother, I love you, and I want you to be happy.\" Basically make it about him and his happiness, and your relationship as brothers, rather than accusing his fianc\u00e9e or saying anything that can be misinterpreted regarding *their* relationship or his decision to stay with her for so long.\n\nIf he realizes what's really going on, that's great, but be ready for worst-case scenarios. Make sure he has a safe space. Save evidence of the abuse so he can get a restraining order, if necessary. But if he doesn't... It's going to be really, really hard for you and your family. For as long as a victim refuses to see the reality of their situation, no one else can force them to see it. Again, I know this all too well. It took far too much for me to leave, even with my friends and family saying I needed to leave him. But I did. So don't give up hope, but prepare for it to take a while, and prepare for it to end poorly when it does.\n\nGood luck. If you wan a talk, I'm happy to. Maybe hearing more about his side can help you approach the situation better, idk.",
            "And she has been doing this since she was 15 I gather? My mom would have put that girl in her place a long long time ago... maybe you could get to talk to your brother one on one and ask him if she's holding something over him or that he's staying with her voluntarily? Make it clear to him he doesn't deserve to be treated like that and that he is always welcome to knock on your door is he ever wants to leave (if you're okay with that of course) but that for your own sake you might have to keep your distance for now because she has too much of a negative influence on you and your other family. He can choose to stay with her but that doesn't mean you have to keep seeing her. Sometimes people stay with an abuser because they don't know better than this is normal or they feel like they deserve it or are scared of the repercussions. It's worth finding that out.",

The best thing anyone told me when I was in a really bad relationship was that they really cared about me and that I really didn't seem happy, and also raising the points they saw in a gentle way. Don't attack the girl, that will make him defensive, but bring up gently the actions and instances over time. Hopefully that will be a seed that will take root and grow. Don't abandon him if he doesn't do what you want, he is likely so entrenched in their dynamic it's hard to see. Good luck, OP.",

Not the most subtle thing he did, but looking back pretty funny.  \n\n\nI'm constantly grateful looking back to know that things did not end with her the way that she had wanted them to then.  My life is about a million times better for that.  If I were you, I would not sit by for the sake of politeness on this one.  The worst thing that happens is none of it goes your way and you end up not wanting to be around them, which is where you are right now anyway.  I'd speak up, directly.  Tell them all of your concerns, put them in a direct narrative.  Outline how his life is worse for being in a relationship with her, how she's using him, controlling him, and not loving or respecting him, with direct evidence and example.  The sort of thing that, even if he shrugs it off right away, might stick in his brain and gnaw at him.  Look for examples maybe from his friends of how single life is good and he'd be better off that way.  Anything you can say to speak up.  In many years, he may love and appreciate you for it, like I love and appreciate my brother for all he did for me.",

So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised uf he just doesn\u2019t get where the problem is.\n\nI was once trapped in sth a bit similar and what helped me was going on vacation with friends.

As long as he doesn't actually marry her, it will be much easier for him to separate when it's time to do so. \n\nAbusive relationships are similar to addictions. It takes time for the addict to really see the damage the drug is doing, and then they have to really *want* to stop, plus they need the support and the motivation to *stick to quitting.* It's not an easy road. I think the best you can do it let him know that, when or if he chooses to leave her, you'll be there to support him. And be a support and gentle reminder of how great he is, help him maintain some level of self-esteem... abusive relationships chip away at self esteem, which is another hook to keep the person entangled.",

            "Having been in a similar situation to your brother. I would say the best way to help is to just continue to express how much you love him and how you will support him no matter what. Unfortunately, until he decides he\u2019s had enough there is no \u201csaving\u201d or \u201crescuing\u201d him. It\u2019s sad but true. Often when people find themselves in situations such as this there is a perverse sense of loyalty and guilt that begins to intertwine with also this odd sense of pride. You feel loyal to this person because of years invested and you feel guilt for thinking about just giving that up without \u201ctrying\u201d.  He\u2019s going to have to see on his own what is happening to him. Like others have said approach the situation supportively and almost as though she\u2019s not part of the equation. Like \u201cI miss seeing you as much as I used to\u201d or \u201cof late you seem less happy than I know you to be, would you like to talk\u201d.

            "Ayyy lady here but I was in a relationship like this. The thing is, confronting him and insisting won\u2019t work. When I was in an abusive relationship like this one, I rejected absolutely everyone who tried to tell me what to do. (This was largely because my abusive partner had isolated me from all my friends so I felt like he was \u201call I had.\u201d).  But I truly and clearly remember the friends, family, and acquaintances who lovingly \u201cjust mentioned\u201d that they were there for me. It makes a world of difference.      \n      \nIf I was you, as a sister, I would take your bro out to dinner (yes she will say it\u2019s not allowed, but you can insist because he is fam. If his family can\u2019t stand up to her how can he?). And have a nice time but once you get halfway through appetizers/meals, say something sweet but direct. \u201cI love you and I care about you and I know you care about (gf). But she\u2019s mean to you and I don\u2019t like it, and it makes me angry when someone is mean to you because I love you and we are connected. I feel like our relationship and our fam isn\u2019t a priority for her at all. You don\u2019t have to say anything now; I just needed to express that. Please come to me if you need anything k?\u201d",
            "I went through an extremely similar experience. I had an abusive controlling ex/fiance from about the age of 15 until the age of 23. Engaged for 2 years. It was a long-distance relationship, but still she wouldn't let me see friends or family, she would literally keep a webcam on me day and night to make sure I was following her instructions, she would throw huge temper tantrums at the slightest imagined provocation.\n\nSome friends and family did try to intervene but I rejected them, partly because they never understood the real core reasons the relationship was destructive. They would point out irrelevant things like \"you can't trust people online\" or that she was older than me or that she had health problems, rather than talk about her abusive behavior.\n\nUltimately what got me out of it was a combination of things: 1. her demands became increasingly unreasonable (e.g. I said I wanted to bake cookies, she said I wasn't allowed); 2. I started to gradually rebel by doing things that were \"against the rules\" when she wasn't looking and not tell her; 3. while doing #2 I started to form healthy positive/supportive friendships with other people, and those relationships shone a light on how unhealthy my relationship with her was.\n\nI cannot say whether my process can be replicated. All I can tell you is: be a friend to him, listen to him, spend time with him, and don't be afraid to go behind his gf's back if he's willing (\"I won't tell her, I promise\"). Eventually you'll get to a point where he values his relationship with others enough that she can't keep him away from them and her attempts to do so will backfire spectacularly. Expressing concerns gently is fine, but if you do, make sure you target the most serious abuse rather than peripheral concerns that are not problems in and of themselves.",

Some people prefer to have a partner who tells them what to do, even if it's dysfunctional.\n\nHe's a grown adult.  She can't MAKE him do things.  If he goes along with her, it is his choice, (again, dysfunctional, but his choice.)\n\nI think the first step is to determine if HE wants things to be different.\n\nIf he does, but doesn't know how to change, then getting him support (like abuse support groups ) could be good.  Or helping him learn to stand up for himself (a therapist sounds good for him.)\n\nIf he feels happy, I think there isn't much you can do to convince him to make changes.\n\nIf he, as an adult, is choosing this, at some point it's not for you to control any more and you'll have to learn to work around her, or to distance yourself from them.",

            "So your brother the adult is making decisions with his life you don't agree with and you want to change that? He's an adult who has chosen to spend his life with a horrible person and you think there is something that can be said to magically open his eyes? You need to change all of the sentences that say \"she doesn't let him do X\". He is an adult and as such chooses what he does or doesn't do. Period. His GF says she doesn't want him to do X, and he then decides OK I'm not going to do X, she isn't physically restraining him. This isn't abuse, and if the roles were reversed it wouldn't be abuse then either. Adults make shitty decisions and are in relationships with shitty people. It sucks but your brother chose his GF over family and that isn't going to get any better, and most likely will get far worse.",

            "This is abuse. The only thing you can do is make it clear you don\u2019t think her behaviour is okay but stay as someone your brother can reach out to if/when he decides he can leave this relationship.",
            "Lots of good advice here.  But something I haven't seen: She seems the type who will purposefully get pregnant as a way to further control him and tie him to her forever.  Anything you can do to emphasize to him that he should be VERY careful with contraception, do it--you don't need to mention her, just see if you can casually bring up how hard it is to raise kids when you're younger, etc.  \n\n\nThere aren't hormonal birth-control options for men, sadly, but at the very least, for his own protection he absolutely cannot trust her to take care of contraception, even if she says she's on the pill, etc.  He needs to use condoms every time, buy his own condoms, use ONLY those condoms, and do not let her handle them out of his sight for even a moment, whether wrapped or unwrapped.  Be sure there are no oily substances anywhere near the condom (medical ointments, body lotion, oil-based lube, etc.), since oils can weaken latex, which can lead to breakage.  DO NOT TRUST HER WITH CONTRACEPTION!!  And finally--and this is gross and a longshot but this is a desperate situation so it's good to consider--it IS possible to save semen from a sexual encounter for a short time and impregnate yourself.  So...um...don't leave any semen lying around.",
            "When people get into relationships at a young age that don't fit, they tend to be stunted in personal growth until they're out of them. Your brother is not a drone, he clearly expressed not being ready to get married yet, so perhaps you could ask him if this is how he pictured his life would be at this point (few friends, cleaning as opposed to going out, etc). Somewhere in his head, he may be afraid of losing the stability of that relationship which could be keeping him willing to accept the abuse that comes with. \nIf he always responds in a way that says he's still super keen on her, you could always have the \"the right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing\" saying DEEP in your back pocket.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the relationship is fully as bad as you describe, attacking it from the outside can lead to (temporary maybe) resentment over circumstances that follow. It would be better for everyone if he decided for himself that it wasn't right.",
            "This sounds just like my brother and his gf of 10 years. She\u2019s also been violent towards him.  I hope your brother gets out. My brother is too attached via trauma bond to leave yet.",

            "I feel like they've been together for 7 years so something is not adding up. Either he's not being honest about how miserable he is to you or you're missing more information. I think the best is just to be there for him. Making her out to be the villian 100 percent seems not to be adding up to me. May family have the same habit of ascribing behaviour to the partner. Oh he wouldn't say that, it must her who texted back. I always tell them when people show you who they are believe them. At some point the other person knows what the partner has texted and they never comes back horrified and apologising. Keep things simple and don't try to figure out stuff that's right in front of you. Seven years is a long time. He'll leave when he's ready if that's what he wants.",
            "Your brother is in a very abusive relationship- separation from family and friends is usually the first step  in what any abuser does because if they feel isolated and alone then they (your brother) will listen and rely on the abuser more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis sounds silly but I would have him watch a video from JaidenAnimations \"Things about Relationships I wish someone told me about\", Ilymation's \"How I met my abusive Ex Boyfriend\" and maybe even Shgurr's \"My First Toxic Relationship\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRelationships are hard to break when you've put so much time into them but he is getting nothing in return with the one he is in. He is unhappy, he is losing his university experience, he is losing out on family moments that he will never get back, he is most likely losing friendships he once had and he is losing himself. Its going to suck but he needs to leave this relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would just be very supportive and say that its not too late to piece himself back together and that your family will take him in and make sure that he is safe. If he wants to leave now then your door is open. This needs to happen BEFORE he gets married and BEFORE anything gets put into her name. Maybe he needs to have a vacation away from his \"fiance\" and turn off his phone to realize how much happier he is without her. Just make sure you tell him that you will be there for him no matter what. Say it as much as you can and have everyone say it often. That way his fiance can't completely disconnect him.",
            "You should listen to a show called \nBlack Phillip on youtube and so should your brother!",
            "Essentially she's an abusive person and he's in an abusive relationship. Those are classic signs of emotional abuse. That makes it a harder situation because it sounds like separation from his family is what she wants and the more isolated and less connection he feels towards other relationships the less he will feel like he is ever able to get out of his relationship with her. So while normally I would say it's totally ok to stop being contact with her I do think it may be necessary for you to always extend yourself towards your brother so that when he hopefully see the situation he's in he doesn't feel ridiculed or stuck all together.",
            "She won't change and he needs to leave her. She's a narcissist. My best friends step mom is a narcissist and my friend has had to call the cops on her for being abusive towards her dad. Does he leave? No. He's not happy but he's too afraid to leave her now despite the fact that she kicked out his children and refuses to let him see his mother. These people don't change.",

This didn\u2019t have anything to do with you. \n\nIf your partner loves you, they want to make you happy. They don\u2019t have to try to prioritize your needs, they DO prioritize your needs. \n\nI do everything in my power to make sure my wife\u2019s needs are met. And in the event that she tells me that I\u2019m not giving her what she needs, I do whatever it takes to make it happen. She does the same for me. \n\nIf that\u2019s not what you\u2019re getting from your partner, be it this idiot or the next person, then move on.

The only thing to do with a cheating partner is drop him like a bad habit.  There are so many other men out there who will bend over backwards for their attention, it really makes no sense when aforementioned women decry, \"He's done it again! Why? He said it wouldn't happen again...\" \n\nForgiving cheating has but one consequence: the guarantee that it will happen again, because he \"got away with it once.\"\n\nGood on you, and I hope you find a likely nerd for your next boyfriend.

You went from two people with equity in the relationship, to a teacher and a student in which his needs were always met while you compromised to not cause issues . It\u2019s like to groomed him into a decent boyfriend and instead of understanding the dynamic like an adult , he took it for granted and didn\u2019t put any real effort in the relationship.

Even thought it was a long relationship, at least it ended now rather than say 10 years, marriage, and two kids later. Just take care of yourself op.

            "On a somewhat related note, OP. You should know that you didn't actually do anything wrong. It's perfectly fine to \"spoil\" your partner or whatever you called in your previous post. Being a giving personality is normal and perfectly fine, it's how many people express their love language. The critical factor is that you need a partner who has the maturity to *not* take advantage of your giving nature. This guy *did* take advantage of you, which is why he wasn't the right guy.\n\nThere are a lot of guys out there. You'll find one who appreciates your generosity in a romantic relationship and doesn't view it as weak and supplicating or as something to exploit.",
            "I'll never understand emotional cheating.  If he isn't satisfying needs you have, that's a legitimate complaint, but emotional cheating is not, nor ever will be,  a real thing.  Were that truly so, women and men would be emotionally cheating on their partners all the time.  The logic there is that people typically have many of their emotional needs met by their friends, things that for one reason or another they just don't get from their partner. It's not reasonable for one's partner to expect that all or even most of their emotional needs be met by them.  I have many of my needs met by my wife, but I other needs that are met by my closest friends, yet others by family, and finally some needs that are only met by a therapist I see.  It's a red flag for me when someone tells me their partner wants all or most of their emotional needs met by them, that's typically a sign of someone who is being very possessive, and unless the relationship is between two very possessive people, ultimately one of the two is going to start feeling trapped and controlled.  I'm glad that you broke it off with him, I don't think the relationship would have been healthy and fulfilling to either of you in any kind of truly long term situation, you're just naturally poison to each other.

        "selftext": "Throwaway cause my son follows account and is actually the one who set it up.\n\nBackground: I met my wife when I was studying overseas when I was 27. She was 25 at that time with a 2 year old daughter. She was, and to this day is, a damn good artist and a middle school art teacher. Her brother was my first friend overseas and still is one of my best friends and I met my wife when he invited me for Christmas dinner with his family. I have no idea what she saw in a broke college student in his late 20s but I thank my lucky stars she gave me a chance. Two years later we were married and a year after that, at 30, we had our son... Our second child. I adopted her daughter shortly after we were married and I love her to death. She's always been a daddy's girl and no matter what anyone says, she's mine. Despite the fact that she's very white and I'm as Asian as they come haha. \n\nI eventually graduated and landed a job as a financial analyst in a pretty big company. I busted my ass off at work and when I wasn't at work I was busy trading in the stock market. After a couple of years, good investments, and a lot of loans, I took a leap of faith and quit my job to start my own company. \n\nWhen my daughter was 14 and my son was 9, I started making seven figures a year from what I earned from the company and my several investments. I slowed down after that and cut my hours a bit, so I'd be more involved in my children's lives. \n\nSince my daughter was young, she's always shown interest in business. She'd spend her Saturdays with me in my company and wanted to learn all about it. I offered to take my son too but he wasn't interested and wanted to be an artist like his mother. \n\nNow I just want to clarify that I was very involved in both my children's lives. I make it a point to talk to both of them over dinner almost every night. One of my son's first portrait, which was of me and my wife, still hangs in my office at work. \n\nBecause of this, I've always groomed my daughter to be my successor. She's the one who always took interest in running my company one day and even studied in a prestigious business school. My son studied art in Italy. \n\nNow, I know every parent says this but my daughter is a genius when it comes to business. She works (or at least worked) in a big international company based in Europe before coming home last year to work with me in mine, where she has plans to scale it to even greater heights (it's still not a very big company). And this is where the problem starts. \n\nMy wife and I are about to retire (early, I know) to travel the world. She's never been into luxury items, unlike me, but she does love to travel. \n\nSo we sat our children down and announced that we were retiring early and that they'd be getting some of their inheritance soon (I wanted to sort out my estate very early to avoid problems for them when I'm gone). \n\nThe moment I said \"daughter will be taking my place in the company\" my son was livid. He started accusing me of favoritism, being a useless dad, and his sister of manipulating me into giving it to her and leaving him with nothing. My wife tried to calm him down but he stormed out, but not before yelling \"she's not even your real daughter anyway!\". \n\nI didn't know how to feel after that. It was a mix of pain, anger, regret, and a whole lot of other stuff. I was hurt by some of the things he said, angry about how he said his sister wasn't my daughter, and regret cause somehow I feel like I've failed him as a father. I wasn't even finished explaining how things would go. \n\nI hugged my daughter, who was crying, and reassured her that I loved her so much while my wife tried to get a hold of our son. \n\nI tried to be a good father to him. I paid for his international education, attended all his art events, and even introduced him to some of my friends that were into art. I made sure to take him on father-son trips too every couple of months. It never occurred to me that he was ever remotely jealous of his sister being my apprentice, despite the fact that I did try to take him with us when we went to work. \n\nAlso, I never planned on giving one child more than the other. My daughter was only taking over running the company, but the ownership would've been 55/45, so my son would still own part of the company. I own 3 condos in the city, 2 of which are occupied by my children (which they would keep) and the 3rd would've went to my son to make up for giving his sister more equity in the company. He would've also kept my watch collection, which I promised to him at a young age. Both kids would've got a substantial amount of money too. My current home would still be mine to rent out, and I'm keeping my stocks, so Id still have some money coming in to fund our travels. \n\nNow I don't know how to go on from here. I'm set to retire after this pandemic is sorted and its safe to travel. It's been a week and my son still won't answer his mother's call. I'm still mad about how he acted but I still want him to be part of our lives. My daughter even offered to give him everything if it would make him happy but I shut that down immediately. I worked hard for BOTH my children. \n\nHow do I proceed? Part of me wants to call but I know we'd just get into another screaming match cause the things he said still hurt me. That's if he even answers my call. I don't think I did anything wrong here, but if I did, please tell me so I can fix it. My wife is beside me right now and she's still trying to reach our son but no luck. \n\nAny advice would be helpful\n\nTL/DR: I told my kids my daughter would take my place in my business. Son was livid before hearing the whole story. He said a few hurtful things and now we're both mad at each other.\n\nEdit: I don't think this part was clear. My son never heard how I was going to split my assets and ownership of the company. He only heard the part where I said my daughter was taking my place before he went ballistic.\n\nEdit 2: My son doesn't fully rely on my money. He lives in my condo and I paid for his car but he makes his own money and his work sells. He's very passionate about art and is very good at it.",

            "Personally, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. It sounds like you were very thoughtful in your succession plan and it sounds very fair. If anything, it sounds somewhat skewed towards your son as your daughter would be putting all the work into the business and he would simply profit from her work.\n\nI think your son is behaving quite spoiled.\n\nIn your shoes, I would just send him a note to let him know that you weren\u2019t done explaining his things would be split and to let you know when he\u2019s ready to talk about it.\n\nYou actually don\u2019t owe either of your children any inheritance. Any penny you give them is very generous and kind - but your money is yours to spend as you wish.\n\nI think he is behaving in quite the entitled way, and IMO, I don\u2019t think you should play into it.",
            "You\u2019re intending to give him 45% of the company even though he won\u2019t have had experience running it? This seems like a recipe for disaster to me!\n\nIf he wants to get involved, give him a chance to show how.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019re still giving him an inheritance. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s being kicked out of the family. Logically, I am sure he can see this. \n\nThere\u2019s an emotional element here which you\u2019re not going to be able to remedy by giving him control of your company.\n\nI would urge you to work on this aspect of your relationship. Consider family therapy. He doesn\u2019t feel connected to you. He\u2019s an adult now and that\u2019s also his responsibility to work on... I am sure in the next few years he will start to see this.\n\nFWIW, I am in a similar position with my family\u2019s business. It was a disaster for me to work with my father and I ended up selling my share and pulling out. Our relationship is better now but I also feel passed over in a sense now that my sibling is the one still involved. In fact, a lot of our father-child relationship used to be based on discussing business together. We both respect that side of each other. Now that we don\u2019t work together any more, it felt like a loss to me. Like we didn\u2019t have anything to connect over. So I can understand that your son might feel left out.\n\nI\u2019ve had to come to terms with our relationship and understand that my father has his faults that he won\u2019t necessarily ever grow past. It\u2019s up to me to accept them.\n\nI can see where your son is coming from. My advice to you would be to work on connecting with him emotionally. I believe therapy could help a lot with that. \n\nI sure wish my father would have been so willing to analyse his behaviour, so a big congratulations to you for going that far.",
            "It sounds like you are working very hard to make things fair, but money and estates make people go crazy. It sounds like he has some long simmering resentment towards his sister. He may not have any real reason behind it, but it's there. My brother is the same way even though he was given more than me when we were growing up and continued to be supported by my parents into his thirties. I'm not sure you can do much except give him time to pull his head out of his ass. I have a feeling his response is deeply rooted in sexist attitudes towards women and a sense of entitlement.\n\nAlso, 55/45 split seems a little unfair to your daughter. She's going to be the one running and responsible for the business, but only has 10% more equity? I'm assuming there is going to be some kind of profit sharing, so he gets to profit from the business at pretty close to the same amount without putting in any work?\n\nI dunno, that seems a little unfair to her.",
            "Based on his behavior, I\u2019d be concerned that your son will immediately sell his share of the company if he gets that.  \n\nDon\u2019t forget that no child \u2018deserves\u2019 to inherit anything from their parents, especially when that parent created the wealth on their own.",
            "To be honest you still need to talk to him. If he doesn't want to listen that's on him. He jumped to all sorts of conclusions when you weren't even done with the discussion. Obviously it makes sense to leave your daughter more of the business as she will be the one running it and doing the day to day stuff. If he doesn't understand that, that's on him",
            "It sounds like your son is jealous of his sister. I know, duh... right?\n\nWhen you can, talk to him. \n\nFind out what he is upset about, what he wanted, what his expectations are.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about how you are splitting the inheritance, this is about your sons feelings. \n\nAsk him to be open and honest and listen. Things he will say will hurt, because you have doubt about how you have been treating your kids. That\u2019s typical. Every parent feels that.\n\nThis is more about letting him feel heard. This should be between you and him, not him and the family.\n\nHe probably feels like you like your daughter more because she likes the same things you do, while he only does art, and you don\u2019t really care about that.  It\u2019s his perception you have to understand.\n\nHe needs to know that you love his mom for being artistic. And you love him for the same reasons.",
            "A 25 year old man lashed out and threw a temper tantrum because he felt entitled to your life\u2019s work. \n\nHe\u2019s not owed anything. You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to give him anything. You\u2019re mostly giving *gifts* with the exception of the business. That\u2019s a big mess you\u2019re making.\n\nYou\u2019re not giving your daughter your business: you\u2019re giving her an opportunity that she\u2019s been working on for more than half her life. You\u2019re giving her a job. There\u2019s the value of the business now and the potential it has. Value your business, divide the value in half and give your son that value. To give  him 45% of the business going forward isn\u2019t fair to your daughter and will obligate her to spend the rest of her working life paying him for her hard work. That can\u2019t possibly be what you really want. If he created a painting and sold it, would you expect him to give her a percentage since you also paid for his schooling and experiences? No.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely annoyed at this man, who has his living expenses fronted by his father, throwing a hissy fit and creating drama because he\u2019s not being given enough free stuff you earned after a life time of being the benefactor of your efforts. I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and guess this isn\u2019t abnormal: your son is emotional, the family bends to his will and ultimately does whatever to make him happy? \n\nThe only person I see you\u2019ve possibly wronged in this is your daughter: please reconsider forcing her into a situation where she\u2019s obligated to report earnings and pay her brother as a part owner in the business. If you really don\u2019t feel he\u2019s part of the business, don\u2019t treat him or reward him as such.",
            "I think it would be a good idea to email him the whole set up of what you're planning to give each one of your children. Ask him to be truthful, is he prepared to actually run the company, everything it entails, not just getting the benefits.\n I think you should also include the hurt he caused to everyone with his outburst, about your daughter not really being yours. Be gentle but firm. \nAnd let him be. Don't try to call, wait until he contacts you.",
            "I'm sorry that you're going to watch your business go up in flames thanks to your son. At least you'll have time to work on all the documentation to insure that your daughter is set up running your business.

            "If anything his extremely juvenile and selfish reaction shows you made the right choice in not giving him additional responsibility. There's no rational basis for him to he surprised by your decision, why would you give him a business he's never shown any interest in and doesn't have the qualifications to run when you have a child who is the exact opposite of that?",
            "I'm gonna go in a different direction than the other comments.  This isn't about the money and it isn't about the business, it's about your relationship with your son. \n\nWhile you've mentioned that you do try to spend time with your family and you attend a few things of your son's when you can, children don't always get the messages we think we're sending.  You clearly care a lot about your business and are proud of it.  You talk about it in your post.  Your son probably got the message growing up that your business was the most important thing to you and that your daughter was more important because she already was at your side (the 5 year age gap makes a big difference at younger ages, to him there was no point in trying to compete with her, she was already there, hence why it appeared to you that he had no interest and gravitated to art).\n\nThis isn't about the money and the company to your son. The company is symbolic of your love and attention, and when you announced it was all going to your daughter (which is what he thought because you didn't explain the split thing), all his worst fears were realized, that you didn't really care about him and you didn't really love him and that he would always be the less important kid to you. \n\nYou have been a good father in many ways it sounds like, but it also sounds like you don't know your son as well as you thought you did.  It might be time to try to rebuild some bridges.\n\nFocus on your son and what he's really feeling, not talking about the money and company. Encourage him to be honest with you about how he feels, even if that means it's ugly.  You need to know what's going on in his head.  Trying to give him more of the company or explaining that you intended to give him almost half will make it sound like you're giving him a consolation prize because he's upset.  Your son needs you to talk father and son, not dollars and cents right now.",
            "It sounds like you spoiled your two kids quite a bit. Your daughter just handled it like a mature adult and didn't take what you gave her for granted. Your son sounds like he just milked off you his entire life and took advantage. If I were in your shoes, I'd be taking everything away from my son but leave him with a small sum of money. No share in the company, no more condos, nothing except some cash. He clearly didn't appreciate anything you have done for him up to this point while living a life full of unearned wealth and privilege.",
            "He is being a brat and acting entitled. He has never shown interest in the business. Your daughter has and has worked to hone and improve her skills for business. \n\nWhy would it make any sense that your son get ther business? He has shown no interest and put nothing into improving his business proficiency.\n\nMaybe his assumption is in the father giving his son based on being the only son. \n\nIt sounds like he is trying to guilt you when you have nothing to feel guilty about.",
            "Perhaps he's mad about her being groomed by you. He might've taken it as you showing her more interest in her than him.",
            "There are a lot of people calling your son spoiled... maybe that\u2019s part of it, though we don\u2019t really know because he didn\u2019t hear all of the conversation.\n\nBut I kind of wonder if this is about something different. Yes, it sounds like you\u2019re a great father and you\u2019ve been present in both of their lives and made an effort for both of them. However, given that your daughter has similar interests to you, it\u2019s probably been much easier for the two of you to connect. And while you support your son and are close to him, it sounds like he might be jealous of the connection that you and your daughter share. \n\nNo, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But I see where he might be hurt anyways, by just the way that it is. You definitely need to continue the conversation, and it might be best for you to spend some time with just the two of you to hash out everything. I think he needs to know how you thought of him and how he\u2019s not just getting \u201cwhat\u2019s leftover\u201d so you can fulfill his sister\u2019s dreams, but it\u2019s actually designed specifically with his dreams in mind as well.",
            "I just wanted to chime in, because a lot of people are saying your son is acting entitled, spoiled, etc. It sounds like you were pretty blindsided by this reaction and if everything you say is true in this post. I don't think the cause of this outburst was due to him being spoiled, but it did contribute to it.\n\nI think the main reason is he is just jealous of your daughter's relationship to you. It sounds like you and your daughter have very similar mindsets and are able to find like minded hobbies more easily. I am sure you love both of them equally, but it sounds like you enjoy spending time with your daughter more by default b/c you had a common passion for business. You talk about spending Saturdays with her to teach her about the business and offering the same to your son. But obviously your son denied it, since he had no passions in it.\n\nYou mention only going on father-son trips every couple of months. Were these trips to further his passions of art or where they just generic vacations places. Did you try to understand his passions or was introducing him to friends with an interest of art the closest you got to understanding? It's possible your son is upset of the intimacy you and your daughter was able to develop, while your relationship is more \"generic\". It sounds like you are a good father and I am sure you did more like maybe going to art galleries with him and displaying lots of his work prominently. But if you compared it to the amount effort and time you spent on your daughter's passions, it probably is much less.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if this has been simmering for a while and you making an official announcement about your daughter taking over was the final nail in the coffin to him that your favorite is your daughter. From what you say, it sounds like your son isn't upset because of the money. You made it fairly obvious that your daughter was always going to take over, so it shouldn't have been a surprise to him. Also, you are fairly wealthy, so if he was to get upset about money it would be during the division of assets, which you state you never even got to, which makes me believe he is more upset about favoritism.\n\nPersonally, I don't think you did anything wrong. You didn't \"play favorites\", but I can see how growing up in that environment could make it seem different. It sounds like this is a huge misunderstanding. I know a lot of artists are misunderstood and it's possible the people he is surrounding himself with is influencing his opinion on the situation. It sounds like he still has growing up to do.\n\nI would suggest reaching out to him and discussing why he feels unwanted. It might help if your wife reaches out to him first, since it seems like she has the closer relationship to him. But it might honestly take time and him maturing to understand where you guys are coming from. \n\nMy family had similar issues pop up. I have 2 sisters and the older one got along very well with my mom. They had similar hobbies and interests and my mom would frequently buy her gifts pertaining to those hobbies or surprise her with random trips to pursue it. The younger one would get jealous and always asked how much XX cost that older sister received and ask why we didn't get anything or go to fun places. My mom would invite us or offer to buy it for us, too, but we would deny due to lack of interest. She did take us on other trips or buy as gifts relating to our interests, but they were usually pretty generic like someone google'd our interests to see what to get us and the gifts/trips were much less frequent than older sister received. I think she realized from our reactions that we didn't enjoy it as much that she started giving us cash in order to buy things ourselves, which I can see how someone would see it is as uncaring. But honestly when our mom spent time with us related to our interests, it wasn't fun. You could tell you she didn't have a passion for it and any enthusiasm she showed was faked. As a young child it wasn't obvious, but the older we got the more obvious it was my mom wasn't having fun and was only doing it for us, so it was inevitable we drifted apart.\n\nI personally don't care now. I understood that it was inevitable that people with like minded interests and hobbies would obviously understand each other more and be better to buy gifts for or spend time with. It honestly hurt as a child, when Christmas and birthdays came around and the amount/quality of gifts was a stark difference. It wasn't because my mom loved us less, but only that she struggled understanding our interests. I realized that in high school and stopped being so hard on my mom. My younger sister did not though and she carried that resentment into her late 20's. I tried to explain the situation to her many times, but she just couldn't wrap her head around that not being treated equally didn't mean your parents loved you less. Parents are only human and they are bound to make mistakes and form bias even with their own children.\n\nI haven't talked to my younger sister about this topic in years, so I am not sure what her opinion on that matter is anymore. But I am sure if my mom was to discuss splitting her assets today, my younger sister would have a meltdown. She just hasn't fully come to terms with her childhood. Even if my mom was splitting her assets equally and gave older sister all her belongings related to common interests (which is a lot of items), my younger sister would be upset she wasn't getting my mom's \"prized possessions\" even though she would have no use for them besides sell it.",
            "Prior to your announcement, how much did your daughter and son know about your plans for the company?  I have to imagine your son could put the pieces together that she was involved in business and was already working for you.\n\nOn some level, this may be his guilt acting out that she followed in your footsteps and he ended up as an artist, which carries a stigma of someone who is not driven or ambitious, regardless of talent.  Your pronouncement that she was taking over, while logical, shines a bright light on the differences between your son and daughter.\n\nIf this were about money, I'm sure his 45% stake along with the other assets and cash you were planning to give him would set him up for life.  That's why I don't think this is about money.\n\nI have an older brother who is a hugely successful radiologist who went to med school on full scholarship, was chief resident of a major unviersity medical school and has two kids who went to Ivy League schools (or their equivalent).  I love my brother to death and there's never been any sort of rivalry -- but its impossible not to think I'm somehow a disappointment in comparison; and I'm a decently successful lawyer.\n\nTalk to your son.  Try to get him to open up about where this is coming from.  The worse thing you can do right now is let your anger or your perception of his spoilt behavior drive you two apart for good.\n\nIn the end, no amount of money is worth more than knowing your father is proud of you.",
            "He\u2019s seems entitled. You technically don\u2019t owe either child anything but raising and providing for them through adolescence, both of which it seems that you\u2019ve been very diligent with.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s the only child from a previous marriage, I had a step-dad who loved the platitude of \u201cI treat him as if he were my own!\u201d It really touches my heart that there are men like you out there who take that seriously, and that your daughter has such a thoughtful and considerate father. Thank you.\n\nThey\u2019re both incredibly lucky to have you, even if your son is taking it for granted at the moment. I hope it all works out.",

            "I see so many comments calling your son spoiled and entitled, but I honestly think this is about his perceived connection with you emotionally, and has almost nothing to do with the company at all.\n\nYour post waxes lyrical about your daughter, and although I'm sure you do love your son too, you speak about him in a different way.\nYour daughter's hard work and skill is very relatable for you, which has facilitated your strong relationship. Your son's skills and talents don't seem to be something that you can relate to personally, and perhaps your relationship has suffered because of this.\n\nI'm sure it's not for lack of trying on your part, but your son does seem to envy the connection between you and your daughter, even if ultimately he may not desire to connect with you over the business. He may wish to connect with you in a different way, unrelated to the business, and is frustrated that so far it hasn't been possible.\n\nYou clearly love your work, and are proud of what you have achieved. Additionally, your business has given you something to bond over with your daughter. To your son, the company therefore represents you and your daughter's strong shared interests, and the connection between you. It also serves to remind your son that your bond with him may not be as strong. To him, all other material things are secondary (art school, car, condo), as they don't represent such an important emotional relationship. \n\nThe company, to him, represents your love for your children. In your son's mind, your daughter has just received all of the \"love\".\n\nIt was obviously wrong of him to lash out, but perhaps this conversation was the final straw in what he sees as years of being passed over in favour of his sister. \n\nTL;DR The company is representative of the connection between father and daughter, and the son has lashed out as he envies their relationship. Nothing to do with money.",
            "I think what you said here needs to be said to him. He needs to know the reason you made your choice and that never in a million years based on what his interests have been would you think he had the feelings he did. But I also don\u2019t think he deserves the company over throwing a tantrum. Your true intent just has to be known and hopefully he comes to his senses. \n\nMaybe it is quite possible you describing your daughter as a daddies girl that you did make him feel like you took more time with her when she\u2019s not your biological daughter. That should not matter but the age apart from them is not so crazy different and could\u2019ve maybe had an impact he was afraid to say when he started understanding that. Anyway, I think you tried to do enough here but obviously someone doesn\u2019t feel heard or understood, and that\u2019s all you can try to make happen from this point forward.",

            "Sir your daughter is doing everything she can to be close to you. You don't know if business was her first love or if she took it up just to be close to you. I did that with my parents to be close to them. They don't even know that art was my passion, my everything but I gave it up to be close to them, so that I could account for something in front of them ( I know art is a good field and have no intention of offending anyone). While on the other hand your son is being an entitled arse. Please don't give in to his entitlement.Be firm with him, tell him about your previous plan but say that you are reconsidering it due to his behavior (even if you don't intend to but he needs to get on track). If he doesn't shape up you will be leaving your daughter in a very hard place trying to run the company with an actively harmful partner. (Hope get some restrictions that he can only sell his shares to her or something). Your son also needs to learn a life lesson or he will fail spectacularly in the future and you will not always be there to help him. I hope that in the end everything works out.",
            "Your son has no shame. Honestly, after this, I'd lower his stake and make him start paying for his own living expenses. You don't reward tantrums. Ever. The level of sexist bs entitlement from this kind is insane. He knows as much information about his life path and his sister's as you do. What planet do you have to be living on to think you'd be awarded control, being in his position. \n\nYou have gone above and beyond to give your kids everything. Sorry, I'm disgusted by your son. You've been beyond fair. In fact his stake in the company sounds way too high if he's not working there. Yes, he hasn't heard that yet but it doesn't excuse his behavior. \n\nThat inheritance mess you wanted to avoid is playing out in real time. Your son actually has the nerve to do this to your face.

            "It sounds like you are trying to be as fair as you can, and you make it sound as if this has always been the plan and your daughter taking over was a *fait accompli*.\n\nJust one question: Did you ever talk with both your kids about this and explicitly communicate this to your son?\n\nAs an S.O.B. (Son of a Boss), I was in a similar situation, but we already had expectations that were clearly articulated.  \n\nPeople are taking great delight in shitting on your son in this chat, calling him spoiled, but while you make it sound like everyone knew you were grooming your daughter, maybe everyone knew but him, and he may have felt blindsided and just reacted badly.",
            "I am dealing with this from a bit of an outside perspective right now. My partner has put in the majority of funds to move his parents into a condo for retirement,  while he takes on the house with the remaining mortgage. Once all the math is done, he does get a gift of equity in the deal through the house being move to his name. But he is still taking on about 50% of a full mortgage in a large city and paid for a condo. He requested his parents take him out of the will so his siblings would have about the same in their inheritance. They would get the condo and any liquid assets, my partner would get nothing upon their passing. But his brother is angry, making comments about the house and how it is unfair. This brother never showed interest in homeownership, never saved any money, and never spoke to his parents when this was all going down. My partner has always wanted a home, saved every penny, and talked to his parents about their plans to down size when the time was right. \n\nThings will always be unfair when seen through the lens of a lifetime of history. People have biases and when it comes to technicalities, our minds will favor emotion. He probably sees this as being not included or that he is not part of the 'business' club in the family. It probably is not much to do with money, but how he views your relationship, and your relationship with your daughter. Getting him on the phone will be hard, he is probably scared to confirm what he is thinking, which is that he was not 'business' enough. Or just not enough in general. Keep pressing with love and hopefully he comes around.",
            "I wonder if some of it is insecurity that he isn't in as good at business.  He knows it, but this confirms it.  He doesn't want to run the company, he wants to be able to.  It doesn't make it any better, but it might change the tone of the conversation you have with him.  I've been in situations like this before, not wanting someone to have something, and it was because I was insecure that I wasn't as good as them.",
            "People are commenting on this specific situation, but I think this runs much deeper for your son for him to react like that. Did you feel any sort of resentment toward your \"favoritism\" before this? If you think real hard? I guess it's possible that he just has an entitlement problem, but I have a feeling this made some deep feelings bubble up for him",
            "I have no advice.\n\nBut I'll just say, there was literally zero point in creating a throwaway. You gave us so much detail that it's not possible for your son to see this and not know it's about him.",
            "I don't think he actually cares about owning the business. He may have just been hurt that symbolically you have chosen to hand down your business to her and not him. Feelings cloud judgement, he probably felt that you favour her over himself. Also, if you have more in common with your daughter over your son this might have also played into his feelings of inadequacy.",
            "I think that maybe he's always felt a little less than his sister just because of the circumstances, not because any one did anything wrong and as soon as he heard that first sentence all his fears (and maybe insecurities) jumped the gun he lashed out.. It's even possible he's more  embarrassed now than mad",
            "It sounds like your son had a skewed view of the family dynamic and jumped the gun at the first thing you said that didn\u2019t go his way (although it does sound a bit bad when you say you\u2019re giving your company to your daughter, even though he would\u2019ve had quite a big share in it). I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve calmed down if he heard the whole thing. Maybe send him an e-mail with full clarification, that way you can have your peace with your good intentions towards his future, but don\u2019t expect him to reply or call right away. You can\u2019t control someone else\u2019s actions.",
            "My initial reaction was your son is entitled and probably spoilt. Then I had some time to think about it, and thought about my younger sister. \n\n(This is a long post where I try to explain why this happened to us and why it may have happened to you, if you cba slip to the last 2 paragraph then skim the others for brief context. I'm on my phone and too tired to edit).\n\nShe used to get angry and throw tantrums, but they came from a place where she was convinced she wasn't the favourite child and had to work harder to get attention and praise. For ages, I never understood where this came from as she had all these amazing qualities which in my eyes made her better than me and which meant my dad did like her for them. \n\nI was more introverted like my dad, so we could be talkative but we could be alone too. However as it was all girls for a while, he used to ask me to help with the car and diy projects. I never saw it as a big deal, and it didn't suit my sister as she couldn't sit still long enough for it. Which wasn't an issue. \n\nNow, I know what my dad loves about my sister because I have the same thing. She's a complete extrovert and has no issues with being very open and bubbly at all times, it's effortless for her and funnily enough I think her problems with not feeling like she was favoured or had enough attention manifested as someone who is a social butterfly but gets people to want to get together. \n\nBut when we were younger she never voiced any complaints to me, but she did go through a phase where she would get angry and accuse everyone of favouritism and how mum and dad had favourites and she wasn't anyone's. Because we all had things we did with our parents. But with her, everything she did would become social and she'd involve everyone. So in her mind, dad loved me more and mum loved our other sister more. \n\nShe said it to me as we got older, I don't feel like dad loves me as much or mum does. Because dad would do projects with me, and mum would always tell her what not to do or watch out for because people took advantage of her and she hadn't developed the sense to see it. \n\nIn terms of favourites, even though we all love each other a lot. I'm pretty sure if we had to pick she'd win, not in an obvious way but it's what would happen. Despite this, she spent a lot of time thinking she was inferior or not as loved. Just because of circumstances and choice. \n\nI think that's what's happened here, the only issue is he might resent his sister because it seems like you love her more. Because you spent more time together and seem to have a meaningful relationship and bond more. And when you guys are talking about things you'll have inside jokes or things he won't get because he's not involved in the business.\n\nSo for him, the beginning of the conversation means that he was right. You don't love him as much, and he's not enough. And yes it's hurtful what he said to his sister, which is wrong, but to him it's a he doesn't love me as much and I'm his biological child. \n\nI think you're going to have to reach out to him, that means going over to see him. And tell him you've realised that inadvertently you've made him feel like this, but it's not true and why you made these choices. Why when you reflect back on things, you realise he may have got the impression you love her more. And please consider therapy together if you have to, do it online if you're going to travel. You don't want unresolved feelings.",
            "I am going to come at this differently from the other comments, though of course he may be a spoiled nightmare.\n\nMy mother has always preferred my brother, she thinks it isn't obvious, but it is. He is more similar to her and shares her interests. I am a grown ass woman now and it still hurts sometimes and I do my best to be mature about it. \n\nIf my mother had made the same announcement that you did then rationally I may have understood, but we do not always default to mature rationality when we are hurt. If your son has always felt insecure about this, it may have just pulled a trigger on a lifelong feeling of inadequacy. This can also be the case very often in families with half siblings, there is quite often an underlying feeling of competition and in his eyes, he just lost. \n\nHOWEVER, I am not in any way saying the way he responded was acceptable, particularly his final remark, but I have also said something mean once during a row that I would have given anything to take back. Only you know if this is out of character for him or if this is the latest example of a long history of entitlement. \n\nYou clearly love your son, so as satisfying as it may be to go with the advice of cutting him off or telling him to grow up, I think it may be better to write him a letter. You can obviously explain the split, but more than that, tell him of the things you are proud of - such as how much you admire his art, as you said above. It doesn't mean you forgive him, but it opens that door on a possible reconciliation, especially between him and his sister. \n\nThis is getting longer than Ulysses now, but I just wanted to give a different perspective.",

            "I just wanted to throw in my 2 cents:\n\n> It never occurred to me that he was ever remotely jealous of his sister being my apprentice, despite the fact that I did try to take him with us when we went to work.\n\nPeople are being pretty hard on your son, but there may be some underlying issues here that you weren't aware of and need to work out. If he was younger, it might've worked out that he naturally felt left behind, rather than totally \"wanting\" to be steered towards art. \n\nThat sort of issue absolutely can bubble up this sort of way. It's not necessarily about money, but you said it yourself- you groomed her to be your successor.\n\n>I worked hard for BOTH my children.\n\nKnowing you're not the \"favorite\" kid (or at least thinking that), can really fuck someone up.\n\n\nIt's obviously hard to say if this is the case, but i wanted to highlight it because it's really easy to come down hard on your son here.\n\n> I've always admired his dedication to his art and I thought he'd be happy to just have shares in the company to fall back on while he followed his passion. \n\nI think you might be seeing it from a money perspective (in which you were generous), whereas he's seeing it from a family/bonds perspective, which was not necessarily.\n\nThere's no way to know for sure, but it's not uncommon for parents to treat both kids identically (money wise), but it's pretty obvious they see themselves more in one, or bond closer etc. And it causes this type of dynamic.\n\n> I was there for a lot of his art events and even visited him in Italy several times.\n\nWhile this is good support, it might not measure up to spending every Saturday together. You know? Compared to that, that might feel more like a \"courtesy because you're family\" thing.",
            "I'm going to get hate for this but I can actually understand his son's perspective. He only heard the words: she's going to be my successor and reacted to it. Badly.\n\nWhat likely went on in his mind: she's going to get everything because my father liked her more than his own son. Questions of sucession and who is going to get what, make people behave like monsters because it can really feel like the ultimate evidence for who was liked best by their parents and so it can wound people deeply. Doesnt matter how logical the choice was. \n\nPeople here also say things like, he was handed a fun degree and gets to play with paint while his father pays for everything. That is not true: OP has stated that his son is financially independent and being an artist who is financially successful, is hard work. He is obviously passionate about it but that doesnt exclude it from being a career where you have to work hard. About OPs daughter: OPs daughter was also allowed to follow her passion. Her passion happened to be business, the same as her fathers: OP stated that she had the mind and talent for it. It certainly is hard work but it isn't clear if she worked harder than her brother did in his career. OP also paid for her housing and was a foot in the door for her career.\n\nPerhaps, his son would have reacted better if OP had started with that his assets would be evenly split instead of saying that his daughter was his successor. It's not a dig at OP: the term successor has a loaded feeling which can easily be interpreted as \"winner takes all\".\n\nI would advise OP to wait until the feelings have cooled off and try explaining things when everyone is in a better mood.",
            "I think he feels like you give your daughter everything and him nothing. He feels unfairly treated.\n\nIt's probably the way it was brought, and he got too upset over it (He probably was afraid this would happen and when his fears got reality, he didnt had the time to hear about the rest). Seems like a communication mistake to me.\n\nTake my advice and write to him what you wrote to us. Either by email or letter. Something he would surely read. So he can see how things are devided and how you feel about this issue.  He probably feels insecure and not important enough for getting your place in the company, but you should tell him you want him to persue his artist carreer. That you want him happy. That your daughter (she is your real daughter, whether he likes it or not) isway more interested in business than he is, and she would be happy leading a company while he can contine being the artist he wants to be. He is not cut out, you are making sure he makes something of life that he wants to make of it :)",
            "Your son is an entitled piece of shit. Fuck him. Let him sulk by himself. You don't owe anyone your money, your business, or anything else. You should cut him out of the estate entirely, so he can learn to work and earn what he has. You've already given him a massive head start, he doesn't need more from you. That would be the best lesson you could ever teach him, since you failed to do so while raising him.",
            "So, from your son's perspective, you've taken the company that you've sweated blood for years over and handed it to your daughter instead of him. Of course that's going to hurt. I don't think it has anything to do with the 45-55 split or the fact that he doesn't have the knowledge to run a business, but he probably believed that you're favouring your daughter over him when really, you need to make sure that he believes in your eyes, both he and your daughter are equal in the family. See, if you started an art gallery that you spent years and years building up and then made your son the director, I bet he wouldn't care if his sister owned 45% of it while he worked his rear off to keep it running. It'd be the fact that you gave your life's work to *him* to manage - it's like telling him that you favour him (with your daughter's business acumen making her pragmatic enough to understand why you did it). That creative nature of your son's probably leads him to come to more impulsive conclusions about certain situations. I wonder if it would have gone down better with your son if you had given your daughter 51% controlling share but hired a stranger to be the CEO and run it (at least until she would have been promoted via merit and not because she's your daughter). I wouldn't place too much stock in the hurtful things he said. That too was probably an impulsive act and he only said it because he knew it would hurt the most. He was lashing out. Hopefully, he'll talk to some people and find out that he's not worse off, at least financially, and give you an opportunity to talk to him about it in the future. Until then, cooler heads prevail (etc).",

And this is coming from a man.\n\nMy only advice is that if he admits he's genuinely interested in business (and not just being 'the boss' for ego's sake), tell him to show some interest in the business, get an MBA or other similar qualification, and then he has a real shot at an executive role working with his sister on the family business.

You have already given your all to your children, and as bad as it sounds, you owe nothing money-wise to each other, so neither parent nor child should expect large sums of money off each other.

You've done nothing wrong, and I'd recommend not giving any leeway for your sons actions.\n\nWhat I would do however, is try and contact someone close to your son. If it's been a week, then he should have at least sent some kind of message, but as he hasn't I'd make sure he is at least safe and not doing anything that could endanger his or someone else's life.

Potentially he feels like his worth should be more because he\u2019s the child of both of you, and this has made him feel small.",

Don\u2019t give him any control.\n\nHowever, to make it fair, you can request your daughter to hire your son as an employee with her rights to fire him anytime she wants to.",
            "There's something missing....do your son and daughter get along very well? It could stem from that too. I mean, to go as far as to say \"she's not your real daughter anyway!\" is way too much, imo. Because it totally makes sense for your daughter to inherit the business: she's shown interest from a very young age. Your son is an artist....unless your business has something to do with art, I don't know why he would get so upset. \n\nDon't beat yourself up too hard, Dad! It sounds like you really tried to connect with him and be involved. Some parents don't even support art, says it's a waste of time. I'm sure both kids are amazingly lucky to have you.",

He has made it very clear at a young age through his own actions, he had no interest in your business and knows your sister does. You in fact did all you could to cater to both their interests fully supporting them in what they are passionate about, his was Art, Your daughter's was business.\n\n Unless he is incredibly obtuse or simply in some warped sense of denial, he had to know, he would not be taking over the business, especially after passionately pursuing his art career, while again expressing he wanted nothing to do with your company.  I mean seriously what did he think would happen?? How can he justify feeling entitled to something he made clear he never wanted any part of. That he went so far to say his half sister, your daughter was not really your daughter, was beyond wretched.  \n\nI do not fault you at all for wanting to reach out, and work this all out amicably, He is your son. Perhaps as others have suggested, writing a letter, if he continues to to ignore your attempts to contact him. Explain there was far more to what you wished to share, before he ran out. Be firm though, DO NOT ACT like you are guilty of anything, YOU ARE NOT. If his attitude does not change, you need to make sure you put in place safe guards that will prevent him from giving you or your daughter trouble in the future.  I truly hope it does not ever come to that.  My heart goes out to you. Please keep up posted.",

If any of my siblings were to act the way yours did they would immediately be dropped from the will. \n\nMy advice; try to set up a dinner or lunch someplace public to make it easier to keep emotions in check. Try and talk to him about all this. If he won't meet you or is still angry after you explain, I think you should drop him from your inheritance. At least until he sincerely apologises to you, your wife, and your daughter. \n\nYou are being incredibly generous. He needs to realize how good he has it and how kind you've been.",

Also, I think it's time for you to sit down and have some deep conversation with him. there may have been things that your son think is favouritism but never expressed before this happened. From your part of the story, it does make it sound like your son is being entitled. However, we don't know his perspective so having a long talk with him and straighten out some curves. Listen to each side of the story. Also, talk with your daughter. She was just told in the face that she's not a real daughter by someone she always considered as a brother.",

I did not get pissed at such a low amount of money or hate him for it. If I got zero dollars, I'd be grateful for the years I had with him. \n\n\n\nMy mother remarried and if something were to happen to her, I'd get maybe 30k inheritance? Again, that's a lot less than my mortgage. \n\n\nI would not blink if I don't get any money and it all goes to my stepfather's kids who are making poor decisions economically and are not nearly as set up in life as my brothers and I are.  My step father is having a hard time cutting the umbilical cord and it is stopping them from becoming adults. My step brother spent his rent on weed and then asked for help with rent. I can't imagine that'll ever change and it's a sore spot in my mom's  marriage. \n\n\nYour son is getting so much more and he still has his father. \n\n\nSorry, but your son is a selfish ass who doesn't deserve any thing with his actions. You are gifting this to him through grace and love. Your son probably thought he was rich when really he was just the son of a rich man. Now he will have to stand on his own and that probably scares him.  You don't earn an inheritance. It's a beautiful gift from a parent who didn't spend it on themselves when they were alive to make their kids life easier. \n\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go dust off the portrait I have of my father in my living room of the house he helped me learn how to work and pay for.",

To avoid a literal screaming match, just shoot him a message, text or email, saying when you are ready to discuss it calmly I will explain to you what my plan was to divide the equity of the company as well as my assets between what I believed to be evenly and then discuss your feelings on it. Then have the convo, just you and kid and wife. Leave other kid out for now to spare her feelings further. Then have a whole family convo later.",
            "Cynically, he sees his money and support disappearing, and panicked. \n\n\nI would wonder if his art career is successful. Many artists struggle, and he may be scared of being broke and a barista. \n\nI would bet there's some gnarly jealousy etc involved too. Adoption vs natural born.\n\nFrom a plain analysis of inheritance, I'd guess a trust fund with a check is a better deal for him than minority control a company he's not adept at.

He\u2019s very immature if he doesn\u2019t see that. I have to say I\u2019m quite envious of the opportunity you\u2019ve afforded your daughter.

If he tried the \u201cyou never tried to teach me\u201d, I would counter by asking him when he himself expressed interest? Your daughter expressed interest and proactively and consistently approached you about your company. What did he do? \n\nI feel sorry for you. I have a short fuse and have worked hard for the things I have. If I had a kid who spoke like that to me, they would have lost almost all of the inheritance. \n\nDo you want your legacy to continue with your daughter, or to end with your son? You know he can\u2019t match her. Why are you ignoring your inner businessman? Would you invest in the company if your son inherited it, and you weren\u2019t related? Would you feel like it\u2019s a safer investment if your daughter got it? \n\nEven giving him 45 while she runs it is extremely generous from your side. She is taking all the risk and responsibility, but half the profits go to him for doing nothing. Your daughter is an angel if she didn\u2019t think this.",
            "\"Son,\n\nI'm very disappointed in your reaction to our talk the other day.

If anything, it's a little biased in your favor, but if you intend to end the relationship here and now I suppose I'm going to have to rethink that.\n\nYou owe several apologies. To me and your mother, of course, but the biggest one to your sister. What you said about her was hateful and absolutely unacceptable. You are better than this.\n\nI have loved you and supported you in your dreams your entire life, to this very day. I don't understand why you think that would suddenly end. And I don't understand why you suddenly want to coopt your sister's dream, after showing no interest in it your entire life. I have put a lot of thought into what I can do to make you both happy, and I think you'll agree with me if you sit down and listen to my ideas.\n\nLet me know when you're ready.\n\nDad\"\n\nNTA.

You and your wife need to sit down with your son and talk him through the details. Give him advice on how the inheritance he is getting could help him start his art career and provide security. He\u2019s probably just not able to see the full picture. \n\nAll that said, I think you should try to split whatever assets as evenly as possible. If she\u2019s getting the business, he should get more in the way of cash/properties/etc. obviously neither is entitled to anything, that\u2019s just how I would do it",
            "Altough your son acted like a spoiled 5 year old, the only solution would be to talk. He should first of all apologize for his words. No amount of money justifies saying these horrible things. BUT still, keep in mind (as he should too) no matter what, ending a conversation with such an argument could be the last words you've exchanged with each other. It's not worth arguinig, you never know if someone wakes up the next day and how much time you've left. YOU HAVE TO TALK.",

He would probably hate the job and might not keep the company running well.\n\nIf my dad said hey here\u2019s a bunch of stock and you don\u2019t have to put in any effort? Hell yea, I\u2019d be all for that. \n\nNo idea why he went ballistic,\nprobably just had plans in his head for how it would all go or something.\n\nHopefully he\u2019ll calm down and realize it\u2019s for the best.\n\nI\u2019m not with the other people who are upset he\u2019s spoiled and shouldn\u2019t get much or any of that.

He's only 25yrs old and it sounds like he might be a little spoiled.  It'll take a bit but he'll cool down and a reasonable conversation can be had.  The first conversation after the fact will probably end the same as the one you wrote about above. Be ready for that.  It'll take a few tries to reconcile.  But I have faith that you can.  \n\n  Give it a few weeks, and what ever you do  do NOT apologize to him for your decision.  This will NOT play in your favor.  Wait for him to come to you with an apology.  Of which you are entitled to.  You are in the right and he is in the wrong.  This is YOUR legacy not his.

But something about him passing brought up old sibling jealousy feelings. That was years ago and I am well beyond those moments now.

Some people don't even have a place to sleep in, some people never studied abroad , their parents could never give them a car but their are still grateful because their parents gave them what to eat and a place to sleep.You spoiled him too much and I would seek advice on how to deal with cases like that. He needs to learn how to be grateful and humble but that's not easy to teach a grown man. I am younger than him and this is so embarrassing for him honestly. If I were you I wouldn't give him anything anymore . You build this company you own him nothing. You did everything a father could do, he is an adult if he wants a company let him make his own company and offer advice about how he can start one, as a parent that's what you can do. Parents are not banks. Also In my perception he just wants money and doesn't care about the business, with that attitude, if you give him the company your business will fail for sure and go bankrupt. \n\nAlso it makes no sense for him to keep the company , he never showed interest and doesn't know how to administrate one, meanwhile your daughter quit her job to do this and have always showed interest. If you keep giving him what he wants he will never learn and continue to act the same and be like this in future occasions , he will never grow up. Living as an artists while you have your parents support is easy lol, you should've let him struggle a bit so that he can value you guys and what you give him.",
            "You didnt do anything wrong here. Your daughter had an interest in business and is qualified for it. Your son is reasonably angry because he feels slighted, which is actually to be expected. \n\nJust keep doing what you're doing. You sound like a great dad, and your son will soon realize this is best for him too.\n\nI will say though - I have an older half brother who is supposedly getting access to my mother's will (over me and 2 of my siblings). We barely know him and he seems really manipulative towards my mom (seems just interested in her money, she gives him access because she feels guilty for leaving his dad). Sometimes, the \"resentment\" is your kids knowing you're being manipulated. Sometimes, it's just envy. It sounds like your son is just sad and jealous.",
            "Yeah your son is 1000% in the wrong. If he showed no interest in business and she did, then her being your successor is perfectly logical. It\u2019s like if a person says they don\u2019t like going out to the movies or parties but flip out when they find out they didn\u2019t get invited to go. Your son needs to get a grip and get some perspective, he\u2019s 25. He didn\u2019t even let you talk about the asset division.",
            "Sounds like your son is a pretty spoiled... but i bet he's had a lifetime of feeling less loved than his sister.",
            "It sounds like he was already planning a life based on getting all the money.",
            "When I first saw the title I thought you didn't give your son any equity in the company but hes whining when you gave him 45%. The only thing you've done wrong is not raised him to be grateful. You seem like an exemplary parent and it seems like your son has some growing up to do. Personally I'd take away all of his equity out of the company and give it to your daughter.",
            "Given his maturity issues, I would also structure the will so that he doesn't see any huge chunks of money until he is 55-60, (and even then maybe save one chunk for 70-75). One, to make sure he has something in his old age, and two, to help protect against him partying himself to death.",
            ">Since my daughter was young, she's always shown interest in business. She'd spend her Saturdays with me in my company and wanted to learn all about it. I offered to take my son too but he wasn't interested and wanted to be an artist like his mother. \n\nThis is the reason why your daughter is getting the company.\n\n>I tried to be a good father to him. I paid for his international education, attended all his art events, and even introduced him to some of my friends that were into art. I made sure to take him on father-son trips too every couple of months. It never occurred to me that he was ever remotely jealous of his sister being my apprentice, despite the fact that I did try to take him with us when we went to work. \n\nYour son is as ungrateful. That's really just about it. I am a son myself and my dad never did this for me but I will always treasure him because he put food on the table and gave me a roof over my head. You have outdone most fathers.\n\n>Also, I never planned on giving one child more than the other. My daughter was only taking over running the company, but the ownership would've been 55/45, so my son would still own part of the company. I own 3 condos in the city, 2 of which are occupied by my children (which they would keep) and the 3rd would've went to my son to make up for giving his sister more equity in the company. He would've also kept my watch collection, which I promised to him at a young age. Both kids would've got a substantial amount of money too \n\nFair inheritance here but after your son's behavior, I don't think he's in any position to receive anything. His attitude before he even gets his inheritance is so absurd like you owe it to him. My parents have inheritance for me too but they don't owe me anything and I live my life as if I had no inheritance. I told them this clearly. \n\nYou son never gave a fuck about the business but the moment its up for grabs, he's there to collect. Your daughter has been devoting herself into it and she's only getting 55% of it. If anyone should be livid its your daughter. That's useless son of yours gets 45% doing nothing.\n\nI don't mean to call your son out man, its just pains me to see a son behaving this way. Reminds me of my uncle who was entitled to everything my grandfather had and ripped everything from him until his death.",
            "Best question to ask a child when they\u2019re hurt \u201cWhat is it that you need from me (us)?\u201d You\u2019ll be surprised how many don\u2019t even know the answer...but it\u2019ll make em think. (Advice from a family therapist)",
            "I dunno, don't think about it. Just hand it over. But don't give it to Eric!",
            ">He lives in my condo and I paid for his car but he makes his own money and his work sells.\n\nDoes he sell enough \"art\" to pay rent on his own?\n\n>My son doesn't fully rely on my money.\n\nJust enough to live comfortably with no worries of ever being broke.",
            "You didn't do anything wrong in this particular situation. But from your post, it is very obvious that something went wrong somewhere with your son when he was growing up, because he is being a selfish, nasty, spoilt brat. If I were in your shoes in this situation, and then your son flipped his shit on me that way, I'd be telling him in no uncertain terms that he could either behave himself, act like an adult, calm the fuck down, apologise to you, and his poor sister, and make amends before I would be speaking to him at all again or giving him one more penny of my money for any reason at all. He needs a serious \"come to Jesus\" teaching moment here because his behaviour is unbelievably out of line. For now I'd be showing him the door; what he said to your daughter is something I am not sure I could ever come back from. She is likely to be VERY badly hurt by it. And considering how vindictive your son sounds like he might be, I would at this point get the will rewritten so that he inherits no percentage of the company. Your son could make your daughter's life hell if he's got a 45% share, and someone as self-entitled as he is cannot be trusted to respect her. He sure as fuck doesn't respect her as it is.",
            "It sounds like you tried to be very fair.\n\nMaybe setting up an irrevocable trust for your son that will guarantee him capital when he's older would satisfy him.\n\nMaybe a modest perctentage of net sales from the business.\n\nIt's not your fault he wants to be an artist.",
            "Have you tried to call him and talk to him, or better still go and talk to him face to face? You mentioned that he's not taking your wife's calls. Maybe he's waiting for yours. If it's your love that he needs validated then maybe he'll calm down when he hears from you?\nBut overall it looks like you were being fair to both kids. Doesn't sound like you did anything wrong. Best of luck with your son!! Hope everything works out soon.",
            "As a third generation small business owner.  My grandpa did what you are doing.  The person growing the business gets a salary and a share in the profits along with siblings.  This lead to some striff with family becuase it can seem that you are busting your butt for your siblings to profit.  After 15 or so years my grandpa sold the business to my dad and the other to my uncle to avoid any other issues and the other siblings got a portion of the proceeds.\n\nMy dad sold me the business after 4 years of just working for him.  I pay him and all siblings understand some of that money will be available for inheritance.\n\nPerhaps it was different for us becuase we were raised the business would be available to purchase by one of us.  In the end I'm the only one that took the call.\n\nI think you are doing your daughter a disservice by not allowing her to purchase 100% of the business.  Owner financed is super easy and we have an escrow company to which handles the payments and payouts.\n\nYour son chose his path.  Let him follow it.  Offer a loan for a business startup of his own.  Something he can be passionate about.\n\nSit them both down together and go over your estate plan.  If you don't have a lawyer as the executor offer your son a chance at that.\n\nThese big money issues can divide families.  I hope it doesn't divide yours.",
            "I think you should give control of the company to employees, like Publix.",
            "You definitely didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He should be grateful that he even has the chance to inherit any money (many people end up inheriting their parents\u2019 debt instead). I would maybe reach out to him in an attempt to understand why he reacted that way, as he seems to believe you favor your daughter. Mentioning that you weren\u2019t done discussing the inheritance may be a way to at least get him to talk to you, but I wouldn\u2019t discuss it until he understands that you don\u2019t owe him anything.",
            "Your son has failed to launch (watch the movie) and is behaving like an entitled brat. Your daughter paid her dues and should be your rightful successor. But how to handle your son? I believe he has made it clear that he is going to despise you no matter what you do. The safest approach is to take his 45% interest in the company and put it into a non-voting trust fund until he reaches an age of maturity where you believe he can be trusted to act responsibly. You should retain all voting rights or give them to you daughter. My fear is he would gladly destroy the company just to make a point of how unfairly he believes you treated him.",
            "If your son is in your quarantine bubble, I would go to his house and try to talk to him. \n\nHe acted really spoiled, but I do wonder if there is more going on here. You say that when they were younger, your daughter took an interest in business and your son didn't. I also noticed that he is five years younger than your daughter. I do wonder if he couldn't/ didn't want to engage as much when he was younger, but grew to wish he could, but the dynamic was already set. Like, if you asked them both to come along and learn, if your daughter was say 18 at the time, your son would have been 13, and maybe not interested. But maybe by the time he was 18 he would have liked to have joined, but felt he had missed his chance; you never offered again as you already had your protege. If something like this was the case, I can see how his sadness about not doing that might grow and then explode like this. So, he was very rude and hurtful but it might have been coming from a place of jealousy or pain, especially if he felt growing up like you and your daughter had a closer or better relationship than you and him did. It might be about that rather than the business thing; I've read a few experiences on reddit and advice columns from people who were not the \"favourite child\" growing up, and how much it hurt them. To be honest, the way you describe your relationships with them it does sound like you love and appreciate your daughter more, and maybe did as a child too. Kids notice this stuff, even if you don't. \n\nThis is just a guess and it could be way off. What he said to his sister was unjustifiable, but his anger or hurt at the situation might be something that goes further back, that you have overlooked. I have interpreted his actions in a generous way; it's not necessarily accurate but it is one possibility.",
            "Sounds to me like you made the right decision.  He\u2019s a hothead and probably will not make great business decisions.  She clearly will lead the company to great success.\n\nHowever, the genetic lineage seems to be of great importance to your son and if you want to maintain some semblance of a decent relationship with him, it would probably be best to split the company up into two competitors as equally as possible and allow him to lead himself into failure.  That or give him equivalent monetary value to what she receives and make them aware that it is equal.",
            "Your son need a reality check. You cant disown him but i would give him something completely different. Nothing related to the company. After all this is no that he wanted for his life. Why is he throwing a tantrum now? He expect to be a responsible adult with that petty mindset?\n\nI grew up without a father. This is so stupid and childish. You should be more important to him than some inheritance.",
            "If this was me after his outburst I would give my daughter 100% of the company under the stipulation that he gets a set salary plus if she ever sells it she has to pay him 45% of the value of the company at the time she was given it so he still gets what he would have got anyway but he doesn\u2019t get to profit from her hard work if the company grows.",
            "Oh, I meant that my step-dad wasn\u2019t the best at treating me like my siblings. I\u2019m saying as someone who knows the difference, you\u2019re a good father. Just the fact that you recognize her talents and passions, and feel comfortable leaving your professional legacy in her hands speaks volumes.\n\nAnyway, on a more positive note, enjoy your travels!",
            "Sounds like your son is acting like a spoilt brat.  Overall it sounds like you well throughout the succession plan and how it would be dealt with.  sounds like in some respects your son needs to grow up and learn humility.  \n\nJust based on the facts you have laid out the sensible choice was for your daughter to take over she has the business background and education, and experience.  As for the comment about her not being your real daughter that just speaks to his immaturity and been a spoilt brat.\n\nThere is this saying.  anyone can be a sperm doner it takes a real man to be a dad.",
            "Wow - can you adopt me! \n\nYou sound like a lovely considerate father - financial both your children have had massive support in getting their lived started. \n\nPragmatic to consider how to divide assets - if you had died suddenly imagine that fall out. Best everyone knows where they stand. \n\nYour son will need to cool off and then you can clear the air. Then tell him the way it is. He will have to listen and accept - he can\u2019t get more just cause he has a tantrum.",
            "What an ungrateful little turd. The daughter seems great though.",
            "You need to allow your son to choose how he's behaving here, as toxic and unpleasant as that is. It sounds like despite you and your wife's best efforts he has not grown into the adult you hoped he would, there's a streak of inherent unpleasantness there that is just part of who he is. That entitlement and meanness is what is driving his behavior. You don't know what outside influences have got in his head as he grew and changed him from the person you raised him to be into the person he actually is.\n\nSo, you need to accept that this is who he is, and allow him to behave the way he's behaving. As sad and disappointing as it is, he is an adult who's choosing his reactions. You're choosing how you're being and at some point you have to accept you've done everything fairly and reasonably and if he's choosing to NOT be reasonable and fair, then there's not a lot you can do about that.\n\nAnd he is being unreasonable, you've done everything to provide him the opportunity at building a life he's happy with and it sounds like he took those opportunities. If he had some assumption that he'd inherit your business without putting any time into it or expressing any interest in it JUST because he's your son and biological child... that's a really shitty assumption on his part. Not one you fed him.\n\nUnfortunately, our kids don't always turn out to be the people we hoped they would. You can still love and support him, but he doesn't get to railroad the whole family. Stick to your guns, and if he wants to be reasonable at some point, great, but don't give in to unreasonable and compromise your other kid and reasonable plans just to assuage his ego and expectations.\n\nWishing you the best.",
            "I would tell him all of this in an email or text. It's likely that he thought your daughter was going to get everything and he flipped out because of that. \"He started accusing me of favoritism, being a useless dad, and his sister of manipulating me into giving it to her and leaving him with nothing. \" I don't think he was even thinking about the condo and properties (which are obviously very valuable).\n\nI would ask him if he even WANTS TO run the business consider art is his passion and that he hasn't shown any interest in it before. It's obvious that he wanted to hurt you and your daughter, but I would still try to see if this is a misunderstanding. I would expect an apology for his actions before further discussion though.",
            "You'll reap the harvest you've sown.  Your son should of showed interest in the business if he wanted to take it over.  You gave him that opportunity...  It appears he likes the idea of having a successful business and the money that comes with it but no interest/experience in running the company.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  He shouldn't feel entitled to something he has shown no interest in the past nor has put any effort in learning.  If it's any consolation, I think you made the right choice.",
            "You should not of started off with the company being split up the way that it was going to be.\n\nYou immediately started off by saying your daughter would get more when you should of started off from a more equal perspective such as each one getting a condo, and your son getting the third while your daughter was going to get a 5% more of a share in the business.",
            "Money is a terrible thing. It ruins relationships and leads to feelings of unfairness. It isn't the love of money that's the root of all evil, it is the actual existence of money itself. For example, when my mom died she left us each the equivalent of $500. That's what she had in the world. And we were all happy and satisfied. She loved us all equally and gave what she had. Now, had she had a million dollars extra, but left that to a cat's home, we'd all probably have been bitter at our meagre inheritance.",
            "id send him an email with what he would have been getting and then explain to him why that\u2019s not happening anymore - he was cruel and selfish and self involved and clearly isn\u2019t ready for the responsibility of such valuable assets if he sees it all as some sibling rivalry thing. but maybe that\u2019s just because reading this made me totally furious at him. (i do think some of what would have gone right to him should go into trust until he\u2019s 30 or something, there\u2019s clearly immaturity here.) he does need to be made to understand how out of line he was, especially given he was totally ignorant of the situation. and yet, on the other hand, that last part doesn\u2019t matter at all really, because his reaction would have been a horrible thing to do no matter how much or little he was getting. clearly there are unresolved issues here, maybe family counseling is in order? don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t know how i could get over my child trying to cut out their own sister though. sorry, this didn\u2019t have good answers for you, but i can at least validate how confusing and awful this must be for you. your relationship with your daughter sounds amazing, thank you for standing up for her. you sound like an amazing dad overall honestly, and i\u2019m really sorry your son is trying to throw it all in your face. good luck.",
            "I sense slight hints of favoritism here and there, though possibly just imagined on my part? Regardless, it sounds like you've taken pains to be supportive of both your kids... so I don't see the problem here outside of your son acting a little like a spoiled teenager. You didn't really speak about your kids' relationships with each other--I'm wondering if there's some tension between them that has slipped under your radar.",
            "No real advice OP. Just want to say I admire you and I wish I was one of your kids lol.",
            "I think you will need to do a lot of thinking and talking to your lawyers about how you will split up the business BEFORE you make a commitment to your son. There are many questions here: \n\n- if you son had a nasty divorce or made some poor financial decisions: can you make it certain that he can only sell to your daughter, without any loop holes? What if she cannot afford to buy his shares if the company comes on hard times? Would she be forced to sell the business and split? \n\n- how can you ensure your daughter cannot just hand over her inheritance to your son if he decides to guilt trip her when you die? She was so fast to offer her whole share to keep the peace, without you talking her out of it, what then? \n\n- how will you ensure that your son is a silent share owner and cannot make any damaging decisions to the company? \n\nFrom my understanding, in this arrangement, your daughter gets a consistent wage (that she works for). It looks like your son will get no money from the business unless your daughter buys him out of it or she gives up and they sell the business to split. So I've got an idea (and I'm not a business person so it could be stupid): \n\n- assess the value of your company upon you handing it over to your daughter. Now you have actual figures for your son and daughters share in the company. From here, your daughter gradually buys off your sons share (calculated above) so he gets money coming in. Once your daughter has fully bought out your son's share and he has received his full inheritance of the company, she now owns it in full. This means your son can use his shares to invest in himself however he pleases. Your daughter will get all the benefit she has earnt from expanding the business (following your retirement). Win win?\n\nYour son definently owes you and your daughter a big apology for being so cruel. You can invite him to a meeting with you, daughter, wife, to have a discussion with your lawyers regarding how your going to split things fairly in detail only once you have discussed things in detail with your lawyers alone first.",
            "This obviously has nothing to do with wanting the company, or even wanting to hurt his sister or anything like that.\n\nFor me, it's clear that it's an emotional reaction of him thinking \"so he loves her more than he loves me\" which is pretty common. So he said those mean things about his sister and I think it comes as a way to say \"she's not even your real daughter and you care more about her than about me\". And I'll dare to say that in his mind, it's unfair because he is \"getting less\" based on choices that he didn't know would bring these \"consequences\".\n\nApproach this situation from an emotional perspective, I assume that just as the majority of people, he will not openly assume that he feels hurt, betrayed and unloved. It's not rational, all emotional.",
            "Is there anything to update with? I can't really offer advice because I'm not sure what to say. But I wanted to at least check up on you and your wife.",
            "The last thing you want is for your company to go bust and your being left with nothing. This is what will happen if you leave it to your idiotic and entitled son. He chose to be an artist, let him be an artist or transition to another job if he wants to (I guess he is not very successful as an artist if he is upset your did not leave the company to him). However, being the CEO of a business is not something he can transition to. Your daughter worked for years to be able to succeed you; he did not and I simply not able to do it."

I'm not really sure what to do before then, I haven't eaten much or slept much. I've never been this alone before. I had someone to talk to for the last 7 years. Some friends reached out to me, which was nice. And I didnt cry at work. But I'm still all alone in a city that I know no-one in and this is all starting to seem like the worst case scenario for the end of a relationship. I guess I have to learn to deal with this now.\n\n----------------------\n\nTl;dr I'm single and miserable. Less miserable than if I had stayed with a cheater, but still miserable.\n\nEdit: damn this got a lot more attention than my last post. Thank you everyone for the kind words.

Breaking up with her was a great decision because the excuse:\"I've only cheated because you've been away\" is shitty and it actually means:\"I am going to cheat on you everytime you go away\".\n\nYou haven't lost 7 years, you've gained 7 years of experience in relationships and all that stuff.

A relationship is composed of 2 people and now you've learned how to avoid trusting friends who may spend too much time around your girlfriend. \n\nYou've lost your 7 years girlfriend and certainly you are going to meet soon a lovable and respectful woman.

            "So all of what you've written connects with me on a deep level. I (31 M) was recently cheated on by my ex fiance (28 F) and it was devastating at first. I caught her sexting some dude. We were together for (you guessed it, 7 years) and I had just moved to a new city for work. So the only thing I will tell you is let yourself grieve. It's natural to try and fight but let the loss wash over you. It is painful but necessary. Eventually, all bad things must end. For me it did and now I am seeing a motivated, successful, smart, funny, independent, beautiful woman who I never would have met if my ex didn't free me. I'm living the dream in a big city I always wanted to live in, doing work I love, meeting people that are amazing. It feels lonely now but the flip side of that coin is unbelievable opportunity. What I did that helped was focused on my friendships at work and seeking out a new support system. As everyone says, Time heals all, give it time. \u2764\ufe0f",

Trust me there are more miserable days to come, BUT understand that it\u2019s temporary. You won\u2019t always feel like this. \n\nUnderstand that while people make mistakes, people DONT make mistakes like this blindly. This was calculated AND was with your best friend! Don\u2019t cling to someone that would sleep with your best friend just because you\u2019re away. She\u2019s trash and you deserve better.",
            "Go no contact. Don't take her back",
            "My man, you\u2019re in a possible best-case scenario and you don\u2019t yet know it. Quite understandably, you\u2019re looking at what you don\u2019t have anymore, and that\u2019s hard AF; moreover, that perspective tints your outlook, so everything is viewed from a sense of loss or of wanting. And the exact opposite is true. \n\nYou\u2019re about to enter the best time of your life. \n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n1. You\u2019ve dropped the deadweight. Your shitty girlfriend and equally shitty friend, they have been gaslighting the fuck out of you. No more! Remember the cues and signals they displayed so you\u2019ll never fall into that trap again. Mourn the loss of your relationship and friendship, but do not dwell or take the blame. Do something cathartic for this chapter of your life; I was always partial to writing agonizing letters where I pour my heart and pain out,  then packing up all the personal stuff that reminds me of them, and burning that shit, finishing with the letter, and then pissing on the ashes. Fuck them. They aren\u2019t worth your time and they certainly don\u2019t deserve your tears. Time to focus on what makes you happy. \n\n2. You have time and opportunity like never before in your life. You\u2019re a young, single person in a new city. Remember when I said focus on yourself? There are 3 pillars of self-care: physical, mental, social. They\u2019re all interconnected and mutually beneficial.  Physical: do something, anything, that makes you sweat for at least 40 minutes, 3 times per week. Mental: be creative, meditate, write, read, visit galleries or museums or whatever makes you think. Social: join clubs or activities where you will meet new people; group sports, trivia nights, whatever forces you to be social.  It\u2019s not going to be easy all the time; but if you want something you don\u2019t have, you have to do things you\u2019ve never done. Once you\u2019re doing those 3 pillars for a few months solid, Point #3 will happen.\n\n3. You\u2019re going to find better people to be with. New friends, new girls, new everything. The best part about working on yourself first, is that you discover who you really are as an individual, and you\u2019ll attract like-minded people. You\u2019re going to look back on this in 1, 2, 3 years and pat yourself on the back for accomplishing so much, and developing as a well-rounded person.\n\n4. You are a better person now than you were yesterday. A person living in truth is better off than one living a lie; and while that may seem clich\u00e9, it seems that way for a reason: it\u2019s true. Your happiness will grow from today. It\u2019s not a straight line up, it has dips and drops, but the trajectory is always up. This trajectory is a choice you make every day. You choose to do something to make yourself feel better, or you do something that allows you to wallow. Only one of those choices is beneficial. Like everything in life, change is mandatory, growth is optional. \n\nGood luck, my man. You\u2019re on a difficult path of recovery, and it\u2019s a familiar one for everyone who has loved. I suspect it won\u2019t be the only time you walk it, unfortunately. Know you have support whenever you need it along the way.",
            "It's cliche but, everything is a lesson. Eventually you'll be back on your feet and ready to move forward with the wisdom you've gained from this experience. Best of luck to you! You will be okay.",
            "You may find you enjoy being alone, although it seems impossible now. You will grow from this. Use this time to dive into some hobbies you may have always wanted to try, or travel.\n\nFeel free to reach out to me. I was your age when a similar thing happened to me. 7 years is a long time. The pain will come in waves, but each wave will be less severe.  Your heart will never fully heal, but this is the beginning of a new life. Use this time to discover who you are as a single person. You are still so young.",
            "I was in a similar situation about 5 years ago with an ex of mine. I was at an internship in a different state and four months in she broke up with me over the phone because she was fucking some other dude.\n\nI was destroyed for a long time. My advice is unfollow her and mute her on all social media, archive the special photos, delete the rest, don't talk to her friends and never ask about her. This is how I immediately started to heal. You don't need to pretend she doesn't exist but you can definitely act as if she doesn't.\n\nYou're far away, take that as an opportunity to do fun things with yourself or find a cool community to engross yourself in. Try to pretend you're a different person, just a single dude in a new city haha! \n\nGood luck my man. I promise you'll feel better - time heals.",

            "Been there too man. I'm 37 now and have been married for almost 10 years. My fiance prior to my wife cheated on me and we had already been apart and fine during undergrad internships and jobs after college. It wasn't until I loved back to the same college for grad school and to be in the same town with her again that she ended up cheating when I went on a road trip with a buddy... That was back in 2007. It was by far (at the time) the worst and most painful feeling ever. Your ex may be truly sorry and may not ever do it again. People do stupid shit when they are young and if they feel pinned down. Hell there are plenty of couples who have been together 2 or 3 times as long as you and your now ex and after a whole they realize that they don't feel like they've really loved their lives. Marriages fall apart and family tear apart because highschool sweethearts didn't take time to explore what else and whom else might be out there for them. Maybe consider yourself lucky in this regard. What really helped me to move forward was making new friends and diving into my passions in art and culture. I like museums and alcohol. So I spent time in plenty of art museums and gallery openings (pro tip gallery openings usually have free wine and beer). I got on a dating site (back before there were really apps). And just let people to hang out with who I felt valued my time. What big city are you in if I might ask? You can pm me if you'd like. I ask because I've lived in quite a few major cities during my internships and travels and know what it's like to feel alone and lonely. I value being an extrovert with ADHD during those times.",

That friendship has been the most solid I've ever had.  We were the best mans at each others weddings, we still try and get together every month or two for a weekend.  My point is, focus on you.  I started working out and lost 110 pounds in the first 18 months or so after I moved away from my ex.  Focus on you, get you to a good place, then try to find a better person to work on an \"us\" with.  You're super young (around the same age I was), you have a TON of time to figure stuff out.  Enjoy it.  These next few years are going to potentially be the best of your life (this chapter anyway, I'm not going to get into marriage and family stuff because that's different for everyone).

            "After I left a relationship that turned abusive--7 years, myself!--I learned to live alone.\n\nInterestingly enough, I also found that I like myself. \n\nWhen you're in a relationship, all your thoughts and emotions are invested in growing it and not so much on your own personal development. \n\nWhen you're by yourself, even when you're sitting alone in a room feeling sad and *really, really* sorry for yourself, you learn about who *you* are. One thing being alone taught me was how to be grateful for what I have. \n\nI had an experience on one of those intense self-pity days (which are fine to have, btw, as long as you don't *stay* there) which really put my life into perspective:\n\nI was glooming over how unsuccessful, unworthy, unlovable a person I must be. No, I was *wallowing* in it. I slipped from self-pity into envy of an older sibling who was, at that very time, on a vacation trip I could never afford. I was literally crying for my poor lonesome self, when one of my cats crawled into my lap and started purring, and let me hug him.\n\nAs I got calmer holding my purring cat, I looked up at my tv, and really *saw* it. \n\nI *saw* the gaming console, dvd and vhs players, and sound system hooked up to it. I saw the bookcases filled not just with my collection of books, but also with all the media for those entertainment devices. I had cable tv.\n\nThen I started assessing my whole apartment. I had furniture. Plenty of clothes to wear. A computer system with internet access. A refrigerator filled with food, a stove, a microwave oven--heck I had a second tv in my bedroom! And indoor plumbing with *running water* for heaven's sake!\n\nThen I compared my own lot to all the billions of humans out there making do with so much less.\n\nAnd realized that my sibling, for all their success, *loves* me, and was, and is, a kind and generous person whom I am lucky to have in my life. The same with my other siblings, and my mom, who was still alive then. I had friends who loved me. I wasn't actually alone, I just didn't have a romantic partner at that time.\n\nThose periods in your life when you feel most alone are when you learn to be most grateful for what you do have, and are as important for personal development as being in relationships is.\n\nYou're in a new city, in a new job, learning new things that will benefit you the rest of your life. You're on an adventure! That is so exciting, and has so many possibilities just waiting to happen!\n\nYou got this! I'm glad you've got your brother coming to visit.\n\nGood luck to you!",
            "I was 22 when I got out of five-year relationship with someone I knew since high school. Same thing, I was always busy because of college so he cheated on me, multiple times with different women. I was alone and devastated, I thought nobody else would love me yada yada~\n\nFAST FORWARD, four years later... I am now happily married. I met him the same year I broke up with the mf cheater.\n\nIf the breakup didn't happen, maybe I wouldn't have met my husband.

            "Have you two talked in this period at all? I'm curious in how did you find that all out as well.\n\nAlso, the entire cheating seems a bit planned out. They told you there's gonna be a third person, but rented a hotel for the two of them. Straight up planning for the act. And it's not a simple gesture like moving a hand, so you do it subconscioussly or unintetionally. It lasts for a while and you have to have some amount of consciouss mind to do stuff. I'm sorry if it's hard reading this, but I just want to help you realise some things from a different point of view.\n\nIt wasn't just because you were away. If she was horny she could've easily dealt with that by her own self. Unfortunately, seems like she really wanted something with your mutual \"friend\", although he isn't innocent himself.\n\nIf you feel the need, speak to her alone and see what the hell happened for her to do this. Use these points and other that people may have made or found out. I'm not saying to do this sou you might get back together, but maybe you'll figure some stuff out that will help you.\n\nI'm really very sorry for what has happened and I wish you find a lot of stregth to pass through all of this.",

As everyone else said, the worst cane true and you survived, that alone should be worth celebration. You got this, and who knows maybe the universe has the RIGHT individual waiting for you. The lesson i learned is when I had insane focus on growing (counseling for other things I don\u2019t wanna really get into) by putting 100% into my work, applying for my masters program, working a side hustle to pay some debt i has occurred earlier in life, that\u2019s when things started looking up.

Now I'm 46, happily married for 11 years, and I don't even think about that guy anymore. Yes, it sucked HARD at first, but every day it gets a little better. Hang in there!

I'd go to the college food court and force myself to eat a token amount of food. I'd walk listlessly for hours after class. \n\nBut then friends invited me to go out. I focused on my studies and on doing one thing for myself each weekend. In a week, I was eating again. In a month, I was noticing other women. In six months, I had developed a few new hobbies and worked on myself. In a year, I was dating someone new.\n\nIt hurts. No denying it. But this is a chance to grow.",

            "I know that it's difficult to see the forest for the trees, but in time this will all make sense. Each of you grew and learned from this experience. Your \"friend\" learned that backstabbing someone close cost him two people that day. Your ex learned that cheating will end her world. And you are supposed to be learning that sometimes things just end, and that when it is time to move on...you do so wholeheartedly and throw your entire being into it.\n\nIt may take alot of time in the gym to get yourself mentally back on track, and physically confident again. It may take the unbroken loyalty and companionship of a dog to show you what true love should be. But in time, you'll find someone who has undergone their own journey, a journey that has perfectly shaped their character, their thoughts, and their compassion so that they fit in a complementary fashion to you. Until then, the best thing that you can do is take joy in the journey. Breathe in deeply and enjoy every second of the here and now as you walk your path. Enjoy the sunshine on your face, taste every single flavor of the food you eat, sweat and push for one further repetition on your free weights. You are single and unbound by another's expectations of you. Do what you will.",
            "I've been in a similar situation. Moved to Boston for a girl who cheated on me 5 months into living there (after dating for a year and a half.)\n\nThe hardest part is the loneliness. Its okay to feel scared and alone, its okay to cry, scream and feel pain. Take your time to heal. Seeing friends and family is the first step to healing. Go do things with them. Explore the city together. And its okay to cry around them. \n\nOne day when it you wake up and it hurt less, just know that being new to the city brings many opportunities. You'll make friends and meet people. (IDK if you're into video games, comics, anime, etc. but local conventions are a great way to meet people. Its how I met people after my break up.) \n\nJust remember your lease, your apartment; is not a prison, its your castle! You can do whatever you want!

I\u2019m going through my first breakup as well and my relationship was only 4 years and the ending was a lot more amicable than yours. \n\nI know reddit isn\u2019t the most religious of forums but you should take this time to explore your spirituality and existential worldview. You\u2019re going to be ok but it may get worse emotionally before it gets better and your going to suffer a lot of grief. You\u2019re going to feel more pain than you thought it was possible to feel, but you can use that as motivation to pray, meditate, or seek comfort in the ancient writings of whatever religion you happen to follow (for me it\u2019s the Bible). Those things helped me through the sadness, helped me to forgive my ex for things she did wrong, which was necessary for me to let go of all the anger I felt towards her and myself. It also gave me a deep sense of hope that ultimately pain is temporary. It really does get better.",

            "It may seem like the real work is surviving the experience and being alone, but honestly the real work starts during your next relationship. That's when you have to learn to trust someone again and not treat them with suspicion because of what your ex did to you.\n\nI went through this too. My ex, first boyfriend, we moved in together and he cheated on me in my own bed. My stepdad literally bought me a new bed to help me get over it. Time passed, I survived living alone. Eventually I met someone and it was hard not to treat him with the same \"rules\" of my first relationship. It was hard to trust! \n\nBut you have to set your fears aside and trust again.  There is no way around it.  If they're going to cheat,  they will cheat, and no amount of suspicion or distrust will prevent it. \n\nBest luck OP",

This question is what is really screwing with you. \nC: if this happened with a close friend it was happening with other people most cheaters claim it\u2019s their first time cheating and it was a mistake \u201cunless she told you everything and you didn\u2019t have to figure this stuff out yourself\u201d that is normally a lie also they will tell the truth if they think you will figure it out \u201csomeone was there and is not willing to lie for them.\nD: you never picked up on your friends intentions? Why would your friend want to hang out with you and your girl and be a 3rd wheel all the time? Didn\u2019t you find that strange behavior? \n\nYou sound very innocent and trusting in a world of untrustworthy people. I think this is just the first of many times you will feel the pain on it. \n\nPAY ATTENTION TO WHAT I\u2019M GOING TO TELL YOU NOW!\n\nNever ever second guess your Intuition on any situation  if your gut is telling you something is wrong go with it! AT the end of the day all you have is your self and you need to trust your self or cheaters will gaslight you! Ps don\u2019t tell anyone you have suspicions just check stuff out yourself if you need confirmation \n\nAlso going forward with new girlfriends be prepared to leave at any time some women will string you along just because they don\u2019t want confrontation \n\nIt\u2019s extremely easily to tell people what I told you but it\u2019s actually harder to follow it. This comes after years of failed relationships and being emotionally drained as advice that works.\n\nNever ever go back to a cheater no matter how many times they say sorry they will never respect you again.\n\nLearn to like being alone you won\u2019t have a good relationship until you beat that fear",
            "So, eat, drink water, get some exercise (even if it's just a walk) and try to get some sleep (like, don't sabotage your sleep by drinking a redbull at midnight). Taking care of the physiological stuff will help you feel better emotionally and mentally, even though you're at probably the lowest point of your life emotionally.\n\nAnd it's okay to cry. Not saying you should cry at work, but having a good cry when you feel it coming at a time and place where you're comfortable, and it will be easier to keep it together at other times when crying wouldn't be good (like a work). Or, in other words, don't keep it in because you will end up crying at work.\n\nIt's great that your brother is going to come visit you and that some friends have reached out. It sounds like you have a good family and friends, even if a couple of those friends turned out to be duds.\n\nFocus everything into this internship. Not only the work itself (which you should be doing anyway), but building your professional network. Make friends with people, go out with your coworkers. Building your professional network is as important as doing the actual work and learning how to do it well.\n\nBest of luck and it will get better!",
            "Hey. I get it.  It really sucks I recently got out of a similar situation and if you want someone to talk to feel free to PM me. My ex cheated on after we dated for 6.5 years and my life was kind of terrible for a while but things definitely got better.",
            "Alone in a strange city (while gainfully employed) is actually a pretty good situation. Endless possibilities, and more free time to explore them. \n\nIt's all a matter of perspective. You're seeing what you've lost. All of us in long term relationships are seeing what you've gained. You can stay out all night at an axe throwing bar. You can race go karts. You can explore strange new worlds. Seek out new life, and new civilizations. To boldly go where no man has gone before... wait, that's Star Trek. You get the idea. Get out there and get dirty, young man. Go out and get you some stories to tell when you're old.",
            "Very similar thing happened to me. Block them both, don't hang out with them, and try to make lots of other friends.\n\nDo stuff that is different, fill your head with memories that are louder than the ones you've already made. Get out of your routine.\n\nIt'll be a tough 6 months, a difficult year, but you'll feel better. Trust me! I'm a year in and never thought I'd feel better, but it's slowly happening.\n\nTry to pour as much love as you can back into the world and wait for the rising tide to lift your boat.",
            "Was your so trying to convince you to stay??",
            "\\> But I'm still all alone in a city that I know no-one in and this is all  starting to seem like the worst case scenario for the end of a  relationship.\n\nWell, I had my 7 year relationship end in much the same way when I was alone in a foreign country where I knew no one and didn't speak the language, so there is always a deeper bottom. I wish you all the best, it does suck to be alone. What helped me was distracting myself, rereading my favourite book, playing a social game online, texting my friends. Heck, that's when I got into talking to strangers on reddit, there are some subs just for that.",
            "My husband (m 35) of 5 years cheated on me with someone taboo and close to the family (sons mother) it was a long standing affair \n3 years later were still together and fucking miserible. \nI fucking HATE him. \nI wish i would have left when it happened. But now I feel obligated to stay because i stupidly said the words \"i forgive you\" \n\nYou dont ever get over it. \nIt isnt ever the same again. \nAt least not in my experience \nThe pain is almost worse today than it was when i found out and the shock wore off.",
            "Buy a PS4 or a Switch and just enjoy your free time.",
            "Dear redditor, I have read your previous post and I am so sorry about what happened to you.\nI can barely imagine the pain you must be feeling. I'm glad you broke up with that person, because whoever just risks seven years of love is not worth it.\n\nFalling out of love is one thing, cheating on someone you have been with so long, who trusted you entirely, that is one of the most fucked up things to do.\n\nYou deserve better.\nI'm sorry you were so awfully hurt.",
            "You're Buddy was not your Buddy,  you where both away and isolated from each other. He weaseled in like a dirty dog... give a break for a bit and review. The make up sex could be incredible...",
