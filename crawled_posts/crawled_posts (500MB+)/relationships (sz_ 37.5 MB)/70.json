        "selftext": "Original Post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ae6inj/is_it_wrong_for_mef20_to_choose_my_friendship/\n\nThanks to all the people who gave me their advice and perspective on the matter, it was greatly appreciated and helped me sort my priorities out.\n\n\u00a0First, let me clear up some things I probably should have made clearer in the original post:\n\nThe thing with the mind reading is not really meant to be taken as a soul mate situation. Ben sometimes struggles to get a point across but I seem to get it most of the times and can tell people what he meant to say. So I think this got blown out of proportion a bit. I should have phrased this differently, sorry.\n\nAlso, many people referred to Chris as my boyfriend in their comments, which he was not. We were dating for a month and weren\u2019t an official couple.\n\nAnother thing I should have talked about is how Ben and I ended up dating for a second time. An acquaintance told us that it was a shame that us dating never worked out and we decided to test the waters again. Not even a month in I said that it did not feel right, he agreed and said how relived he was that I felt it too and we went back to being friends. That was considerably easy since we hadn\u2019t even had sex in that month. Chris knew that the second time wasn\u2019t all that serious.\n\nOne comment was suspicious of why Ben hadn\u2019t moved on so I probably should\u2018ve mentioned that Ben had a girlfriend from February to June 2018. I liked her and she was always lovely to me. She left him because, ironically, she still had feelings for her ex. So I thought it\u2018d be safe to assume that he\u2018d be over me as well.\n\nNone of my close friends talked about my history with Ben and they didn\u2019t joke about us at the party. They genuinely want me to be happy and most of them instantly liked Chris. However something did happen at the party that ended up causing all this mess. So buckle up folks.\n\nNow that that\u2019s been said, let\u2019s move on to the shit show that\u2019s been my life for the last couple of days.\n\nAfter reading some of your comments I texted Chris back and agreed to talk about things that night under the condition that we both will be civil and adult about it. He was fine with that and I came over to his place.\n\nChris started the conversation by immediately apologizing for how aggressive he reacted and how stupid he felt for not being able to keep it together. He said it wasn\u2019t fair of him to mistrust me and that his jealousy was ridiculously overblown considering we weren\u2019t even official.\n\nI told him that it\u2019s okay if he gets jealous or uncomfortable but I just wished we could have talked about it before things escalated. I apologized for not being sensitive enough to realize that no matter what he said to me, he wouldn\u2019t exactly be thrilled with the situation. I could have made more of an effort to reassure him and adapt situations so that we could both be happy.\n\nWe both made it clear that it would make us sad if things ended before they had even begun and we\u2019d probably end up regretting not giving this another shot. After all, we have this crazy chemistry and got along so well.\n\nNow all that seemed to stand in the way of a happy ending was an awkward conversation about my friendship with Ben. But before I could even get into it Chris dropped this bomb:\n\nSo at the party he overheard Ben and his best friend talking. Ben said how awful it was to see me with another guy and how unfair it was that we weren\u2019t an item.\nChris did not know what to do with that. He said that that\u2019s where what little jealousy and insecurity he had went from zero to a hundred and he couldn\u2019t help seeing red. He weight his options and thought that if he\u2019d tell me it\u2019d end in a situation where it\u2019s his word against Ben\u2019s and I\u2019d believe Ben more. He also didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat guy that ruined a friendship\u201c. So he swallowed his feelings until they burst out when I casually mentioned hanging out with Ben.\n\nAs he told me that, I put my guard up and took it with more than just a grain of salt. That story sounded almost cartoonishly convenient. Some people in the comments warned me that he could try to manipulate me and I had to look out for myself. I told him in all honesty that I\u2018d have to talk to some other people as it was hard to take his word for it given the current situation.\n\nChris was very understanding and told me that to whatever solution I\u2018d come, he\u2018d have to accept it because as he put it he \u201clost the right to be involved in this with throwing a jealous fit\u201c. I disagreed but he was adamant about me having to find my truth.\n\nWe ended the night with me telling him that I really wanted to trust in what he said to me for the sake of salvaging our relationship but it was just so hard and I was so confused. He again said that he understands and that I should take my time to sort things out. Then he gave me a long hug (yes, this one was actually long) and I left to figure things out.\n\nAnd oh boy did I figure things out...\n\nThe first thing that came into my head was that at the party in September, the one where I was dared to kiss Ben, guess who thought of the dare. It was Ben\u2018s best friend, who, if I\u2018d take Chris\u2019 word, would know if Ben still had feelings for me. Ben\u2019s friend was also the person who suggested playing truth or dare in the first place even though he usually doesn\u2019t like that many drinking/party games.\n\nThen I thought about how weird Ben acted when I asked him about Chris. At the time I was convinced that he just didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings but what if he just saw his chance of getting Chris out of the picture and held an inner debate whether he should act on it or not.\n\nMy head was in bits and pieces as I overanalysed basically every interaction I had with Ben for the past months. I had to rip the band aid off and talk to Ben directly. So I asked him if he\u2019d be free after work and he came over. We usually don\u2019t spend time alone at each other\u2019s place so he knew that something wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nIt was very awkward but I had carefully thought about what to say beforehand which made it a bit easier. I told Ben that I value our friendship but had gotten the suspicion that he might want more out of our relationship than I could give him and asked if this was true. Ben is a bad liar so he got defensive instead and asked me if Chris wanted to separate us. He used that phrasing. \u201cSeparate us\u201d\n\nI told him that it did not matter if Chris was involved in this because I just wanted a clear answer on whether us being friends was enough for him or not. He avoided the answer. Asking again if this was because of Chris. He spun in circles trying to change the subject and ended up saying some mean things about Chris not being a good person and what not (Reminder that their first and only interaction had been at the party). I however stayed focused, as I wanted an answer. Given, his avoiding of my question was answer enough but I was getting angry with him and I wanted him to spell it out.\n\nAfter some more back and forth he finally snapped: \u201cFine! I thought that we\u2019d eventually get back together and it was only a matter of time until you realized that we were meant to be! You should be with me then we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this.\u201d His words still echo in my head.\n\nLike, what\u2026? I could have handled him having a little crush on me or if he felt that some things were left unresolved, but this? It felt like my entire world was shattered. All these years of friendship he just stuck around to one day get back together with me? Everything we\u2019ve been through and everything he did for me was just so that I\u2019d eventually realize that we should date again?\n\nI told him that I couldn\u2019t return his feelings. Not now and not in the future. We had tried twice, it didn\u2019t work out, at least for me it didn\u2019t, and I saw nothing that could change that. I wanted us to be friends but I don\u2019t think it is possible under these conditions.\n\nHe got pretty worked up about it and it was like watching someone go through all stages of grief except acceptance. \u201cWe can still work this out!\u201d \u201cThis is unfair!\u201d \u201cNobody will ever love me!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll change and we can try again in a few months!\u201d\n\nIt took a lot out of me but I remained calm and told him that it\u2019d be better if we stopped seeing each other for quite some time. Then I asked him to leave. I was exhausted and honestly creeped out. I felt so betrayed. This person that I was so close to and that I trusted so much was always acting with an ulterior motive.\n\nI called my best friend and once she heard me sob through the speaker she got in her car and came over. I told her what had happened and she was horrified. She had no idea. As word spread in these last two days it turned out that my friends didn\u2019t know about his feelings either and most of them were shocked and repelled by how he acted.\n\nI got some amazing support from my friends and they were great at helping me not losing my head over this so far.\nChris and I talked yesterday and I apologized for putting him in such a horrible situation. I hadn\u2019t wanted for us to start out with this level of drama. He believes that I wasn\u2019t to blame but I still think I should have realized some things earlier... it\u2019s been five years of \u201cfriendship\u201d for Christ\u2018s sake...\n\nChris was very sweet. He ordered food from my favourite take out place, we watched a movie and cuddled up on the sofa. He said that he was glad that we came out okay and somehow everything was worth the struggle in the end. He also asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend and I said yes.\n\nSo tl;dr: Ben had feelings for me for years and expected that I\u2019d just get back together with him one day. I told him that I couldn\u2019t be friends with him if that\u2019s what he wants. Chris and I are now an official couple and can\u2019t wait for a drama free relationship.",

I'm glad you and Chris worked it out. \n\nI hope you know there *ain't no way* you can be friends again with Ben, even after \"quite some time.\" First, he acted manipulative AF.

I've been blindsided like that before and it's not a fun feeling. But know that you also handled this situation so well not only with doing your due diligence vetting what Chris said, but also taking it seriously when you found out he was telling the truth.

It\u2019s okay to be sad and hurt and angry. He really pulled a Nice Guy here and that always sucks. You did beautifully in your fact-checking here and learned several good lessons. Take comfort in the fact that you\u2019ll be harder to fool next time. That has value.\n",

            "Ever since I read your first post I just had this feeling that Chris was a decent guy. When you said Ben mentioned Chris was bring frosty I was like 'OK BEN IS THE ONE WHO HAS AN ISSUE' .. knew Chris was a reasonable guy. It's nice things worked out the way it did. You see Chris for who he really is, and you also see Ben's true colours. I just can't believe he tried to sabotage your relationship. ",

I had a similar experience with my boyfriend and his ex and I wish we'd both handled things differently (I didn't fully explain my feelings about the two of them being \"best friends\" after breaking up not long before we became a couple, and he kept some things (a couple were BIG things) that happened from me because he didn't want to cut her off/hurt her feelings but was afraid I'd break up with him - I later found out/he fessed up and I'm gradually getting over it as time passes, but geez if we'd both done what you and Chris did right at the start, we would've avoided so much drama (and trauma in my case) \ud83d\ude05 Massive props to you ",

Your willingness to talk things out as well as listen is an extremely admirable trait.",
            "My rule #1 is that you cannot be friends with an ex while dating someone else, especially if there was physical interaction. There will always be a level or depth that goes slightly beyond friends. I\u2019ve read this in a lot of dating guideline books as well. Many of those books also pointed out it\u2019s not fair to your other half to see you around an ex.\n\nIn regards to your story, Ben is not friend material worthy. Even if you and Chris don\u2019t work out, I would advise keeping Ben away, which could be tough after a breakup but very necessary.",
            "This will be a great lesson for you and you will encounter this probably again in life. We cant control what we feel and there are most of the times some feelings lingering over a relationship. I always wondered why older people always assumed my best friend and me were a couple. Well she was deeply into me. The same happened with me not dealing with other friendships properly. I have to admit the older I get the more I feel like very close male-female relationships are very difficult to manage properly. My last girlfriend had a best male friend and even though they didnt have something sexual going between them it was still a very complicated relationship. I believe the opposite gender just gives us something that is hard wired to a romantic relationship for us.",

            "Suprise suprise. Dont crap where you eat. \n\nAny type of hookup/dating ALWAYS ends up with one person wanting more than the other. Even if it ends amicably like you and ben did where you stayed as friends. \n\nBen probably did feel the lack of chemistry but stuck it out as friends for a what if scenario.. like what just happened. \n\nI hate to say it but for you and chris to continue, ben cant be in the picture anymore.. no matter what he says. Maybe once he finds somebody long term, and thats still a MAYBE because it will strain your relationship with chris no matter when he comes back. \n\nHe is/was an active threat to chris as a romantic interest so dont put him through that circus",

            "From a guy who got to experience this at one point with a ex fiancee. I would never date a girl who is still friends or good friends with a ex. It's a horrible mess and this Chris was probably like me trying to be nice to somebody who is really interested in but didn't want to blow the chance from the start by saying you shouldn't talk to a ex.\nBut in reality you should have told ben have a nice life and moved on but you didn't. Remember you two at one point found something both liked to date for awhile even if it didn't work out. Now a new flame has to deal with the fact you are goid friends with a ex and there is always a possibility of you two connecting again maybe on a drunken night. He will always be looking over his shoulder. It that one time a hookup happens with your ex it will destroy Chris.

Because it would have happened to the next guy, or the one after. I only ever see the point in being friends with exs, if you literally live in a small town where everyone knows everyone.

            "I like this turn of events.  A couple of days ago everyone was saying leave Chris, and the friendship with Ben is was too important. People pick their friends for reasons; when a past relationship becomes a friendship it's important to ask what is your ex getting from the friendship.  Because the new friendship will always be less than the relationship, and should change according.  If I  breakup with someone and they want to remain friends the first thing I change is money.  In relationships I don't mind paying for everything, but friends go Dutch. I also am not affectionate with friends and for Ex's I make an effort to avoid physical contact. I never had an Ex who would agree to my friendship dynamics. I mean some remain in our group but not one on one interactions. ",

The problem is this \u201cfriend zone\u201d nonsense logic where the only value his friendship with you had was being a path to an inevitable relationship, rather than seeing you as an actual friend. Him being an ex gave his brain a sturdier place to start from, sure, but the problem was still that he was in denial about your own feelings, and avoided actually communicating anything about this.",

Parents are homophobic and he's still in the closet. Should I tell him? And if so, how?\n\n______________\n\nSo about a month ago I made a post about how I caught my brother having sex with his best friend and I wanted advice on how to approach him. One redditor suggested I write my brother a letter, so that's exactly what I did. I could have let it go, but I didn't want my brother to become a statistic and feel isolated.\n\nIn my letter I essentially told me brother that I had seen him and Friend together. I told him that he doesn't have to tell me anything, but I love him and he can talk to me about anything and I'd never tell our parents.\n\nHe never responded straight forward. We talked like normal, and whenever Friend came over I just kept my distance. But on New Years Eve, him and Friend and I went out to a party (no family was around). He and Friend kissed at midnight, and I've never seen him so happy. \n\nThis was a really uneventful update but I thought I'd post it anyway.\n\ntl;dr: Wrote brother a letter, he seemed to get a little more comfortable around me.

            "> This was a really uneventful update but I thought I'd post it anyway.\n\nActually, I rather disagree.  It may all seem uneventful now, but I think as you both get older you may realize how important it was that you reached out to him.  Instead of building a life separate from his family, you allowed him to \"merge his spheres\" so to speak, and you will have so many more memories together because of your decision and his willingness to trust you.",

Just a quick chat to let him know you're still supportive of him, and will keep any secrecy he requests.\n\nI'm willing to bet he's thought about how/when he will come out to your family, and you can offer to be a resource on that (but without pressuring him to do so).\n\nBasically just keep doing what you're doing. You are a good, supportive brother and he's lucky to have you.",

            "I'm not sure if this means anything. My brother is gay. He has a boyfriend he brings to family events. I haven't really told my children about his orientation or anything. We've discussed acceptance and all that jazz. \n\nWell, Christmas time, my middle child started asking questions about my brother and his boyfriend (which led to youngest asking questions. I'm pretty sure oldest was aware and just accepted it as normal). I answered honestly. All three of my children said, okay, and were perfectly fine. My middle even expressed his fondness of my brother's boyfriend. \n\nI'm not sure this was the best way to handle this. I wasn't actively hiding anything. My husband and I actively accepted him and his relationship (as does the rest of our family) and just acted like it was normal. We let them come to their own conclusions and ask questions when they needed. We didn't make a big deal about it. To them now, it's not a big deal. It's just a fact. \n\nAs a side note, I did tell my brother a more detailed conversation. I thought he was upset because he had his face down. I apologized for upsetting him. He looked up and said no, he was so happy. He loved the way they reacted. He thought they were sweet. \n\nGood for you for being such a good brother. Please continue to be there for him.\n\n As for parents, sometimes they can surprise you. I hope yours come around. My parents were initially shocked and upset. Now boyfriend is part of the family. Someone complemented my mom's ability to accept him as gay. She got this confused look and said, he's my son. Why wouldn't I accept him? \n\nGood luck. Sorry for the book. =]",

I meant to post one way a few days ago, but things have been really busy lately.\n\nI didn't want to ruin my Thanksgiving holiday thinking about the car situation, so I decided to wait until I got back to discuss it with my boyfriend. I was really hoping that this was all just a misunderstanding, but unfortunately it was not. \n\nWhen I brought up the rental payment, my boyfriend said that he thought it was only fair that I compensate him for the use of his car. He asked me if I had a problem with that, and I told him that I did. I mentioned what some of you said about how I could have rented a car for less if I had known he was going to charge me. I also told him how I felt like he had taken advantage of me by only mentioning the fee after I had taken his car. \n\nOne thing that one of you mentioned was that maybe someone had suggested it to him. I asked him about that, and he said that no one had said anything. He just figured that it would only be fair for me to pay for the use of his car. I did at least get him to see that the price he charged me was too high, but he didn't think he was wrong about the fee. We ended up having a larger conversation about how tight he is with money and some other things I mentioned in my first post. I didn't intend to break up with him, but after he still insisted on the rental payment, I just realized that he was not someone I wanted to be with. I did end up paying him, but it was $100 instead of $250.\n\nSo that's the update. He has apologized and asked me to take him back, but I don't think I'm interested anymore. Thanks for your help everyone. \n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Boyfriend was serious when he requested I pay him a rental fee for his car. We broke up. ",

Its not like you ask to borrow it all the time.\n\nI have lent my car, on occasion, to my brother, cousin etc. I would EXPECT them to fill the tank, or at LEAST give it back with the same amount of gas. But I would not charge anyone. \n\nFrankly, sometimes you just need someone to give you a hand.

It was awkward but it wasn't that bad. She apologized profusely about the past. I thought her apologies would make me feel good but to be honest, I was wrong. The truth is that I still think badly of the Nina who bullied me in middle school but I couldn't see that Nina in the current Nina ( I don't know if what I'm trying to say makes sense or if my brain finally decided to give up on me.). Her voice, her demeanor, everything except for her face is completely different.\n\nI told her exactly how what she and the other bullies did affected me and then I decided to forgive her... more or less.\n\nI decided to start over as strangers and told her as much. I told her that while I couldn't forget what she did in the past, I don't know the current Nina. It's been 14 years since the those times, more than half of our lives passed since then and I firmly believe people can change ( I did.) so, if she wanted to try and get to know the current me, we could act as if that was the first time we met and move on from then. I don't know if this decision show my maturity or my stupidity, I guess the future will tell.\n\nI admit what she did next made my giggle a bit ( I think she took it from a film but I don't remember which one.). She stood up and got out of the coffee shop, then came back in, sat down and introduced herself.\n\nWe chatted for a bit and it was ok.\n\nI what to thank all the people who gave me advices in the comment section of the previous post.\n\nTL;DR : I decided to forgive her and we decided to start over as strangers and see what happen..",

Just take it slow and go at your comfort level.\n\nAlso, have a good think about whether this is something you are ready for.

You wouldn't be doing anything wrong or being mean, you would be protecting your peace of mind. Sometimes the consequences of a person's actions means that they effectively close a door on getting to know someone great. But if you find that it doesn't make you uncomfortable and that you enjoy this person's company, that's cool too. People can change, in fact childhood is all about changing.

That is amazing.\n\nI just want to say keep it up.  Like you said, you don\u2019t know this person.

            "Good for you. I know how hard it is to be severely bullied as a kid. Like you, I was bullied all through elementary school and it didn\u2019t stop until I moved out of town. When I came back to a minoring neighboring town, I was unrecognizable. I had gone through puberty, dyed my hair and stopped wearing glasses. I guess I was considered pretty suddenly and it was a big shock, me included. One of the guys that had bullied me, went to my new high school. I didn\u2019t recognize him nor him me but after hearing my full name, he remembered me. He tried joking about the past, down playing it and he kind of said sorry. When I told him to go f*** himself and walked, he was dumbfounded. He ended up being a AH to me although high school. Doing little kid stuff, like through gum in my hair or trying to get my attention by repeatedly calling my name and then laughing at me when I finally ask what. I later heard he liked me but since he couldn\u2019t tell me, he resorted to how little kids do it. I forgave him and all the rest of those kids that had bullied me but I could never be friends with any of them, let alone date one. I\u2019d be too worried that it be another prank/joke they were playing on me. Because of their bullying, I have a hard time having any type of relationships including friendships and romantic relationships because my trust in people is so broken.

One year ago he decided that he has had enough of family life and went to live with his parents for some time. He was behaving like a bachelor for the entirety of his stay with them, found a girlfriend and was drunk constantly. He had used alchohol before but we never had much problems around it. He also spent a lot of his time playing games with friends on his computer.\n\nOne year ago he informed me that he found a girlfriend and was ready to move out of our apartment and cut ties, although he didn't quite do that. He left me (making close to minimum wage) to care for our two kids and also left a collection of unpaid bills going back months. After that I fell into a depressive episode that lasted two months and my two close friends managed to get me out of it.\n\nAbout three months after he left us, he came back, well not really. He started coming to our city, hanging out with the kids again and also with me, inviting me out for drinks and dinner. All was going well and my 16 year old went on a week long trip with him. \n\nFor a while, all was going well. He said that the girlfriend was a lie and he just needed some time away to clear his head, last night I sent him a \"Good night, love you\" text as I usually do, but in the morning he replied with \"I don't deserve your love. I'm about to become a dad again. I'm sorry\" I later called him to ask what he meant by that and he told me that he has a girlfriend in another country who is pregnant with his kid. She plans to keep it and he wants to cut ties with me and our kids to care for that child.\n\nI don't know what to do. I requested devorce but he declined saying he was not ready. Can anyone give me advice regarding this situation. Can I divorce him anyways, even though he doesn't want to do it. Is there any way I can secure payments to my kids, since with only my job I can barely make end meet for the basics. I do some odd jobs here and there but it's not enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR!
