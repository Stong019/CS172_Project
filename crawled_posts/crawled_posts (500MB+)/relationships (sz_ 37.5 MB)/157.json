        "selftext": "This is kinda long and I know that asking strangers on the internet may not be the best way of working out what to do but I really need to get this off my chest.\n\nThe first thing to say about my father is that he places a very high value on formal education.  He had very little of it himself but believes that it is the best thing that you can do in life.  I am one of a set of non-identical twins (with my sister) and she is everything that he could hope for in that she has a bachelors, a masters and has just completed law school.  Unfortunately for him (and me) I am not suited to formal education at all.  I did enroll for one semester at a state u but I knew from Day 1 I had made a mistake and left.  He was furious about that at the time and confidently predicted that I would be a bum and a loser for the rest of my life.  \n\nHowever, I found my niche as an entrepreneur and after struggling along for a few years at the beginning am now doing very well.  In the same way that I knew college was not for me, I know that running my own business is.  I have started and sold a number of them over the years and, although not everything I have tried has worked out by any means, the last one I managed to sell for a decent chunk of change (low 8-figures) and have recently moved across country to NYC to find a mentor to help me play in the big leagues.  Prior to this incident I thought that my Father had come to terms with me not going to college etc and making a success of being a businessman instead.  He and I have never been on the very best of terms but I did honestly think we had managed to get to a sort of \u201cworking relationship.\u201d\n\nI should add that my sister and I have always been close and although our lives have taken us in different directions we still speak at least once per month.  I always knew that she must have incurred a good amount of student loan debt over the years but I have never tried to tell her how to live her life and she has never tried to tell me how to live mine.\n\nMy sister got engaged last year to a guy she met in law school, I have met him once when they came to NYC for a visit and he seemed alright to me.  Fastforward to two weeks ago and I am travelling from NYC to our hometown for a \u201cmeet the family\u201d type dinner with my family and my future BIL's family (coincidentally, they come from a nearby town).  Upfront I will be very honest and say that I didn't really want to go as it is a long trip for me, I am very busy and what does it matter if I meet his family or not?  But I go, for my sister's sake.  \n\nAnyways, just before dinner my father pulls me off to one side, tells me that sister and BIL have a combined student loan debt of nearly $500k (WTF!!) and it would be really nice if I \u201cdid something for the family for once\u201d and paid it off for them as a wedding gift.  Frankly, I have been expecting him to ask me to contribute to the cost of the wedding and I had already decided that I would just keep my mouth shut and pay up so long as it was less than $25k, but this really shocked me.  It was the really matter-of-fact way that he said it.  Now, I have the money and wouldn't really miss it but that was not the point.\n\nIt gets worse.  As we are sitting down and eating it transpires that he has told everyone there that I am \u201crich\u201d and I will be paying off the student loan debt.  There are toasts and heartfelt thank-yous while I am just sitting there stunned at being railroaded in the most brazen way I have ever seen!!  \n\nLong story short, I said a few things I probably shouldn't have and end up walking out of the restaurant there and then and going back to the airport and catching a red-eye back to NY.  While I am in the air I am stewing on the whole situation but by the time I land I have calmed down and thinking \u201cwhat have I done\u201d?  However, when I switch my phone back on in the cab back to my apartment it just blows up with voice messages and texts from my parents and sister.  Later that night, my sister rings me again and this time I answer it.  I explain that it isn't about the money but the way in which it was just assumed that I would pay up.  I know that this sounds really petty now, but I was just so angry at the time.  My sister was really surprised as she knew nothing about it before the dinner and afterwards dad was going round telling everyone that I had said I was going to pay it but had now changed my mind!  She ended up being really embarrassed in front of her future in-laws (who are now wondering what their son is marrying into) so is now very pissed at our dad.\n\nNow I come to the issue.  Turns out my sister went back and confronted our dad about it and there was a huge row and now she is talking about eloping and not having a big family wedding at all or only inviting her fiance's family etc etc.  My phone is being besieged with messages from my parents to talk to my sister and ask her forgiveness so that she will forgive them.  The final message from my father before writing this was just him ranting about how I don't deserve the money that I have and it is because of \u201cpeople like me\u201d that college graduates are struggling.  Seems that we aren't in such a good place after all.\n\nI am not sure what to do.  Was I totally out of line?  I don't have many friends to talk to about this and those I do have probably have as equally skewed perception on this as I do.  Did I get this totally wrong?  Should I just have paid the money?  I hate being railroaded and that is what it felt like, as though my only value there was a source of funds.  Having said that. I'd hate to think that my sister's wedding gets ruined because of me...\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: I have made some money selling a business and my father thinks I should pay off sister's and BIL's student loan debt as a wedding gift and blows-up when I refuse.  Family drama ensues, wedding in danger, parents blame me.  Should I just have kept my mouth shut and paid up?",

            "Your father is trying to live vicariously through his children. The education he wanted was something he only experienced through your sister and so holds you in contempt. That is his problem at this point, not yours. Keep up with your sister, she didn't expect you to pay and seems to recognize that what your father did was wrong. Her eloping is up to her and her fianc\u00e9. If you want to help (that 25k is no joke even against 500k of debt) go ahead but don't feel like their choices mean your own life decisions take a back seat. You worked for your money, they worked for their education, each came with its own set of consequences.\nDon't let your fathers expectation hamper your success.",
            "I think it was super generous of you to consider offering $25,000 to pay for your sisters wedding. To me, that is already going above and beyond as a brother.\n\nYour father is out of line. Also, you're lucky that your sister is also on your side. If she wasn't, this would be really messy.\n\nYou don't need to pay for your sisters (let alone your BIL!) college education. If you wanted to gift them anything as a wedding gift, that's your prerogative.\n\nYou need to simply let your father know that the only money he gets to decide how to spend is his own. Full stop. And it was wrong of him to try and trick you into paying by announcing it in front of everyone. You are owed an apology. ",
            "You did the right thing. There is absolutely no reason that you should pay her debts, and if that is a condition of having a relationship with your family, it sucks that you had the misfortune of being born into a company of idiots.\n\nIf it makes you feel better: you sound like the most grounded of all of them.",
            "Dude. Look at my post history and read the post on my inlaws expecting my husband and I to pay up for my BILs honeymoon. For some reason, my inlaws think we owe his brother a piece of our hard earned pie. We don't and you don't. I think your father is jealous of how well you succeeded without a degree and a lot of his identity was probably based on what he could have been had he been privileged enough to get a good education. When you didn't get an education and succeeded anyway you basically ripped that chip right off his shoulder. Your sister followed his advice and ended up in massive debt. I bet if your father had the means he would love to pay it, but he doesn't so to redeem his own pride he wanted you too. This isn't about you it's about your father's pride, identity and self worth. You did nothing wrong and I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. Distance yourself from your father because it looks like he's just waiting for you to fail.",
            "This is all on your dad. He made his bed, he can lie in it. ",
            "Your sister knows what went on and believes you. She should be able to smooth things over with her fianc\u00e9's family. \n\nAside from the fact that the money owed isn't that much for you its a HUGE amount for most other families in this world. How the fuck have they racked up half a million of debt? \n\nIf you can, and you want to, then help your sister out on your own terms and just cut your dad out your life. You've done exceptionally well despite his influence and will continue to do so. Anyone who involves you in something this major without your permission should just be dropped. ",
            "You are absolutely right. This is a matter of principle.\n\n\nYour father pushed your sister to get the education (and the debt). This was his vision, his principle.\n\nNow he is trying to manipulate you into relieving your sister from consequences of his and her past decisions which proves that he was wrong all along and you were right.\n\n\nDon't pay your sister debt. She has extremely valuable education. In 5-10 years she will be able to pay it in full while making 6 figures salary per year. She will not suffer by any means.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why lottery jackpot winners go bankrupt quickly is they keep giving money to their family and friends. Once you gift serious amount of money to somebody all other family members start feeling that they are entitled too: some nephew has serious medical condition, somebody got in accident, somebody opening the business and struggling - list goes on and on. Once you start giving your money away - they never stop asking and there will be even more of family drama.",
            "Your sister is standing up for you. She's on your side. ",
            "You handled this like a champ. If I were you, I would encourage my sister to just go ahead and elope. Eloping gives them a head start on paying off their tremendous debt and it does away with the unstoppable drama train ahead.\n\nAnd, if you don't think you'd miss the 500K, go ahead and take it out, and tuck it away in a long term investment. Should your future partner or child be struck by accident, health issue, or something otherwise unexpected you'll be glad you've nested that egg. \n\nBest to you.",
            "You are getting a lot of validation and psychoanalysis of your Dad but little concrete advice... I have some suggestions I think may help you and everyone move forward.\n\n1. I think you need to arrange another dinner with your sister, future BIL, and his parents without the rest of your family. Apologize for the drama and enjoy a nice, relaxing evening. Don't bring up your wealth or wedding gifts at all, and if someone else brings it up (I can't believe anyone with any manners would) then change the subject.\n\n2. Put yourself in the frame of mind as though your father will never know what you gave them as a gift, that you do not know about their debt, that they are eloping and will have no wedding costs. Then decide on a gift. It may not even be financial; that is fine. Maybe it is a large cash gift that she can put towards her loans, towards her wedding, towards a down payment... Maybe it is a horse. Or a honeymoon. Or a designer wedding dress. Whatever would make you happy to give her, do it, and don't think about the other pressures when deciding.\n\nYour sister is not a victim of her student loans. She signed every paper agreeing to pay back that money, and she was an adult when she did it. And if she chooses to have a large, lavish wedding, she is choosing to spend thousands on that that could make a large dent in her debt. The most important thing here? She knows all of these things, and expects nothing from you. Good for her. \n\nYour father has been analyzed enough here. \n\nNo matter how much wealth you own, you don't owe anyone anything. Being wealthy and coming from a non-wealthy family, this issue often comes up. The question you have to ask yourself is, what level of wealth is it \"okay\" to start assuming family members owe you something? My brother and his wife easily make $100,000 more than me and my husband per year. But it would be apalling for me to expect them to give me money. Yet, at some level of wealth disparity this problem always arises... The answer is never. It is never okay to assume you are entitled to someone else's money. Period. And you should never feel like someone else is entitled to your money. That way, gifts can be given and received with joy, not out of obligation.\n\nSo, give your sister a wedding gift that gives you joy to give her. And tell your father your finances are none of his business, and you will not discuss it with him further. Ever.",
            "Here's the thing.\n\nYour sister and BIL are GROWN ASS ADULTS. They decided to get the loans, they can fucking pay them off. That is not your problem. At all.\n\nFor your father to even consider asking that is completely ridiculous. If he placed such a high value on her getting an education, he should be the one helping her pay the loans down if needed. You are her brother, not her damn parent. Your money is YOURS and its being rude how your father is acting. \n\nFuck your dad. I feel bad for your sister too because he not only managed to tarnish your reputation, but hers too. If I was your sister I would elope and not include him in anything. \n\nI would let your sister know that your father did that without you agreeing to it in any way, shape, or form. If she needs help, she can ask like any grown mature person, and accept whatever the answer may be. \n\nYour dad has such a shitty attitude. And after reading through your post a few times, I know its jealousy. \n\nHe obviously invested alot into education, pushed your sister to do the same, and then you wound up with more than he could have ever dreamed. That's jealousy. \n\nDon't let his jealousy and rudeness ruin your relationship with your sister. And DO NOT give any of them any money unless it is 100% okay with you on every level.",
            "It's awesome that your sister is taking your side, no questions asked. She sounds awesome.\n\nYou father on the other hand is a piece of work. What a shit head. Don't back down. There's lots of good advice here, but do not compromise with him on this. If you compromise, it should be with your sister only.\n\nGood luck, and I'm sorry that some people in your life just see you as a wallet. It seems to be the en vogue thing on reddit these days.",
            "That is so far over the line that I wonder if there might not have been some sort of mitigating factor.\n\n> just before dinner my father pulls me off to one side, tells me that sister and BIL have a combined student loan debt of nearly $500k (WTF!!) and it would be really nice if I \u201cdid something for the family for once\u201d and paid it off for them as a wedding gift ...

When he said you \"should\" give them the money, did you say \"no, I will not do that\" or \"I'll have to think about that\", or did you just kind of not respond?\n\nIf you didn't respond, he could have taken that as assent. Obviously he shouldn't have (very, very, very shouldn't have) but there's a huge difference between deliberate railroading and an honest - albeit thermonuclear - fuckup.",
            "You obviously didn't get rich by giving away $500k anytime a blood relative just expected you to do it. Clearly you have more sense than that. I am a woman with a brother, and your situation sounds a good deal like his: no matter what he did, my dad was quick to criticize him and to praise me. Is this a common family dynamic?\nI digress. How totally out of line for him to say you don't deserve the money you earned. He's just butthurt 'cause you blew a hole in his worldview. I'm with another wise commenter: pay for a nice wedding as that's what YOU wanted to do in the first place, and go nc with Dad until he gets his head on straight. Not that I believe education should cost as much as it does, but why should your sister not work to pay off her debt? She doesn't seem to want you to shell out for it. She's competent and can make her way in the world just like you did. Why would your Dad assume she can't? Your Dad's meddling. I'd be mad, too",

            "oh your dad is stupid. Your sister was not in on it, so there\u2019s no reason at all that it should negatively influence your relationship with her.\n\nIf I was you, I\u2019d help your sister with her debt (if the expense is trivial for you), but make absolutely sure your parents are never informed of this. And then I\u2019d probably stop seeing your dad for a few years.\n\nAnd congrats on the success with the entrepreneurship.",
            "The way your father put you on the spot is horrible. You did the right thing leaving. \r  \rI would go low contact or no contact with your father until he apologizes to you and the rest of your / future BIL's family. \r  \rIf you want to help your sister out, stay in contact with her, and do it on your own terms. \r  \rFor example, let's say they get married, and find stable jobs. You could buy a house (still in your name) and have them live in it rent free while taking care of it. This would free up rent / a mortgage while they could focus on paying off their student debt.  \r  \rIn the end, it is your hard earned money, and you can do whatever the hell you want with it. ",
            "The gall of some people. Holy smokes.\n\nPaying 25k toward her wedding was unbelievably generous. It was her decision to get 500k in debt. If you wanted to do that of your own accord, that would be one thing. But their presumptuousness is out of this world.",
            "Their debt isn't your problem and you aren't the family piggie bank. Your dad is an ass for springing that on you and going around telling everyone that you would pay off their debt. I'm glad it blew up in his face.",
            "It might almost be better to let your sister elope, then pay off the debts anyways just to stick it to your parents - sort of a \"I can do this because I want to help my sister, not because you're scummy asshats.\"",
            "Your dad wants to feel like the hero without the work and sacrifice. Like the type of guy that has a business idea and will you provide the effort and money for a 50% partnership. \nIn his mind, he got you to pay, so that counts as helping his other daughter. The one that followed his mental rules to life. \nHe highly resents you for breaking his perceived mental rules for life and succeeding. (It also means his life rules are wrong and he can't admit that to himself.) If you had not been a success, he would have also made you feel awful the rest of your life for not listening to him. ",
            "Why does your dad think you have the ability to give your sister $500k?  Exactly.  These people (at least your dad) are greedy a-holes.  Never mention money again to them.  Not what you have.  Not what you sold your last company for.  Nothing.  You thought you would stick your dad's nose in your success and this is what it brought you.  Your business is not their business.",
            "For my wedding, I had to pay for everything and did not get a single gift worth more than $100. $25k sounds like a ludicrous amount, let alone 500k. Can I be your family member? I'll send you a christmas card and everything, new big brother !",
            "Everyone's focused on how much debt it is, if some of it was federal student loans it'll be forgiven after 10 or 20 years depending where they choose to work. So paying off $500k is possibly dumb, if they themselves won't have to pay that full amount.\n\nYour sister sounds like a solid ally. Don't let your dad being an ass ruin you relationship with her and her husband.",
            "Major kudos to your sister because she is handling this like a champ. I would talk to her and tell her you appreciate that she isn't trying to take advantage of you. Since you had already planned on giving her 25k, I would still do so. Tell her she's your sister and you love her and while you can't pay off her debts, you want to help her and her new husband get off to a comfortable start. 25k can be a deposit on a house for some people, or it's a great way for them to have a cushion. It's not your responsibility to pay her debts, and 25k is extremely generous. \n\nAlso, I guarantee that your sister isn't blaming you for what happened, she is blaming your parents, who are to blame. ",
            "Let's say you did pay off the $500k, then what? Wont your sister and BIL feel indebted to you forever? It's sets up such an inequality that will likely will ruin your relationship with either or both of them. ",
            "Bro, my dad is very similar.  We had a crap relationship when I lived with him as a teen.  We had a 'working' relationship when I was an adult living away and we didn't need to interact much.  The relationship turned crap when I had to have more interaction with him for family functions like yours.  \n\nAfter years of trying to make it work and compromise so we'd have SOME kind of relationship and letting it affect my own family's health I saw there was no end game other than my pops getting everything he wants.  I realized he was a high school drama queen trapped in a grown mans body.\n\nI cut him out and things have never been better for me.  I still love him but I've stopped allowing him to set the parameters of our relationship.  If he decides he's willing to be a part of my life according to the rules I've set I'll welcome him back.\n\nDon't let toxic people fuck up your shit.  Even if they're related to you.",
            "This is between you and your sister. Cut dad out of your life if you have to because he is a piece of crap for doing this. On the other hand your sister was innocent and the amount that you are willing to give to them should be between ONLY you and them. If you decide to help at all, nobody else needs to know. This is ridiculous.",
            "OP, \n\n\nYOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE ANY MONEY TO YOUR SISTER'S WEDDING NOR FOR THEIR COMBINED UNIVERSITY DEBT \n\n\nYou are under no obligation to give your sister any money whatsoever. Your parents should be the ones giving her money OR her fiance's parents. I'm going to be quite frank with you, your family of origin did not teach you nor model for you what love is. Giving money does not equate to love and the choice to not give money is not sign that you love your sister any less. \n\n\nLove is accepting another person for who they are, for what they do, for being enriched by having them in your life. You were never given what other children or young people experience in terms of unconditional love from your parents. You're still not shown love by your father. His 'love' or should I say approval of you is based around whether or not you do certain things that he wants you to do. That quite simply put: IS NOT LOVE. \n\n\nI can't believe these comments discussing how much you should give and whether there should or should not conditions? Those people have bought into this false assumption that you need to give money to show love or to give money if you have it to another family member. Given these assumptions, I'm not surprised that you're now feeling an obligation to contribute a significant amount of money. \n\n\nSo, I would discuss with your sister your intention to support her wedding by giving her a gift. You are not responsible for your sibling's higher education debt and even less responsible for her fiance's. You may want or need your money for something else. You may need it for a new business enterprise, you may need it for your wedding (if you get married), you may need it for your children, it really doesn't matter, it is your money. No one else in your family can tell you nor should they even attempt to tell you what to do with your money. Best wishes and stay strong. \n\n\nTL;DR - You were not shown what love is in your family of origin. People are equating giving money as a sign of love. \n\n\nEdit: grammar and sentence structure",

He was wrong to lie about you by saying you'd agreed and then changed your mind. Literally everything your dad did was wrong. You didn't screw this up at all.

It will be because of your father, if it does indeed get ruined. He started this mess. He can blame you all he wants but that won't change the fact that it's his fault. He resents your success; you had no college education, same as him, but you managed to become very successful and he did not. That's what this is about. And that's *his* problem, not yours. Don't let him make it yours. Don't accept the premise or the blame. ",

Focus on the relationship that has been the most consistently rewarding and nurture your bond with your sister. After things have calmed down a bit and your sister decides what she wants to do about her wedding, and if you still feel inclined to offer money, then offer her the money without strings, to be spent as she wishes. Whether she pays off student debt or puts it towards a lavish wedding ($25,000 is a ridiculous amount to spend on a party IMHO) your generosity will surely be appreciated.",
            "Wow, your dad is a complete fuck head. He's coincidentally the exact opposite of my father - who would think being a successful entrepreneur at your age would be on the same level as being elected to the Senate. I'm not even kidding.\n\nThe way your dad went about this makes me think he's jealous, bitter, and envious of your success and position. I feel terrible for your sister. \n\nYou said you were willing to go up to 25k for the wedding, and given your financial resources I think that is perfectly reasonable - I'd offer to buy them a honeymoon trip with that money. \n\nAs for your dad, send him a message and tell him that until he apologizes he will not be a part of your life. ",
            "> Was I totally out of line?\n\nNo. Not the least bit. I won't fault your father for asking but after you said no he had no right to tell people you would be paying off both of their debt. He also had no right to tell them about your money.\n\nHe and anybody who asks, now that they think they know, needs to understand that any money you have isn't fun money for you. It is your next investment, seed money, collateral for a loan, etc. for your next business venture.\n\nI advice moving forward is to stop speaking one on one with your father unless it is necessary, at least until he understands how he screwed up. Perhaps have your sister, mother, or other trusted family member there.\n\nNext since things are a little odd with her and her fiances family it might help to get to know him a little better. Something that is separate from the rest of your family. Perhaps some long weekend you can meet them somewhere.\n\nI would call your sister and just talk things out. Discuss a little bit about your money so there isn't misunderstanding. Again I would use what I said earlier, let her know you do have some money but it is all budgeted for business stuff so you really \"don't have it\" to pay off her college debts. If you are still willing to help with the wedding let her know. Tell her that you set aside $10K or $25K or whatever number you are comfortable with. If you are comfortable with her using it for other reasons if she elopes let her know you are ok giving it to her for the college loan or first house. \n\nAs far as asking her to apologize to the family. That is up to you and maybe her. But perhaps you'll want to be seated somewhere other than your father at the wedding.",
            "You aren't responsible for your sibling choices. Keep your money.  Tell your family and just cut them I\nOff if they object. Your dad is trying to make you do what should have been his responsibility. \n\nWeddings are a waste of money. ",
            "As one fraternal twin to another, my advice is don't do it.  Don't even give a loan.  From then on you'll always be the brother with money and you're setting a precedent that you'll bail them out if they get into trouble.  Your sister and her fiance are a couple of lawyers.  They should definitely have known that if they are going to finance their education with debt then they would have to pay it off sometime.   Would you pay their mortgage off for them too?  How about paying for their kid's college?  Don't be surprised if they come to you hat-in-hand for every large expense because you \"have the money.\"\n\nThe reality is you made your money on your own.  You took risks just as much as she did by financing her education through debt.  If she's smart things will work out for her.  It's not like lawyers make chump change.  \n\nAlso, your father ruined the wedding, not you.  Don't beat yourself up over it.  ",
            "This is rage inducing. Your dad is a first class asshole. Cut ties with him. If you pay up, he will leech off you forever.",
            "Dad sounds like a huge dick.  ",
            "Vultures, the lot of them. Money brings out the worst in people. You did nothing wrong and you don't owe anyone a dime. Hold your ground and stay true to your convictions. Can I have some money?",
            "I'm sorry dude, that sucks. The sad thing is I bet he probably wouldn't do that if the roles were reversed and your sister was doing well, but you weren't. I feel like he's using favoritism, but idk your family enough. Hopefully not, and he would ask your sister to do the same. Is that something he ever mentioned growing up? Help your family?",
            "Damn. That's a lot of money. To ask someone to pay off half a million in debt is ridiculous. And to then say that you don't deserve it is even worse! You worked hard and you earned that money. And its your right to choose how you spend it. It sounds like your dad is an asshole who is jealous of your wealth. Your sister sounds really cool though.   \n   \nI think you handled the situation perfectly fine.",
            "I'd like to add that even if you wanted to pay off her debt, why would you pay off her fiances debt??\n",
            "Their debt isn't your problem...if you paid it they'd just ask for another half-million dollars so their kids can go to law school. Best set a reasonable limit now, like you did.\n\nHow did you learn what you needed to know to start your businesses?",
            "Your dad is an idiot. First, has no belief in you to do anything with your life, then when you do have success, (bet you $5 he still doesn't believe it if you really got a deep answer out of him) he wants you to give up all the money that the supposedly successful sister should have had (in reflection of him and his \"grand duties and advice\" as a father).  He sounds very narcissistic, manipulative, and to ask another important question - why isn't he putting in his own money to pay that debt off? He sounds like a loudmouth / blowhard. \n\nDon't get bullied into this. Do with what YOU want with your money. It sounds like you're willing to help out with the wedding but I'd also recommend you paying directly for wedding related expenses. Don't just hand over a check! \n\n\n",
            "Obviously your dad was out of line and you'll have to come to grips with how you want to handle that relationship going forward.  As for your sister, in your comments you've said you love her, have a good relationship with her, and are now concerned about her debt level.  We don't know your financial situation and truly how much 'extra' money  you have available.  If you truly feel worried about your sister's financial position, take a good look at yours, decide what you are comfortable with, and just TALK to her about what's going on.  Are they both employed? Are they able to make the payments?  Can they afford a house as well as the student loans?   Have they started any retirement accounts/savings?   \n\nYou've worked hard for your money  and no one has giving you a free ride.   But, in your heart, it's OK to want to help your sister, who you love and care about.  It's OK if you want to give them a bit for their wedding, it's OK if you want to pay off her loans (or all), and it's OK to not do anything.  We can't tell you what to do.  Everyone's family dynamics are different.  Decide what you can easily afford and not jeopardize future plans, decide what you're comfortable with, and then have a private talk with your sister (without the fiance) and have an honest talk about how her financial life is right now.",
            "You don't owe them anything really. This is your hard earned money. Your sister is pretty well qualified. I'm sure she'll be able to handle her situation well. ",
            "Fuck your dad, he's an asshole, that's all ",
            "I don't think anyone should feel compelled to pay down their families debts just because they have the money. You don't get and stay rich by spending money like water, your Dad is harsh and shouldn't have done any of that to you. I dunno what you should do aside from not paying down her debts, maybe take a break from your Dad for a bit :/",

            "Sounds like your sister wasn't in on the whole shebang, so don't hold it against her. You can (if you want) help her out with the 25k you wanted to gift anyway, but you're in no way obligated to give away half a million dollars. Your father is a pompous, self-righteous jerk that thinks he can still push you around like you're still a boy",
            "Your dad is delusional. If I were you,  I couldn't be in the same room with him.  He wants you to take care of your sister's debts despite his disdain for your life choices. WTF? If he's such a big, wise man he should pay off his daughter's debt. It shouldn't even be your responsibility to pay for her wedding, much less her and her fianc\u00e9's ridiculous law school loans.  The fact that you were expecting to be expected by your father to pay for the wedding,  and you were willing to do it,  seems like he already has you brain washed into doing more than a brother should ever do for his sister. ",
            "I have student loans of 16k, by the way you're paying them off. I told my friends already.",
            "> Should I just have kept my mouth shut and paid up?\n\nFuck no. NEVER. Even your 25k scenario is a bit much. I am in a similar situation as yours: sister cannot set $1 aside for the life of her. All I do is pay $2-3k for my niece's school each year, whenever I feel like it or if they ask nicely. You are living your life, not theirs.",
            "She and her husband both have law degrees, they're not going to have a problem paying off their student loans. No, you absolutely should not give them half a million fucking dollars as a wedding gift, that's insane. You've done well for yourself and worked hard, your dad is being an ass and I my guess is he has a huge chip on his shoulder because he has never and will never be able to provide for his family the way you will be able to provide for yours when you decide to settle down. You are, at 31 years old, far more successful than he will ever be. Unfortunately, instead of him being proud of how you've done for yourself, he's gone the other route and become an entitled jerk. \n\nYour sister seems to understand that this was your dad's fault, not yours. You don't need to do this, but if you wanted to, you could always send a nice letter to your future BIL's parents apologizing for what happened at that dinner and that you weren't prepared to be put on the spot like that, and that this type of behavior is not something that is normal for the family. As I said, you don't have to do this, but it would be a really nice gesture for your sister. Because let's be honest, if I were one of BIL's parents I would be a little wierded out about what happened too. And the consideration of writing them and apologizing would go a LONG way towards relieving them of any negative first impressions they have. Oh, and if you are going to do this, get some nice stationary and write the letter by hand, it sends a message that you are sincere and didn't just shoot them an email when you had a couple minutes.",
            "You handled the situation like a champ. Don't speak to your dad about money, he clearly sees you as an atm and to him, you can only show your worth by giving your hard earned money to the family. He's acting truly outrageous and honestly such interactions are beneath you. \n\nNow your sister seems to have been as clueless as you were about this whole thing. If you want to do something nice for her and not feel like you are giving in to your father you might consider buying them a nice surprise honeymoon. It would be a gift that's totally acceptable and wouldn't feel like you were forced into anything. That and they will always be appreciative of the experience you provided that they wouldn't otherwise have been able to get on their own. \n\nDon't feel bad about their super high school debt amount. They are both lawyers and should be able to pay that off in just a few years and still have a great standard of living. In ten years you and your sister will both be millionaires and looking back on this it will be no big deal. The experience of paying off your own school debt is one that I think makes people mature in a way that might otherwise never occur. It's good for her to be responsible and take care of it and she has the means to do so. \n\nHope this works out for you man, you sound like a good guy and totally deserving of your success. ",
            "Honestly you're handling this much better than I would have. You worked hard to earn your wealth, and your sister worked hard to earn her debt. It's not your responsibility to take any of that off her hands, and it certainly is not your responsibility to waive the debt of a man you barely know. For your father to expect that of you is genuinely appalling. Clearly you know how to handle your money just fine, or else you wouldn't be where you are now. It's already wildly generous of you to intend on contributing the 25k, but don't feel obligated to do so  just because of your father's condescending nature. You have every right to choose how and when to spend it, if at all. ",
            "I might of missed something but it seems like your sister handled this okay. It's your dad that's really the fuck up here.\n\nIf it were me, which it isn't so who cares, I would cut my dad out of this discussion and try to talk to him about boundaries, which he likely won't take anything away from, then talk to my sister about helping her out. Maybe paying off their loans in a big lump sum as gift isn't the best course, but if you want to help your sister I'm sure there's another way you could help her out that would work well for the both of you.\n\nI think it would also be worthwhile to find out how much of the student debt belongs to your sister and how much belongs to her fiance. It doesn't really matter that much since their finances will be melded but I'd still like to know this if it was me.\n\nA thought experiment that might help you figure out exactly what you want to do is try and think about how you would of reacted if you had just casually found out that your sister and her fiance have all this debt. Pretend that your dad wasn't sticking his nose where it doesn't belong and what you would of done then.",
            "Your dad is to blame for all this he went around telling people without your consent your sisters loans are not your responsibility ",
            "You weren't out of line at all. Walking out of there was exactly the right action to take. Fuck the lot of them. You owe them NOTHING. If your sis and BIL have all that education surely they can get some jobs and pay off the loans THEY incurred.",

Whether you have $5 or $5million - those dollars are yours.\n\nYour dad wants to look big and powerful and he went grandstanding and now everyone knows he's a fraud. Good.\n\nYour sister also did the eigrightht thing and her not wanting your dad around after this is a solid boundary and also natural consequences for your dad's behavior. You should not get between her and your parents - they owe you a huge apology but they also owe her a huge apology for creating drama and taking attention for themselves at an event that should have been about her.",
            "So you're supposed to gift your sister's future husband a couple hundred k?\n\nUm, no.",
            "You did the completely right thing. Fuck your dad. With a metal spork.",
            "Check out the comments on the thread about the mother committing her daughter's work (carved boxes) to charity auction without asking her. \n\nAll the replies apply to you as well. \n\nFuck that noise and your father who wanted some glory at your cost.",
            "Seriously, fuck your father. He's being no kind of a parent to you and is about as brazenly rude as I've ever heard of a person being. He assumed that you would be giving away half a million dollars without even asking you about it, but *you're* the one there's something wrong with? I'm sorry, but your father is a total ahole.",
            "Where they there when \"you\" were struggling?  Your father does not get to dictate how you spend your hard earned money.  Do not pay for your SIL and BIL's debts.  They are grown adults and can figure it out for themselves.  The only one who looks stupid here is your father.  I would limit contact with them since he feels \"entitled\" to your money.",
            "If I were you I'd go no-contact with your dad until he apologizes. In the meantime, if your sister is truly serious about eloping, maybe you could offer to pay for a vacation for a small amount of people to go somewhere she's always wanted to go, but never been able to afford to do so.",
            "I think you should go no contact with your dad.\n\nI think, if you're willing, you can/could still offer your sister that $25,000 since she appears to be innocent. \n\nPerhaps, though, since you are successful, if you want to help your sister, perhaps you can help her find investment opportunities, she might be able to pay off her own debt more quickly.

            "So... You father seems to still hold you in contempt and has zero remorse about what he has been doing.\n\nHere's my advise on how to deal with that, based on how insaw my gf dealt with her narcissist father.\n\nHer father has always been vile and verbally abusive to her family. Even when he was \"nice\" he would still sporadically throw out some insults at my gf, which she would just deal with because she was used to it. One day though, not long after she met me, she decided that she's bad enough and she started to completely ignore him. Even if they were in the same house in the same room, she would pretty much ignore his existence. For several months he went through various stages of anger about it: at first he would go on profane rants, he would pretend like nothing happened, he would play the victim etc. My gf ended up starting to talk with him a year later, and he hasn't insulted her once since.\n\nThe point is, he assumes that he can do whatever and won't face any consequences because he's your father, and its not like you can just cut your father out of your life. You need tonshow him that his actions have consequences, and that ifnhe doesn't change he won't have you in his life anymore.\n\nMaybe write a short email explaining how you feel, and why you think his actions are wrong, and then just ignore him forna good long while until he gets over this whole situation and apologized.",

Sister did not ask me to do so nor did she know anything about it until it was sprung upon her at the dinner.

What you work out between you and your sister is your business, but with the lack of respect that your parents show for you, I think you need to reevaluate your relationship with them. I also think that you need to be blunt and tell them that they are never to do anything like this again or else you will not have a relationship with them.

I have co-workers who have $1 to 2 million mortgages, and they do fine.\n\nI do not feel that they need to be \"rescued\" and their debt is completely normal for their educational background.  Erasing the debt will frankly spoil an experience they need to go through.  They need to live within their means and be able to plan and handle their own lives.\n\nThat said, you can talk to your sister about all this.

Further, your father needs to apologize for what he did. It was outrageous and you cannot have a relationship with a man like that. \n\nIf you pay this money your family will come to you for a free handout whenever they get the chance. And don't think that if you DO pay it that it will change how your family behaves. When your dad wants to retire in a beautiful condo that he can't afford, guess who he's gonna expect to pay for it?  And things like this will happen all the time. You want to get into the big leagues, right? This kind of shit will hamper your goals. \n\nYou cannot let your father get away with such a disgusting thing. It was one thing to ask you to do it, but telling your sister and the fianc\u00e9 that you WOULD was horrible.  \n\nI am a young person making a lot of money, albeit not as much as you (six figures, not eight), and I can promise you that money will not buy behavior modification. It will just make your family a bunch of spoiled brats, in the way a 10 year old would act. Your dad believes that you should share this money with him and thinks he's entitled to to it, even though he didn't believe it you. Don't let him get away with it. \nCongratulations, however, on your success. I hope you continue to succeed. \n\n\n\n",
            "This is 100% your dad's fuckup.  That is your money to determine how you want to give it away, not his.  He may think it would be wonderful for you to give all your money to some bullshit charity that gives AIDS to turtles, that doesn't mean you have to do it.\n\nSecondly, your sister chose a career path that required a lot of education.  She knew what she was getting herself into when she started.  And the result is that she will be rewarded financially in the future.  Her choice, just like it was your choice to go your path.\n\nIf it were me and I came into a bunch of money, I would try to help my family out.  There are times that my parents have given/loaned me money, I know my sister could use money, but I wouldn't just wipe out all of the debts that they've incurred because of their own decisions.    For example, my sister has a son, who because of my sister and BIL's salaries, will probably be limited in educational opportunities (I see educational including travelling to learn about new cultures, not just schooling). So if I had the money I would set up some kind of trust for him.  Not sure if there is something similar you could do, to show that you are giving back (if you want to) without just writing a blank check to the family for every time they want something?\n\n",
            "If you are inclined to do so, you could always pay off her loans under the condition that she keep it between you and her.  That way your dad doesn't see pressuring you in to paying for stuff as something he can do.  It seems to me your sister might appreciate it but doesn't assume it's your responsibility to pay for her debt.  In other words, I think she may be a normal human.  You probably could even just pay a decent chunk of it and take a huge burden off them.  That being said you don't need to feel like this is something you have to do.  It is your money.  You earned it.  She looks like she will love you regardless.",
            "Fk yo dad, as much as you may hate it, I am still gonna hate it, people that didn't receive enough education always tends to think like this, always stuck in his own way",
            "I don't have anything unique to throw in that hasn't already been said, just wanted to cast my vote that you were completely right and your dad is completely in the wrong. You don't owe anyone anything, and I get the feeling that if you didn't have money, your dad would be treating you poorly for not going the formal-education route. You can't win with him.",
            "If it really is about the principle of you being expected to pay off their debts (which is completely valid), you could wait and help them with it down the road after the wedding. You don't actually have any moral obligation to pay it off but if you want to then that could be a way to do it in which it would be by your own volition and not because of someone else's expectation. ",
            "You are right. Her decisions are her decisions, not yours. You don't work for them. ",
            "Do you have 500k lying around? Do you really want to help your sister by paying all that money which she and her husband put themselves into?\n\nYou dad is a jerk for railroading you into paying their massive debt.",
            "1) How can you ever be expected to give a 500k wedding gift? And how is that equivalent with doing something for the family for once?\n\n2) How are you expected to pay for your BIL's debt? You have no apparent relationship with the guy?\n\n3) Why does your dad feel you don't do anything for your family?\n\n4) What, if you were asked like an adult, would you like to give to your sister? What would you like to give to your BIL?\n\nThere is no guarantee this thing is going to last and you do not know this guy or his family. If you still have some interest in helping them maybe you can pay off some (or all) of your sister's debt (not simply giving them a lump sum) and create a trust for both of them that they will have access to in the future. This is beyond presumptuous. Your father clearly has little respect for you and may be jealous.",
            "What the hell is wrong with your father thinking that it's okay to expect YOU to pay a half-million dollars of someone else's debt??!??!?!!",
            "You say you have the money and wouldn't really miss it.  The question, then, is, do YOU want to give it to your sister?  If so, do it.  If not, don't. \n\nIf you want to give a smaller amount, do that instead.  But don't do anything because you were \"railroaded.\"  It sounds as if you have no good relationship with your father (parents?) anyway--you may want to work on that or not.  Your sister seems as if your relationship with her won't be damaged either way.  \n\nYou, my friend, have some soul-searching to do.  ",
            "your father sounds like Lord Cuck",
            "As someone who has supported her sister because her parents couldn't (our mother is a fuck up) and just recently stopped. I cannot tell you the overwhelming relief I feel about not being obligated to support her. ",
            "fuck them",
            "Employ her. Offer her a nice salary and then tell her that you'll pay the debt off after a certain number of years. That way you know you have a *right hand man, so to speak, that you can trust working by your side. That's what I would do. ",
            "You did NOTHING WRONG!  You have a screwed up, Dad. I do, too. I feel your pain. god, it hurts but stand your ground!  \n\n",
            "Your sister should now refuse to let your father pay for the wedding. And then you and her arrange it and you pay for it. Cut him out of the planning, etc., and just send him an invite without any more information.\n\nThat will upset his role as the father of the bride. He will learn from someone else how generous you're being by paying for the wedding and be ashamed.\n\nAs for your sister and BIL's student debt... that's their problem they went to college now get good jobs that will pay for it.",
            "It probably would have been better if you hadn't said anything in front of your future in-laws (your sister seems innocent here and it really sucks that she was embarrassed in front of them through no fault of her or your own), but you can hardly be blamed for reacting poorly to something as insane as your dad telling everybody you're giving away half a million dollars.\n\nAs for what you can do now--well, a lot of that depends on your sister. If she and a wedding weren't involved, I'd be inclined to let your dad stew in his wrongdoing for awhile and keep contact limited for the time being. But if your sister wants things to blow over, I think it would be kind of you to talk with your dad and see if you can reach a resolution, if only for her sake. \n\nThe larger question is whether or not this is something your dad's done before--you said he's been shitty about your lack of college education, but has he promised your money and time without your knowledge before? Does he tell lies about you or bully you in other ways? If this is a one-off, then perhaps you can shrug and move on. If it's a pattern of behavior, it's worth evaluating the extent to which you want to maintain a relationship with your father. I'm sure someone has already recommended /r/raisedbynarcissists. It sounds like you may have a golden child (sis) and scapegoat (you) dynamic with your dad. \n\nFinally, if you're planning on blowing $25k, I just want you to know that my student loan debt is a mere $5k. Just saying. ",
            "It really sucks that your success has tainted your family relationships but it sounds like the heart of it is your sister and dad's relationship.  Just keep in contact with her and make it clear that your dad has to come to you to apologize.\n\nBut yeah, don't pay a cent until the drama gets at least some closure.",
            "I just think it's hilarious that you have to point out that you, a male, are not identical twins with your sister, a female. \n\nAlso, I think you and your sister need to do damage control together. Your dad is the bad guy here. ",
            ">Long story short, I said a few things I probably shouldn't have...\n\nIn this scenario, I could justify you saying ANYTHING.  Kudos to your sister for sticking up for you.  My heart is warmed by sibling loyalty.\n\nFor the sake of the family, perhaps you could - not should - could consider talking to your sister to reconsider.  She has shown you loyalty, so having her understand that having her parents at her wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that she may regret not having them there.  Do it for HER, not them.  You'd only have to deal with your father for a day or two for the wedding.  Do it for HER, not them.  I'm praying for you, bud.",
            "Is your dad mad that he can't pay his daughters student debt and wedding? Why the fuck is it his sons job?! Shitty dad. That is appalling he would do that no matter the money you have. Maybe he's embarrassed.",
            "he's an entitled ass who caused a huge problem by trying to spend your money (seriously, $500k? that's a nice place in the city where i am) and then making you to be the bad guy/fixer when it blows up.\n\nadvice? dunno, if they elope, can you get on the guest list? dad can lie in his own bed.",
            "From the way you speak about this, I would guess that you are (unintentionally) very good at rationalizing your father's behavior for him, and your first instinct is to take guilt and blame on yourself for when there is a confrontation with him.\n\nYour father appears to be used to being able to do this to you, and expected that it is the way things work that he can just force you to do this, and lie about you and your motives when his narcissistic manipulation is not capitulated to. \n\nMy apologies to you and your sister for having to deal with him. Please just stress to anyone involved that you had never offered to pay off the student loan debt and the father had lied and told everyone it is something you had agreed to beforehand. Cut off as much of his credibility as possible. Do so in a matter of fact way.",

            "Don't have much to say but just wanted to add congrats on your hard work. ",
            "Your dad is an absolute mess. Your story gives me the impression that parents don't seem to know how to truly respect their children; even at 31 years old he still somehow thought it was okay to presume you'd pay your sister's debts and just go ahead and tell everyone before even getting your agreement. \n\nAnd then to go and tell everyone that you had agreed and just changed your mind when you never knew about it in the first place? Ridiculous.",
            "I'm only writing this because so many other people are taking the other side. \n\nI think it might be worth some time to consider helping your sister out. Maybe that's not writing a check, maybe it is. I say that because I think, in one way or another, your dad helped you out. You obviously love your sister and entire family. \n\nThat money isn't infinite. But I think if you can work something out, while making clear this is for you'll be better in the long run. This seems like a petty thing to come between family. ",
            "The biggest asshole in this situation is your dad.\n\nYou aren't wrong in feeling upset at all. It's not even about the money, it's the way your father approached you - he's asking for an indirect favor, but instead of coming from that angle, he approached you in a way that made it clear that he had no respect for you or sense of how significant and generous that gift would be. He didn't ask; he simply volunteered you up for the task with no words of gratitude or recognition of the gift of you'd be making, but rather as if you \"owed\" the family something. Of course that tone and the assumptions he made as well as forcing you into this situation would make anyone furious! The sense of entitlement in his approach is just mind-boggling. It raised my blood temperature just reading this post - it reminds me of my own parents' approaches so much. He was incredibly un-diplomatic and clearly has no negotiator or people skills.",
            "What the fuck? You're like the least obligated person involved to be paying any amount of money in this situation for any reason. 500k? I'd have laughed in my dad's face. My family is fucking loaded and I'd be ecstatic to receive $500 for a wedding gift. The fact that he just offered up half a million of your hard earned dollars is a crime. He essentially tried to bully you into giving up your money. I'm glad you stood your ground. He thought if he told everyone you'd do it that you'd be too embarrassed to say no. Not that it isn't petty, but I'd offer to reimburse the entire cost of the wedding under the condition that dad wasn't invited just out of spite.",

The only family drama here is caused by your parents, they're just trying to deflect responsibility. Tell them their beef is with your sister, if they want her to forgive them they should apologize to her. Then call your sister and empathize over having shithead parents. If you think you'll get a reasonable answer, ask her if there's anything you can do to support her through this.",
            "Uhhh no. What you should do is cut off your parents, your sister should uninvite them from the wedding and live happily ever after. Also let your sister know you'd love to contribute to the costs of the wedding (if you want to)",
            "Your initial instinct is usually correct. Your father should have talked to you first about any gift-giving and it is your decision how you spend your money.

I'll wager there are several reasons she wants to elope and/or not have your family there and most of those reasons have nothing to do with you.  And why are you offering to pay for her wedding? Don't do that.  She incurred the student debt, she wants to get married ...she has to pay her way. She's not a pauper, she's capable of making coin, let her.

I would not pay anyone's 500k dept, especially my sisters boyfriends education.",
            "Well, the drama aside,  if you want to do as your father wishes,  I would only pay the sister's debt, not the fiance's. (I personally wouldn't pay it at all if in the same circumstance.) And I wouldn't pay it off in a traditional way. This is her debt after all.  You could tell her that as long as you are financially able to, every month she makes the minimum payment,  you will pay the interest portion of the loan,  so that her payment goes towards principle.  For example,  the minimum payment is $1000, $700 of which is interest.  She pays $1000. You pay $700. That way $1000 goes towards principle instead of $300.",

        "selftext": "He has a Vietnamese Centipede (google it) and it came with him when we got our first apartment together a few months ago. He's into exotic animals so this is his idea of a pet. I didn't mind, *as long as it never left the tank*. Now it's got out somehow.\n\nThe problem is we'd been going to have his brother, SIL and niece over to visit today. His niece is at the \"crawling everywhere\" stage. These centipedes are very aggressive and will bite if startled or not handled properly. I said he should cancel the visit until the centipede is found. Or at least warn them!\n\nHe said no it's not a big deal. What? There's a baby going to be crawling all over with a venomous centipede on the loose? He said she could provoke it into coming out of hiding, then he'd jump in and get it before it could hurt her.\n\nThis is fucking insane to me. I get he wants to find his pet, I want it found too but how is it acceptable to put a child at risk?? So I told him if he didn't tell his brother then I would and they could decide if they came. He said \"Fine whatever\" and hasn't spoken to me since that this morning. He DID go call them then, and predictably they didn't want to come. We rescheduled, but he's still annoyed at me...for taking safety seriously?\n\nWe've still kept looking for the centipede but I can feel his annoyance at me. Is there something I did wrong?\n\n*Tl;dr* My bf's Vietnamese centipede escaped it's tank. When I told him we should cancel a visit from his family who has a young child, he didn't think it was a big deal. Ended up telling them anyway but he's irritated at me. I don't think I did anything wrong by bringing up safety concerns. What's up with his reaction?\n\n**Edit, how things stand as of 10 pm:** Still no centipede. The apartment isn't that big (3 rooms, 1 closet) and we've checked literally everywhere, no square foot has been unturned. And yes we stripped the bed and sorted through every piece of laundry. We live in a very large and very old building, hundreds of residents. At this point we think it likely got into a crack somewhere in the wall or gone down a vent. The building isn't exactly up on its repairs.\n\nI did calmly tell my boyfriend we needed to talk about his reaction. I told him the phrasing some of you used, that he was basicly saying \"Let's use my niece as bait and lure it out.\" He hadn't seen it like that but when I said so he realized it was true. He apologized for being huffy at me, and for his astoundingly braindead idea about his niece. He said he was panicking and mad at himself for not securing the tank right, and acted defensive. Now that he's cooled off he realizes he was in the wrong. He knows he messed up, I told him if he wants an exotic pet again it MUST be a safe one. At least an escaped iguana or stick insect couldn't hurt anyone. He agreed to this.\n\nThank you to everyone who offered advice!!\n\n**And edit again, ~10:30 Monday night** Hi everyone, I never expected there to be so many comments, I haven't had a chance to read them since last night but I have a few messages from people wanting to know if it's been found so I just wanted to say that no it unfortunately hasn't. We've pretty much given it up as gone now. Who knows maybe it'll find it's way back somehow but unlikely. Also thought I'd let you know my bf decided to hold off on taking on any other pet exotic or not for a while until he has the time to do a lot of research on how to care for one properly and be more responsible.",

Doing so is INCREDIBLY selfish. You especially don't endanger a child because of a pet.

I know people who own these animals -- they literally have multiple locks and weights on their cages, they always know where this animal is, because it can seriously hurt somebody. This kind of centipede has killed kids before. \n\nSo your boyfriend has allowed this situation to happen, which is already an issue. Forget the kid -- this animal will hurt you if it doesn't die first.  Yet not only did he allow that to be a possibility, he doesn't even seem to care.

I'm not trying to be funny but lol really???\n\n\n\nAlso, his idea that he can just jump on top of it to capture it is unbelievably moronic. They are way too fast.

You say he does stupid shit constantly when you argue, so, mentally, it looks like you've already detached yourself from him in instalments over a longer period of time. He isn't there yet. He very much still wants to keep you around, since you have been so good for him. That's why he's upset because you're not. He also probably can't see you just being friends as readily as you are now, because he simply isn't there yet. This is going to be highly annoying for you if you stick around to watch him go through the motions of grief. I also, personally, suspect you might be suppressing some of your own emotions because you are so focused on your business. It might hit you later. Be gentle with yourself.

The fact that you were able to emotionally disconnect from him so easily and without much pain is an indication of how weakly you were emotionally bonded to him in the first place (again--that is how most people will see it, because that is typically how people function). Based on his cheating behavior, it sounds like he wasn't the sort of person someone would ~want~ to be emotionally bonded to anyway, so that's not a dig on you...but it explains why he's upset by your reaction.

He cheated on you which is obviously messed up, BUT I feel like it's also kinda messed up that you're planning on stringing him along for the sake of your professional career.\n\ntbh, it kinda sounds like you were already planning on stringing him along even before he cheated and now you're like \"whew, now i don't even have to feel guilty about it!\"\n\nIdk, that sounds pretty immature and petty to me.

            "I think you are very smart to not give him the reaction he's looking for, and it sounds like from your perspective you have checked out of the relationship and downgraded him to roommate status instead of partner status. It sounds like eventually you plan to make him a former roommate as well. These are all good things and I am happy for you that you have such a good head on your shoulders!\n\nHowever, the main issue now I think is that he is not AWARE that his status in your relationship has changed. He is still thinking you are partners, and doesn't seem to realize that what he did was absolutely a dealbreaker. He doesn't understand that you've checked out of the relationship and made peace with that, or that you will eventually end the relationship when timing suits you. \n\nDo you get the feeling/expect that breaking up with him and staying roommates until you can deal with housing logistics will cause him to treat you badly, make your life harder, and/or make the living situation super tense? \n\nIf so, I kind of understand why you wouldn't tell him you're done right away - but I still think not informing him that you're done with him is misguided. \n\nIt is highly likely he will see through you pretending to still be with him (while not acting upset anymore about him cheating) and realize it anyway. If drama is going to happen due to breaking up, it will happen no matter what, and I promise it won't happen on your timetable. \n\nUnless there is a danger of violence or him purposely making your life hell as a roommate, it really is best to confront this head on and tell him the relationship is over. Otherwise, you are going to have to not only deal with his constant checking in on you for a reaction, but also likely have to appease him with affection and love in order to keep him from questioning you over and over about where your relationship stands. That's not healthy for either of you, at all. \n\n**TL;DR: Don't pretend to be in a relationship with him still to avoid logistics and drama. That is unhealthy and will make things worse for both of you (but mainly you) when he realizes you've checked out of the relationship for good.**\n\n**Confront the situation ASAP (as long as it's safe to do so) and sleep in separate rooms/him on the couch until the logistics of moving and separating finances and such can be worked out.**",

I really appreciate it that so many people cared to give their ideas. A lot of people thought cheating, but some suggested he was just insecure.\n\nLast night I asked him to come over. I should have mentioned in OP that the original event actually happened in mid August. When it FIRST happened after enough I said \"Listen, you're pissing me off, stop saying that I did something I didn't do\" and he just said \"Okay, sorry\". But then proceeded to occasionally bring it up since August until now. Also we are long distance, kind of. He goes to school in another state, but is from my home town. He's been here the past few days due to family issues.\n\nSo when he was over I asked him why he feels so strongly I cheated, and at first he tried to brush it off. I kept pressing him and finally he said \"I just don't feel like you could go somewhere like that with a bunch of guys and nothing would happen\". I told him \"Well, you go to Florida for most of the year for school with a bunch of girls. So are you saying that you don't think I could do it because you've done something?\"\n\nWell, he flew off the handle and FREAKED out. Started yelling that he was so pissed I'd even think to accuse him of cheating. That he never had and never will. That I KNEW about any time a girl came on to him too strong because he'd tell me about it (which is true). I just sat there and watched him and then finally asked \"Well how is it ridiculous for me to ask you that, but you think it's ridiculous that I even argue that I never cheated?\" He just said that \"He knows me\" and \"He knows what I'd do\".\n\nFinally I just got pissed and said that if he can't trust me and thinks so lowly of me we probably shouldn't be together. He started going off then saying \"See!!! I knew you cheated!!\" I got fed up with the crazy and told him to go. He asked if I was breaking up with him, and I said no. I said no because I figured if I said yes he wouldn't leave, but I felt pretty sure that's what I wanted to do.\n\nAfter he left, called up his brother who I am sometimes close to and told him the story. He was surprised by how crazy he was but also told me that my boyfriend's last girlfriend (his first) had cheated on him, so he probably just thinks that of everyone now. He told me that my boyfriend has some massive anger issues and has been known to get physical with people/objects when angry. He also told me about a bunch of other crazy things my boyfriend has done... including \"running away\" from home as a 20 year old when he didn't get his way, cussing out his mom and telling her to die when she took his brother's side over a petty argument.. etc. Some other minor things were that my boyfriend has apparently stated he \"never wants to move out of his parents\" house and continue making youtube videos for the rest of his life.\n\nThat and how stupid my boyfriend acted to me over me doing literally nothing made me decide I wanted to end it. I called up my boyfriend and told him it's over. I'm pretty sad about it, I do love him, but I don't wanna deal with crazy dick. Plus it's pretty lame we've been together three years and he still thinks he wants to live with his parents forever. I've asked him a million times what he wants to do when he's out of college. He just says \"I don't know\"\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Accused me more and more of the same thing. He didn't cheat, probably, but is crazy as hell, so we broke up.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the comments!!! Wow. I'm trying to reply to most but I AM reading everything!!\n\nPeople are asking how I never noticed these red flags earlier. I KIND OF did, but wasn't sure. We were long distance, which I think often left me confused. A lot of times I'd wonder if his actions were just because we were far. Hearing his brother say those things just confirmed that's not the case.\n\nAlso a lot of you were upset I called his ex \"crazy\" and referenced her Cocaine use as an example. I actually knew her personally, she was a pathological liar as well as being actually clinically insane, and did a LOT OF Cocaine, and was like.. 15 or 16 at the time. Throwing the word crazy around was rude of me, and of course Cocaine use doesn't mean crazy. I'm a bit jaded when it comes to her because she used to be my friend but has done some pretty messed up stuff. So sorry if I came off as insensitive and for tossing those words around like that.",

Throughout the relationship he was extremely emotionally manipulative and when it came to us breaking up he always say he would \"destroy me\" and tell my family what I was \"really like\". There was no reason what so ever for him to not trust me but he had been cheated on in the past and it messed him up pretty bad. He would constantly text other girls and see no problem even when he would spend all night on the phone when he was meant to be with me. I was so manipulated by him that it took a long time for me to get out of the relationship and even after we broke up we saw each other a lot because he made out like I was nothing without him. I then met my now boyfriend and he blocked me off every social media possible and had a new girlfriend within a week of finding out I had met someone else. What he did sometimes still affects me over a year after I last heard from him and I can't ever imagine being in that situation again.

            "Yeah, you gotta dump his ass. It sucks, but it is better being alone than being with someone who will who hurt you and hold you back.",
            "This situation isn't all that unusual but I doubt many people understand what's truly happening.\n\n\nFirst off, good for your for not cheating.  Monogamy is not the natural choice in many circumstances especially in a college lifestyle.  Also, if there was something, why could it not be forgiven?  How can anyone love their partner if they cannot conceive that their love is strong enough to not forgive.  \n\n\nI was definitely thinking that his reaction fits in with what I know from psychological defense mechanisms.  The original accusations at you were likely projection -- he feels guilty about something, and it may not be cheating on you, but it may be having had a thought about an attractive girl or something.  When you turned the tables on him the increased volume in his denial also speaks of insecurity and possibly guilt.  I'd say insecurity definitely.  But keep in mind that the more attached or 'in love' we are with someone, the more likely we are to feel insecure because we do not want to lose someone we deem so important.  \n\n\nNow, I understand that you talked to his brother and now you know all this dirt about how crazy he is.  Honestly, brothers talking about their brothers does not equal truth.  I mean you've heard of sibling rivalry.  The brother is likely using the situation which you presented to him to blow off steam because there always a build up of tension between siblings.  So you can't believe everything you hear.  Also, consider that something mild can be embellished to seem insane... like you said that you were told that he got angry and threw something and it was a big deal.  Well, I'd say that an assault is a big deal, and if it was a big enough deal there would have been a police report or something.  So could it be exaggerated?  Well have you ever gotten frustrated and thrown something across the room?  I think everyone has.  There are degrees that the brother is controlling honesty about... like did he break one plate or did he shatter the china cabinet and everything in it.  \n\n\nYou say you still love him but you now think he is crazy as hell.  Well, I guess I can understand that it's easier to start the process of \"moving on\" if you think he is crazy as hell.  But consider that you have also admitted loving him... and that's being vulnerable.  It would be a risk to your ego and emotions to work things out and potentially have things not improve or what not.  But this is the risk we take when we 'love' another.  \n\n\nIn the end we all have relationship \"deal breakers\" as Dr. Phil used to call them years and years ago.  You decide what you can live with and what you cannot.  You are the one to define what the love you give will look like and to state your expectation of what the reciprocation should be.\n\n\nI wish you both all the best whether your journey's take different paths or you come to a solution.",
            "you definitely made the right decision in the grand scheme of things.\n\nI feel like the whole situation really brought light to who he truly is as a person.  it's scary that you can be with someone for that long and still not know who they are.",
            "I know i'll be downvoted but... People take what people say too danm seriously.\n\nSometimes in this sub everything means something, everything said bears some awful and meaningful truth underneath it.\n\nShit, when did people have to be so god dammed perfect. They can't be angry, or have insecurity issues. Shit, young people don't even get allowed to be young. \n\nFor me this is silly, really, for both parts. Sorry. It's so easy to find issues with other people, so easy to blame someone because i don't feel perfect.\n\nWork on your shit. What is the big deal if love each other,? i just don't get it.\n\nDon't take words as dogmas. So he thinks you cheated on him...but still wants to be with you? Has insecurity problems? Sure, fuck i wish i was that complacent with my insecurity. But i get it, maybe it was not a big deal evemn if it happened.\n\nI don't know....maybe I'm playing the Devils advocate here, but, if your relationship is ending I don't think it's because of that shit. Especially when you say you decided to end after you heard what someone else said. Don't you know your bf? Make up your own mind.\n\nSorry about my english. Not my best language.",

            "Wow, having someone cheat on you, **destroys** your trust.\n\n1. He probably was livid about the assumption of him cheating was ludicrous because he's been through that. I would never wish that upon anyone (I've been cheated on and regaining trust was one of the **toughest things I've ever done**)\n2. Don't ask about what he wants to do out of college, ask about what he likes currently and talk about the future possibilities that he could have if he went through with them. Psychologists can have their own office and can make their own schedule, etc. Be supportive. (My SO does the whole, *I don't know*, thing which frustrates the living hell out of me, but I'm learning how to steer around that blockade)\n3. When he says *I know* it could be a gut feeling, he needs to be in therapy for his trust issues and understand that just because he has those *feelings* it doesn't mean they are **real**.\n4. His youtube idea is extremely dumb, only a 15 year old would think this would be good. As a hobby, it could work and potentially turn into a full-time thing, but you need something stable first.\n5. He sounds extremely unstable, both mentally, and emotionally. **Therapy would be the best bet.** I would attempt to get his family to usher him into it.\n\nBreaking up, I'm not sure if that was for the best, or for worse, because now his trust capabilities are going to be torn in even more directions.\n\nI'm sorry you had / have to deal with this sort of mental instability, it's is up there at the top; It sort of reflects a bi-polar, schizophrenia, with a dash of OCD (Intrusive Thoughts).",

        "selftext": "I don't know if this is the right place for this but I don't know what to do.\n\nI live with this girl named Meredith. For someone I met online when looking for a roommate to fill the second room, she has been absolutely great to live with. We aren't the best of friends but we get along well. We both have busy lives so we usually chat for a few minutes in the evenings and on the weekends. She's actually an awesome roommate. She's quiet in the mornings and night, clean and takes good care of the common areas. When she first moved in, she asked me if she could put a lock on her bedroom door. I thought this was odd because the last roommate never did this but it's her own room so I didn't really care. She left the extra key for me in a kitchen drawer and told me she usually doesn't lock the room but if she goes away for a few days she prefers to keep the door locked because she's quite watchful of her things.\n\nAnyway, Meredith has a good job but I don't think she is super rich or anything like that. When she first moved in, she only bought two suitcases of things. I commented on this and she basically said she likes designer items so she buys just a few high quality items but pays a lot for them. I don't really know anything about designers or labels but I kind of got to appreciate them after seeing her wear these items. \n\nYesterday, I had my last exam of the summer semester and officially finished my course. I decided to have an impromptu party to celebrate at the apartment. I texted Meredith letting her know and asked if she wanted to join in and bring friends.\n\nMe: DONE!! I am going to have ppl over to drink later. Want to join? You should ask Jen and her boyfriend to come too.\n\n\nMeredith: Awesome! Congrats!! I am going to be in [place] remember? I am coming back Sunday because I have a session at 9. Have fun celebrating!\n\n\nMeredith: There may be a bottle or two of wine in the fridge. I bought it last wknd. You can have it for tonight :) :)\n\n\nMe: Thanks!\n\n\nMeredith: By the way, if there's going to be people over, can you do me a huge favor?\n\n\nMe: Ya what's up?\n\n\nMeredith: When you are in the apt later, can you pls lock my room? I think I left my Tom Ford sunglasses on my bed as well so maybe you can put them in the closet or something?\n\n\nMe: I am here now. \n\n\nMe: Hey, I put the sunnies in the closet and locked the room. Have fun in [place].\n\n\nMeredith: Perfect, thanks! \n\n\n\nSo people were over last night but it ended up being a much bigger party than I expected. People brought friends so it was really crowded. I got drunk pretty quickly. My friend Allie was feeling a bit ill and wanted fresh air. I am an idiot. I wish I could take this all back. I was too drunk and wasn't really thinking. Meredith's room has a nice large window where you can sit on the ledge. I unlocked her room with the spare key and let Allie in. I went back to drinking with friends. At the end of the night, a couple of people crashed in the living room but left when they were sober.\n\nI woke up this morning to a very messy apartment with drinks spilled everywhere. I had every intention of cleaning it up. I walk towards the bathroom and notice Meredith's door open. I remember opening it last night so I just wanted to go back and lock it again. I noticed that a few of her drawers are open and her closet is open. FUCK. Now I am freaking out. Meredith literally only has ten or so hangers in her closet of which seven are EMPTY. Everything was there last night because I opened it to put the sunglasses in. The sunglasses are missing as well. I am really freaking out now. I don't know what else is missing. I looked up Tom Ford sunglasses online and they run $350+. Some of her purses are $6,000 each. I have no idea how much any of her clothes are worth. I can not afford to replace any of these items. Not now and not anytime soon in the future. I know it's all my fault. Anyone could have taken the items since so many people were in the apartment. I called Allie and she told me to file a police report which I will do now. What do I do? I have every intention of paying Meredith back but I literally can not afford to do so. I think she will be very upset about this. A lot of her things seem to be gone. It's not like she's very rich that she can just write it off like no big deal. A lot of her savings went into these items. I feel so horrible.\n   \n**tl;dr**: Had a party at my apartment. Roommate is away and asked me to lock her bedroom door. I did but then got drunk and opened it hours later. Wake up and many things in her room are missing. She has very expensive taste and I can not afford to replace any of the items. What do I do?",

            "Life lesson learned the hard way.  For now all you can really do is file a police report and contact your renter's insurance company (because you have renter's insurance like you should, right?).  I don't know how far renter's insurance will take you though, with items that expensive.  If you don't have renter's insurance, you are SOL--the police won't do anything, and obviously nobody you invited will admit to taking stuff.  Doesn't hurt to ask around, but realistically the stuff's gone for good.\n\nAs far as the personal relationship side goes, you're up shit creek.  There isn't any excusing what happened, and she is going to be, quite rightfully, angry.  Apologies only go so far when thousands of dollars of stuff is gone.  Be prepared for a conversation about someone moving out.",

            "For what it's worth, this happened to me but I was in Meredith's shoes. I figured out who it was after a little cross-referencing between friends and was later compensated by the friend of my roommate that brought the thief into our home. You have a significant amount of liability here, but don't panic. There are still options. \n\nFirst, sit down and think about who came. Make a list. Think about who you didn't know. Call the people you remember being there and ask who they knew/didn't know. Ask Allie! Don't accuse anyone or seem panicked (it will discourage cooperation), but be serious in your need for info. Think about it this way, you looked at and welcomed a thief into your home, and I bet you can deduce who it was. At least down to a few potential people.

You're probably not dealing with a criminal mastermind here. Definitely go to the cops, but understand that they cannot help you as much as you can help yourself.\n\nCheck your renters policy. Call Meredith, explain what happened, the options moving forward you are aware of and apologize. Sincerely apologize, with no exceptions. Do not surprise her with felony level theft when she gets home. You want her to react before she sees you so she has the chance to be calm when you first talk about it in person. Include her in the process and show her you are working to make things right. She will be angry, and you are liable for what happened. Treat her with the utmost kindness and respect, even if she yells at you. You do not want to give her a reason to pursue a lawsuit. \n\nBest of luck!",

Fingers crossed that renter's insurance covers everything.  \n\nSeriously,  though. I know you can't afford it, but this is 100% your fault.  Your roommate did everything correct. She bought a lock for her room, asked you to pack everything up, and requested you lock the room when she was not there. You unlocked the room and let everyone in the apartment go through her things. If I were her, I'd be pissed and I'd expect you to repurchase everything. Who cares if you can't afford it? You could have suggested anyone that felt stuffy take a walk. You could have walked to a 24h cvs and bought a fan. You could have started to kick people out when it got too crazy. Instead you unlocked your roommate's room without her permission, and invited everyone inside of it to get some air. \n\n",

The neighbours got pretty annoyed at the noise and the stink of weed and called the police. Luckily, I managed to get me and my very very drunk/high friend out of there before they turned up. About 7 people got asbo's that I know of.\r\rBut the house was trashed, the fences outside were annihilated all along the road, someone punched a hole in a ceiling(?), the bannister on the staircase got ripped off, all their food got eaten and lots of things got stolen, including all their forks and tv remotes.\r\rThe guys parents got called back from their holiday by the police. They had to redecorate the whole house due to graffiti and the smell off weed getting into everything, as well as replace the neighbours fences. \r\rPoint is, the guy had to get a second job, while at college and give his parents his paycheck every week for the next year to pay for the damages. They also made him write a very embarrassing public apology about what an idiot he had been. Even though it wasn't directly his fault he was held accountable as he put it online and invited everyone possible and he had to deal with the consequences. OP, they were your guests, regardless of whether they were friends of friends, you had the choice to stop the party in its tracks, when things were getting out of hand, but you were too drunk to care. And what a huge invasion of privacy, it was your housemates room, you shouldn't have even gone in there without permission, she trusted you. I don't think i could trust someone again if they went in my private space without permission, let alone if they let a bunch of strangers in, who stole my things. Insurance companies can be a bitch about things like this, they may not even pay out as they were let into the place voluntarily, the insurance people of the guy I knew did nothing about it.\r\rBe prepared for the rest of your tenancy to be awkward as hell too.",

Hate to be blunt here but you don't have too many options. Best case scenario, she gets (understandably) pissed and never trusts you again. Worst case; she moves out and sues you for letting the thefts happen.

            "Where in the world do 28 year olds throw parties like this? All the mid-late 20s people I know are in/graduated graduate school or have careers and have long since moved on from the party lifestyle. I had to re-read the title to confirm the ages here after I read the line about getting black out drunk. I doubt OP has renters insurance and the police won't get the stuff back, so OP better get a job if she is truly determined to pay the roommate back. ",
            "Get a credit card and take out a loan against it and pay her back as much as you can. Ask your parents for a huge loan. Use your school loan to pay her. Get a second job and pay her. Wash cars. Serve tables. Sell your own car, bike, stereo, computer, iPad, etc. Then get into some treatment. You have a drinking problem. ",

            "Look up and notify EVERY local pawn shop or store that buys the sort of stuff that was stolen up to an hour away from your home. Make a script of what was stolen, what it all looks like, and read it aloud to whoever speaks with you over the phone. This will take hours, but it will help.\n\nI had a girlfriend that threw a party at my parents house when I went on a family vacation, a laptop and a nice shaver were stolen, I wanted to hit a girl for the first time in my life when that happened.",

            "You're 28 and throwing house parties like it's college? This is your end result in trying to be cool. Are you sure you're 28??? \n\nMy only suggestion to you is to tell her the truth as soon as possible and try to reimburse her. I know many people say filing a police report will help. Which it may. But you willingly let these low life thieves into your apartment. You chose the wrong group of friends to hang out with and you trusted them in your home and sanctuary that you shared with your roommate who you disrespected by unlocking her door and not caring for her stuff. The only thing you can do now is slowly pay her back with a job. \n\nI feel bad for her. Even though I'm not one for luxury brand items, to some people it's their life and they take pride in owning expensive things. I only wished your stuff were stolen instead of hers. ",

            "First thing you do right now is call the police and file a report right away.\n\nNext you call Merideth and let her know what happened and that you already filed a report.\n\nIf you have renters insurance call and deal with that.\n\nYou could do a number of other things ive seen posted like sending out a mass text saying your disapointed and theres a security camera and your waiting on merideth to get home to see who did it and people could return the shit or whatever. I wouldnt count on that to pan out though so the first 3 things i said need to be done.\n\nAfter this though id take a look at your life. Maybe quit drinking or at least quit getting blackout drunk. Maybe also take a look at your friends and eliminate a few of the more problematic ones. \n\nApologize to your roomate as well. Give her the spare key back as your not responsible enough to hold onto it. If the stuff isnt recovered anytime soon and theres no insurance to cover it then start working on a payment plan.\n\n\nPersonally i suspect your friend that you let into the room. But who knows really. Id keep a eye on your friends though for suspicious spending habits or even being stupid enought to wear what they stole. Watch craigslist and ebay as well for the items that are missing and see if you can link the accounts to someone you know or who was there.\n\nI really hope your hot, at your age these kind of parties should be done with and life is only going to get harder for you if they are not. You should also have a pretty good understanding of your drinking limit and know when to cut yourself off by now as well. Im only 2 years older than you and have long since figured out when to quit drinking and usually switch to water afterwards to avoid a hangover, i pound a bunch of water and piss a lot before going to bed and wake up feeling great. But i also tend to just avoid drinking much if at all. I for sure never get black out drunk though.",
