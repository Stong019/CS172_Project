        "selftext": "Thank you all. My OP from two weeks ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4j12or/both_our_parents_50s_have_abandoned_my_21m_sister/\n\nSo besides reassuring her verbally continuously, making sure we do a lot of things together and being a good brother, I needed to get her into therapy and I found the right therapist for her. She's a psychologist who specializes in children's issues after divorce.\n\nThe only problem was money. I called both my parents and told them that I need to talk to them (separately) and told them that we need more money as she needs to get therapy and I want to do nice things for her and that's the least they owe us after everything. They were hesitant but eventually agreed. I'm now getting $500 more each month from my mother and $750 more from father and that is a real help. When we have extra money from what my parents give us I put it in a college fund for her and this extra money means that not only she can see a great therapist but now I can save more for her.\n\nI also talked to a lawyer as a lot of you suggested to make sure we're getting the right amount of money and it seems that we do. Of course we could go on and get them to court and make everything happen through the legal system but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her. She's much safer and better off here than in their hands. Obviously the option is on the table if they decide to stop paying or reduce the amount.\n\nAnd a couple of you suggested we do something symbolic which I liked a lot. So I bought two matching necklaces and had them engrave our names on them and told my sister that we're doing to wear these to remind ourselves that each of us will always be there for the other and we can count on each other.\n\nWe've already been to two sessions of therapy and I think things are good. The necklace has worked and she doesn't even want to take it off when she takes a shower.\n   \n**tl;dr**: I got her into therapy and got parents to pay for it. We're doing fun things together more often and we bought matching necklace with our names engraved to remind ourselves that we'll always be there for each other.",

            "I missed your original post, but man, I have to say: your parents are the worst. The absolute, motherfucking worst.\n\nYou, however, are a sterling human being, and don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise.",
            "As a former ward: make future plans with her. Like community events, concerts, trips, zoo, etc. The college fund is indicative of a stable future for her and that must mean a lot to her. But some short term things are cool too. Like tickets to see a movie or etc, or discuss when a new one is coming out and how it'd be cool to go see it together. Or, video games and release dates for DVDs. \nGet a big calendar and write your plans on it. \nThis kind of stuff is small but powerful. Doesn't mean just that you won't bail on her but also that you're sticking around because you *want* to and that you do like hanging with her, (not just taking her in out of a sense of obligation.)\nKids always know more of what's going on than adults give them credit for. Be straight with her, always. \nBest of luck to you guys!\ud83d\ude42",
            "you are a great brother/parent <3",
            "You know I can understand if you just flat out can't be a parent and just need to disengage. I don't like it, but I get it. But when you just ditch your family so you can start a new family? Trade in your old kids for new ones? I treated my Mass Effect save file with more respect than that! Your parents need to be marched naked through the town, carry large signs saying what they've done while being whipped.\n\nYou're a great guy, keep looking out for you sister. It's better than to have one person who cares for you than a huge bio-clan who are neglectful and abusive.\n\n>but that has the risk of them choosing to end my guardianship and get my sister back which is not the right thing for her\n\nNot a lawyer but when she is older but a) her testimony saying she wishes to stay with you and b) Their total abandonment for years should protect you from that.\n\nStill, family courts in the USA are a total shit-show. I've seen cases where they leave the kids with abusers or take them away from the caring parents to go live with the abusers. CPS minimum standards for care would be too low for prison. Better to be avoided.",
            "Op, you're a much better parent to her than they ever were. \n\n\nYou're an incredibly mature, sensible, intelligent man, and at such a young age! When your sister is older, she'll realize the true extent of how much you love her. Maybe look into some therapy for yourself too?\n\nKeep on being you. Never change. ",
            "OP, I want you to know how much your post touched me. I am in tears-and I rarely cry.\n\nYou are not only a great sibling and guardian to your sister, you are a wonderful human being. Our world is better because you are in it.\n\nThank you for being a person that does the right thing. Thank you for advocating for your sister. Your love and care for each other is how you will both heal.\n\nPlease remember to take care of your needs, too. You are young with a great deal of responsibility and also coping with shitty parents. You deserve to heal, too.",
            "Brother or not, you are her parent at this point. She only a child and she needs you. I'm glad you've got her in therapy. Just keep doing what you're doing and keep her away from her biologicals. They are complete shitheads.",
            "You're doing good!\n\nAnd the necklace thing is also so cute :). It reminds me when I got a necklace for a little family friend of mine for similar reasons, these things make my heart melt.\n",
            "Do you have a female (not necessarily romantic) in your life your sister might be able to talk to for female issues? I would suggest that.\n\nThe other thing is I would suggest you always be reliable for her. If you say you are going to do something you always do it. Consistency is what will help deal.",

            "OP I remember your original post and I am so happy to see this update. You truly are an amazing individual and a compassionate human being. Your parents are clearly not the best people - but you have been doing everything right for your sister so far. Please focus on yourself too, try to have as much fun as you can while you are young. You already have so many more responsibilities then other people of your age. Try to live your life as much as you can - even if it's just getting a sitter for your sister twice a month so you can  go out with friends. You are a fantastic brother and I'm really proud of you for being this strong and capable. Hugs from an Internet friend.",
            "Hey, man. I'm 28 and have a younger sister. She's 22.\n\nWhile we are lucky to have good parents, I still wanna say that you are a great brother and a parent to your sister. \n\nI don't know if you'll have kids, but if you do, they're lucky as hell. \n\nPlease don't take this the wrong way, but I am envious of your relationship with your sister. \n\nI have a good relationship with mine. I still drive her around and she's 22 (to work and stuff). She doesn't take advantage of me, but I feel she takes me for granted. I wish she would hang out with me more. Not every weekend, but certain events like birthdays and stuff. ",

            "I said this on your first post and I'll say it again, you're a true champion sir. Wish I was 10% of the man you are and you're 5 years younger than me. You're saving this girls life man. Giving her something (more like everything) your deadbeat parents can't give. Keep being a boss for your sister. ",
            "Shit, you're 21? Your responsibility and attitude makes you really attractive ;) Go OP!\n\nThank you for taking care of your little one. It will mean so much to her how much you did for her when she grows up.",
            "Mind you op - they WILL want to get her back one day. And if you allow for this to happen, they very well may abandon her again, which will crush her. Do not let that happen. I am not sure how to avoid this legally or any other way around this, but don't let that happen. \n\nAlso, you're great. I'm your fan. ",

So many could dump their sister into the foster system and live their lives. Especially after coming out of a situation like yours. Seriously kudos for being the bigger human being in your situation and I hope the best for you and your sister.",
            "I read the original post, but I'm still lost as to how this situation even came in to being.  In what world does a parent pawn off their youngest kid to their oldest kid?  Where were they living before he turned 18?  How did they even transfer custody?  What family judge saw that situation and didn't go WTF?",
            "You are doing everything right. You and your sister deserve all the happiness in the world.    \nAlso many people are mentioning that she could use a female figure to help her through some things.

Thanks for sharing your story, even if it was to just ask advice, it means so much more than that to hear about different styles of family and parenting. You're a good guy and we need more folks like you in this world. ",
            "You are an amazing brother and I really admire the care you are providing your sister. Please disregard this if it's out of line (or someone else suggested it), but I was wondering if you could set up your \"parent's\" payments for your sister's care on a direct deposit  or bank transfer or something. That way you don't have to waste time or energy seeing them.",
            "I hope you are getting some therapy too.  At some point you will likely feel the mental strain being a single parent.  Especially as she moves into her teen years. Make sure to take care of you too, its part of taking care of her.",
            "Wow. You are an amazing brother. Tell your sister she is an amazing kid for me. This is the most heart breaking thing I have ever read. It's one thing for one parent to kinda just do that, but both? And so severely too! How do you just forget about your own flesh and blood like that. \n\nWhere they like this with you as well growing up? I just can't even begin to guess what is wrong with your parents to be like this. Are they otherwise normal people?\n\nJust keep being awesome and make that college fund grow. With therapy and time things will get better. But i think it's important to just cut off contact with your parents and sister permanently. therapy would be good for both of you together as well. Especially as she gets older. As a brother stepping in and being a brother/now parent it's a difficult transition even just emotionally. And when she hits puberty that could open a whole new can of worms if she's not well adjusted by then. Therapy all the way. \n\nAt least your getting decent monetary support to give her the best life you can. \nUgh.\n*hugs*",
            "You are so amazing. You are such a caring and loving brother, and I applaud you that you're there for your sister. Great job :)",
            "I wish I was as kind and caring of a human being as you are",
            "I am so so sorry for what your sisters gone through. I can't imagine what kind of parents could treat anyone the way yours have treated her. She deserves better than that.\n\nOn that note, you are a stellar human being. Go you for being supportive, caring and for taking up a cause you didn't have to at such a young age. Your sister is lucky to have you.",
            "This update had me in tears! My cousin (16) came from a broken home and I recently have taken him in as well (I'm 25). You have done such an amazing thing for your sister, it warms my heart to see there are people like you out there. Even handling a 16 year old has been tough on me, but atleast we are able to talk in a way that I can assure him that he's not a bad kid and I won't ever get rid of him. I know 11 can't be easy since she just doesn't understand why your parents are being such fucking dicks. You are an awesome person man, don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise. ",
            "Aaaaw, the onions!!! :3",
            "Your parents can go kick rocks, shatter their bones and then get their feet amputated. What a bunch of assholes. \n\nSecondly, OP you are a phenomenal person. Being a parent for your own kids at 18 is incredibly difficult. Having to take up that mantle now, especially during that period where you are in the process of becoming an adult is a downright heroic thing to do.\n\nBut that's where I worry. OP, what are you doing for yourself? Are you able to pursue an education? Do you have a social life? Doing everything you do for your sister is amazing, and you deserve the highest of high fives at all time for that. But you have to do things for yourself too. Your sister will grow up with guilt over that if you don't. And that's not anyone's fault but your parents' to be fair.\n\nI think you can both have a life and be there for your sister. I think it just requires some planning. Also, you may need therapy yourself after this, and I don't think anyone would blame you.",

She is young enough that this plan will work.",

Maybe you don't necessarily need a counselor (couldn't hurt to take a few sessions and see where it goes), but somewhere in there is a boy who has been dumped by his parents.   \n\nPerhaps there is some sort of support group out there for you...even a parenting group?  You're going to have to help your sister deal with the upcoming puberty and teen years, and your relationship is in between parent and sibling.

Parenting is hard and it's really fucking hard when you're basically still growing up. I hope you consider some therapy with your sister or on your own at some point. God knows most people who have been through tough shit, especially regarding parents, (myself included) need it more than we reach out to get it. ",
            "I havent been able to go through all your replies, OP, but I wanted to make sure you heard this just in case it was missing: Make sure you take care of yourself too, man. You're going through something alot of people wouldn't be able to handle at even older ages than you are. You might also benefit from a therapist as well to deal with the shit theyve piled on you. Also, try making sure you get a night off to relax every two weeks or so. Every parent needs a break, and that's what you pretty much are at this point. Best of luck to you too. I have faith that you guys are going to be just fine. As for your parents, they are going to be much worse off in life. Even if it doesn't look like it right now, they are really going to get theirs. I'm not talking about spiritual karma or anything like that. I'm talking some obviously unresolved issues and mental health problems that they clearly have to abandon their own children. I'm not wishing this one them, it's just the plain facts.",

My two suggestions are 1) create holiday traditions that you do every year, and 2) use something like Shutter fly to create a photo book of your good times together, and leave that book always out in the open (on a coffee table rather than in a bookcase).  It will help her later on when she is going through the emotional upheaval of puberty, as she'll have tangible proof of you two as a family. ",

            "It amazes me that people like your parents can even find new families to assimilate into. Sociopaths, monsters -- no rage-influenced label really does them justice. I worked for several years with kids who often struggled to cope with ineffective parents, but through all those parents' faults, I could see that they generally loved their kids, and just couldn't handle the responsibilities of adulthood.  \n\nNot so long ago I would've suggested insidious ways for your parents' consolation families to stumble upon this thread, but I'm being honest in saying that it is probably best that they remain locked in their positions of inefficacy; their stepchildren will probably have difficulty attaching to them anyways if they are as cold as they sound, and they will continue to pay support for the children they never deserved until the day they die. They do not continue to send mixed messages, but a single simple one: you and your sister are far better people than they could ever wish to be, and there should be no room in your lives or time spent on such a miserable pair of souls.  \n\nI know you and your sister will continue to love and support each other; thank you for being a good brother.

Just small things like 'we won't leave each other' rather than 'I won't leave you', talking about being partners helping each other. It's a weird position to be in because you obviously have to act very 'parenty' sometimes but just when she's having a harder time, partner in crime is probably better than parent when the two people that personify the idea of parents left her.",

Common thoughts are he was selfless, protective and my role model, as I looked up to him always.\n I cannot believe your parents put you in that situation. \nWhen your sister grows up and realizes the things you sacrificed for her. It will be something she will think about always and forever. You truly set the bar for siblings everywhere. \nKeep your head up and continue to love your sister.

        "selftext": "It\u2019s been about a week since I talked to my dad and I\u2019ve had a couple people message about an update, so I figured I\u2019d give one.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t see my original post, I (16M) had to move in with my dad (47M) and his family after my mom died and things have been extremely strained\u2014the worst incidences being my half-brother ripping pics of my mom up and my dad\u2019s wife leaving me locked out of the house\u2014so I was given the offer to move out by my dad\u2019s friend and his husband (Both 30\u2019s M).\n\nI followed a couple peoples\u2019 suggestion and texted my dad\u2019s friend that I wanted to leave and they ended up suggesting we all go out to lunch. I think they could both tell how nervous I was around my dad and my dad\u2019s friend J ended up being the one to bring up the idea of me moving out. My dad seemed completely blindsided by it and asked why I wanted to move out. J and his husband B reminded him about everything that\u2019s been going on at home and I just kind of sat there.\n\nMy dad seemed really upset and it made me feel terrible because I already felt guilty about leaving, but then he just asked if I really wanted to go. I said yes and he just immediately agreed.\n\nIt kind of hit me that I wanted him to try and fight for me, to say sorry for everything that he\u2019s been letting happen, and for my dad to try and keep me at home but he just let me go like it was nothing. It\u2019s been hard after my mom died and my dad\u2019s the only family I\u2019ve got left, so it really didn\u2019t make me feel any better about leaving, even though I don\u2019t have to deal with my dad\u2019s family anymore.\n\nB took me back to their apartment while J went with my dad to get my stuff from the house, and they had set up their extra room for me already. He apologized that they hadn\u2019t been able to do this sooner and that they hoped I would like living with them. J came back with all of my things and they kind of gave me time to decompress. I ended up sleeping for almost sixteen hours because I was so exhausted.\n\nOver the last week, they\u2019ve been really nice about making me feel at home and have talked to me about getting me into therapy to deal with losing my mom and everything that happened at my dad\u2019s house. They\u2019re also trying to figure out how to move me into a different school so I don\u2019t have to deal with my half-sister and everyone that knew my half-brother. It\u2019s the first time in months that I feel like I can actually breathe and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m constantly on guard. My dad hasn\u2019t texted me much or reached out in the last week so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with him but, for now, I\u2019m safe I guess.\n\nSo that\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far. Thanks for everyone that gave me advice and wished me well. It\u2019s been really hard lately and it made me feel less alone.\n\nTL;DR: I managed to get out of my toxic living situation, moved in with my dad\u2019s best friend and his husband, and things are going okay, even if I\u2019m still having a hard time\n\nLink to my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q3xzf2/should_i_move_out_how_do_i_even_ask/\n\nEdit: Umm wow this unexpectedly blew up and I\u2019m kind of stunned. My other posts never gained much traction so I never expected this update to get so much attention.\n\nA quick update over the last 24 hours or so. B\u2019s sister somehow saw this and send it to him, so he and J came in and asked. They never heard about the picture incident and apologized that they hadn\u2019t asked to get me out sooner. They had no idea how bad it was and said I can stay as long as I want or need to. I realized then that I hadn\u2019t really said thanks to them because it\u2019s been so crazy so I told them how much I appreciated having the place to stay. It was a really emotional moment honestly and I\u2019m glad it happened.\n\nThey did think it was funny that they\u2019ve been called everything from my \u201croommates\u201d to my \u201cnew landlords\u201d, so that\u2019s helped soften the mood a little.\n\nSorry I haven\u2019t been able to respond to many comments, this feels really overwhelming but I just wanted everyone to know that the support means a lot.

It was good you moved out as your dad was not likely to change his wife and children.\n\nDefinitely go to therapy. You went through a lot and it sounds like J and B are good people. Maybe they have a little experience with tough family situations and can be there to help you. You can definitely now rest and then be able to get back up in a situation that allows you to focus on your best future.\n\nI'm sorry your dad didn't work out, but after some time you will be 1000X better off than if you had stayed. His family was abusive to you when you aren't the problem, just a consequence of your dad's actions. However, you are your own whole human being and deserve happiness. His wife should know that. His wife shouldn't have been a bad person and treated you poorly and thereby teaching her children to treat you badly because of her own unhappiness with your father.\n\nYour dad likely let you go because he knew he can't keep you safe from his chosen family and past choices. He should know that you don't deserve to live in that environment because of him. Hopefully, he will send you money even if he can't face you out of shame he has against himself.\n\nYou are just a person.

Not just your mom, but your family, is how it reads to me. That sounds incredibly traumatic. Can I recommend that when they help you find a therapist, that you find one trained in either CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or ACT (action commitment therapy), or someone who specifically works with PTSD/trauma.\n\nThat being said, please make sure to bring up these feelings of guilt. The therapist will help you with through these. What I see right now \"my dad seemed upset and it made me feel terrible/guilty\"; I see you trying to manage and own his emotions. This is something that's incredibly hard to detect in yourself, and it's even harder to learn to let go of that.\n\nTruly, he is the one failing you, not the other way around. His \"upset\" feelings are for him to deal with - not yours to try to make better.\n\nAdditionally, my heart hurt for you reading the second paragraph I quoted. I am so so sorry that happened to you. Unfortunately, people tend to grieve in wildly different ways, and they will get stuck on one of the stages. I suspect that, especially considering he was blindsided, he had no idea what to say. Of course I don't know him. I'm basing this on observations of other people and situations- even my own. Not to say that it was okay for him to basically abandon you emotionally and let your brother do what he did. You are absolutely normal and correct to feel upset and incredibly hurt. I encourage you to feel your emotions. It is normal to feel confused too - you are hurt, but you love your dad. Your dad failed and neglected you emotionally, but he is also grieving. It's confusing. I'm not sure if you're hyper-empathetic - just know that there's boundaries between understanding why someone hurts you and allowing them to hurt you.\n\nI hope therapy helps you find peace. I started going this year and it is just not what I had thought it would be, and I regret not starting sooner. I hope eventually your dad apologizes. I hope you learn that you're not required to forgive him, nor that you're required to feel guilty of that upsets him.",

Take care of yourself and be proud that you\u2019re taking charge of your mental health. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had a hard time; hopefully better times lay ahead.",

And he may have just wanted to be supportive of you and a decision you'd clearly made already. \n\nThis may also be the case if he was concerned about his ability to make his home more welcoming to you. If his wife and your half-brother aren't likely to listen to him or completely change their awful behavior quickly, then he may not have wanted to subject you to what would probably be a period of conflict and argument. \n\nHe may have rationalized that this is the emotionally and physically safer option. \n\nBut, you should make it clear that you do want a relationship with him, because he may be thinking that you're done with him too. And from what you've written, I think you'd regret not finding out if your Dad was willing to do the work to be a part of your life or if you just need a clean break and time to heal.",

            "You sound as though you are now with good people, so good luck and best wishes for the future.",
            "I\u2019m so glad you have at least two decent people in your life. It really sucks that the other two adults who are supposed to love (at least your dad) and take care of you (both him and S) are complete wastes of space as humans. And I\u2019m so so so sorry for all the grief and trauma you\u2019ve gone through. \n\nIf you can get B and J to sign you up for therapy, I highly recommend it. And I hope one day you realize that the world is not as shitty a place as your dad has made it for you. Sending hugs!",
            "From now up until between two to six years, make sure you make J and B's life as easy as possible. That means helping with chores, doing your school work, working, staying out of their face, not getting into trouble, not getting with the wrong crowd, etc. Start thinking about school, work, money, career, moving out, relationships down the road. That stuff doesn't happen in a day but over time. \n\nMy friend took in a fifteen year old girl because her family was toxic; mom did drugs, more crazy stuff in the household. My friend gave the girl a place to stay, had her hang out with her daughters, took her to games, and events, you know how the fifteen year old girl repaid her? Crashed her car, got kicked out of school, did drugs, got pregnant. Don't be that fifteen year old girl. My friend kicked her out and she's back with her toxic family. She had it good, didn't know it, and was bored. Some people attract drama in their life, need drama, or cause drama, that was the fifteen year old.\n\nAnyway, you got it good. Otherwise, you could've been with that horrible old family. You're two years away from eighteen. Maybe you can go to college, live in a dorm and move out. Depending what career avenue you want to take. You want to start thinking about this now. You got this.",
            "When you're ready. Tell your dad that you wanted him to fight for you, to apologize to you, and ask why he let it happen, and why he let you go. I recently lost my father and there are many questions I wish I had asked and wished I had answers to. This is one of thoes times when you could just be misunderstanding each other or it could truly be heartbreaking to hear the truth. Brace yourself. But I tell you the doubt and the unknown will eat at you later in life. You don't have to right away, but consider it in time. Don't feel guilty for doing what you need to do to stay safe and healthy.",
            "Your stepfamily is incredibly cruel and heartless, also, how clich\u00e9 and dumb is it to blame the baby of the affair!?\n\nI\u2018m glad you\u2019re out of there, hope these 2 amazing friends become your new dads and everything will be fine \u2665\ufe0f\n\n(\u2026In fact, I also hope you become super rich and successful, they stay the losers they are and a few years down the road they come begging to be a part of \u201cyour life\u201d and you can tell them to go fuck themselves. Oh geez, just thinking about this cliche scenario gives me a juicy justice boner, but I am petty like that \\^\\^)",

            "This might have been engineered by your dad to get you to a safer place. He might like you but can't risk losing his family over you. Which might explain why the room was already set up, and why he agreed immediately. You've got a long life ahead of you, kid. You'll never know what will come out into the open.",

It sounds like you've got to great men in your life who are happy to be father figures to you. Embrace that as best as you can and then focus on grieving for your mom like you should have had the space and time to do before. I'm not religious but I like to believe that the people who loved us are always with us in some way and watching over us.

            "OP, I really recommend you talk to B&J or your school's counselor about getting a therapist and possibly a social worker (tho, I am not sure what country you are in, but since you mentioned French, I'm guessing Canada.) \n\nYou have been through an awful lot. You likely need help getting through this (because this is a lot even for an adult and you're only 16.) Please go and talk to someone professionally about getting some help getting through this. I recommend a grief counselor and likely a family therapist too. And a social worker to help you and B&J with whatever benefits you need/can get from the government. \n\nBig internet hugs. I am so glad you found someone who will help you.",
            "Your dad was not surprised you were moving out, even though you say he seemed completely blind sighted. He may have been trying to gaslight you, making you believe that he was, which is a form of manipulation\n\nAs all I can tell, the two step-siblings dont have the best relationship with their parents, at least one and the fact they have gotten away with treating you poorly speaks volumes. And the step siblings are incapable of empathy about your situation which speaks volumes. It could be that there is really really poor communication at the household and things are not great there\n\nBut thats not your problem or responsibility\n\n\u2b06\ufe0fread that again repeatedly until you agree and understand why\n\nThe manner in which you communicate, you narrate highly emotional events of the last week with clarity and logic is noted and speaks to your maturity. \n\nPersonally, Im glad your dad didnt pull some ego boost and require you to stay. I am sorry he did not defend you or come to your aid when you move there and all these new things hit the fan so to speak. Reading about all that happened, and Im sure it was not all of it, was horrible. I can\u2019t imagine what it must have been like, and *be like to be going through it. \n\nProtect your time and space right now from anyone who might challenge your sense of safety and self esteem (like your siblings). Like if your dad invites you at some later date to do something, it OK to say that you would like to meet him alone and anywhere but home. m not saying to look forward to this or even initiate it. Im just saying that if he asks and you want to go, it is OK and suggested you implement boundaries\n\nOn to better days. J and B sound like stand up guys. Really. They even collected your things without you having to. Really stand up guys. In every way. It\u2019s like they\u2019re a blessing. Im glad you slept in and feel safe. Im happy they are looking to find another school. This is true empathy\u2014trying to imagine what your situation is like and helping you every way possible. Take advantage of getting good therapy. \n\nThis is just a guess but I bet your mom wants the best for you and would want you to be the best person possible. You will get through this and you will be a better person for it. Who knows, you might some day be able to provide guidance for someone going through this\n\nYou got this",
            "I hate to say it like this but you need to hear it.. Your sorry ass dad really doesn't care that you've gone with his friends he's just happy you're out of his happy little world that he has with his new wife and children.. \n\nDon't expect to hear much from him as time progressed and to be honest if I was you I would actually cut complete contact with him because it was too easy for him to just allow you to go to stay with the family friends..",
            "I'm proud of you for having the courage to have these conversations, you deserve better, and I am so happy you're in a safe space now. Things are going to be out of whack for a while but you're going to be okay in the long run. Take advantage of the therapy, it will help you.  \n\nOne thing though, ask your dad's friends for help in filing for your mom's social security benefits to help you save up for college or to get a place of your own when you graduate.   You are eligible to receive them.",
            "Those two are a godsend. I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re out of that situation. I know first hand how it feels to live somewhere where you feel like you can\u2019t move and it being your only choice. You should be really proud of yourself for sticking to your guns and telling your dad that you do want to leave and move in with them. They sound like amazing, caring people. I\u2019m sorry you were hit with your dad not fighting and trying to keep you at the house. But I would like to think it\u2019s best at the end of the day that you don\u2019t have to deal with your half brother and always having to look over your shoulder. Hope everything gets a lot smoother after all this. Keeping you in my thoughts OP",

            "I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve lost your mom.  I was the child of an affair between a married man and a single woman.  I have siblings who I don\u2019t know, and will never know.  My dad was an awesome guy, but I\u2019m thankful I was never in a position where he had to make daily space in his life for me to live \u2014 he wouldn\u2019t have known what to do, or how to make it work, and there would have been a ton of resistance from his wife and my siblings.  He\u2019s passed away now, and his other family neglected to tell me or include any mention of me in his obituary, and it hurts, but I\u2019m ok.  I\u2019m an adult who has made and chosen a family, and while I think it would have been lovely if my bio-relatives could have seen me as a person, and not a hurtful byproduct, they couldn\u2019t get there.  Again, it hurts, but I\u2019m also content knowing that I am able to love deeply and fully and be loved in return.  It took me a while to figure that out, but it\u2019s been true for my whole life.  \n\nI\u2019m sure your mom loved you with her whole self; and your dad probably loves you more than he can express to anyone (but hopefully he\u2019ll get some therapy one day and figure out how to do it); and now you have two adults in your life who love you enough to open their home, and care for you, and make a new kind of family.  You have so much love in your life \u2014 I know it hurts right now, but it won\u2019t always feel this way.  Just let the love, and your ability to love yourself, light the way forward.",
            "You will absolutely need to confront your father over this as well abandoning you, none of what happened in their home should have ever transpired and his lack of being the man, your father protected is obviously why they all thought they could and did get away with it.  Dad should have never allowed himself to be walked over by his terrible newer wife. And Hs own children. Confront him, you need to say it to him, to his freaking face. Allowing his daughter to be exiled to near strangers because he has no backbone.  Tell him.\n\nNo one can make anyone do anything at all, ever.  Everything we do, we decide to do, regardless of pressures, dare I even say torture.  We decide to do what we do.  He cannot make them do anything, but by his staying and doing nothing he is tacitly telling them what they did is okay with him.  He cannot make them do anything, but he as well can choose to not participate in their terribly bad behavior.  If they want their husband and father around they would need to change to satisfy that want and need for him in their lives.  And the need to change their horrible mindsets.  They all are not good people. That is the bottom line in all this. \n\nI hope it all works out for you, and do therapy as offered.",
            "Reading your first post, I feel sorry for your circumstances. Your context of birth is understandable why your father's family hates you. You're innocent of all this. You don't deserve all the hate. The hate should only be directed at your father for being a cheater.\n\nFor your father to let you go so easy means he never loved you. Your father is a deadbeat. Your father has shown complete apathy towards you. Not even caring about you nor your health. Only tolerating you. Seeing you as nothing but trash that should be thrown out.\n\nFor now, you made the best choice of staying with your father's friend. Get yourself emancipated or ask your father to terminate his parental rights. Don't contact your father nor your siblings unless you want to. Your father doesn't deserve you. Your siblings don't deserve you. Move on for now. Be happy that you're safe.",

You've endured so much these past few months, and I hope you know that you should be proud of how you've dealt with things (***even*** *if you punched 'M', which I suspect is what he was aiming for- goading you into doing something so that you would be kicked out of the house*).  \n\nAnyway, you have nothing to be ashamed of- but your 'father' and his 'family\\*'  should be ashamed of *their* actions- abusing a child is **disgusting** and pretty much one of the few crimes that even hardened PRISON INMATES will look down on.   (And yes, ignoring, harassing, destroying personal property, AND denying basic needs like shelter from the dang rain are ALL abusive actions). ^((\\*'A' kinda gets here, imo, but only because she's so young and probably was heavily influenced by said adults).)\n\nI hope your life keeps getting better, and remember- a real family isn't made up of a bunch of shared genetics, but by the people you really love and choose to be around.  And now you have a lifetime ahead of you in which to find those friends and partners with whom you'll make memories and share in whatever makes you happy- because THOSE are the people who will make up your true family.  <3\n\n**Also, on a side note- if you're able to get to a local library in your area, they may have a digital scanner in which you can put the pieces of your mother's photographs and get a digital version of each one- there's tons of folks very skilled in Photoshop and similar programs who I'm sure would be thrilled to donate their time fixing the images so you can print out 'new' versions that look like the originals!**",

Try and remember that he does care for you, that he is only human and sometimes humans don't make the best choices - even if you know you wouldn't make these choices yourself.\n\nNow you have another two dads who I'm sure you will feel the love from.

            "I doubt you\u2019ll see this message, but do you still have the picture pieces of your mom? I don\u2019t know about your country, but in the US there are companies that can repair shredded and damaged photos, so maybe not all is lost. Either way, I hope you find peace.",
            "Oh my goodness, I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your mom and all the messed up stuff that has happened with your bio dad's family.  I'm glad you are in a safe place to stay with caring adoptive dads now.  Kudos to them - they sound like amazing people.  You are so blessed to have them!\n\nIt is valid and natural to have some feelings of resentment and anger toward your bio dad and his family for the way you were treated.  You deserved way better than that.  I understand the resentment of your stepmother and half-siblings over the circumstances of your birth and the disruption to their lives that the present situation has caused, but that was no fault of yours.  They had no right to destroy your treasured possessions nor lock you out of the house in the rain.  That is straight up abusive behavior.  They should direct their anger and resentment at your bio dad for handling this situation extremely poorly, starting from the day you were born.  How sad for them - they are quite likely missing out on the opportunity to get to know someone wonderful, and they can't even get past their own resentment to see that.\n\nOne thing I must stress is finding healthy ways to cope and deal with your feelings.  You have been through some major traumas in your young life, and you need to process them and figure out how to deal with your feelings about them constructively.  A good therapist will help you out a lot here.  While it might be tempting sometimes, try to stay away from drugs and alcohol to medicate your pain.  Their effects might make you feel better in the short term, but they can lead you down a path of self-destructive behavior if you get addicted.  Work with your therapist and your adoptive dads to find some healthy outlets for your emotions - whether it's working out or maybe just taking a walk, music, or indulging a particular hobby that you enjoy.\n\nLiving well is the best revenge, so do what you can now to set yourself up to take care of yourself in the future.  Concentrate on your schoolwork, and try to help your adoptive dads out around the house from time to time.  As crazy as it sounds, something as simple as pitching in with the dishes or sweeping the floor will give you a sense of belonging, and show your adoptive dads your gratitude for giving you a new start.  It would be a good idea to start thinking now about what you want to do after you graduate from high school in a few years - be it college/university, trade school, military, or career.  Whatever it is, give it your all and set yourself up for a good life.  You deserve it!\n\nHang in there - we are all pulling for you, kiddo.",

Best of luck! :).\n\nThis is something that I've always thought..especially after watching movie scenes.. as you go through life ahead.. there might be some hard situations you find yourself in.. In moments like that, I'd like you to please not say something along the lines of - \"You're not my parents! You don't get to tell me <anything here!>\" That shit hurts! :/ Family is made! Also, understanding and patience has to come from all parties involved!\n\nI'm really sorry about your mom.. and not finding a family in your step-family.

J & B are just two examples of that. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to hear about the loss of your mom and having to deal with your newfound family in such a difficult way. You deserve so much more, and I hope that you know that. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re in a safe space where you can finally process all of your emotions. Please take J & B up on their offer of therapy because it will be so beneficial. \n\nAnd I\u2019m so happy you finally are in an environment where you can talk about your mom. It\u2019s gonna hurt, but it\u2019s better than forgetting. Although she\u2019s gone, you can still keep the memory of her alive. Let people who weren\u2019t lucky enough to meet her fall in love with her through the stories you tell. \n\nI know I\u2019m just some stranger on the internet, but I\u2019n wishing you all of the good and beautiful things life has to offer.",
            "Hey man that isn't ideal but it is an unavoidable lesson. The people you share genes with are almost always not the people you'll share values or level of courage with.\nThis is how it is for at least half of us.\n\nIt is also important to realise that your family's flaws and 'frailties' and how that leads them to act poorly with you, isn't personal. It is their issues and problems.\nThis goes the same for other people. See how these guys are treating you. They don't owe you anything - but they seem to be operating from a higher level of consciousness than your next of kin.\n\nIn life you rarely get the family you deserve. But you get the family you need. I know people with accomodating families who grew up soft and entitled.\n\nIt will hurt, but focus on learning to be this way, and working everything in your life through this Universal process \nBe\nAware\nAccept\nLet go (forgive)\nBe Grateful\nBe Courageously Humble (can't think of a better word for this)\n\nThis leads to Inner Peace & Joy\n\nWatch out for being reactive, which will drop you into these states,\n\nSelf-Pity\nResistance\nResentment\nArrogance/Cynicism\nPride\n\nThis pulls you down to Hate and Bitterness\n\nWhenever you feel a counterpath emotion try and find a Path emotion that gives you an equivalent result.\n\nFor example people will tell you to be proud of yourself. While they mean well and what they're really advocating is to have more self-esteem, Pride is the dirty fast-food version of Gratitude in that case.\nInstead be grateful for your abilities and your initiative or imagination.\nWhat you are truly grateful for you will increase the likelihood of experiencing again. What you are proud of becomes more scarce.\n\nAll the best finding your best self. Life is meant to be good, not shitty.",

            "This is an impressive demonstration of you understanding just how important it is to value you yourself and when to put your hand up and say something when you really are feeling like you cannot deal with a situation anymore.\n\nI\u2019m terribly sad that you have had to endure so much personal trauma in the last year - and that has forced you to see things that you weren\u2019t ready for, and you shouldn\u2019t have to be at the age of sixteen. \n\nYou\u2019ve done an incredibly brave thing, and now you\u2019re surrounded by people who just want to see you get well and they want great things for you. \n\nIt sounds like your new living environment is going to allow you to develop some incredible communication skills that will absolutely set you up for life so go with this - if you\u2019re ever feeling lonely, or a confused as to why your dad hasn\u2019t been in contact then say exactly that. Say what is in your heart and mind to these people you live with and talk through those thoughts and feelings with them.\n\nYou\u2019re safe, you\u2019re healthy and you are loved. Not just by the people who you are living with right now, but every single one of us too.\n\nTake care, be well and find the things that make you love your life - they\u2019re out there, I promise.",
            "I'm glad you are feeling safe. If you want a relationship with your father, you may have to take the lead. \n\nIt sounds like he may not have understood what was happening in his home with you and your half siblings, etc. If I had seen your original post, I may have suggested talking to your dad, and telling him what was happening, and asking if he could fix it. \n\nWhat is done is done. How old do young men live with there parents in the culture where you live? 16? 24? or ?\n\nIt sounds as though your half siblings were having a hard time adjusting to you being there. That doesn't justify their behaviour.\n\nRather than trying to avoid everyone, would there be value in trying to develop a relationship with them, with the goal of you moving in with them again? It probably wouldn't be easy, but if everyone makes an effort it would be better than being without family. Some families last a life time. All my family live within a 7 min drive of me and are half siblings. We see each other all the time, and have Christmas, birthdays, etc with each other.\n\nIt sounds like your dad's bf and partner are great, but it doesn't replace family.\n\nTalk to your dad. It might be hard, as you are young, and might not know what to say, and it might feel scary. Tell him you love him and want to be apart of his life and apart of his family. You didn't leave because of him, but because your siblings were giving you a hard time and you didn't know how to handle it. Ask him if he can take the lead in trying to work this all out.  \n\nJust because he didn't 'fight' for you doesn't mean he doesn't love you. He might have been trying to respect you, and maybe he felt rejected. \n\nI wouldn't change schools. If you see your siblings, smile and say hi.\n\nAll the best.",

I mean, I don't know the guy but from what you're saying I think that he doesn't want to keep you in a situation that you felt uncomfortable or unsafe in just because of his own emotions and he wants to respect your choice. But like I said, this is just a guess. Anyway, it's nice that you are finally in a healthier environment",

Your dad's friend and his wife came in, and they're treating you well. They're going to become your real family.

I only say this because now that you got out of that toxic situation and in case the step mother and siblings are very petty people and want you to be miserable because you were discovered, I would say be careful that they don\u2019t try to go out of their way to be mean to you or try to get you in trouble but if they aren\u2019t the type I just say flip them off if you see them next time",

            "I'm so glad you're at a safer place and with people who actually care about you now. B and J seem like absolutely amazing people and I'm so happy for you to have found a safe haven. This is a prime example of found family in my eyes. These two stepped in and up for a complete stranger.\n\nAlso, take them up on their advise to go to therapy. It can definitely help you deal with your trauma and emotions. Give it a try and find a therapist that is right for you. I go to therapy and while it's not always... \"comfortable\", in the end I emotionally feel better after these sessions.\n\nEdit: I'd like to point out that none of this is your fault. Don't you dare let anyone make you feel this way. Your stepsiblings and especially your ADULT stepmother should know as much. Them taking their hurt feelings and anger out on you is absolutely despicable! And your father is enabling them by allowing this to happen. He should have a clear stance on this and protect you. Tell them, they should get their act together and act like decent human beings. It is HIS fault. HE was the one who cheated. It's HIS responsibility to deal with the backlash, not YOU! GOSH! This makes me so angry!",

I would like to say that if your step siblings keep tormenting you for something your father did please stand your ground. I'm sure you won't see them often if switching schools works out but a quick \"Hey look, I'm sure you're going thru some things emotionally due to dad cheating and me moving in and stuff but I have nothing to do with it. I had no where to go and I didn't appreciate your hostility. Dad was the one who fucked up. Alienating and bullying someone who just lost their mom is inexcusable considering your age and I no longer consider you guys family\" might let you feel like everything's been wrapped up. I'm really sorry you had to go thru that. An 18 and 14 yr old acting that childishly against someone innocent is horrible. Your dad is not taking responsibility for his actions or his children at all. I hope you find some happiness and peace in your new living situation :) (again, just a suggestion for if you'd like to properly put a close on the situation regarding your step siblings!)",
            "I hope that the only thing that happens to you after being able to leave are great things. Maybe your dad will eventually see that he was simply not trying hard enough for his son. Because he wasn\u2019t. I hope you get the closure you deserve and that the memories of your mom forever live untainted. Maybe living somewhere you can call home is the best thing that could have happened for you at this time. You deserve to feel safe, heard, loved and supported through this hard time. I hope this is something that you will now feel and experience with this new home you are being welcomed into.",

The mistreatment and mental abuse you suffered under these people who should be your support system is nothing short of horrendous, nightmarish, unforgivable... There are not enough words.

Knowing that your absolute shit-hole half brother ripped those photos up, I'd encourage you to write down as many of the memories as you can and revisit them with friends who you feel safe enough to share with. I'm sure your Mom is so proud of you for how strong you've been through this ungodly situation.",

Since it all happened fairly recently I'm confident you can remember details of what she looked like.\n\nYou weren't given a place to grieve easily but you are now in a safe place to breathe, rest and sleep, the proposition of going to school that won't hinder your education, and therapy for your mental health. Pick up the pieces and build yourself up. I hope everything goes well for you!",

If you don\u2019t mind me asking there\u2019s some questions I wanted to ask if you don\u2019t mind me asking because when you did post some thing kind of made me wonder. First if you did get out of the school do you feel that after you do that your siblings will try and retaliate against you again if say you flipped them off or told them drop dead just so they can get satisfaction out of getting you in trouble or are they at that I don\u2019t care what you do just get the hell away from me type of attitude? My other question is now that you know that your grandparents refuse to even acknowledge you have you made sure that if and when you decide to strike out on your own to make sure you don\u2019t have them try to find you so they demand you help them even though that they won\u2019t help you? I have the feeling that they are probably going to pull the we disowned you and your mother but we command you to help us in our old age type of routine and I have the feeling that\u2019s what that stepmother yours might try as well. Also one other question is that if you did try to contact them and you\u2019re about to leave do you feel that if you said something horrible to your family do you feel that they\u2019ll try to get back at you were at they at this point just wanting you to just disappear and pretend that you didn\u2019t exist? I\u2019m sorry to ask this but something says to me that your father probably might want you to be there a couple of times in your life just so he can pretend to be the loving father but I would say be careful that you\u2019re half Siblings and step monster don\u2019t try to sabotage anything for you in the future just so they can get their kicks out of humiliating you.

        "selftext": "And edit 3 (I forgot to type this as I was just going to bed): The whole reason I came here was to know how to respond to our acquaintances when they approach me about it being so great Mark came out. This is basically going to be my go to response: \"I'm happy that Mark finally had the courage to live true to himself, but divorces are always sad and unfortunately ours is no different.\" \n\nEdit 2: just realized I could edit after the lock. This is my first gold...thank you so much...this has been amazing at the all the support I've gotten. I don't even know how many private messages I've gotten since the lock and how many people have gone through this or had relatives to through this.\n\n\nThings will be static for a while but when there is news I will post an update. Right now I'm going to go hug my kids because even with all the crap, I never would have had them without Mark in my life and they are my two favorite people in the world.\n\nThank you again.\n\n\nI hope this doesn't get too long, I'm sorry in advance, there are lots of emotions here. \n\nMark and I met in college and had a really great relationship. We dated until both of us finished law school after which he proposed and I gladly said yes. At the time he was much more religious than I was and he insisted we have kids right away and that I stay at home with them to raise them while he worked. I had really wanted to start my practice as well but I could see it was really important to him so I relented and we had two amazing kids and his law career really took off. I was able to work from home and hire help three times a week (with me still in the house) to do insurance and real estate paperwork reviews--it was something but I had really wanted to be a litigator. I was even ok with this and my resentment didn't ever really show unless Mark would remind me that stay at home moms should be stay at home moms and not work at all. \n\nMarriage turned really bad after our second child was born 8 years ago.  We basically became like unfriendly roommates. I pleaded with Mark to go to counseling with me and he would and things would get better for a few months then it would go to crap, I would insist on divorce but then he would remind me that our (his actually) religion does not allow divorce so I would insist on counseling--and the cycle repeated itself more times than I can count. \n\nThen about a year ago Mark hit me with the bombshell revelation that he has been gay since he was a teenager. I was honestly relieved for him because it seemed to explain so much of why he acted the way he did, why he was distant and over compensating with so much. I was actually very relieved that our divorce would finally come and he could live true to himself. \n\nHe moved out, but it turns out he had been having an affair with his much younger partner for about 5 years (the dates on this are VERY sketchy btw because it's very possible this \"man\" was underage when he and Mark started the affair--he certainly was when he and Mark met). I grew very resentful that I was busy working my fingers to the bone to save the marriage to appease Mark's religious sentiment while he was off having sex, technically cheating on me and violating the principles of the religion only he really cared about.  Our kids are also of the age that I could have easily gone back to work but again I stayed at home to appease his desire to appear as the perfect Christian couple--all the while he is carrying on with a younger lover. \n\nMark has also fought me at every turn over the divorce. He doesn't want to pay any alimony even though it would take me years to get my career to where I could support even half the lifestyle the kids and I lead now. He wants to pay bare bones child support and wants the image that we split custody but in reality he makes the effort to see the kids once every couple of months and ignores their calls. He's a great lawyer so even he has to know all he is doing is delaying the inevitable to make things hard on me. In all this time, he's taking sabbaticals from his firm and taking long vacations to places like Tavarua with his boyfriend delaying our divorce even further. \n\nIt happens almost daily, and certainly weekly where family and friends will see me at dinners, the grocery store or restaurants (we live in old farm community that has essentially been turned into a commuter town for the city near by but it retains a very small town feel) and tell me how amazing they thing Mark is for \"living true to himself\" and being so courageous to finally come out. I've gone along with this because I don't want to embarrass either of us. But yesterday I was approached by an older woman from our (old now-thank god) Church who almost \"shamed\" me for keeping Mark in a relationship that he didn't want to be in.  I didn't snap but its as close as I've come. The only people that really know how I feel are my best friend, my Mom and my counselor. \n\nIs it time that I just start telling the truth when I have one of these awkward interactions? I feel that if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was. \n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: my husband came out as gay. He'd been having an affair for 5 years while we struggled to keep marriage together. He's now being awful in the divorce but our \"community\" wants me to play along and be supportive of his decision. \n\nEdit: this totally blew up as I was taking kids to school! Wow thank you everyone. Lots of people asking the same questions which I should have clarified in the beginning...sorry about that!\n\n1. I have a really great lawyer as of January and he's working on it. Mark did every shitty divorce trick in the book to frustrate me into settling. It took that long for me to be able to even hire a lawyer in our area. I'm lucky in that I could represent myself in preliminary hearings which in turn allowed a judge nullify quite a bit of the crappy stuff Mark has done legally. Now that I'm going through it first hand, I am absolutely going to go into divorce when I do finally work. I've always heard, but I'm appalled at how the dirty tricks can affect people's lives. \n\n2. I'm not out to ruin him...which is thus far why I haven't spread the talk of his affair. I don't think most people know that he cheated on me...and even if they do...they seem to be more impressed with his coming out. I rationalize that ruining him is not in my kids or my best interest. \n\n3. Lots of great tips and I really appreciate every comment...this was way bigger than I thought and I'm reading all of them. Thank you. ",

            "I'm a gay man myself and that's great for him that he came out BUT...\n\nHe ruined a large portion of your life. He took up your time, your career, your emotional investments. He did all that for what? Because he was too scared to face the truth. YOU ARE JUSTIFIED IN BEING FURIOUS. If my partner came out and told me he was actually straight after building his career while I stayed at home and put my career on hold to help raise our family...The amount of walls and punching bags I would want to go through. Then to turn it around in court and not make right in how he wronged you. I honestly don't know how you haven't told people just what exactly he took from you. If he isn't there for the kids, the kids will figure it out regardless of the custody battle. Coming out doesn't make you a good parent. You were there for them and still are. \n\nYou owe it to yourself to fight hard in the custody battle. You owe it to yourself to move on. You owe it to yourself to set the record straight when people praise him for being happy while you are left in the dust. All those years he knew he was lying and he has no respect for you. Pisses me off just reading about your situation. He's an ungrateful fuck. Someone call Karma and tell her she's hit the jackpot. ",
            "I'm a gay man whose own father came out as an adult, for what it's worth.\n\nI would say that coming out at 16 in Alabama so that you can live your drag princess fantasies at high school prom is brave. Trapping an innocent woman in a marriage (while you cheat on her) because of your own religious self-hate is deeply cowardly. I have a great relationship with my father now that he's out but we had some rocky years around how he treated my mom.\n\nBut your husband is far worse: you owe him nothing and should speak your mind.",
            "You should not feel bad about telling him the truth. Just because he is gay doesn't mean he isn't guilty of cheating and ruining your marriage. There is nothing wrong with being gay....at all, but using it as a cop-out to not face the consequences of cheating IS wrong and he should feel ashamed. He isn't courageous for cheating, he's a scumbag just like every other cheater. ",
            "Check out Frankie and Grace on netflix, about two women whose husbands leave them for each other. There's a great scene where one of the kids yells something like \"I have to pretend to be okay with this because you're gay but what you did to mom was not okay.\" ",
            "Honey,  you have been trying to do the right thing your whole life.  What has it gotten you (not including your kids).  Snapping at people is wrong.  You live in a smaller town so this is how you get the real story out.  You wait until the biggest gossip is around and you break down.  Be pathetic, cry, allow the devastation to come out.  Tell them about the YEARS of cheating, of how he knew he was gay but married you anyway.  That man cheated you out of years of your life while cheating.  Let some of the stories about not seeing his kids but having sex vacations out.  This way you only have to tell one person and the whole community will know.\n\nP.S.  Also, get some damn support.  What you are going through is horrible and you are a victim.  Look, even gay rights advocates like Dan Savage call that crap out.  Get your kids some therapy and start taking charge of your life instead of being the good girl.\n\n",
            "The go-to response should be to give these people a horrified look until they shut up.  If they don't, \"my divorce is a private matter. I don't discuss it with strangers.\" But if you absolutely must respond:\n\n\n\"You are mistaken. It's wonderful that Mark has finally come out of the closet but he wasn't courageous when he pretended to love me, or continued to lie to me about his sexuality. He wasn't brave when he cheated on me the last 5 years of our marriage. I understand why you would praise someone for being true to himself, but he was never true to me in the decade we were married.  Had his lover been a young girl from his office instead of a guy, you wouldn't expect me to praise his courage while having to rebuild my life as a single mother from a marriage broken by lies and infidelity. And if your spouse came out of the closet and walked out of your life, I doubt you'd be as happy about it as you're expecting me to be.\"",
            "You don't owe him anything and can tell people whatever you want. If you have any evidence of the affair you might be able to use that in the divorce for leverage. ",
            "Stop being the perfect wife. Start fighting for your kids and to get out of this marriage. Fight *hard.*  Don't be all smiles in the grocery store. Mark wasn't \"courageous.\" He was all fear at every turn. Couldn't stay faithful to his wife, couldn't divorce her because that would ruin his \"perfect Christian couple\" image, couldn't be a good father to his kids. Cheating on your long-suffering partner is not \"courage.\" Marrying a woman when you know you are gay is not \"courage.\" Nothing he has done has been courageous so far.\n\nThe train for courage left a LONG time ago. And he's still not doing the right thing! God I am just incensed on your behalf. Get a good lawyer and take half. This has gone on for too long.",
            "I'm not sure what advice to give you, but I suspect you came here to vent and for validation anyway. So here it is:\n\nYour ex manipulated you into waylaying your career and having children sooner than you really wanted them. He used you as a beard and cheated on you [with a *child*], while you took care of your family and tried to do the right things.\n\nYour ex is an asshole. More than an asshole. \n\nIf anyone starts in on how awesome he is, I don't think think you need to go into detail, but don't agree either. Maybe just act incredulous and say \"Do you really expect me to be happy that my husband has abandoned me and his children?\" \n\nSeriously, people just don't think. It's the politically correct thing to be happy that gay people are free to come out as gay. And that *is* a great thing in general. But it's so stupid to expect that the mother of his children is actually cool about the impending divorce. ",
            "Anytime people come and talk to you about how courageous he is and how terrible you are, just tell them you wish he would have told you all this before you married,  had kids, and gave up your career. Ask them if they would please drop the conversation,  because finding out he was cheating on you the entire marriage was still hurtful, even after he came out as gay.  \n\nSeriously, fuck that selfish asshole, and if anyone says anything positive about him, make sure they know the entire story.

            "Say nothing to anyone until you have a settlement. Spend a lot on a lawyer. Reply to gossips with \"I prefer not to discuss it\". Your truth WILL emerge. \n\n(Also, closeted gay is not an excuse for infidelity)",
            "Good lord, I'd just want to clock those people.... Not that you should... But that is so rage inducing.\n\nI would not hold back one iota if someone says shit like that to you . \"Oh yes, he's incredibly brave for lying to me, convincing me to stifle my career to facilitate his facade and raise his kids while screwing around on me. Oh, and he's especially brave for ignoring his children and wanting to give us as little financial support as possible, after everything I've given to him.\"\n\nAnyone who tells a divorced/ing woman how brave her husband is for leaving her (especially since he was unfaithful and its not like you were abusive or something) deserves to be verbally eviscerated. Whatever you say to them, they totally have it coming.\n\nEdit:\n\nUuugh. After reading the other comments.... They are probably right. You should wait until after the divorce is final, so he can't hold it against you. After that, screw em. Until then, if anyone says anything, I would straight up walk outbor hang up before they even finish their sentence.",
            "If your husband's love affair was another woman, he'd be the scum of the earth. Coming out as gay doesn't absolve him from being a dick to you. \n\nThere's a difference between you being upset over homophobic bullshit (which I am not getting from this post) and being angry over how he's treated you like shit for the last ..what, decade? You do what you need to do, and if anyone says shit about you needing to support his decision, well. Tell them the sex of his partner doesn't absolve him of everything else he's done. ",
            "There's a lot of good advice here, so I won't dwell on that. Your husband is a selfish, cowardly, prick, and you are not in the wrong here. Tell the truth.

You gave up your career which you spent years in school for to be a good mom so heck yeah you are entitled to alimony (and I am very reluctant towards people receiving it). You gave up 8 years of your life where you could have been with someone who actually loved you. It is brave for someone to come out but it is not brave for them to take advantage of someone and cheat on them. ",

This kind of nonsense is inexcusable!  If your attorney isn't going to go to the mat for you, find one that isn't afraid to fight this jerk tooth and nail for you.  A long-time family friend went through a similar situation with her ex who as an attorney.  He actively hid assets from her so he wouldn't have to pay more child support.  She has finally gotten an attorney who will actually fight for her.  \n\n**You need the same!  Don't let this 'gay rights' stuff cloud the issue.  Your children deserve the full amount of support due them!**",

It was misery for me, and I ended up in therapy over it.\n\nI recommend therapy for you as well. This is a massive betrayal and upheaval of your life, you have been living a lie just as much as him, even though you didnt know it. It takes a toll. Dont be ashamed of being mad or upset or anything else, but do get help for yourself.\n\nI wish you much luck with the future. This isnt the end, you will find happiness. internet hugs to you.",

But...\n\nWould rumors that you're gossiping about this sort of thing potentially damage your case in your divorce proceedings? As a lawyer you're far better able to answer that than I.",
            "Mark's a selfish asshole. He's also gay. These things aren't mutually exclusive. He can be brave to come out and be truthful with himself and the world, and he can also be a philandering, self important sack of shit as well. People are complicated like that. \n\nBasically, Mark's got some fucked up stuff in his head from religion and being closeted, but he went out and fucked up your life to keep his own lie going, and he's been absolutely selfish and cruel to you in this. Fuck him, fuck his boy toy, go to the mattresses and crush him. Line up everything you can on the boyfriend and their long term affair, go for full custody, rake him over the coals.

Take every penny the law allows -- nothing more, nothing less.\n\nTell everyone the truth.  This man deceived you in so many ways.  He does not deserve to have his reputation spared.

You have a right to be a little bitter and not have to lie to cover his ass.

            "I'm going to paint a different narrative. One of a young woman who gave up the idea of a career and dreams of entrepreneurship to be a stay at home mom to the ma. Of her dreams. Allowed only the time and luxury to practice her craft on a very limited part time basis, she worked for years more to be a devoted wife and mother while being active in their church community. \n\nUnfulfilled, she spent years trying to uphold the image of a perfect family but underneath was a pool of loneliness caused by a husband who, unbeknownst to her, was leading a separate life including sexual encounters with other men. Still, she fought and attended multiple therapy sessions trying to fix problems with no idea of the real issues: the man she gave everything up for, whom she was continually trying to make happy, was not in love with her at all and cheating on her. \n\nAnd now, eight years after her last child, he's decided he wants to make his absentee father status official, as he attempts to live his authentic life as a selfish, inconsiderate, manipulative person. He's trying to ignore your needs, all you gave up, and responsibility over his children. But yay for authenticity? \n\nPrint that shit out. Wear it on a tshirt. You spent years trying to keep up appearances, living a lie. If he gets to live his authentic experience, you do too. And that doesn't include indulging the fantasies of Mayberry. ",
            "In my personal opinion, it does not matter what kind of background you have. It's always wrong to cheat and even more so while being a hypocrite. He's not courageous, he's an a-hole. You on the other hand is nothing but incredible. You keep up a good facade for the sake of others and deal with your emotions in a very mature way. I respect you for that.",

            "First of all, I am so sorry that you're going through this. What a heartbreak and pain in the ass. I found this part of your post perhaps the most interesting to ponder:\n\n > \"...if Mark had left me for a younger woman he'd been seeing for 5 years, everyone WOULD be expecting me to spill the beans on what a jerk he was.\"\n\nThis is so very true. If he'd have left you for a woman, you'd have people intimating that you perhaps didn't know how to keep your man satisfied, or that he got bored, or that he has a wandering eye. But I suspect no one has said any of that to you about this situation. We are still on the new side of being PC and accepting of gay as mainstream and as such, few are afraid to separate infidelity from who they cheated with. Instead of people treating you like you \"failed as a wife\", they're treating him like a cultural hero (maybe in a way, that is a good thing).\n\nThat must add so deeply to the embarrassment, sadness, and frustration that even a basic breakup brings. I hope that your counselor is great and s/he makes you know that this has nothing to do with you, and no amount of quality relationship would matter. Even if he left you for a woman, your relationship was not meant to succeed. There is, oddly, comfort in that if you can find it. I'm sure that seems oversimplified and I don't mean that at all, in my personal experiences, dusting off and knowing you tried your best is sometimes all that can get you some peace in the dark spots.\n\nCan you claim fraud? I don't know anything about law, but he convinced you that he was one person when in reality, he was someone else and not just in his head and heart either, but in a bed with another person. ",

Go get a bunch of cheap mirrors and a baseball bat. Fish tanks are also fun to vent anger on. And what fucking church do you go to where they take the gay guys side for breaking your heart? Thats the craziest thing to me in this.",
            "You have a weird-ass church. I don't have more advice. I certainly believe in attending churches where gays are affirmed, but I believe in attending *Christian churches* which see marriage as sacred union, not something done out of convenience to deceive an innocent and loyal partner. ",
            "Not that you ever needed to, but certainly now you don't need to do anything to appease him. Carrying around the stress he's continuing to put you through isnt doing you any favors. What he's doing doesn't make him courageous it makes him selfish. Everything he has done is self-serving. From marrying you, keeping you home & now this. Go ahead & snap & don't feel guilty for it either. Then go buy some bubble bath & a bottle of wine! You deserve some time to be concerned with your own feelings, take it.",
            "I JUST WROTE THIS ON ANOTHER POST NOT 6 HOURS AGO!\n\nKnew a chick, and she was marrying a gay guy, and everyone was like \"WTF? But he's gay, I don't get it.\" And that was the truth because no one did. Then she found out he was gay, because he was gay, and they got divorced, and then she was like \"why didn't anyone tell me?\" like it was all our fault. ",
            "What he did to you was horrible.   What IS awesome is that now you can stop living a life you don't want because of someone else.  Once you have the divorce proceedings behind you, I hope you figure out exactly how you want to be living your life and do that, and don't sacrifice huge things for someone else again.  Your next partner needs to be someone who wants you to do the things that are meaningful to you.  It'd also be a good idea to figure out how to work through the immense anger you must be feeling.  It'd be too bad if you lost years more of your life to Mark, but this time because you are too focused on the anger of what he did to you to move on.\n\nThe best revenge is living well.  Figure out how to be happy, move on and have the life you want.  Leave Mark behind. ",
            "That's fucked up for people to say that to you! I can't believe anyone would blame you for repressing him. Did it seriously not occur to anyone that you're shaken up over this?\n\nYour husband is a cheater and a liar, not a hero.",
            "Next time someone tells you he was courageous, tell them \"Oh yes! Very brave of him to risk our sexual health by sleeping with another man wile I had no idea. Really, I could have died of AIDS and had no clue! How brave!\" \n\nSeriously, he doesn't get brownie points here for his \"bravery\". He doesn't get to hide for years, to *cheat* on you, to waste *your* life making you be part of a religion you don't believe on, try to keep you from living your life.... and get called \"brave\". \n\nIf he had cheated on you with a younger woman, how would you feel? How would anyone feel? He doesn't get a fucking pass for being a massive smeghead just because he was in the closet. \n\nHe didn't choose to be gay. But he chose to fuck up *your* life. He chose to bring children into the world that he no longer wants to deal with. He **chose** to cheat on you. \n\nHe is a scumbag, and honestly, the whole world should know it. He's not brave, he's a fucking coward asshole. Being gay won't change *that*. ",
            "The asshole cheated on you (doesn't matter whether or not it is with a man) and is now trying to make life hard for you. Fight fire with fire. Fuck that guy. ",
            "I don't think it is advisable to \"snap\" if you can avoid it, but I also think the simple answer here is you should just tell people the truth. \n\nIf someone asks what happened between you two, or where he is, tell them the truth.  There is no reason to protect Mark from the consequences of the bad decisions he has made at your expense. ",
            "You're right to be mature about it, but he screwed you over and there's nothing wrong with telling the truth. You don't owe him shit.",
            "If you need others to know the truth in order to keep sane, tell them the truth. I do think it would make you feel better, but be selective about who you tell and be blunt. The others need to be given a look that says they should mind their own business.    \n\n\n\"I helped support our family while he spent the last five years of our marriage cheating on me. Now I'm still supporting our family without him. You can support him now.\" ",
            "I'm reminded of the Episcopalian priest who abandoned his family for another man and got nothing but support from the media for obvious political reasons. Good luck ",
            "I imagine a lot of people in your life don't know all the details. The 'juicy' detail that he is gay and the divorce is part of coming out is the one people are most likely to know about.\n\nIt's possible that people think that he was a good person throughout this ordeal. That he was struggling with his own identity, finally was able to be honest with himself and you, asked for a divorce, and he should be supported in his difficult time.\n\nThose people don't know that he was having an affair, and they don't know that he's being an asshole during the divorce. I don't think you have to play along. I think it's perfectly fine to say \"I'm glad that he can finally be true to himself, but his self is still an asshole that had a 5 year affair and is making this divorce a nightmare\"",
            "Fuck no your not wrong for being furious with him. 12 years of time money and commitment to this guy and now he's fucking off while being a total ass hat. Good for him for coming out. Fuck him for wasting 12 years lying and cheating and then doing w.e he can to make things worse during all this. you wouldn't be ruining him by telling people the truth. You'll be exposing him for the exact kind of person he is. A shitty one. You owe him nothing and your kids won't understand any of this until they are much older but at some point they will figure it out what he's done exactly and realize for themselves how crappy he can be.",
            "I don't have any advice for you; I just wanted to say that I am mad as hell about what he's doing/done to you. It's not fair! You've done right by him the *whole* way, and he treats you like this. What a asshole!",
            "So,  so much this.  I've been there,  three years later I am still angry.  I relocated and started over,  no one ever thinks about what the family has been put through.  How hard it is and how hard daily life is after something this catastrophic.  I hope you find peace, I hope you have continued support.  Youre not wrong in being angry. Do what makes you happy,  do what's best for your family.  ",
            "Anyone who is telling you he's so courageous is a real insensitive piece of work. I hope they witness the same levels of \"courage\" from their spouses.",
            "Gay has become such a hot button issue lately. Honestly, fuck your husband. I'd say the same if he was with a woman for 5 years. He cheated on you, and basically used you as a live in maid/nanny. You are a bigger person than I am, because I would be mad bashing all over the fucking town. For being a liar, a cheater, a user etc  I'd use every ugly adjective I knew. So major major props to you for being such a big person. You deserve to be happy. I'm sorry this happened. ",
            "You don't have to embarrass anyone when people bring up the topic. Obviously, this asshole is in the wrong here. It is not courageous to string along your wife and children in a 12 year lie. If people ask you or talk to you about it, maybe just make small remarks such as \"Oh yeah it was really courageous of him to lie to his family for 12 whole years. I don't know anyone who has the strength to do that\" and just leave it at that. Or something. It's honestly none of these people's business either so you don't own them an explanation. Your (ex) husband is a dirtbag. ",

        "selftext": "I live alone in a city and I've had some trouble making friends. I go to the same cafe every day and the owners have taken on almost a parental role since my family is so far away. I'm close with them and I trust them and they care about my wellbeing, so when one of the owners, Sara, gave me the number of another regular, Derek, I trusted her judgment.\n\nI know Derek a little bit from spending time in the cafe. It's a small place and we both sit at the counter so we can chat with the owners. Usually, we sit next to each other. We've chatted about movies, he once helped me with my language homework, and he's generally in the cafe hanging out most afternoons. Sometimes reading, sometimes working on his computer. He's also friends with the owners of the cafe and has always seemed like a nice person so I certainly wasn't against getting to know him better.\n\nWhen Sara gave me his number yesterday, she was selling him pretty hard. I asked her about the book she was reading and she said, \"Derek lent it to me!\" and when I asked about a card game she said, \"Derek taught it to me!\". So I said, \"okay, I get it. I'll text him.\"\n\nI texted Derek after I left the cafe and I thought it was maybe a bad idea because if things went south, it would be uncomfortable to see him in the cafe almost every day. But it seemed like Derek had already set things in motion by asking Sara to slip me his phone number in the first place.\n\nDerek told me that he could use more friends in the neighborhood and that he'd like to get to know me outside of the cafe, so we went out for a few beers. So, last night I learned that Derek is 31, unemployed, and he sees dead people. He's a full-on weirdo, which is fine. I still had fun hanging out with him and I didn't feel unsafe or threatened until I got home.\n\nIn the 10 minutes it took for me to get into my apartment and get ready for bed, Derek sent me about 20 messages about how he wanted to kiss me and asking if he could come upstairs. I told him \"no, thank you for a fun evening. good night.\" and went to bed. My phone died overnight and when I woke up and plugged it in, he had sent me more messages confronting me about blocking his number, which I didn't do. These messages were over the top and intense and honestly, they worry me a bit.\n\nIt's obvious to me that I need to back away from this person, but right now I have no idea how to do that gracefully. I wouldn't mind a friendship, but he's made it clear that he's interested in a romantic relationship. I just want to be able to get coffee and enjoy myself without any awkwardness.\n\nWhat can I do? What should I say to Derek? And should I tell Sara that this guy freaked me out?\n\nTL;DR: I went out with a regular at my local cafe and it didn't go well. He's maybe a little unhinged. I don't want to lose my favorite coffee shop. How do I handle this without any awkwardness?\n\nUpdate: Thank you for your advice! I just went to have some coffee and talk with Sara. I didn't tell her everything but I told her I found Derek a little strange and she asked me what happened and I told her what he said about seeing ghosts.\n\nI mentioned in one of my comments that Sara shares some of Derek's interests in spirituality and mindfulness. We talked a little more about this. she's a very open-minded person. Sara knows that Derek believes he sees and hears ghosts and said she wasn't sure if it was true but she didn't believe he was deranged. I probably misunderstood some of what he was telling me about seeing dead people because we weren't speaking English.\n\nShe asked me overall how I felt the date went and I told her that he was getting pretty intense, he's too old for me, and I'm feeling a little uncomfortable. She told me that she thinks Derek is a good boy but agreed that he can be a little over the top and told me to let her know if he did anything else that made me uncomfortable.",

She is the owner, she has the right to refuse service if she feels someone is a threat to other customers. You also say they have a \"parental\" role to you; someone in that role would likely want to protect you.\n\nDon't blame her for setting you up (it doesn't sound like you took much convincing, so his facade of normalcy must be pretty good), and don't demand she ban him from the store, but explain that you aren't comfortable around him and let her take the lead and see what she does.\n\nAs for Derek, block him. Don't try to be his friend after he has already harassed you.",

If things go bad, you taint the place it started up at.\n\n\nGiving Sara details is going to help your case here and get her support.   Maybe tell Derek something mild like you don't want that large of an age difference in a romance.  If he suggests hanging out as friends again just decline and say you aren't interested in going out to whatever he invites you to.   That way if you guys happen to be in the coffee shop at the same time, you will be still mostly strangers. ",
            "Re: your update: she has now SPECIFICALLY asked you to tell her if he makes you uncomfortable. You need to show her the texts. She wants to know how bad it is and you downplayed his behavior to start with.",

These people have known each other for a long time and he can lie about YOU. Who do you think Sara will believe more? A friend she\u2019s known for years or You? She NEEDS TO KNOW how weird this guy is, WITH EVIDENCE.  Also homegirl, don\u2019t even trip. Tell this weirdo that you would like to be friends and that is all. Go about your life as usual. ",
            "Block him, but take screenshots because you may need to go to the police if this escalates. He may be a stalker and you may need to get a restraining order from this guy if he\u2019s already acting like this. You guys aren\u2019t even dating, and he\u2019s sending you that many messages and being this controlling? Please contact a friend and tell them about the situation to ensure your safety. Losing your favorite coffee shop is the least of your problems. ",
            "Seems like you could just approach the lady and tell her what happened. Show her the texts if you want. If she's a crazy person also and totally lacking empathy she will fail to see the problem and you'll probably have to just find somewhere else to go. If she's normal, she'll see the obvious problem and be on your side. If you're expecting them to, like, kick him out forever or something though I wouldn't hold your breath. He's a customer just like you and they're business owners in the end who might not want to lose a regular, so your \"family dynamic\" there just might not remain the same if they try to stay neutral. It's all up to them how it plays out, we can't predict it.\n\nThis is a great reason as to why you should personally vet people for extended lengths of time before giving out personal info or spending time with them socially though. Bummer this didn't work out.",

Back then I was alway the nice girl and let people walk all over me. But being single and dating has taught me so much... I think your feeling guilty is the shock and it hasn\u2019t worn off yet. The cafe is not worth it. Go find a new one. He wont take the rejection well and won\u2019t go quietly. I was lucky that in my situation the guy never knew where I frequented lived etc. just find a new place to hang and don\u2019t talk to him anymore. ",

            "i hate to be the one to tell you this, but there is sometimes a vast and often indistinguishable difference between people who are very warm/kind and those who are *good people*. sara is one of the FORMER - she\u2019s warm and kind, but she DOES NOT have your best interests/safety in mind. \nfirst of all, she pressured you into approaching [essentially] a total stranger one-on-one when you hadn\u2019t independently expressed interest in doing so. \nthen, when you told her about your deeply uncomfortable (read: absolutely terrifying, for a young woman living alone in a new area, hello there \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc i understand *exactly* where you\u2019re coming from!) experience with this creepy grown-ass man she pushed on you, she told you he was a \u201cgood boy\u201d. *what???* \n\nat this point, it\u2019s my opinion that sara is either:\n1) well-meaning & kind but *completely* socially clueless, enough so to actively put you in harm\u2019s way and not bat an eye (!!!) - or -\n2) deceptively \u201cnice\u201d to all her patrons and really could not care less about anyone. \n\nBOTH OPTIONS ARE BAD. PLEASE, from one single woman also desperately relying on my beloved \u201cregular\u201d spots in a totally new area for some semblance of familiarity, please please please find a new coffee shop. stay safe. surround yourself with good, not just *nice*, people. \n\ngood luck!

            "Yeah, I think the stuff about seeing dead people was the *least* important stuff to tell Sara about. What she needs to know about is how pushy he was to come in to your apartment and how he flew off the handle cos you didn't respond to his messages while you were sleeping. :/",

You can\u2019t reason with crazy. It will only give him the attention he wants and encourage his behavior. \n\nYou may have to avoid your coffee shop for a while. I\u2019m sorry about that. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be waiting for you there - best thing would be if he let his crazy show to the owners while he\u2019s waiting / obsessing (and maybe they could ban him. But then he could still wait for you outside).\n\nRead \u201cThe Gift of Fear\u201d. It\u2019s an incredible book that sheds a lot of light on this sort of behavior and how it escalates. ",

They\u2019d send me someone they wouldn\u2019t in a million years consider dating themself and it feels very disrespectful to do that.

It shows that they had some deal about you and you mentioned that Sarah has been nice to you like a family. It\u2019s really sad to say that sometimes people are nice(strangely nice) to you only because they have some intention. Maybe Derek has already targeted you since you first came to the coffee shop and made some plans with Sarah.

            "Dude, if you\u2019re going to be honest with someone, be 100% honest, not 70%. Those text messages are a huge red flag for some psychotic shit. Not to mention the seeing dead people stuff. If she still doesn\u2019t get it and still tries to hook you up with this dude, she\u2019s not really interested in your well-being. There are tons of ways you can make friends in a city. Don\u2019t be scared of saying no to people. ",
            "If things for some reason will go south even more, don't be afraid to lose your favourite coffee shop. I understand that can be hard in the new place, but if guy will be creepy even a little, and the owners will not do anything about it (or their actions will be unsatisfactory) just find another place.\n\nIn many coffee places you can find friends when you'll be there a regular, just like in this particular coffee shop. As you experienced, it's natural - the more often you are in the place, the bigger chance that you will start to chit-chat with the owners or the other regulars.\n\nAnd guy, as you described him is a \"nice guy\" TM.\n\n\\>  Sara, gave me the number of another regular\n\n\\>  unemployed, and he sees dead people. He's a full-on weirdo, which is fine.\n\nIf you are serious - no it isn't fine. This guy has some issues, and in my opinion you should 100% avoid him. If there will be even one creepy behavior, don't try to convince yourself \"I love this place, what can he do anyway\". Well, bad info - creeps are capable of doing not nice things.\n\nJust change a coffee bar without any regrets. If owners are really cool, they will understand this, and you can always meet with them after work once a while.\n\nGood luck, be safe and update.\n\nEDIT: Also, if they're friends with coffee owner she can try to explain his behaviour \"it's not a big deal, he is a \"good guy\"\". That's what the friends sometimes do... Especially when they made bad call - many people can't admit to the mistake. Don't buy it, please. You can \"agree\" with her of course, but if she will be like that - change your coffee spot!",

You owe her honesty. \n\nShe deserves to know what kind of person he is to women he is interested in. \n\nYou told her all the irrelevant things, AND SKIPPED THE MOST IMPORTANT! \n\nYou can't make him change or calm down. You can't make this go away and be the same. Things will have to change. Sorry, but that's what happens when someone aggressive gets fixated on you. \n\n\nNow please do the right thing. Show her. ",

Like... no? Let her know if he does more? Why give him the chance.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be rude if you don\u2019t want to but he is being objectively inappropriate and way too much. So you say to Sara that unfortunately you\u2019re not into him and to him you say that unfortunately it\u2019s not going any further and you want him to stop pursuing anything romantic. I\u2019d also tell him to lose my number but I understand you may be uncomfortable doing that (you shouldn\u2019t!

The fact that he got that crazy after one date screams something is not right with him. Any rational person would've just assumed you feel asleep our that you were just busy. With how quickly his agression escalated I honestly believe your safety could be at risk. Telling Sara the complete truth will be better for you, it will also send this guy a message saying what he did is something you will absolutely not tolerate and you have people that will have your back.\n",

If you haven't heard anything since then I think it's one of those situations where it's best to just ghost. If he does persue you then just say bluntly that you're not looking for a relationship with anyone right now, and you're sorry if you have him the wrong impression. Not that you should have to apologize but it's sometimes wise in these situations! If he does continue making you uncomfortable, and especially if it stretches into in person/at the caf\u00e9 then don't be afraid of saying clearly \"you are making me uncomfortable\". I sent my housemate a long message explaining how and why he made me uncomfortable, and it did help to an extent. \n\nHope that helps, and hope you get out of this situation soon!",

This is the best shot you have at preserving your current situation at the coffee shop. If he doesn't take it well or continues to send you aggressive messages, you'll need to set very firm boundaries. Tell him outright to leave you alone, tell Sarah the situation, and probably find another place to spend some of your time.",

I would share the texts you received with the owners of the cafe, just so somone else you know has an idea of what happened in case things escalate.

You can't really have a friendship with this guy because he's apparently unable to respect basic social boundaries.\n\nI echo others on screenshotting the texts, relaying your date (Sara presumably would be interested in hearing about it anyway), and informing the owners generally. You can just let the know that you don't want to lose this coffee shop and interacting with them, and you don't know how to navigate this guy freaking out like this.\n\nIf the owners have any sense, losing Derek's business (if need be) is much better than him scaring away multiple female customers over time, which he will do if he stays (or at least if the owners/Sara keep trying to set him up).\n\nThere will be awkwardness, but it's not your fault.

Sarah is trying to be your girl, help you get laid out enjoy some Male attention from someone who is clearly smitten on you! already has a crush! is overly excited AND also a nice guy asshole. sometimes when I'm dating someone new, I'm always checking how they process negative information. I like to take things slow, boys get crushes and want to rush too fast for me, so I get a lot of potential dates or friends that turn out like this for me. \n\n\nHE IS CREEPY!! THAT IS NOT OK. for the safety of everyone, give me his number and I'll explain politely to him, how he f--d up, and now there are social consequences. Show Sarah the texts. ask her opinion. demand he not sit next to you. tell him he's inappropriately behaving and you're surprised because he's old enough to know better and to treat people with respect. \n\nlecture him. \n\ntell him to move over or leave. \n\nbe the boss. \n\nIf he gets more dangerous--call the cops, a friend, someone intimidating who's just good people, and tell him to get off your jock and grow up and be respectful!! ",
            "Honestly, don\u2019t go back to that coffee shop just yet.  Don\u2019t go running to Sarah showing her screenshots, there\u2019s not really a good scenario that can come of that.  It\u2019s possible he\u2019s so embarrassed he won\u2019t show his face there either.  This will likely only become a big deal if you make it a big deal.  Just take a week or 2 off and go to a different place.  Then when you do go back just sit down and wait for Sarah to talk to you about why you haven\u2019t been around lately.  Tell her Derek gave you a bad feeling and you thought it would be best to not be seen by him for awhile.  If she continues to ask tell her about the texts.  She\u2019ll probably feel horrible for what she put you through.  Tell her it\u2019s fine but you\u2019d just prefer not to run into him.  Get a feel for if he\u2019s been around a lot since you\u2019ve been absent.  Chances are you\u2019ll eventually run into him there, just politely ignore him and cut conversations short.  Much better than getting him banned from his usual spot by running to the owner with creepy texts.   Good luck",
            "I\u2019ve been demonstrably psychic since I was 13, I\u2019m now 61, and there have been hundreds of incidents throughout my life that prove that I am. Many of those experiences are related to communicating with dead people.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d be more worried about the over the top texting and paranoia. ",
            "You mentioned you live just next door to the cafe. I really hope you don't need to move away as well for safety reasons. You're in such a troubling situation if I were you I'd probably just pull away and move somewhere else because of anxiety. I really don't know how you're handling it. Be strong and good luck!",
            "Sometimes blocking crazy people who have other ways to contact you only exacerbates their crazy contact.  It\u2019s easier to ignore and diffuse a text than a letter on your door or something weird like that.",
            "If it goes any further tell him you will be filing a harassment report. A lot of times that will scare guys who truly don\u2019t mean harm. If he has a bad reaction to that\u2014 File it!!! ",
            "You have already told him, politely,  that you're not interested.  Could you maybe go to the coffee shop owners and ask them if they could sit and have a talk with him? What about also throwing in a fake guy you just met , tell just the owners how good it's going and you really like this made up guy. Don't tell the weirdo,  the owners will tell him , trust me.\n\nHope these options work. For me I prefer being direct, but I get  that's not everyone's style. \n\nBest wishes!",
            "I would be careful with Sara. I think that you should , as gently as possible, enquirer if Derek is in any way related to her family before you tell her about the creep issues. ",
            "Ignore him (so you have an ongoing record of his attempts at interaction) and send screenshots to the owner. The owner may ask for him to take a break from the coffee shop for a while. If she doesn't, you always can choose to. \n\nJust be honest with the owner, \"I love your shop and I really value my relationship with you and OtherOwner. But Derek made the whole situation really uncomfortable. His intensity and lack of respect for my boundaries after one casual date was, for lack of a better term, a bit disturbing. Im just not comfortable around him anymore. So I think I may take a break from the shop for a litttle bit just to put some distance between me and him. Thank you so much for understanding.\" They will either volunteer to tell him to step away or they will accept your plan. But the situations end result will be clear- you and Derek are no longer social cause hes a boundary crossing weirdo. ",

            "You have every right to go where you want to go, and you have the right not to be harassed.  I second others who have said to just ignore him (unless he escalates or gets dangerous-- then tell the police), show the people who set you up the texts, and just continue doing what you want to do as far as hanging out at the shop.\n\nIt was one date.  You don't owe this guy anything, even politeness.  If he bugs you, just ignore or get the appropriate authorities involved if you feel he's going to do something.  Folliw your gut on that last part.\n\nIn the future, if a guy needs an intermediary to ask you out even though you see each other on a regular basis, it's a bit of a red flag.  Through years of experience, I can tell you: you don't want the ones who know you but are too scared to ask you out or give you their number in person.  Takes time to learn that.",
            "Just be frank with everyone. Your story and feelings are enough. Just say to both Derek and the owners that you had fun, that you liked to hang out, but then the messages were too much and not OK at all. \n\nSimple, true and really nothing wrong with saying it as it is. If Derek asks again just say it was fun last time, but then it was not OK, so let's go back to what was before. \n\nWhy would it be more complicated than this?",
            "This advice is based on another woman giving me the same advice 20 years ago:  Just openly tell him \"I don't like you.\"  Just that and no more.  Don't hedge, soften it, or try to explain.  ",

            "Don\u2019t feel bad for having emotions or opinions. He freaked you out and you\u2019re not interested in him, that\u2019s that. It\u2019ll probably be awkward but be clear and direct with him that you do not and will not see him romantically. I would keep a record or everything he\u2019s texted to you as well, it is over the top. Be mindful of your surroundings, especially if he knows where you live.",

            "Personally, I hate blocking. I think it's immature, but I also am able to trust my instincts and tell people when they have gone too far. I would draw a line in the sand in plain language. \"Derek, I am not interested in a relationship, I don't want to be friends outside of the caffe, and I don't want you to text me any more. Texting me 20 times in X minutes is extremely inappropriate.\" Then I would tread carefully and see if you can to the cafe while he is there and if he will behave with polite distance. If he fails, I would tell him \"I told you, Derek, I do not want to be friends outside the cafe.\" But this might not be for everyone. I personally think it's an important skill to be able to tell someone uncomfortable things to their face.\n\nI would also tell the owner and see what she says, and then make my decision about whether I can go to the cafe any more based on those two variables (her reaction and if he realizes he fucked up and leaves you alone).",
            "I would recommend the following ( knowing its easier said and done) : you don't need to justify the fact that you don't want to be with this guy whatsoever. Just be like: Hey, I don't think this is going to work out. Period. You don't need screenshots of texts, or anyone else's approval as to why you feel this way. You don't need to spread the fact that the guy is \"weird\" either.  \nJust stand your ground: Tell him, hey, this is not gonna work out, sorry. Same goes for the people at the cafe. Tell them its not gonna work out between you and the guy and that#s it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point I am trying to make: You owe no one an apology, or even a reason as to why you feel the way you feel. Just be open and honest about it. People respect that a lot.   \n\n\n&#x200B;",
            "The cafe owner probably the main reason you're in this situation. She either knew about his mental health issues or she up sold a guy she doesn't know. She should have quashed this. \n\nAre you sure you want to continue being a patron?",
            "I am concerned about why she would try to set you up with a man who is over 30. (And she keeps calling him a \"boy\"...)",
            "Unfortunately he knows where you live!!! Ack. Sorry about this shitty situation",
            "What's funny is that my name is Derek and my sister is Sarah. That's the only reason I'm commenting. I promise we're not the same two though. She and I are estranged and I'm a married gay man who doesn't have imaginary friends.\n\nJust keep in mind that he's the one who fucked up. Not you. Continue your routine without any regard to his comfort. Be cordial but distant. Don't speak directly to him. If he tries to engage you simply tell him you don't feel comfortable speaking to him. \n\nUse common sense and situational awareness if there's any escalation in his behavior. Until then, hes probably harmless and frankly desperate. That is a risk you take when trying to be friends with someone who has no friends.\n\nAlso, sounds like he's got schizophrenia. It explains the dead people and his lack of real friends and his unemployment. That doesn't automatically mean he's dangerous. It does shift the odds in that direction though. Although, I think that as long as you avoid being alone with him you're relatively safe.\n\nPeople who have schizophrenia are generally prone to momentary, impulsive, violent outbursts. They aren't so much cunning or sophisticated or premeditated.",
            "I think you can go with the honest, but not too honest, \"I just didn't feel a spark\" line. You had fun, you want to be his friend, but you just don't have those kind of feelings for him. ",

            "Tell Sarah how wrong she did you, and how awkward things got with him. Send the messages to her, let her know that you trusted her judgment and it backfired. Hopefully as the owner of the coffee shop she won't want this creep circulating in there.\n\nOtherwise, get an order of protection/restraining order against him. He won't be plaguing your coffee shop anymore.",
            "Don\u2019t bring the cafe owners into your drama first. If you do, they will feel they need to choose sides. It normally never serves the person bringing the drama  up first. I would message the guy back and tell him you\u2019re interested in friends but not wanting to date right now. And when Sarah asks, you can say he was a fun \u201cfriend \u201chang with and joke about that he sees dead people and you don\u2019t see a future with him.

            "Honestly, maybe she needs to talk to Derek, & be the middle person. She could straighten this out due to a misunderstanding.\n\nYou sounded like you were on the fence regarding a relationship to begin with. So, it didn\u2019t seem like you were into a relationship to begin with. Were you put off due to race? Were you wary, about how his background was not similar to yours? Granted, I\u2019ll agree that he should be employed or at least in pursuit of a job. Yet by you pointing that out, it seems you were not clear to Sara what you were looking for in a romantic relationship.\n\nI say, talk to Sara; let her talk to Derek, see if she can clear the air. It seemed like you only went on the date because Sara insisted. That was not fair to Derek. If he was not your type or you did not like 1 thing or another thing, you should have told Sara, so she would tell Derek. It\u2019s obvious that Derek tried to play this delicately, though that does not seem to be the type you are attracted to. To simplify, talk to Sara, decide for yourself if you want to pursue a romantic relationship with Derek. If you do, be more open minded, while still getting advice from Sara. Derek himself will have to be more mindful with dating you if you both want to see where a relationship goes. If you decide to not go on a second date, both, tell Sara, & Derek. Sara in person with your honesty & how you feel about him, what type of person you want in a romantic relationship, & other details. Tell Derek, obviously in a text, from you, seems the best method. Be kind in what you write in the text. Maybe ask Sara for advice on what to say. Be honest with Derek & ask if you can still be friends. This part is the awkward part of being an adult; being okay with less than comfortable situations.\n\nIf you can continue after 1 date, as friends or in a relationship, then you will be better off for it.\n\nGood luck. I hope it works out for you.",
            "Just read top comments and I feel to say that GUYS, TRUTH IS NEVER BLACK OR WHITE. It's completely wrong that you felt kinda guilty for not having endorsed his behaviour that night. You shouldn't overchange the way you like men and what you may like of men. No one should. But let me be straight: if Derek did what he did, he's probably such miserable in dealing with possible romantic relationships that he doesn't know anymore how to do that in a \"normal\" way. He wasn't harassing C'MON. You people are tending more and more to monsterize those who use to have weirdnesses in relating. Darek's methods are sad, the attempts to draw him like an issue for society are far sadder..."
