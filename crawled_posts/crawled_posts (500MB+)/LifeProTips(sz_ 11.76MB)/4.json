            "Some negotiating tips for people since there is a lot of bad advice on this topic out there:\n\n* Don\u2019t go in guns blazing. So often do I hear people suggesting to go in and **demand** an outlandish position because they think they\u2019ll catch the counter-party in such shock and panic that they\u2019ll easily walk them back to the best outcome for the initiator. This is not how real life negotiations work. Negotiations are best done when **both parties feel like their needs are being met.** If you have a hardline position and tons of leverage then it\u2019s not a negotiation\u2026it\u2019s a demand. \n\n* Additionally, human emotion plays a big role in negotiations. It\u2019s not all hard calculations. Sometimes people will be more stingy simply because they think you\u2019re an ass. Being super aggressive on an opening position is an easy way to create an \u201cus vs them\u201d situation where the counterparty doesn\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be negotiating in good faith. It\u2019s like if you went into a raise discussion and they offered a $0.01 raise. You\u2019d probably not even want to continue the discussion (or job) after being so insulted even if they were actually willing to go higher. \n\n* Most negotiations are situations where all parties can win. Don\u2019t lock yourself into the mentality that there is a set pie that you have to fight over for your share. It\u2019s possible to grow the pie during a negotiation. How?\n\n* Find mismatched priories between parties! If negotiating an employment situation, what do you care about most? Pay raise? More vacation? More autonomy? Remote work? Now think about your employer and what they care about most. Things where you care a lot less compared to your employer and vice versa are where you can make everyone happier. \n\n* Everything is negotiable. Got approved for remote work but not as much of a raise as you\u2019d hope? See if you can\u2019t get a \u201cremote work stipend\u201d which likely comes from a totally different budget than salary. Frame the benefit as something that keeps you working efficiently (e.g., extra monitors, ergonomic chair, standing desk) while also reminding them of the lower operation costs that come with remote workers. Even if your company doesn\u2019t have these benefits, your request may be the thing that spawns them into creation. \n\n* Most negotiations have a hidden party. That discussion between you and your manager? Well your manager is operating under their own constraints from upper management/HR. You and your landlord negotiating next years lease? They have their bank and mortgage on the other side to balance. Which brings me to the most important part of any negotiation\u2026\n\n* Information. The more prepared you can be understanding the positions and motivations of all counter parties the better. The more independent data you can bring to support your reasoning (e.g., industry pay comps, research on the tie between worker efficiency and workplace comfort, competitor actions, hard data as well as qualitative reviews showing your impact) the more convincing you\u2019ll be.\n\n**Edit:** For a good book on this subject, I recommend \u201cNegotiation Genius\u201d by Deepak Malhorta, Max H. Bazerman and published by Harvard Business School",

            "Just going to say, I did my first year in trade school for plumbing last January, I've been dirt poor my whole life and it was a struggle those 7 months but before I even finished school I had job offers. 3 weeks before finishing I got a job looking on Indeed I think? It's new construction plumbing and although I prefer residential work and not big on the construction environment, Ive already recieved 2 raises since August. And with all honesty I know I'm a good worker but nothing special at all. Probably your average worker/labourer. At the beginning of 2021 I was making $17.50/hr and now at the beginning of 2022 I'm making $26/hr. In a few months once I have more than 1000 hours I get another $2 raise. Then I go back to trade school next year, which the company covers and get bumped up to $30/hr. And so on and so on. \n\nPeople should try trade school if you have any hands on skills. I had classmates that had zero knowledge or skills other than being a cashier and cutting paper but they passed and are doing great as well.

            "As a small business owner who employs 30 people and pays a living wage and health/vision/dental for them, and after a couple of grueling years with decreasing revenue, it is unnerving to see the bandwagon of people looking to encourage others to quit their jobs, find a new job that's better paying, or negotiate for better benefits while staying in ones job.  At my office, all staff got a raise in 2021, as well as a share of merit based incentives received, twice a year bonuses, and three office catered outings.  We're a well-performing medical office and rely on the consistency of our staff (most of whom have been there over 10 years, some as high as 30+ years)--but do extensive cross-training.  \n\nI am hopeful that everyone at my office gives us the credit for what we do provide.

            "This is very very accurate as I work in designing programs which are intended to increase retention, engagement, and the attractiveness of a company to potential employees.\n\nCouple Tidbits:\n\n- Be calm and informative. Say that you feel you have higher value than your current compensation and are articulate why.\n\n- Be ready for the budget potentially being less than you thought as many companies are hurting. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find some place to increase your comfort. Reimbursements some folks have mentioned as well as other programs or perks may help.\n\n- Be ready to start looking.

I just did this recently and was surprised with the result.\n\nA few months ago I told my boss I felt I was becoming stagnant in my current position. I\u2019ve been in role for a few years now and have mastered the mechanics of it, but the workflow situation keeps getting perpetually worse to the point of burnout. Plus I had seen so many new hires come and go in the past year that I\u2019ve become one of the few experts left in my department. So as a result I was looking at other position internally - I\u2019m a young professional and seeking growth opportunity as opposed to staying in this same role forever. Never mentioned that I was also looking at external opportunities but I think that would have been clear anyways.\n\nNext thing I knew I was given a 9.9% raise. Apparently anything 10% or higher and the big wigs in NY had to sign off on it and their policy is no major raises right now (except for themselves of course). This raise is completely independent of my annual merit increase (usually about 3-6%) and quarterly bonus (based on performance and sales). I\u2019ve had a good year and stand to gain a total salary increase of about 14% plus larger than normal bonuses. If I hadn\u2019t said anything I would just be getting 3-6% raise and my normal quarterly bonuses.\n\nOver all I like my job but the workload has become so intense that it\u2019s really taking a toll on me.

            ">...you have to let it sit upright for 24 hours before plugging it in to allow the oil in the compressor to go back in place. \n\nI may be wrong, but I seriously doubt that this has anything to do with the oil in the compressor, but with the refrigerant.\n\nMost fridges work by using a phase change refrigerant.  When the gaseous refrigerant is compressed, it liquefies and releases heat.  It does this in the coils in the back of the unit. Then the liquid refrigerant is brought inside the unit and the pressure is released.  The refrigerant absorbs the heat of the surroundings to boil and become a gas again.  This cools the surroundings (your beer, cheese, and steaks), and the cycle repeats.\n\nNow, when you move a fridge, the refrigerant gets sloshed around, and sometimes the liquid refrigerant winds up where the gaseous refrigerant is supposed to be, and the gaseous refrigerant winds up where the liquid refrigerant is supposed to be.  This can happen easily when the unit is on its side. Running liquid refrigerant through a compressor which is expecting a gas is what causes the damage.\n\nSetting the unit upright for a day allows all the liquid refrigerant to trickle down and pool at the bottom of the system where it was designed to be.",

            "Refrigeration systems, at least in general, have refrigerant and lubricant mixed together in a single, sealed, closed-loop system.

Also, its unnecessary to stand the refrigerator upright for a full 24 hours. But if you are not trained with either commercial or residential refrigerators, 24h of standing time is a good rule to follow either way. \n\nWhile your system is on (wether its a refrigerator, home AC, Window Unit, or anything having to do with refrigeration) the compressor oil naturally travels around the system. It does not all stay in the compressor, but most of it does. If you dry start the compressor, as in turn it on without any compressor oil, it can tear up the valves on the inside. Will it auto kill your compressor? Like a 99% chance it won\u2019t. Will it shorten the compressor life? Yep. \n\nThe main concern is that the refrigerant on the inside of the system can be burned. It won\u2019t explode (unless your system is the kind with Propane instead of standard freon) but it will render the refrigerant useless and your AC/refrigerator won\u2019t work. The compressor oil lubricates all the moving parts inside and prevents the parts from over heating, thus preventing the freon from burning. \n\nI\u2019m sure there will be a slew of other HVAC techs out there who will argue what I\u2019m saying, but you don\u2019t NEED 24 hours to \u201csettle\u201d the oil back in the compressor.

You arent required to reset your car for 24 hours, when driving up a hill with the AC running,; are you? The cold effect is caused by the gas atomising through a valve the size of a needle head, then freezing in an element (similar to electric oven element) as the gas has a boiling temp of negative 30-40 degrees. The oil is too viscous to pass through the valve, so it flows back into the bottle with the reserve gas\u2014then onto the compressor."

            "The book [The Gift of Fear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56465.The_Gift_of_Fear) has some tactics bad guys use to try and manipulate you into vulnerable situations. \n\n* Forced team - Forced teaming is an effective way to establish premature trust because a we're-in-the-same-boat attitude is hard to rebuff without feeling rude. Sharing a predicament, like being stuck in an elevator or arriving simulations at a just-=closed store, will understandably move people around social boundaries. But forced teaming is not about coincidence; it is intentional and directed, and it is one of the most sophisticated manipulations. The detectable signal of forced teaming is the projection of a shared purpose or experience where none exists: \"Both of us\"; \"We're a team\"; \"How are we going to handle this?\"; \"Now we've done it,\"  pg55 \n* Loan sharking - \"He wanted to be allowed to help you because that would place you in his debt, and the fact that you owe a person something makes it hard to ask him to leave you alone.\" pg60  \n* Too Many details - When people are telling the truth, they don't feel doubted, so they don't feel the need for additional support in the from of details. pg57  \n* Unsolicited promises: \"I'll just put this stuff down and go. I promise.\" The unsolicited promise is one of the most reliable signals because it is nearly always of questionable motive. Promises are used to convince us of an intention, but they are not guarantees. A guarantee is a promise that offers some compensation if the speaker fails to deliver; ... But promises offer no such collateral.   \n* Typecasting - A man labels a woman in some slightly critical way, hoping she'll feel compelled to prove that his opinion is not accurate. \"You're probably too snobbish to talk to the likes of me\"  \n* Discounting the word 'No' - Declining to hear \"no\" is a signal that someone is either seeking control or refusing to relinquish it. pg62  \n\n\nI highly recommend everyone read the book. It was far more enlightening than I would have imagined.",

One of the worst things society has done is expecting animals to adjust to the life people lead while living in a city.

So she was literally running back and forth because she was the only person there; and after expressing multiple times that it was too stressful and difficult, they initially lied to her face and said \u201cwe won\u2019t do that again\u201d (and then did, every day) before straight-up admitting \u201cyou\u2019re not a priority.\u201d\n\nThe worst thing is that I saw this coming\u2014in July I was on medical leave for a month and a half after a severe panic attack (created by circumstances at work) that left me legitimately worried I was losing my sanity (and that was terrifying).

Every day seems more and more unbearable. \nSo, in 2021, my goal is to be able to make enough money working from home (plus my s/o should be back to work next year) to be able to quit that job, and have a healthier quality of life where I\u2019m able to actually take care of myself. I do have a few \u201crealistic\u201d routes to do this thanks to my skillset, I just have to find the opportunity now. \n\nDidn\u2019t mean to write a novel, sorry\u2014 but if you\u2019re reading this, I want you to know that it does get better than where you are now. At this time 2 years ago I was still trying to crawl out of rock bottom. I had lost my home the year before and was staying with family while looking for a new place; I was unmedicated and mentally ill (guess I still am, since I\u2019m kinda stuck with the brain I\u2019ve got), everything felt hopeless. But I got a car, found a place I could afford (with a loan), and I was starting therapy.\n\nTL;DR :  Your job is supposed to pay for your life. Your life is not supposed to pay for your job. Don\u2019t let any employer (no matter how good you have it now, it only takes one supervisor or one change to cause chaos) make you believe that exploitation is okay. Know your value. Your job does; that\u2019s why you work there. If your job is draining all the energy and joy from your life, plan your way out. Start making yourselves the priority. Your LIFE isn\u2019t worth the expense!",

            "The best advice I read was somewhere here on Reddit a long time ago:\n\n\"Spend money where you spend time.\"\n\nMattresses and shoes fall into this category, but it gives you a better guide on how to manage those expenses. Do you do sedentary work that involves sitting in front of a computer? Then your shoe expenses may not need to be as high as if you were an engineer on-site or construction worker.\n\nOr in my case, I had a job for the last few years that required me to be at work 60-80 hours a week. Since I wasn't going to be at home a lot, I made sure to not spend too much on housing and furnishings. If I were working at home, then I would spend more money on say, a desk chair, a desk, a nice monitor, and other comforts like that.\n\nOther examples:\n\n* Don't cook a lot? Get cheaper knives. Cook every meal? Get nice knives.\n* At work a lot? Don't get too many living organisms (plants, pets, children, etc). Stay-at-home person? Make your home homely with plants, a dog, and a couple kids (if these float your boat)!\n* Is it easy to take public transit to work? Get a boring used car. Have a long commute? Make sure your seats are comfy and spring for that luxury audio system if you like music.",

It is significantly higher quality than any other piece of furniture in my house, and I was a bit uncomfortable shelling out that much money for a chair...until my back pain mysteriously disappeared less than a week after buying it.\n\nEdit: Wow, I did not expect to come back to this much response about a desk chair, lol. A bunch of people are asking what chair, I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint everyone: there's no brand on the chair, I know a guy in my city who makes them, and I just bought one from him. And it's not a thousand-dollar chair, lol, I don't make that in a month.",

Other great gift low prices ideas are Tile Key finders. If you need to buy her fancy perfume, do that but also include a bottle of Mace- so she knows you care about her safety. Stuff like that works well.  $40 gets a mini weber BBQ for a guy, and if you pick up some steaks or vegan food to grill for the picnic you planned.  Or a fire pit is $50, but if you bring over a 1/2 cord of wood with it you are a hero, add stuff to make Smores for a bonus.

            "Knowing your receiver is very important. I try to avoid people's hobbies and passions because they know way more about it than I do and getting them a random, semi-related thing probably isn't going to do any good. In that area, you need to go for specifics and are better off actually discussing it with the gift receiver. My dad and I both have lots of tools as we both use them for work and hobbies but every Christmas my mom gets him to list specific tools he would want with model numbers or direct links to websites. Seems informal but that way he gets a gift that he wants and will use and we don't waste time and money. Everyone wins.\n\nMost of the time I think getting something vague but thoughtful is a good way to go. Like a friend of mine makes crafts and made me a dream catcher one year. I never thought about or wanted one before that but I still enjoy looking at it on my wall. \n\nIf all else fails, cash is the way to go.

I really wanted to head back home, so I opened the app to see if the realtor's car was still out front. I honestly forgot that it even captured audio because I only ever used it to watch videos of things that were happening outside the front of the house (beyond the glass).  \n\nWhen I opened it up the couple in the house must have been standing like 2 feet away from the camera because they came across as clear as day. They were gushing about how much they loved the house (which felt really nice) but they hated that one feature didn't work and would be expensive to fix. I only heard them talking for like 10 seconds, and then sort of realized that they didn't consent to recording so I closed it.  \n\nWe didn't use anything they said in negotiations (and in fact accepted their first offer) but I did leave a few notes around the house for them including one giving instructions on how to operate the piece of the home they thought was broken.

Today, I didn't. \n \nSo I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. \n \nWithin a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. \n \nThe one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.\n \nEdit: This has gained a massive amount of traction. I would like to thank this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ejq9oy/ysk_to_never_trust_a_call_from_your_bank_always/fczynoa?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for the idea to post it here. It has been interesting reading all the stories. Some with similar outcomes, some with way better outcomes. Either way, it has been a nice topic of discussion. \n \nIf nothing else, I hope this post saves at least one other person from going through what I went through. \n \nEdit2: It seems in my slightly frazzled, yet still very amused, state last night, that I missed a few proof reading spots. I appreciate the red pen marks fellow redditors. Keep up the good work.\n .\n \n.\n \n.\n \n**************Update*************************\n \n. \n \n.\n \n2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received. \n \n\n \nTo clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info. \n \n1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system. \n \n2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card \"that was hacked\". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to \"lock\" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into. \n \n3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff. \n \n4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)\n \n5. Lastly, thank you all for all the kind words and reassurances. It did all turn out fine in the end. Lesson was learned.",

'Suspicious activity,' is a popular phrase, but others will claim that your account will be canceled if you don't comply, or there's a virus on your computer, and others will even say that you have an arrest warrant.\n- Some scammers will be very vague.

Helpful hint: all credit card numbers start with a 4 or a 5.\n- Anyone asking you for your password for anything. Companies don't ask for your password, and they certainly won't call you to do so.\n- Anyone cold-calling you and asking you to screen-share your computer, for any reason. Don't let them in.\n- Anyone calling from the IRS, Social Security, Medicare, or other government agencies.

            "Even if you aren't in California, send a CCPA request anyway. Most businesses process all CCPA requests without question, especially businesses located inside of California.\n\nI live in Washington and sent about 500 CCPA requests last year to various data brokers and marketing/advertising companies across the country, and most of them replied letting me know they had either deleted my data, or that they had no data on me. I'm now on their blacklist for the future too. Only 5 refused because I wasn't in California, and so I followed up with generic \"do not sell my data\" requests and 3 of them complied. The other 2 never responded, but I actually doubt they had anything about me, so oh well.\n\nI've also heard from others who have had a harder time that adding a fake California address to a list of all your past and present addresses can be enough to make them comply since there's a chance you might actually live in California and they don't want to be wrong and get in trouble.",

He pets him, albeit roughly without realizing, but my cat likes it.\n\nHobo is getting older and I\u2019m terrified of losing him, because he\u2019s the best friend and cat I\u2019ve ever had. He\u2019s starting to show an unexplained health problem, and I\u2019m scared. He\u2019s one of the only reasons I\u2019m still here (depression), and I doubt I\u2019ll be able to have or afford another cat. Not that I want a different one, of course.\n\nMy grandpa always mentions how old Hobo is and it bugs me. He\u2019s probably 14 (he arrived as a stray in maybe 2008), and I know that. I hate being reminded. He\u2019s also mentioned that Hobo needs his back shaved (knots) but that getting it done during the winter would probably kill him",

It's been 6 years now and he's a big dog, about 95 pounds, made up entirely of happiness and fear of being alone. Also has a fear of cats, probably from being in the shelter his whole life getting swatted at haha.\n\nAnyway, point of the story, he's a very large dog and spent his first 4.5 years on earth being abused, then being a stray for a year and a half around the shelter I got him until they finally trapped him and took him in, so he didn't have a healthy life. He was very skinny and had issues with his hind legs from being in a cage for so much of his life.\n\nWhen people ask me how old he is and I tell them he's about 11, all people do is tell me how they can't believe how old he is and how crazyyy it is that he's still able to run around, etc. And yeah, I get that, that'd probably be my reaction too, but I'm the one that's gotta see him have a harder and harder time as the months go by climbing into bed and getting winded on walks, sleeping more, and with winter just generally having a harder time than this time last year with everything, it kills me. I don't blame people for saying it, I probably would have that reaction too, but it sucks to have to think about that on the spot when someone says it. I mean, I think about it every couple days myself already.\n\nThat being said, yeah, I really don't blame anyone for saying that type of stuff, it's totally normal and I have these thoughts anyway because I see the effects of aging on him coming on more rapidly, so it really makes no difference. Either way, knowing I have to come to terms with the fact that he won't be around for another 6 years and wondering if it'll happen before summer this year even, or even before then, it stresses me out and breaks my heart. I don't know how I'll deal with it when the time comes. I've had dogs and cats growing up my entire life, loved them like crazy, but not like this dog. This dog I got after my mother passed away, sister got married and moved away, and my ex of 4 years and I broke up so he was all I had when things were bad and he changed my life. I went from being super unhappy and not caring about anything anymore to having to care because of him, and when he's gone, I can't even think of getting another dog. He's got this personality that I've never seen in a dog and he relies on me so much that when he's gone I'm afraid that I'll never have anyone or anything love me as much.\n\nAnyway, this post dragged on and I'm teary-eyed at this point writing it.

            "This paragraph was a waste of time and space. If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I could\u2019ve done something more productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if you did not have anything else to do in life. Life is so precious because it is short and you are being so careless that you do not realize it until now since this void paragraph mentions that you are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you realize that you are not using your time wisely. You could\u2019ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time, you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds. Imagine what you could\u2019ve done with those 20 seconds besides reading this non-productive paragraph. Imagine the things you could\u2019ve accomplished. Imagine the possibilities. But time is irreversible and you still do not realize this. Somehow you have managed still to waste around now 35 seconds reading this stupid, excessive, and long paragraph with your irreversible time. If you haven\u2019t realized that, then you have not yet read the whole paragraph. Even if you did, you still refuse to stop reading this essay. After around 45 seconds, you are still reading this mindlessly and carelessly with your precious and non-reversible time. If you remembered from the first sentence of this disgustingly long paragraph, you would remember that this paragraph was a waste of time and space, imagine if I had not typed this paragraph and you had not read it. Imagine all the things you could\u2019ve done, the things that made you, you. But no, you are still reading this paragraph and it has been around 60 seconds, which is a whole full minute. A minute! Yet you still have the urge and motivation to read this pointless and long essay. Now you have nearly reached the end, you ponder, why am I reading this? Why is the writer making a paragraph so long that I have the urge and motivation to finish this pointless paragraph to prove him that reading is what makes me, me. Then you realize, you have wasted now around a minute and 10 seconds. If you had not make the idiotic decision of continuing to read this paragraph, use that mind of yours to think what you could\u2019ve done throughout your whole irreversible time. You could\u2019ve finished your homework, play with your cat, eat your seal, or you could\u2019ve discovered who made the fire hydrant, if you did not get the reference, you could\u2019ve went and learned something and post it on reddit in the subreddit \u201cToday I learned\u201d, but you still have the urge to read this insanely long paragraph, pondering how I typed this without rest. Then you read this text and see that text over there. Why am I still reading this? How does this paragraph know what I\u2019m thinking? What did I eat last April the 17th? Then you come to the conclusion that you know that this useless and insanely long paragraph would tell you. And you are right, but I did not write this and you have wasted now around 2 minutes. A full 2 minutes. Now, use that intelligence that you have, assuming that your IQ is above 60 and you are literate. Now that you have made it this far, you wonder if you learned anything, but no, you did not get the reference about the fire hydrant and refused to look it up, then you make the decision of reading this long essay with your irreversible time. Since you have made it this far on your long journey, you try have the urge to stop reading. But I bet you cannot finish this paragraph for which you are lazy and want to continue on with your life, but you keep on reading this long, wasteful, barren, and non-productive essay that will not benefit you in any way than making you lose your irreversible and precious time, but that is not even a benefit. Soon you realize that it has been now 3 minutes. A full 3 minutes, now you use your intelligence with an IQ above 70 and ponder about the things you could\u2019ve done, the assignments you could\u2019ve done, the dogs and cats you could\u2019ve eaten. But you continue reading this now nearly 2 paged paragraph. Then you wonder how this is even a paragraph. How am did I make it this far? Do I get a certificate? Why am I reading this pointless and barren paragraph? How does this essay know what I\u2019m thinking about? Then finally, you feel relaxed and accomplished because the essay said finally to make you hyped up that you accomplished reading a nearly 2 paged essay then the paragraph creates a plot twist; You\u2019re no where near the ending. Your insides wince a little while you\u2019re reading this endless paragraph. Wondering if this will ever end. Then you start getting nervous that it\u2019s almost time for bed, then you wonder what you ate for breakfast on June the 9th. How does this paragraph know what you\u2019re thinking about you think? Because when you\u2019re reading a paragraph inside your head, the words are projected into your brain with the IQ above 90 and then the thought process go through your internal organs and through yours eyes and you wonder if this is actually true but it\u2019s really not because all it is non-sense. Then you look at your watch, if you had one, and realize that it\u2019s been a near 4 minutes. 4 minutes, if you expect this paragraph to say the old and customary saying after you\u2019ve discovered how long it\u2019s been, then you\u2019re wrong. This time, the paragraph is going to criticize you why you\u2019re still reading this essay with your irreversible and precious time. Why are you still reading this you ask? Because you are so headstrong and careless, yet you have the urge and motivation to continue reading this essay that it feels like an eternity. If you have made it this far, then it is mind boggling on what you could\u2019ve done with your near 5 minutes. Imagine the things you could\u2019ve eaten ; sushi, sharks, dogs, snakes, cats, fish, humans, dogs, dogs, and many more wonders of this world. Then when you are reading this, you realize that there is no long a wall of text, you realize that you think you\u2019ve made it to the ending and I congratulate you on your epic journey across the wall of text. Yet you have not yet realized, that you wasted a full 5 minutes on this paragraph that feels endless yet it has been ceased.",

            "\"What does success look like with this company/organization, and how do you (the company/organization) work to achieve it?\"\n\n\"Does the company/organization have a 5~10 year plan for growth and expansion? If so what is it?\"\n\n\"Does the company/organization offer a career building program of any kind? Are there advancement opportunities?\"\n\n\"Do you offer 401K?\"",
            "When they ask why you want to work for their company...answer then immediately ask: \"Why do you think I should?\" You'll likely get a reasonably honest assessment of what your interviewer enjoys about the company.\n\nAlso, ALWAYS end the interview with a variation of: \"I'll let you know when I've made a decision.\" Remember, it's never their decision for YOU to work for THEM.",

My wife once went to an interview and they fucking lost her passport while they were scanning it.

I personally got laid off in July due to the outbreak and was lucky to find another job within 5 weeks. I hate it and have been looking for a new job since I started. Unfortunately, companies aren\u2019t hiring as quickly or as much. I haven\u2019t even gotten a call back in the past 5 months.

Also having to think of your own questions gives you a sense of authority and subconsciously makes you less nervous. \n\n\nMy go-to question is asking how they measure for success. It\u2019s an important one. I would be wary working for a manager who doesn\u2019t know how to answer that question because at some point down the road my raises and promotions might be dependent on something arbitrary like how much the boss likes me as a person.",

Be sincerely happy for them.\n\nI'm not saying I'm always in the mood to hear a friend go on about something great in their life, but it's pretty easy to suck it up and feel good for them. They're happy, they're proud, they want to share their achievement with you. It's not them saying \"I'm better than you\".\n\nAnd brag about something special you accomplished too. Be the kind of friends where you celebrate each other's big moments.",

Compliment or maybe thumbs up. Most of em is hoping people have a good day even if just random & out of the blue. \ud83d\ude01\n\nEdit:\nI also think part of the reason I try to compliment/uplift others is due to the fact that most of my school life was of being put down, teased and bullied. Had maybe 1 friend the whole time. Somewhat overprotective parents which inhibited my social skills growth a but. Have flourished living on my own. Due to lots of other crazy life stuff/struggles/challenges, it has allowed me to be more patient with people. \n\nGot off track. Basically I think because I know how bad I felt when super low, I try to boost others up because I would have liked that in my life back then. Since I can't change the past, I can only change my perception of it and transmute the negative experience aspect into a positive learning experience.",

Nobody is saying it\u2019s a singular point of joy, it\u2019s just one of the niceties in life and gives recognition that you\u2019re doing things that others admire.\n\nIf anyone needs to hear it or hasn\u2019t heard it in a long time: I am proud of you.

            "I agree. Also, some people might be involved in, or have recently come out of a bad relationship where their partner is constantly putting them down. Our friends\u2019 partners/relationships are not always as hunky dory as they appear in public. Someone\u2019s significant other who appears to be a charmer and a real sweetheart in public might be putting them down and trying to gaslight them constantly at home. \n\nMany adults don\u2019t have too extensive of a social life, due to work or family responsibilities (or right now, covid restrictions) so their partner\u2019s negative talk may make up the majority of their interactions with other people. When they are with other friends or acquaintances, they may subconsciously seek validation by fishing for compliments or bragging a little, because they do know their worth (or at least they used to), but their sense of self worth is being tested by some assdonkey on a daily basis. \n\nAnd they will likely feel awful and guilty/embarrassed about it afterwards, because they know it\u2019s not cool to brag or fish for compliments. They don\u2019t want to do it, they know it\u2019s obnoxious, so the embarrassment of having done it makes them feel even lower about themselves. And so the cycle continues. \n\nI think there are also people who were mistreated as children or came from bad home environments so they are constantly seeking the validation they never had as kids when most of us were building up a normal healthy sense of self esteem.\n\nI mean there are also people who are just truly conceited  jerks, but those people are pretty easy to spot.",

The first playlist I send out to everyone ahead of time requesting they add a song or two if they desire so I can have different inputs of music as well having songs that might please people.\n\nI then listen to every one of those songs and determine if it fits the mood of the party, filtering out any songs that don't match the vibe. After that I determine what kind of start & end the song has and add it to a large spreadsheet of previous party songs.\n\nThen leading up to the party (sometimes until the first guest arrives) I create a second playlist with the new songs that worked and a bunch of songs that fit the mood and que them in a specific order so that every song flows well into each other and creates themes or blocks (example: 70s funk gets a 15 minute block, electroswing may get a block, throwback dance jams, etc.).\n\nThis allows me to \"schedule\" lulls for people to get another drink or  have a smoke between dance blocks so people don't feel like they are missing out on those moments.\n\nI made this mistake once in 2013 and have doomed myself forever, as my friends have now dubbed me the \"Musique Maestro\" and I have since been in charge of curating music playlists for any event / gathering. For smaller gatherings or last minute plans, my friends will just go into my Spotify and que up a previous party playlist.",

That is, I can fill out next months expenses with this months income, it makes my financial life lot more predictable and less worrisome. Even those without consistent income can save enough ahead to smooth out the hills and valleys of their income.\n\n2. Saving up for big expenses. Our car insurance is $850 every six months. That's a huge hit if your taking it out of only that months paychecks. But instead, for the six months prior, I save up $142 each month, and when my bill comes, all the money gets flushed out and I start again. What's better, when I was paying monthly our insurance was $170/month, so we're saving a ton too!\n\nAnyway, it's fun, and knowing where your money is and where it is going is a huge weight off of your mind.

They actually have a \"holiday,\" show a friend how to brew, or something along those lines.  \n\nI was in a large liquor store and happened to be looking at the homebrew stuff, just because I'd been thinking about it for a coupla years. Someone who worked there told me that there was a local meeting of homebrewers that very night, and I was welcome to come if I wanted. I went. It was at a bar that was within walking distance, and what did I have to lose?  \n\nProbably about 30 or so people, mostly men but maybe a half dozen females, all with samples of beer styles, many that I hadn't heard of. Sampled everything, mostly wonderful, some were wtf? Super friendly, smart, welcoming group of people. And wouldn't you know it, the \"show a friend how to brew\" time was coming up. It seems like nearly everybody who had experience was more than willing to help me with my first batch.  \n\nI ordered a simple dry malt kit for like $20, had the malt, the hops, and the yeast. Very simple, beginner stuff. Not at all how my teacher brewed, but perfectly suitable for a beginner. I went to his place on a Saturday morning, used all of his high quality equipment while we talked about his path, how he started, what he started with, and what he thought I should get to get started and keep going.  I was home in the early afternoon. Had a great time, felt like I learned a lot. Very enjoyable time.  \n\nTook about 2 weeks or so until I could try out my beer, and I was floored. It was fantastic, way better than I thought it'd be. It's like cooking something that takes a while to be able to try. I'd read enough to know that things can go wrong if you're not careful.  \n\nI think a lot of people who try to homebrew without guidance don't get awesome results on their first try. I suspect that I wouldn't have. Having someone show me the basics, the importance of cleanliness, what to look for... all of the stuff we talked about on that Saturday morning went a long way towards encouraging me to make a second batch solo, try new methods and ingredients, buy better equipment, and really enjoy the whole process.  \n\nI've become that guy who wants to show off my brews, and the guy who wants to show newbies the basics on a Saturday morning.",

U.S. healthcare really shouldn\u2019t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. \n\nThey make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I\u2019ve mentioned, they\u2019ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.\n \nSome bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!\n\nYou can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.\n\nIf you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren\u2019t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!\n\nYou can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. \n\nAnother thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.\n\nEDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there\u2019s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don\u2019t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no \u201cpropaganda\u201d or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation.

            "Story time. \n\nMy uncle and aunt went to visit my aunts parents in another state. When they arrived they learned that they'd be sharing a room with a hamster - one of their grandchildren's pets. But he's quiet and doesn't bother anyone. They claim he's not nocturnal because the kids play with it all day. \n\nSo they go about their day and when it's time to turn in, this hamster gets agitated and starts running the wheel. And it's a bit of a squeaky wheel. \n\nThis goes on for about an hour and a half until my uncle gets up and gently removes the wheel from the cage and sets it on the desk.  The hamster goes into its burrow and goes to sleep. \n\nThe next morning it was quieter than normal at breakfast until my uncle mentions the hamster doing crazy laps for an hour and half.  \n\nTheir mom sighs a relief and her dad busts out laughing and says they thought it was the bed squeaking for 90 minutes.. at which my uncle (always a jokester) says \"I might be able to go that long but she makes more noise than that hamster\"\n\nAnd it was quiet again.

            "There are 15k upvotes as I thumb this so I expect to be buried. Fuck it, writing it anyway. \n\nYears ago my old high school buddy who I hadn't seen in a while  moved into a two-story, rather old house in a neighboring state where he had become a marketing professor. He lived there with his wife and I think one black cat who never showed his face and the house had hardwood floors, a fireplace, a porch out front, and gabled windows. Old southern style in many ways. There were trees in the big front yard and back, lots of grassy lawn stretching out on both sides, a clay embankment off on the border where he would often discover local women spooning soil into their mouths (clay eaters, but that's another story). \n\nAnyway once I went to stay with him. This was I think more than ten years ago. We had a nice time chatting, his wife went to bed, we sat up having a few more beers as men do, then I called it and retired to their \"guest room\" upstairs. \n\nSo let me say a little more about the house. It was painted white, and inside the walls were also painted mostly white. The ceilings were high. They had, like many southern US houses, ceiling fans in most rooms. The baths in their two bathrooms were great old porcelain clawfoot tubs with shower nozzles you unhooked and had to control or you'd get water everywhere. A good bit of antique furniture. \n\nIt was like stepping into a set of a Tennessee Williams play. The bed was high off the ground in my room with a wide white cotton comforter, a few pillows, and an old but good quality chifforobe in front of the bed. \n\nSo I bathe then hit the sack. As I'm lying there I get a very odd feeling, as if someone is at the foot of my bed. I turn the bedside lamp on--absurdly, as I know there couldn't be anyone there. And there isn't. I look at the big chifforobe and think hmm, that is foreboding. Get up  Open it. In movies people roll over and then the killer clown pulls them under but I'll be damned if I am not going to \"secure the area\" as it were so I check everywhere. Under the bed, in the closet, in the chifforobe, in the hallway even. \n\nNo one. Nothing. But now the feeling is even stronger. As if the person--the *presence*--is right there in the room with me, and now even *conscious* of me, like watching me, like there is this palpable feeling of being watched. \n\nIn his book *The Gift of Fear*, Gavin de Becker writes that often the unnamed weirdness we feel, what is sometimes dismissed as silliness, is rather *intuition* built into us, a kind of survival tool underneath our reasoning, rational brain that is aware when something is \"off.\" It's what makes you edgy around the potentially violent guy at the ballgame, or step back when you sense the guy on the train platform might have a homicidal urge to shove you onto the tracks at the last second. Something in us *notices* when things are almost imperceptibly off.\n\nWell in this room something was off. Way off. I don't know what or who it was. It felt to me like a little girl. Not outwardly violent or dangerous but somehow unpredictable, and, in this case, fucking invisible so eerie as hell. I almost said something aloud, like addressed it, like \"Come out, show yourself, what do you want?\" \n\nI didn't. I tried to sleep with the light on. Couldn't. But it was worse with the light off. As I've said on reddit elsewhere I don't really believe in the supernatural but damn it if I couldn't shake this feeling. And I am now and was then a grown man. \n\nSlept for shit. Next morning I was up early. I didn't ask about it, about the room, because they had clearly made it up nice for me, my buddy's wife was never too fond of me and might have taken offense (He just *had* to complain about something) and anyway in the light of day I felt silly, like a scared child. \n\nA long time later I did ask my friend about it. He shrugged. \"I never go in there,\" he said. \n\nWe never talked about it again but I wasn't surprised to learn they moved a year or so later, to a house in another part of town. \n\nedit: Chifforobe is spelled withan \"o\" apparently.

I see this post reached some of its targeted audience and brought out the trolls and hatred of others. \n\nI'd like to give some background before I move on. This post was not intended to be Identical to any others out there. I posted this after having a conversation with one of the people under me who wanted to call in today. Our work is paying for his college, but having him come in to make up hours he misses due to school. He's running behind on homework and wanted a day off to catch back up. I told him I didn't need any explanation. Just don't come in. He has 7 vacation days which can be used as PTO. I as the supervisor and the company do NOT need a reason for his use of PTO/Vacation time.\n\nI'd like to thank those who posted great ideas and stories regarding their past experiences with prior jobs, Either being screwed over or helping those under them realize this as well.\n\nI'll post some of the comments and remarks a bit now, to help stop the identical spam posts.\n\n**-You'll Get Fired-** Is one of the most commented posts on here. Yes, there is always a risk of getting fired, But if a company wants to fire you for using your PTO or Vacation days, then is that really a place you want to stay at? \n\n**-Only Privileged People can do this-** As seen below in quite a few popular comments, Privileged people get way too many PTO/Vacation days and can bargain for more. Those who are less privileged rarely get time off. Jobs such as retail claim you can schedule unpaid days off, then turn around and deny them, forcing you to use their trash point system, until you're forced to come in every day or get fired. \n\n**-As a XXX This advice doesn't work for me-**  I understand that some fields, such as Military, Teaching, Railroad, etc, can't take time off due to either contracts or legal reasons. However, this post wasn't fully intended for your positions. There are a lot of young adults out there that work at retail or fast food jobs that are getting screwed over by their management and scheduling teams. I faced the same thing when I started working years ago. This is just personal advice I wish I knew when I was younger.\n\n**-It's Vice Versa, Not Visa Versa-** Alright grammar police, I'm not a robot. I make mistakes just as well as everyone else.",

I remember one day my stomach was hurting so much I was crying, and I did end up calling out from my grocery store job and my mom just ripped into me and accused me of being irresponsible and just not wanting to go to work.\n\nNow that I'm 24, when I do actually feel sick and want to call out, all I feel is extreme guilt, like I have to justify it with debilitating pain or something.",

Some of our employees come from cities that fared *even* better. So for those employees and the health of the company, the company was trying to reopen. They honestly had no expectations for me to come until I was ready. As a matter of fact, the company pooled resources from employees who didn\u2019t need them and redistributed those resources to people in need. Because of that I was able to borrow a generator and gasoline, so I could power my fridge, eliminating the need for me to going from store to store looking for enough ice to keep my food cold another day.

I knew it before, but this occurrence solidified this ideal for me personally.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve recently been working remotely in Florida and last week, we got absolutely devastated by hurricane Ian. I haven\u2019t had access to power, Wi-Fi, or pretty much any means of communication for the past week. We were hit with a 12 ft storm surge, family members houses completely flooded, cars totaled, etc. with that being said, we\u2019re the blessed ones, everything damaged can be replaced. \n\nOnce I got back to my work email/work phone, mind you they know I\u2019m living in South FL, not one person checked in on me. Rather, I got wrecked by some executives for not showing up to a scheduled zoom without notice and further chastised via email for not having something done. No consideration to my situation whatsoever, and I understand the need for letting management know about a lack of communication however this isn\u2019t the case. Employees there and anywhere matter of fact are completely disposable. \n\nI was offered a new position before the storm hit us, and decided to take it. Immediately, after communications we\u2019re back I was hit with text messages and emails from this new company asking if I needed anything at all, extra days off, money to evacuate, etc. That slightest bit of compassion reminded me that we aren\u2019t asking too much from our employers and anyone who is sticking around in a company culture they view as problematic is only doing a disservice to themselves.\n\nSo after all this, even though I had put my work notice in with my original company, I haven\u2019t worked a single day of my notice and frankly, I couldn\u2019t care less, I\u2019m still disgusted that I wasted 2 yrs working for a company that would enact business like that.

And even if you get to follow your \"calling\" and create without compromise every now and then, there will always be things you have to do to make money. Go on tour when you'd rather stay with family. Record with that asshole who pays well. Christmas shows. And that diminishes the joy of it all, and all of a sudden it's not your \"calling\" anymore, just a job, that also alienates you from many people you'd like to know.",

She buys what she needs (and doesn't get what she thinks is unnecessary), cooks for her 80y old friend and my family multiple times per week, she always makes sure she is warm and cozy, doesn't do crazy things. She lives her crossword puzzles, likes to watch TV, and when flea markets were a regular thing, she'd be a regular on the weekly one in our town.\n\nI can't imagine that she does much else, but she's keeping herself occupied. The things she does, they fill up her day pretty well, and most importantly, they seem to keep her happy. Oh, and she is crazy about mobile games ever since she has got her first internet connection about half a year ago. I guess it really is just the simple things in life that can make you happy.",

It was a warm spring day so we were all standing around outside our cars. This chubby guy was standing outside an orange Mini Cooper. I nodded and made the random nice car comment. He said its name was Oliver. Oh, like Hammond's car in Top Gear? His eyes lit up. Friendliest guy in the world, he came over and we started chatting. Found out we had nearly everything in common, and were best friends from that moment forward.\n\nIt's so rare to make any friends in your 30s with a family, much less a best bud. Our daughters were the same age and were immediate best friends too. Same with our wives. It was weird, we were all so much alike and got on so well. I helped them move, Joe helped me with some projects at home. We went to see Deadpool about a dozen times.\n\nLast summer Joe, in his early 40s, had been having some stomach issues for a few weeks, then passed out at work. They did tests. Found a sizeable tumor in his colon. Chemo. Surgery. Complications. Another surgery. Another. More chemo when the last surgery found that the cancer had \"spread significantly.\"\n\nJoe was brought home from the hospital a couple days ago to be put in hospice. My wife and I are going over to see him later this afternoon.\n\nTo say goodbye.\n\nI'm loading up a couple episodes of Top Gear on my tablet and am going to just sit with my buddy one more time.\n\nGuys... Get checked. Get your colonoscopies. If something doesn't feel right, go to the doctor immediately and get it checked.\n\n-----------\nEditing to add because it looks like a common question. I'm no doc but I saw a GI doc comment that the current recommendation is for all adults over 45 to get a colonoscopy, potentially earlier if you have family history. \n\nAnd thank you everyone for the kind words. Wife and I are about to head over to Joe's. Gotta hold it together for him. I can cry in the car afterward.\n\n------------\nEvening edit. Got to sit with my buddy for awhile. He mostly slept. Woke up a couple times and held my hand. It was good to see him and remember all the laughs. Made it home before I bawled my eyes out.",

            "colon cancer runs in my family, unfortunately. I got my first colonoscopy test at age 27. The doctors kept telling me that it was too soon and the insurance wouldn't even pay for the test. I ended up having about 15 polyps that they had to scrape and it costed me out the ass (literally).  \n\n\nAfter that, they told me to come every 5 years for a test, but the insurance still will not pay for the procedure even though I'm at risk.",

They end up having to take 6\u201d of my colon out in a follow up surgery.  Turns out it wasn\u2019t cancerous, but left untreated it would have been. The surgeon said that this surgery would amount to a speed bump in a few years and he was right. No ill effects, everything is normal. But had I not gotten the colonoscopy, it would have turned to cancer.  I now have to get them every 5 years.  \n\nGet your colonoscopy.  It literally saved my life.",

No symptoms.\n\nColonoscopy 6 weeks later (due to COVID chaos), tennis ball sized adenocarcinoma. Removed via sigmoid colon resection, marginal tissue and lymph nodes negative. Surgery got it all.\n\nMy one year follow up colonoscopy is Monday morning. Don't sleep on this, people.

I had no problems or symptoms of anything.\n\nMy insurance wouldn't cover one until 50. My doctor suggested a cologuard mail in test, which my insurance would cover. I did one, and failed it. So the colonoscopy was now covered.\n\nI went in with a gastroenterologist and had it done, and a 25mm high grade dysplasia was found. It was removed but not tattooed. GI doc said glad you came in when you did and see you in 6 months for another.\n\nUmm....nope. I took the reports and results to my one of my old bosses, a colo-rectal surgeon, and he repeated the scope the next week, tattooed the area of the pre-cancerous growth/polyp to keep track of it, and found 5 more polyps. \n\nIf I had waited until 50 that polyp would have infiltrated and maybe went metastatic.",

Hoping you find just the smallest bit of solace in saying goodbye today. \n\nI got my first colonoscopy at 34 after my 42 year old brother got colon cancer (successful surgery, 6 months of chemo, considered in remission). I was TERRIFIED of getting a colonoscopy. Honestly, the prep is NOT that bad as long as you follow the diet and eat light and don't eat grains, meat, and anything too fibrous the two days before. Get a peri bottle off of Amazon if you don't have a bidet, it will make the runs much less awful.

            "Since it could save someone's life, a few details:\n\nI had a colonoscopy due to some blood in the stool. It took me months to get in due to neither my doctor or I thinking it was too serious and probably just internal hemorrhoids, due to my age (early 40s). It turns out I was incredibly fortunate. I had several precancerous polyps, one of which was, in the surgeon's estimation, about a year from becoming malignant. \n\nI literally didn't even feel and don't remember the colonoscopy. No discomfort afterwards. **AND IT SAVED MY LIFE.**\n\nDon't screw around with any digestive issues. Colon cancer is often asymptomatic until it is too late and the symptoms present are often overlooked, as I almost did. The scope is painless.

            "Sorry for your friend, but insurance generally doesn't cover colonoscopies for people in their 40s unless there are symptoms. This was an unfortunate, tragic case of colon cancer in a younger person that went undetected.\n\nEven for older people who are eligible for a colonoscopy to be fully covered, insurance companies now use a loophole - if there is one or more polyps detected (polyps are considered a pre-cursor of cancer and are not uncommon) and the doctor snips them, insurance then does not cover a lot of the costs because it is considered treatment, not prevention. The patient has to sign off prior to the procedure, not knowing if they will wake up to a 4-figure bill for what was supposed to be covered by insurance. It is a reason some seniors put off having them.",

            "Had a friend who got colorectal cancer (this is an especially nasty cancer) in his late 30\u2019s. Same thing, gut troubles, didn\u2019t see a doc for months and months. When he finally went in, it was Stage 4, metastatic cancer that had spread to his liver. Six surgeries, two six-month rounds of chemo later and he is cancer free for the moment, but he very nearly died, will have GI problems / surgical related issues for the rest of his life, and it is very likely his cancer could come back (he currently can\u2019t eat any solid foods and is in and out of the hospital with bowel obstructions). \n\nEarly detection is the single biggest determinant for cancer outcomes.

            "I was just about in e same boat as your friend at 36. Constipation for weeks and stomach pains. Wanted tests but it takes time in Canada so I went private. They told me to go to the ER and get a colonoscopy because they see something. \n\nGot to the ER, was sent home to start the cleansing process and came back the next day for my colonoscopy. They found a cancerous polyp the size of a golf ball. Usually the type that is way past being ok. He had to cut it in a bunch of pieces just to extract it. Sent it to the labs to confirm it was cancer but it looked like a tree so the doc said that the important thing is that the stump needs to be clean and I\u2019ll be fine. Because he cut it up so much, they couldn\u2019t tell which part was the stump so we aren\u2019t sure if they got it out. \n\nThey put a clip in me so I could heal. Unfortunately it fell out 3 days later and I started hemorrhaging, filling up hospital pans with blood. It\u2019s a long story but I nearly died and had 4-5 bags of blood put into me to survive. \n\nOff work for 6 months and constant pain for 1.5 years after that. I still get random stomach pains now, say 2 full days a week, and my stools will never be normal looking but I\u2019m alive. \n\nIf I would have gone a few years earlier, it would have been an easy fix. \n\nOh and getting the tube up your ass isn\u2019t as bad as it seems. You are drugged and turned to see the screen so you can see what they see. Drugs make it seem like you were on the table for a minute. Some are even put to sleep.

You have painless comfortable liquid shits for a few hours.

            "Just do it, a friend of mine died of colon cancer at the age of 50 a few years back. I get them done as the doctor orders, it's really not that bad.",
            "I was lucky,  I have a family history of colon cancer.  [https://reinkefaceslife.com/2016/09/02/health-colon-cancer-get-your-colonoscopy-now/](https://reinkefaceslife.com/2016/09/02/health-colon-cancer-get-your-colonoscopy-now/) \n\nSo when I was 35, my GP \"ordered\" me to GI doc for my first of many colonoscopies.  My first report was that I was \"a polyp farm of precancerous growths\".  At 45, I was having them every two years.  S\n\nShortly after that, one year or two, I had a massive polyp enveloping the cecum.  That was so bad I had to have it surgically removed.  The GI doc at the time, who skeptical of all the colonoscopies I kept having, said that was a \"silent killer\".  Probably the kind that killed my maternal grandmother.\n\nRemember the tragedy that took Katie Couric's husband.\n\n[https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a35863226/katie-couric-husband-jay-monahan-colon-cancer/](https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a35863226/katie-couric-husband-jay-monahan-colon-cancer/)\n\nAfter the first few colonoscopies, I got over the disgusting prep and it became \"routine\".  Then I got frustrated with waiting for the anesthesia and getting a ride to and from the hospital.  (I always had to have them done in hospital because the docs were convinced that I'd need emergency surgery.)  So I began to skip the anesthesia to the amazement of everyone.  (At worst it was a little uncomfortable. And, it did allow me to \"help\" the doc by moving around on his direction to get the probe \"up the republic\".  Laugh!  I get to watch the \"expensive plumber\" at work and we crack jokes. \n\nI wouldn't call it \"fun\", but going almost directly from the operating room to the exit was a hoot.\n\nSo, my strong advice it \"get over it\" and get the procedure done.  It could save your life!",
            "Even if you are not middle aged or male, getting checked out for any unusual stomach symptoms is important. I\u2019m 21 going on to have my 3rd colonoscopy because they found something.

            "Cannot agree with this enough.  Late 2017 / early 2018 I was suffering from increasing abdominal pain & digestive issues.  I'm in my early 40s and wrote off the discomfort as any number of things - too much spicy food, too much caffeine, aging, slowing metabolism.\n\nI'm not sure when it started for me, or how long it lasted.  All I know is started \"small\", but got to the point where I was in so much pain I was losing sleep.  I was gainfully employed with decent insurance, but I'm the type to avoid doctors (and more importantly, medical costs) altogether if I can.  Finally I went in - numerous scans, and blood work, and tests.\n\nThey found a sizeable growth (6 to 8 inches) on my colon.  The initial diagnosis was colon cancer.  Colonoscopy was scheduled, as was an appointment with the oncologist (same doctor, if memory serves).  Those appointments didn't happen as planned - on a Friday morning I left work, excused of course, to go to the Emergency Room.  I hadn't slept a wink the night before, no exaggeration, and the pain was excruciating.\n\nMy parents, both retired, drove me to the hospital and stayed with me all day.  More scans were scheduled and meeting with countless doctors and nurses and hospital staff.  Needless to say, I wasn't going home.  Colonoscopy bumped up to the following day, but I didn't even get that far.  You see, that night I couldn't chug down whatever liquid they want you to drink to flush out your system.  The simple act of drinking fluid made my stomach feel like it was about to explode.  I hadn't eaten anything that day, and now I can't swallow this liquid that tastes similarly to how nail polisher smells.  It was late and they dosed me up a little so I could sleep through the pain.\n\nThe next morning I was woke early and told they were going to operate.  Emergency surgery by the oncologist and his team to excise what they believed to be a massive tumor.  I called my parents, who were in the process of getting ready to come down.  But they wouldn't arrive in time, as I was soon hauled off via gurney to the operating room.\n\nI woke, or was conscious, about 8 hours later.  I had IVs in each arm, a tube inserted in my nose leading to my stomach, pumping out the contents of my stomach.  And worst of all, a major incision from sternum to waistline.  They cut me open, pulled my intestines out and excised the growth, which also attached itself to my appendix (so that came out, too).  About 10 to 12 inches of intestine was removed.  Keep in mind, no colonoscopy was performed and the doctors had no chance to flush the contents of my digestive tract or stomach.\n\nNeedless to say, it was a helluva lot of work by the surgery team on that day.  I was scared and in tons of pain still and wearing a f\\*\\*king colostomy bag.  I told the doctor in the ER I'd k\\*ll myself if forced onto a bag.  But upon waking up, I was happy to have my life and knowing that no matter the cost, I was mostly out of danger.  \n\nThinking back on it, I was so foolish for trying to tough it out.  I'm crying a little even now, 3 years later, as I don't talk about it much and never to strangers.  As it turns out, it wasn't cancer but just a strange growth caused possibly by swallowing something like a chicken bone fragment.  That little sharp thing lodged into my intestinal wall and my body responded by growing more of that intestinal flesh, growing inward and outward from itself, constricting the flow of waste like a shrinking bottleneck.\n\nAll of that is to say, take care of yourself.  Especially if you have the insurance to do so.  The earlier you do, the better off you'll feel (physically and financially).  The smallest thing could snowball into something much bigger until it gets away from your, any doctor's, control.  The recommended age for your first colonoscopy, I believe, is around 50.  But given the kinds of stuff we put in our bodies these days, I would say maybe it should be 40.  Even my surgeon thought so.  And if you're experiencing discomfort and irregularity, don't delay - get it checked out.  Thanks for allowing me to tell my story.",

            "I echo everything you said. My GI doc is the best in the state, and he told me he\u2019s seeing a staggering uptick in colon cancer for young men. For reference, I\u2019m 30 years old and was noticing blood in my stool which alarmed me, in addition to stomach issues I\u2019ve been having. Found a GI doc and he recommended a colonoscopy. He ended up finding a 3mm polyp, removed it and was found to be benign. Everything else checked out. I am so relieved to know nothing is wrong with my colon besides having IBS to certain foods. \n\nIf you have ever noticed blood in your stool I highly recommend talking to a GI doc. Heck, even stomach issues may be a great opportunity to have the discussion. \n\nSorry to hear about your best friend OP. It\u2019s insane how life can change so fast.",
            "You shouldn\u2019t just arbitrarily get them though. Get with your doctor and make a plan. There are actually risks to colonoscopy and even seeding.",
            "Too bad my doctor has dismissed me because I\u2019m \u201ctoo young to get colon cancer.\u201d I\u2019m 36 and the studies are showing more and more people in their 30s and 40s are getting colon cancer. Doctors need to listen!",
            "I'm only 34 but a colonoscopy was suggested by my doc. I know it may be silly, but this post feels like another kick in my ass to just get it done. I'll set one up on Monday lol",
            "I\u2019m really hoping they lower the recommendation for colonoscopies to late 30s. I just had my first one last month due to gut irregularities and they found and removed a polyp that had potential to turn into cancer. My doctor during my follow up was thrilled that we gotten this done. If I had waited the typical 8-9 years for my first, the discovery could have gone a much differently.",

By Sunday he was back in the ER and within a week he was in surgery getting a mass removed and found out it was Colon Cancer. He just finished chemo in January and his numbers look good. It was a long, rough year.",

            "Thanks for this. As a medical provider, it can be so hard to convince some people to go in and get a colonoscopy done. We try to make it as easy as possible, but people just put it off. I get it: it\u2019s a procedure that\u2019s uncomfortable to think about, and not without it\u2019s own risks. But catching cancer early is literally the difference between life and painful, often humiliating, death.\n\nGet your colonoscopies, regularly, starting at age 45. If you have concerns, you can always request one earlier than that. \n\nKnow your family history. If there\u2019s any history of colon cancer in the family, it\u2019s recommended to get a colonoscopy 10 years prior to the age at which the person in your family was diagnosed (start screening at age 35 if you have a family member who was diagnosed at age 45, for example). Joe\u2019s kids should be screened starting in their early 30s. \n\ntl;dr: go back and read it. It\u2019s important.",

            "There are an increasing number of colon cancer cases in younger people, especially men. My husband was diagnosed at 39 with stage four. He had never been sick enough to go to the doctor and started having stomach issues out of the blue. After a month we went to the ER and they did tests but couldn\u2019t do a complete colonoscopy. Doctor told him to get checked again in six months without addressing the pain. If I hadn\u2019t pushed the issue for him to be checked by a different doctor and gone to the appointment to tell the doctor how unusual it was for my husband he would be dead now. By the time they found the mass and removed it the tumor was 12 cm and stage four. Somehow luckily he survived. \n\nMoral of the story: never wait to go to the doctor if something isn\u2019t right. And if they don\u2019t listen find another one. And most importantly always advocate for yourself.",

We can be one way in a good mood... another in a bad mood... one way around close friends... another way around employees we can barely tolerate... etc. \n\nAs I've gotten older, I try very hard to be the version of myself that's the best for a certain situation. Like I might tell really inappropriate joke around certain friends, but not around my mom. And that doesn't mean I'm fake, it just means I'm taking other people into consideration and trying to be a good version of myself for them.\n\nSo IMO don't take \"just be yourself\" to mean put no care or effort into charming people, like just \"keep it real\" and if you annoy everybody, at least you're not being \"fake.\" Be yourself, but try to be the best version of yourself for the situation.

It's demoralizing because it makes them think they're broken because either there's no \"yourself\" to be or what you think is yourself is considered fake.\n\nBetter to say, don't try to be something fake.  Start looking at who you are and develop it into a full sense of self.  Or be who you are, and find the best version of it.  Give some advice that's not just: you're flawed, stop being flawed.\n\nIt took me getting sober in my 30s to start discovering and developing my own personality.

            "I disagree about frozen. At least modern frozen veggies are probably more fresh than a lot of fresh raw vegetables. I'm not sure if that was the case when I was a kid though and I certainly suffered from way over boiled and/or canned vegetables. To this day canned peas are some kind of awfulness that I just can't bother with but I will snack on bowl of fresh raw peas like they are candy.\n\nI don't find that frozen veggies steam any worse than just fresh vegetables (although I haven't tried an exhaustive list) but you are absolutely right that you have to be careful to not overcook them, just like anything else.\n\nI regularly steam frozen broccoli in the microwave and it always turns out perfect because I specifically steam it enough to cook it but not so much that it loses all of it's crunch. Little bit of S&P, maybe butter and/or some melted cheese and they're great.\n\nBut although you can certainly steam veggies well, you're absolutely right that grill, roast, fry are the methods that were missing from my childhood that has affected my vegetable tastes to this day.",
            "This is largely because a lot of Western/American food culture treats vegetables as an afterthought, cooked separately from the \"main meal.\" If you cook your vegetables together with the rest of the meal, they'll be much tastier than if they were cooked separately. It's why vegetables in dishes from other culture (eg. Indian food) have so much flavor.",
            "Okay, I have a friend who for the life of us we couldn\u2019t figure out why her husband didn\u2019t like her cooking. Found out she cooks plain food. I\u2019m talking slapping a piece of chicken on a skillet. That\u2019s it. No oil, no salt, pepper, garlic or onion powder. Just plain \u2018ol dry ass burnt tasteless chicken. Haha, needless to say we intervened and started helping her cook. \n\nAlso, Hello Fresh boxes are another good way to learn to cook, for you plain skillet chicken people, and their food is bomb!",
            "This is 100% true for me. I thought I was a very picky eater as I only really ate carbs, meat and legumes as a youngster. When I began living alone I realised that this was actually because my parents were awful cooks. I now don't eat meat but have a whole world of new options available to me and I love food more than ever.",

            "Pro chef here. Roast extremely high for a short time. I\u2019m talking like 500 degrees. Works with almost anything, broccoli rabe, brussels sprouts, carrots, asparagus, etc. Toss in salt and pepper and roast for like 10 mins. The outside will be slightly charred and the inside will still be firm but tender. Then you can toss in a dressing, like hot honey or maple balsamic whatever. But the number one trick is a hot as f oven, and experiment from there.",
            "Salad when I grew up was shredded iceberg with corn and peas from the freezer.\n\nGuess who hated salad until he turned 30? I love salad now, always have it in the fridge and I still fucking forget to eat it most of the time.",
            "Jokes on you, I like frozen vegetables steamed with nothing on them. My parents told me broccoli were mini trees when I was a kid, so I always loved eating it.",
            "Back in the 60's my mum would boil veggies in water for 30 minutes. Then pour off the water, with all the flavour and colour (you could literally see it)\n\nAnd all the veggies tasted like mushy warm water. I hated them.\n\nDecades later I married a Chinese girl who cooked veggies with every meal and knew how to do it. Garlic, a little oil, other ingredients and spices....one of her green veggies actually became my favourite part of the meal. These days I \\*like\\* veggies.\n\nWhat I do: Steam veggies. Got a frypan? Drop your veggies into it, add a tabelspoon of water and then put the lid on. Put the heat at 3/10. In 30 minutes you will have beautiful steamed veggies.\n\nThen I add splash mint sauce over the veggies. Delicious.",
            "Nah. I just cant stand the taste of peas.",

            "I was traumatized by my parents treatment of the act of eating. Their cooking was mostly terrible and I suffered for it.

It\u2019s easy easier to just pay your provider for their international plan. For my plan it\u2019s just $10 per day and then your phone works exactly like it does at home. Same number, same messaging, same data, same voicemail, same everything. No need to tell people you have a different number. When you call people, they\u2019re not like, \u201cwho\u2019s this? I\u2019ll let it go to voicemail.\u201d\ufffc\n\nPlus, there are countless scams in other countries when it comes to that stuff. It\u2019s a hassle to swap SIM cards physically and you best not lose your original one on your trip. If it\u2019s the new digital SIM.... that\u2019s cool... but the last thing I want to do before, during, and after traveling is call my carrier. Then let everyone know I have an international number. Then hope nothing goes wrong and have to deal with that local carrier. \n\nNope. The \u201cbest option\u201d is to activate your international plan with the phone number you already have. It\u2019s faster. More reliable. Easier to manage. Never a language barrier. Plus.... if you\u2019re an American (or Canadian) you get to show off your fancy country code of 1.",

I exit using the emergency exit, if it does not trigger an alarm, which most places it does not.

Once, we got in a fight and I stood up for myself and he was so mad, he unfriended me on Facebook. This was a 20+ year friendship at that point.

Even his girlfriend (who was the original cause of our fight when he broke important plans with me last minute just to grab lunch with her) told him to apologize and make up with me.

Oh, could it be your best female friend whom you've betrayed and bad-mouthed and unfriended on Facebook? \n\nAnd he called me to apologize, and I comforted him, and he refriended me on Facebook (which Facebook announced to all our friends, embarrassing him further).

My philosphy is that we all need help sometimes, and you should always do everything you can for someone else because some day you may be in the exact same spot. That doesn't mean expecting favors in return. That means, maybe you let a recently homeless friend crash on your couch for a week. A few years go by, and suddenly you need a couch to crash.

Vents people are assholes trying to fuck others over. All he does is vent, and in reality the culprit of all of him problems is him. I've told him this before, he doesn't listen. Recently he quit yet another job, and called people to come over to tell him how crappy he is. I didn't bother to go because I am pretty much done with that shit. The guy can't even listen to ways to get out of the rut he is in. He just turns it around as it is everything and everything else fault. I told him once find something you are decent at and stick with it for more than a year. Can't even better himself because he thinks he is stupid and worthless. Even talked about how he thinks if he was homeless he would be better off. See now I am venting.",

They should be willing and make the time also to listen to you. If you or they cannot then you are not true friends. You have grown apart. And that happens in life sadly. But create some rules with your friends. We adults get busy and have our own families. When you need to hang up the phone/text/email/chatroom it should not need more than 5 seconds to do so. No bruised feelings. This is how adult long term life works. Maybe you need to set boundaries with your friend.",

I like helping people with their problems because I like being there for my friends, but I really don't like talking that much, especially talking about myself. I don't wanna talk about my life and how I'm doing. That's great if your life is going well, and I'm happy when my friends are happy, but it's overwhelming to have to hear about every little thing in a person's life, good or bad.

But I'd recommend applying the system below instead:\n\n1) Pick who splits at random (coin flip, RPS, any \"fair\" method will do)\n\n2) Have them divide the thing in half\n\n3) *After* they're done, pick who chooses first at random, again any method is fine\n\nWhile the stochasticity involved means someone *could* choose to intentionally make an unfair split and gamble they get lucky, their expected cut is always exactly 0.5 no matter what. Whereas in the non-stochastic-selection method, even if you choose who does which role at random, the expected cut might differ significantly from 0.5 if one person is noticeably more skilled at dividing things fairly than the other (and yet if you always make them do the dividing because of that fact, they'll end up with a negative expected return despite the extra effort!)",

Books , magazines, newspapers, bible.\nNever, never, never sign a document without reading it first. Never.\nRemember if they want you to sign it, that which it contains will be used by them at some time.\nLove yourself, mistakes are tough learning but the best learning.\nForgive everyone, especially yourself. Just get better. \nFind your true love. But be careful and follow item number one. Listen to your gut not your prcreating organ. I'm more happy in marriage now than yesterday.

That's not what matters, what matters is trying to be the best human being you can be, treating people with kindness and empathy.

Therefore, this change would effectively kills 3rd party apps.\n\nI protest this for the following reasons:\n\n1) The official app is terrible. Specially, I dislike the design and layout, bad quality of video player, general constant lagging.\n\n2) The purpose of this action is not to improve user experience, but to enrich reddit owners and monopolise the reddit experience. Forcing people to use only the official app will allow for full control over their feeds and, more importantly, allow unfettered shoving of ads down their throats. Thus, the website becomes less centered around its user base and more focused on bringing money to its owners, which in turn decreases quality of content. And I would not prefer that.\n\nCurrently, it seems to me that reddit does not attempt to control the content of user posts (with the exception of moderating for offensive speech). Introducing high API usage fees is another step forward towards policing the content in the interest of advertisers, which would massively bring down the quality of submitted content. We have seen it happen with youtube.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my disapproval of this change. I will remove myself from reddit if it goes through with it.\n\nSigned, long time \"RiF is fun\" user. \"\n\n\n*Sent from RiF*",

We talk on the phone every couple  of weeks and he told me how difficult it was being alone and the only faces he saw were strangers. So now i make it a habit to ask how he's holding up. His situation has improved and after i mentioned once that I'd been pretty lonely lately, he makes it a point to make sure I'm doing alright as well.\n\nIt may not seem like much but when you're completely alone, just knowing somebody cares enough to ask how you're feeling, and mean it, can make a world of difference.",

Bullies see this and they know who to target. Ultimately, you can be setting your kid up for a lifetime of failure because you never taught them that whining isn't winning. They need to have a little bit of tolerance. Start very small. Building their tolerance can be as simple as not switching activities the exact micro-second that they ask. Not giving them something they want as immediately as they ask for it, and not following their demands instantly. Like maybe you sing a song they don't like.

Had a couple one on one's with the new owners recently since I'm in transition to the next position higher than my current place. Bad feels from those two guys.\n\nPeople have been slowly peeling off. 5 people left in the first 8 months, 3 of them good people. 2 left this week. 2 more are about to leave next week, both good. I'm probably 2 weeks behind those last 2 guys. \n\nI'm glad I saw this post today. Thanks, OP.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the supportive and positive feedback, everyone. Keep yourselves informed. \n\nUpdate: 07-27-18  One of our senior field guys put in his notice yesterday.

            "In the past, I've been privy to a few sinking ships. The biggest flag is when upper management starts talking about how awesome the company is that other companies are poaching their employees; if the company is so good, those employees will likely stay. The second flag is when there's a shake up in upper management and someone good leaves; usually someone in marketing or in sales. You'll know when shit has hit the fan when the CEO either outright quits or they're fired and they bring in a finance guy to run the company; that means the company is being prepped for sale or their trying to cut costs any way they can and the culture is going to take a huge nose dive.\n\nEdit: wow I didn\u2019t expect this big of a response. One other flag that I forgot about that one of the stories reminded me of. If there\u2019s rumor that the company is going to be bought out, especially if it\u2019s a venture Capital firm or private equity, you\u2019re going to be let go and the company is about to tank. \n\nDouble edit: I am currently part of one now.

            "I found this out in my one year of teaching high school. I have a doctorate in English. I ended up working for a principal who didn't like people with genuine expertise in the field and only liked teachers who'd kiss his ass. I was expected to teach a micromanaged curriculum that made no sense, so I quit after a year and went back to college teaching. Several other teachers quit after a year. Students were left with teachers who knew little about their fields, but who would do as they were told, regardless of whether they were doing a good job teaching the subject or not.  \n\nThis is a broad problem in education today. We have far too many curriculum-design administrators who never set foot in a classroom and who are constantly trying to reinvent the wheel to keep themselves employed. We should instead have teachers with expertise in their fields and allow them to use their skills and creativity to teach. We'd get much better results. ",

My last friend there would tell me how much worse things had gotten and he himself left as soon as he found something better.

If those aspects don't exist in a work environment, I'd argue that it's a recipe for disaster...even if people are well-intentioned.\n\nAlso, a common saying is \"people leave managers, not companies\", but that's not the whole story.

Sometimes good people leave simply because another opportunity came up and there creates an opportunity for someone else to step in and fill those shoes - which may be you. Or sometimes those \"good\" people that leave may not be as good as you think they are - but you don't realize it until months or even years down the road.\n\nWhere I currently work, within the first year I was here, a lot of good people left - but a lot of bad people left as well. There became a void in leadership in some situations that allowed me to step up despite being relatively new and it turned a lot of heads and has earned me a good spot at the company I work for in terms of recognition, position, as well as getting to carve out a niche of self-actualizing work that I really enjoy doing day to day.\n\nOne of the most valuable things having worked in the same industry for 10 years now has taught me, is the difference between \"things going bad at a job\" and \"the culture of a company going toxic\". The first can be recovered from, even if good people leave - depending on the right people stepping in to fill their shoes.

More specifically, when one sleeps, the brain resets itself, removes toxic waste byproducts which may have accumulated throughout the day [2]. This new scientific evidence is important because it demonstrates that sleeping can clear \u201ccobwebs\u201d in the brain and help maintain its normal functioning. More importantly speaking, this paper illustrates the different principles of sleep; starting from the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to the behavioral as well as mental patterns with chronic sleep loss as well as the importance of sleeping acting as a garbage disposal in the body.\"\n\nEdit 2: Yes I agree.

I followed the 6 hour thing for very long till I realised, that wasn't true and I needed 7 hours. I used to wake up at 4.30 AM to push more hours of studies ( after 6 hour sleep) man let me tell you. I was extremely sleepy and tired in class. I stopped doing that later. Couldn't keep doing that.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, they never let me sleep over 8AM, even during summer holidays.\n\nAbout Boss and Coworkers....In 5 months I'll become a doctor. Healthcare, depending on your speciality and job is one sector where sleep and mental health is actually ignored. I see my interns/ house surgeons staying awake   36 hours. Sometimes the job requires it. Night duties are a part of the job. Even during our undergraduate it's considered very normal to lose sleep over studying for tests and exams. Most of them sleep hardly 3 -  5 hours before  University exams. It has kinda become the norm. And yes I've heard my own friends bragging about how less they slept the previous day. It's pathetic.\n\nIn our student life these kinda extreme situations happen before exams and our exams go over a month.\n\nWhen we don't have exams, I keep my sleep the highest priority more than my studies and try to eat well and exercise. I'll take the stress when I have to, just before the exams.\n\nDuring internship, half the interns I see are sleep deprived and stressed.\n\nBrings me to another point.

She worked 10 and 12 hour shifts, and for long stretches of time only got four or five hours of sleep a night.

The worst of it is that she knows something\u2019s wrong, but she can\u2019t track it or remember it or articulate it.

If they can't justify an \"order\", maybe they shouldn't be giving it. Obviously some kids might just whine, \"whyyyy\" as a complaint.

The way kids work is that up until a certain age, they need stability, and for their parents to take charge. At that point it is often better to literally gaslight them out of any ambiguity or inconsistency that may arise from your parenting.\n\nThen at around age 3 or 4, your kid will start to become more independent, and that's when you start to treat them a little bit like tiny adults, e.g. by apologizing when you are wrong. This does *not* mean you should pile on with \"mommy hasn't slept too well, and work was kinda hard on mommy\". Trying to invoke empathy for yourself won't go over well, as the kids will loose their perception of you as a stable protector (and an unquestionable autority figure). Treating your kids like friends, and sharing your problems with them is often considered a form of emotional abuse.\n\nWhen you say you were wrong, you were wrong. But when you decide something that they don't like, and you're right, you're still right. Kids don't need everything to be up to debate. They will literally stress out over the sudden lack of a clear \"leader\" in their everyday life.\n\nThen you reach early teenage years, and that's where \"because I say so\" might become too condescending a response.

Each person picks a random 6 digit login code from a bowl and goes to a random computer which is blocked off from view. You are only asked what department you work in, and nothing more specific. \n\nLove the way they handle the results too. 6 months later, the higher execs get together and go over the results. Then a meeting is held with the associates about the results as well. Each meeting has their own say, and will offer suggestions on how best to resolve issues. 1 month later an action plan is put into place and about 95% of the time, it is followed through. Marriott is the only company I have worked with that listens to their employees and actually follows through. \n\nThey even have a jury be peers system where if an employee is going to be terminated for selected offences, they can request a trial by their  peers. Different associates who work as different hotels will meet with the accused along with the terminating HR staff as hotel execs. They employee will state their case and if the jury decides in their favor, they are allowed back to work and don't even have anything marked in their employee file. Quite a great system actually.",

You open a hatch, pour in all your random Lego pieces, it counts and categorises each piece, then says, with these pieces you can build set #1358 and #94893 and #55421. You then select which set you want and it puts those pieces into a bag for you, and the other randoms in another bag.\n\n\n\n\nIt could also say that you're missing 6 pieces from completing set #767618 and print you out a slip which you take to the counter and they sell you the missing bits.\n\n\n\n\nIt's a win win for everyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_Edit:_ to give you an idea, here's a DIY solution:  https://youtu.be/04JkdHEX3Yk",

I'll lay him on his bed in the living room and we'll pull up the instructions on the TV (computer attached) and go through the steps. He'll call out the pieces, and we'll both hunt for them in a glass pie pan as I'm sitting next to him. It's a great way to keep doing what he loves and have some family time.",
            "To pile on to this:\n\n* Many people sell Lego by the pound on craigslist and ebay\n* The pictures can often tell you what partial sets are included in the boxes\n* In my experience, if you see a recognizable part of a set, it is likely to have most of the set included in the box. (Sellers are more likely to combine source material into a larger unit than subdivide the material and try to sell more, smaller units)\n* Pricing varies by the pound, but if you average 10c per piece on sets, and you see X number of sets, you can gauge the value of the sets in that box and know what you're going to get when you finally sort through the pieces\n* Download the PDFs (or view on a tablet) and after sorting all the junk and megablox out of the box, you can build the sets you can identify\n* With the remaining pieces, you can often identify stickers or specialized parts that point to other disassembled sets\n* You may not be able to complete all sets from the pieces in the boxes, but you end up with enough spare pieces from each box to supplement previous purchases\n\nHalf of my Lego collection came from this method. For $100-150 bucks, I can get $1000+ in Lego sets, and thousands of spare pieces. When my kids were young, this was our weekend activity.",

Blocking the door can really hamper my access to the patient, when you actually just want to help me.\n\nContext: For every job in my metropolitan ambulance service, I'm carrying at least a cardiac monitor weighing about 10kg, a drug kit in the other hand, and usually also a smaller bag containing other observation gear. For a lot of cases, I'll add more bags: an oxygen kit, a resuscitation kit, an airway bag, sometimes specialised lifting equipment. We carry a lot of stuff, and generally the more I carry, the more concerned I am about the person I'm about to assess.\n\nIt's a very natural reflex to welcome someone to your house by holding the door open. The actual effect is to stand in the door frame while I try to squeeze past you with hands full. Then, once I've moved past you, I don't know where to go.\n\n**Instead, it's much more helpful simply to open the door and let me keep it open myself, then simply lead the way.** I don't need free hands to hold the door for myself, and it clears my path to walk in more easily.\n\nThanks. I love the bystanders who help me every day at work, and I usually make it a habit to shake every individual's hand on a scene and thank them as a leave, when time allows.

            "Even worse, family want you to feel justified, even if they don't agree.\n\n\nMy uncle and his wife, many many years ago before they were married, my other aunts and uncles were married, and none of my cousins or I were born, got in a huge fight and broke up. My uncle vented about the event to EVERYONE. Naturally his family all took his side. ' yea what a bitch, I can't believe she would be like that! You're better off without her.' kind of stuff. The problem was they all loved her, but wanted him to feel justified in his breakup since it was VERY clear they were never going to get back together. 'None of us ever liked her in the first place.' \n\n\n\nWell lo and behold about 2 months later they got back together and got married. He fucking told her EVERYTHING everyone said. That changed the whole dynamic of her relationship with the family. She has since refused to go to family gatherings and to this day (even though, as I understand it, people have tried to explain to her the actual situation) believes that everyone in the family (even in-laws that weren't married, cousins that weren't born yet, those cousin's spouses who came decades after and might not be aware of the initial fuck up, and their children who are 6 at the oldest) all hate her.\n\n\nSo when you say anything to friends and family about relationships, take what they say with a huge fucking grain of salt. They don't see your whole relationship and might lie to you about their feelings in an attempt to make you feel better in the moment.",

My grandpa drove over, threw my dad in the shower with his clothes on, told him to get his shit together and apparently my dad drunkenly cried saying *nobody loves meee\ud83d\ude29*.

All the while, this is EXACTLY what he wanted me to do because then he could carry on. \n\nDont encourage people to isolate themselves from their family. If the relationship is not toxic, the friends and family have no business \"holding a grudge\" when you moan about your SO leaving a wet towel on the bed again.\n\nI might also add that the input from family and friends about the dynamics of a relationship can mean more than anything. If a person is in a toxic/abusive relationship, they tend to not know about it and therefore must rely on outside voices telling them \"that's not normal\"",

That's not at all to say that this is bad advice, just that it didn't work out for me. \n\nShe's been screwed over alot and has become a bit of a man-hater. She loved my husband, and they were friends too, but I was afraid that if I complained to her she wouldn't be able to seperate that and would hold a grudge. That wouldn't be fair to either of them, plus I just don't like sharing our dirty laundry. I don't pretend that our relationship is perfect, I'll definitely bitch in a general 'this man drives me crazy' kinda way, but never any actual problems. That's our business to work through. \n\nWe were going through some shit, and she knew it. She kept telling me I could talk to her, she was going to school to be a therapist. I kept telling her that I didn't want her to get mad at him for something stupid I said when I was angry, that wouldn't be fair to either of them, etc. I told her we could talk about general relationship issues, but not specific private issues in our marriage. I would talk to her about anything but that.\n\nThen I got sick and my husband had to go on a business trip, so he stocked me up before he left and was checking in often. She offered to leave work to bring me soup, and I told her I was good, don't lose money on me. I would let her know if I got low on supplies and she could get it another time.\n\nThen another friend brought me soup on her way home from work, and all hell broke loose.\n\nI chose other friend over bestie. I don't trust her because I wouldn't tell her all my problems. She couldn't trust me because I tell my husband everything. I made her feel like a bad friend. I thought she couldn't provide for her son. Everything just fell apart. \n\nI genuinely tried so hard to clear up all of the miscommunication that caused all of this, but I got back a lot of sarcasm, twisted words and insults so I just stopped. That was the first disagreement we'd had in 3 years of friendship. \n\nI miss her and her son so much, but thinking about her reminds me of the shitty things she said to me. If she could think that little of me that she could drop me for accepting a kindness from someone else, I guess it's better I knew sooner than later.",

            "I don't really comment often, but I feel very strongly against this. \n\nRelationships are hard. And by adolescence, through hollywood or novels or what have you, we are all conditioned to believe so much garbage about relationships already by the time adolescence strikes.\n\nAbout compromise and 'not giving up no matter what' and 'fight for it, it will be worth it in the end', and on the other side of the coin about soul mates and 'if it's meant to be it's meant to be'. \n\nToeing the line between compromises and not letting go on what's best for you as a individual is hard especially if you only have the perspective of someone who is in the relationship.  You are simply too close to the picture. \n\nThe terms 'honeymoon period', 'love-goggles' are all established terms because we tend to glamourize the hell out of our partners and we tend to make shitty choices at great personal cost to appease them.\n\nThis is not to say to trash talk your significant other at every turn. \n\nYou gotta have the self awareness to be able to do positive venting where you say your piece while also trying to fairly empathize with your partner's viewpoints, as well as to understand that who you are talking to won't know the dynamics and complexities in the relationship as well as the ones who in the relationship. \n\nYou gotta realize that the point of the venting you're doing is to get an outside perspective on how to handle what particular issue you are facing. Also keep in mind that the nature of outside perspectives is that they are outside. \n\nEspecially when you are younger, seeking advice will save you a helluva lot of heartache. Too many destructive relationships have gone on for far too long because of \"us against the world\",  \"this is between us, and no one else\" mindsets. \n\nEven in the context of abusive relationships, it's that much tougher for someone to reach out and talk to someone if they have never made a habit to seek advice in the first place. \n\nIf you are worried about your family and friends holding things against your partner because you vented, then one simple way to curb that is to follow up with them regarding how you and your partner manages to sort things out.",

I think many people don\u2019t appreciate/broadcast the good things unless they are like over the top. \n\nmy friend did x and y thing which triggered me and almost gave me a panic attack will make everyone hate them. You have to also tell those people about how for months that person helped you through a lot.

            "Also a good LPT to flip on its head. Whether someone vents constantly or it's just a one-off, remember when you go to reply two things.\n\nFirst, people rarely want solutions, they want empathy. Tell them they're right to feel how they feel, whether you think the situation is exactly as they describe or not, but try to resist the urge to tell them what to do unless they ask you what they should do.\n\nAnd second, remember that you are hearing them vent. They get to talk about the good stuff all the time, but unfortunately we live in a society where everyone has to pretend everything's perfect except with a chosen few. Just because they are getting something out of their system now, that doesn't mean it's all, always bad. This can be a good thing to gently remind people. Towards the end of the vent when they're running out of steam, find some way to imply, \"I assume you're in this situation because by and large you want to be, but just keep in mind that I'm always here when you want to vent but that means I generally hear the worst of it. If this is a serious problem, please let me know, otherwise I'm going to assume I'm just your release valve.\"",
            "Honestly I think that if you're having relationship issues and want to vent, friends are the worst because you're generally looking for someone to take your side not to give advice or be objective. Those friends are also very likely to frame the situation based on what they know of you and not reality which as the LPT implies often leads to animosity or a bad opinion of your SO even if you're dead wrong.",

If you cannot not talk to your partner, even slightly after something bad has happened between you, then that relationship isn't working. You should be talking between you both and saying how you feel and coming up with a fix that keeps you both happy.  \n\n\nIf you cannot talk it out with your partner because:\n\n* You feel afraid of them\n* They ignore how you feel and shut you down\n* Manipulate you into only seeing things their way\n\nThen that is something you should be seeking advice and help from.\n\nPartner's will have verbal disagreements. No relationship is perfect. You will not always see eye to eye immediately or all the time.

So it's really way to want to talk about that. \n\nBut there were really good times as well, and up until the last year, maybe the last year and a half, I truly felt loved.

I had a job to install a speaker in a kitchen so that the kitchen staff could hear incoming orders as they were being placed. The location supervisor wanted it loud, so that everyone in the kitchen could hear. Within 3 minutes a customer placed her order, then proceeded to tell her passenger about the blowjob she gave her boyfriend last night.

I was a Production Assistant which does anything asked from getting the crew coffee to filling in on lower crew jobs. So one day I was helping the sound dept. That day I was the one holding the boom mic (microphone on big selfie like stick). I had headphones attached to the mic so I can make sure it\u2019s pointing the right way. The sound mixer also had headphones and was the one with the recording unit and adjusting levels and such. \n\nSo when the director yells cut that means you stop recording. But the mic was powered through the cable and was basically always on for the listening. Not sure if the mixer should have turned down my headphone volume or not but he didn\u2019t. So between takes I can still hear the mic. I\u2019d hear the directors and producers talking while they sort of huddle and talk softly to each other. Sometimes they\u2019d argue or bitch about someone/something. They never mentioned anything about me but I could hear them bitch about some actors or other higher level crew people.

Huge bummer, and me and Dave laid into him after she drove off. \n\nAnyway, she pulls up to the window, and he decides, \"yo, yinyin123, come make the sandwich\" and I am all too quick to oblige. As we switch, I tell him \"GIVE HER YOUR NUMBER.\"\n\nAnd guess what? He didn't. So upset. Both dave and I. Hes been super mopey about his breakup that happened about 3 months prior, and were a little tired of it. We're not mad, just sad that he wasnt confident enough.\n\nThen, the only time I beleive god existed happened.

Right away, I realize what this is. There's no way that she would forget and then immediately remember that her g-ma wanted something too, she's trying to give Dyl a second chance! What a girl! \n\nI frantically wave dyl over, and he's super confused, but I explain the situation, and he lights the fuck up. I tell him \"YOU ARE GIVING HER YOUR NUMBER. THAT IS THAT.\" and give him a pen and a price of receipt paper. He wants to be sure, and he asks her if he can give her his number, and she's like \"yeah!\" It was so fuckin cute. She lit up herself and that proved to me that I was right. \n\nExchange happened, she left, and he was fired up. We got out early that night, Dave and I were so fuckin proud and he was so Damn happy.\n\nFunniest part of the whole thing was that it didn't really end up in anything. But, it gave him the confidence to spread a little bito more after ths breakup, and now he does have a girlfriend. It's the best story I can tell that I've been a part of to date.",

I will forever love you if you can send the full zip sweaters so I can grab it and dress your mom or dad in 20 seconds or less. \n\nI love my job. Get ya sweaters right.\n\nEDIT: YAY my post blew up! Let me add a few things, since a lot of my fellow healthcare workers have chimed in. \n\n1. CD Players: YES PLEASE. Plus your loved one's favorite CDs. \n2. So many photos. All of them. You can't go overboard. I will sit there and go through every photo with them every day, if you want me to. I really don't mind. \n3. Clothes, one size larger. Please label them. I will do it myself if you can't but don't be upset when/if you see Mom wearing roommate's clothes. Maybe you didn\u2019t send enough, maybe the washer is broken. Maybe you didn\u2019t label correctly. Kindly point it out and someone will explain or rectify the problem. \n4. Food gifts are almost always allowed, just be sure to check with nursing staff first. If your loved one is on a low-sodium diet and you keep bringing them McDonald's, that's a yikes. Also be careful about sharing with other residents. Your loved one's roommate might be on a special diet and you keep giving them french fries and we can't figure out why they're not feeling good. \n\nAdditional points:\nOH MY GOD YOU ARE NOT A BAD PERSON FOR PUTTING YOUR LOVED ONE IN A COMMUNITY. CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA IS A FULL TIME JOB, LITERALLY I HAVE TWO DEGREES TO HELP ME DO IT. IF YOU ARE 90 YEARS OLD AND YOUR SPOUSE HAS AN AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DEMENTIA AND THEY HIT YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO? Keep your judgement out of my inbox. I have now worked in a geriatric psychiatric ward too- and these 90 year old women who have literally been assaulted by their once-loving husbands at 2am have to hear your fucking bullshit about how they can\u2019t care for their spouse and what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ use your brain. Maybe your grandma insists that she needs to get to the bus stop at 4pm, right when you\u2019re getting home from work every day- do you want to quit your job because she can\u2019t stop wandering into the street? Can you afford a loving, caring facility that provides a lock on the door and 3 square meals every day with 24/7 nursing care? THEN BY ALL MEANS, GO TAKE A FUCKING TOUR OF IT AND SEE IF IT\u2019S A GOOD FIT! THERE IS NO ONE-SIZE ALL FIT FOR DEMENTIA CARE. This is a full-family journey and the focus has to be on the DIGNITY, SAFETY, AND EDUCATION of all involved.  \n\nI. Love. My. Job. Mind. Your Business.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm enjoying the hell out of everyone's energy on this post. Keep your questions and DM's coming, it's 1am EST but I'll be up for a bit longer if I can help support you either emotionally or with advice if this journey is relevant to you.\n\nEDIT 3: Big shoutout to the guy who wants to know if I have two degrees in \"wiping ass\" because this job takes \"no brains\". Foolish question, everyone knows that WIPASS-201 is only an undergrad course.\n\nIn all seriousness- both of my degrees are psychology based but geriatric specific. I am NOT clinical- I am the program director. Basically the cruise ship captain.\n\nEDIT 4: I keep getting this question of what the hell a program director is, so I'll post my response here too:\n\nAs the program director, I am in charge of scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating the activities. I either lead the activity or I delegate it to an aide who works in the afternoon. I interact with and update the families as necessary or on a schedule. I come up with creative solutions to behavioral problems and advise/inform staff and management on layouts of how to address concerns resulting from cognitive impairment. I work closely with the nursing staff to coordinate the best care with behavioral interventions paired with the pharmacological interventions. It's a huge team effort. Takes a village.",

            "I'm not in a nursing home yet, but I didn't realize this was even an issue until I moved to New England from Miami. After a couple of years I suddenly understood that the only sweater that exists for me is full zip. Nothing else is a sweater, just a fucking thick shirt that's a pain in the ass to put on and remove 10 times a day.\n\nFull zipper FTW!",

You are amazing and you aren\u2019t given the credit or the paycheck that you deserve.\n\nMy grandmother is mid-eighties moderate/severe Alzheimer\u2019s.

            "My wife worked in assisted living homes for years. One wonderful nurse would take new generic XXL sweatshirts (black or dark colors) . Cut the front down the center. Sew on wide floral or angular pattern fabric as seams and sew in Velcro patches instead of buttons. Then give them to residents. Everyone loved them.",
            "Also! Please, please, please, provide several days worth of pajamas and clothing. If we CNAs are lucky, we can get dirty clothing out to laundry every night and your loved one will be wearing new, clean clothes every day. We put everything in the wash after it's been worn, unless resident says no and even then we give them another day, and it sucks to find out they have no clothing. \n\nAccessories are always big too! My ladies love dressing up in costume jewelry. Necklaces and bracelets as rings get to be too tight sometimes. And if you get socks, get some nice slipper socks. That way they don't have to wear the hospital ones. And easy shoes. Slip on or Velcro. Life savers. And slippers with some tread.",
            "To add on to that \"Additional Points\" with a little personal example to make a point....\n\nI work memory care, dementia and what have you. One of the men I worked with was, apperently, incredibly sweet before he declined. Wonderful man, father, husband. He lived at home with his (very sick) wife for a long time. However, she was wheelchair bound. And he was declining hard and fast.\n\nShe never talked about what life was at home with floor staff, but while he was living with us he:\n\nOvertook 3 staff members by throwing one through a door, one through a wall, and pinning the other to a different wall by her neck.\n\nBroke fingers by squeezing them, and continued even though the staff member would be screaming in pain.\n\nThrew his recliner at staff.\n\nCornered me in a bathroom because he didnt want to change his pants or underwear. Late stages of some memory related diseases include incontinence and inability to recognize that you need to change your clothes.\n\nI can not imagine what life was like for his wife before he got to us. He was the tallest man ive ever met, 350lbs I'd guess, and nearly non verbal due to his disease. Imagine putting your hand on someone's knee to try to connect with them and they take your hand only to squeeze it so hard your fingers break, all while they stare into your eyes with a blank face and say nothing.\n\nHe was a severe case. I've had a lions share of people like this because of where I worked but this isnt average. But imagine living with someone like this and getting shamed by family and friends for putting him in a facility where he's safe so you can live safely in your home. I can't imagine.",

            "One more. If you bring your family member to a facility if it's allowed to get them a radio that plays CDs of their favorite artists, or even an iPod. The caregivers can turn it on for them so they aren't sitting in their rooms in silence. I take care of quite a few folks who don't enjoy television but like music and their family members won't bring them a little 20 dollar stereo for them to listen to! I wish our facility had some to spare. It's so sad that they prefer to be in their rooms with just their own minds.",
            "Also, if you can pack up whatever your loved one needs to take care of their nails in a small pouch, this is very helpful. Make sure they everything for their teeth and hair.\n\nIf you are around and can wash your loved ones clothes, it keeps them from getting lost in the laundry room. It happens. Other patients go in there and take clothes out of the lost and found on occasion. This is why she mentions to label the clothes. \n\nI would even venture to label and number the items. If your loved one becomes convinced they have lost something, it can be a chore. If you have numbers on safety pins so you can put them on the clothes currently there, you can keep track of everything. This keeps you out of the laundry room searching for a specific item if they are doing the laundry. If you are taking care of the wash, you don\u2019t have to worry about this.\n\nAnother thing is to provide small gifts to your loved one\u2019s caretakers. These are wonderful people. You are not allowed to tip them. However, you can give them a nice but small token for helping you. \n\nMy mother was a thimble collector, and would give pretty thimbles to her caregivers.",

That also increased both their qualities of life - my physically limited grandpa didn\u2019t have to try and keep an eye on her constantly and she had people to help keep her regulated and on a schedule; he could be the loving husband he had always been but have the freedom to eat lunch in the main area, go to church, go out to eat with us, because of the wonderful people taking care of her.

Leave grandpas priceless leather jacket from the army at home), large print books, baby wipes, nail polish, beer or wine (the kind with no alcohol is usually allowed and fools people with dementia pretty well, and really makes them feel more normal), spare glasses/reading glasses, hearing aid batteries, cough drops, tea bags (esp herbal), powdered coffee/lattes, night gowns (its hard to pull pants up on bed bound people), knitting/crafting supplies, nice pencil crayons and coloring books (surprisingly popular with my seniors).. etc\n\nAs far as what you can do to quickly make a difference is: bring in coffee (our coffee sucks, people appreciate a double double from Tim's SO much), trim/file fingernails (paint as well when appropriate), dye and blow dry ladies hair (it sucks when you can tell how long they've been there by their roots), bring in birthday cake to share on their birthday, bring in a current newspaper or magazine (I swear I saw one at work the other day from 2016), wash their dentures (an unfortunately very often overlooked part of care, they get horrific), bring pics of their pets (or bring the pet if allowed!), bring cans of diet pop.",

He\u2019s also really hard of hearing, so I went along with him as a \u201ctranslator\u201d of sorts.\n\nAt the beginning of the appointment, my dad took out his list of issues he needed help with. The Apple rep we talked with saw that it was long and suggested we go down it one issue at a time to make sure we resolved each issue before moving on to the next one. This rep made sure to take so much time and care with each issue on my dad\u2019s list, many of which were just my dad not understanding how technology works and I could\u2019ve fixed for him in a jiffy if I\u2019d realized. But the rep said not to worry, he was there to help! He not only helped my dad fix all the issues, but explained things slowly, carefully, and, in many cases, MANY times until my dad understood things for himself.\n\nA few issues into the list, we noticed that the store - really crowded when we first got there - was nearly empty. Then I realized that the store across the hall had its gate down. Then we remembered it was Sunday and the mall closed early. We turned to the rep and said, \u201cOh my gosh, are you guys supposed to be closed?? We\u2019re so sorry, we can make another appointment another time for the rest of the list!\u201d But the rep just told us not to worry and that he would help us with every single item we had on that list, and that we didn\u2019t have to make another appointment.\n\nThat rep worked with us for over an hour past when they were supposed to be closed. Once we finished, my dad said, \u201cOne last thing - I\u2019d like to talk to your manager please.\u201d The rep went and got his manager, and my dad and I sang that rep\u2019s praises. We wanted to make VERY sure that the manager knew how incredible the rep was with us and how much it meant that he was so kind, patient, and dedicated to helping all my dad\u2019s issues, no matter how small. After we got home I also went on that specific store\u2019s Facebook page and left a glowing review.\n\nI don\u2019t know if our praise did anything for the rep, but I hope it made a difference.

She persisted, angrily, and even then the FA was so nice and polite. Karen was non-stop complaining and insulting, demanding the FA\u2019s full name and other crap.

            "No, don't. Fill out the shitty surveys at the bottom of receipts. The manager knows that individual is doing a great job, you need to send it to corporate so that individual can build a reputation outside their store. Managers know individuals do a great job, they don't need you reinforcing that. HR and people involved in succession planning need more than a managers word for it however and consistent customer voices make a world of difference when a manager is trying to 'sell' an individual for promotion, and in some cases deny a promotion.",

At worst they see it as a good reflection of themselves. I still get shafted one day down the line.\n\nIf you can tip, or if you come back and remember me, you'll allow me to treat myself to the movies or a new video game, and/or make my day.\n\nIn my current job my managers can see how well I work on paper : I've quintupled sales on one of my sections. That's right. Sales went x5 after two years of me curating it... Still hates me, backstabed me and now banished me to a smaller shop elsewhere, far from my friends and requiring 4 buses of travel a day (lolol right until furlough got extended...)\n\nSo yeah...

            "Hi, as a current retail employee who's been wanting to write this topic FOREVER (but whose always burnt out from the demands of my job and the other areas of my life), I would like to expand on OP's post by sharing the following, just in time for the hectic holiday season:\n\n1. It genuinely makes my day better knowing that anything I did made a difference in a customer's experience. I want to make sure your precious glass gift is wrapped (nicely) as well as securely, I want to help guide you to that specific drink-making related thingy you need but don't know the name of even if I myself don't have experience with drink-making items that we'll go searching for together because you really need it for reasons. We'll be the best of friends, if for a couple of minutes, as long as you're patient and understand we're doing our best to help you on our mutual mission of the moment!\n2. Please please please remember to get the name of someone who had been particularly pleasant or helpful, don't just trust the manager to appropriately pay attention- This has happened to me where I was overlooked for my efforts. Be sure to write down the employee's name for later, as oftentimes the receipt you'll get after checkout will usually have a feedback survey. Fill it out so you can provide your feedback on the store's performance, which we objectively benefit from hearing, but be sure to add the name \\*and if applicable, the experiance\\* with the helpful employee!\n3. Those of us in retail or fast food/other service sector jobs aren't allowed to accept tips. Its incredibly sweet of you, but we can't! So please accept the alternative avenue of pointing out our helpfulness. Also, just saying, I once got a flower from a customer who collected blue flowers off the side of a highway she walked on the way over. I wore in my hair for the rest of my shift as a cashier, very happily, so make whatever you want with this information.\n4. No, we don't have more in back. I'm just saying this now for everyone's convenience. I think this is true for every retail environment nowadays, where stores aren't hoarding its bounty in different colors and sizes in the back stockroom anymore. We try to put everything out on the floor so it can be bought, because it would quickly go out of season and have to be marked for later clearance otherwise. If something you want isn't currently there, it is easier to check back in by the next week. The customer service associate will NOT know when the next shipment of super cute holiday edition Italian hand blown glass salt and pepper shakers will be, its all random as heck.\n5. Please be respectful of the items in the store. Don't separate or remove things from their hangers and mix and match items in two-piece clothing sets, or boxed sets until you've already come up to the checkout counter to ask for the manager's permission. I had to witness a woman crying in the week prior to Christmas because she and I both tried very hard to find the missing matching piece to a PJ set she wanted badly. I felt awful for her and awful for telling her that we weren't able to sell it to her in the condition it was in (yes, I had my manager with me while this happened) before she started to cry because she had spent hours shopping :( PLEASE do not be that person who just flings items and causes grief to other shoppers. The store associates try their hardest to keep the store and merchandise neat and organized and tidy while dealing with assisting customers through searching for items, putting out loads and loads of new merch, cashiering, etc. We do our best but we're all human and have a limit to the amount of damage control we can do, and your actions will affect someone else's shopping experience.\n6. Sit down on the toilet seat. Wipe it when you're done for the next person. Flush before you leave. I HAVE to say this. I SHOULDN'T have to say this, but I HAVE to. IF you're squeamish about sitting down, lay down some tp or the tissue cover thats provided. And for the love of God WASH YOUR HANDS. If you even ENTER a toilet stall, wash your hands- You don't know if someone with Covid touched it!\n7. I have to ask about the credit card. I'm sorry. I don't like it either, but I'm mandated to do it. Please let me finish my sentence though because its genuinely hurtful being cut midsen-\n8. Respect the fact that some if not many stores are utilizing lines in order to control the flow and number of patrons inside. This means being patient and waiting in line for your turn. If you're at a mall-type environment, there is no \"I'm just passing through\" exception- Since its a mall, there is an alternative exit/entrance you can use for whatever side you're on. I will try my best to inform you of this information. But I'm no mindreader If you ignore whoever is in charge of keeping a headcount of how many people are currently inside, then regardless of your intention, you have just entered the store and cut ahead in front of the line of 9 people who were patiently waiting, you're violating something thats in place for everyone's safety and fairness. Please respect these very, very, very basic rules. And if you're a shopper who's already inside, yay, good for you! We enjoy your company and prescence. Please be mindful of other shoppers though, don't camp for the entire day in the store as others would like to enter and shop. I understand you need your time to select your gifts and stuff, but we have a sensitive environment!\n9. Your mask goes over your nose and under your chin. If you're not wearing it this way, I'm going to approach you and inform you of the proper mask-wearing method. And no, you can't drink your drink while you're in the store with your mask down. If you EFFECTIVELY want to be safe and make sure you're not inadvertantly transmitting anything, don't touch your mask, don't pull it down, don't touch your face, and sanitize the back and front of your hands at the beginning and end of the shopping trip.  \n10. Please mask your children.",

But i was laughing my ass off the whole time the music was playing, just knowing that they have to be on the floor in laughter as well. \n\nI come back on the line and act normal for a second, almost like I didn't even know anything special had just happened.\n\nMe: alright thank you guys for holding for me. First things first, guys...Are you pretty in awe of your psychic abilities right now?

My wife couldn't believe it! That was incredible... We were just hooting and hollering after that. You got us good. Good one\"\n\nIt went so well that time that it kinda became a thing of mine that I did whenever a customer complained about the lack of music or wait time (unless they were actually annoying, then fuck em make em wait in silence or take my headset off).\n\nProbably only did it 3 or 4 times while I worked at that call center but it was always a BIG HIT with the customer and always lightened the mood of any convo once I came back on the line and they could hear me grinning ear to ear already.\n\nIt was a nice change of pace for what was otherwise a stressful sales job",

I put her on hold to find the hat. Before I took her off hold I heard her say \"they're so incompetent.\" Lady, I'm trying to help you. Took her off hold and said \"We have your hat, I'll put it on reserve. You must think we're so incompetent.\" then I laughed. She went dead quiet.

It got to one of the scenes were Dany is nude, and my girlfriend says \"hey her boobs look like mine\" at which point we had a discussion about  boobs and nipples.

If you're put on hold with music, they're usually unable to hear you.\n\nWhen I was training for the call center our trainer had a story. She got a call from someone who purchased the travel insurance. Travel insurance is usually coverage for things like death in the family, and not just \"I want a refund because I decided not to go.\" Her caller called in and said that her grandmother had died. The trainer put her on a silent hold to get the information she needed to help and as soon as she put the girl on hold the customer said to her SO \"They're totally buying it.\" The trainer then comes back to the call and says, \"To get your refund we'll need a photocopy of the death certificate faxed to us.\" This always makes the customer very angry.",

And we weren't done until every pot, pan, mixing bowl, and utensil was cleaned while things finished cooking! The WORST!!\n\nAnd... now she's gone. My Beloved Mawmaw. As I was cooking with my 15 yr old the other night, I realized I was absolutely parroting the same commentary to my daughter as I helped her cook Sunday dinner that her boyfriend was joining us for. (Chicken cacciatore, buttered herbed noodles, salad with a homemade raspberry vinaigrette, and chocolate pie with homemade crust and whipped cream, YUM).  \n\nI had such a flashback, lol, and got a little misty, realizing that all my Mawmaw's lessons really stuck: it *is* so much easier to measure out ingredients beforehand when you're baking, like they do on cooking shows, especially when you're learning so you aren't rushed trying to measure stuff while you're on a tight time line (let's be honest, ain't nobody got time to measure ingredients while the custard is cooking unless you're much older and already done it a million times). Always read through a recipe and set out your ingredients to make sure you have everything you need, and that you are prepared for each step. And for Pete's sake, *CLEAN* as you go, it just makes the whole process so much smoother and simpler! Clean, clean, CLEAN!!!\n\nI'm pretty sure my kiddo was rolling her eyes at me and my old fashioned ways a little bit, and I'm sure she'll figure out that the old ways are sometimes the best ways, just like my Mawmaw tried to teach me \u2764  And honestly?

            "This is something that people always ask me about when I'm working in my shop. \n\nI put tools away every time I'm finished with them, even in the middle of a job. I don't wait until the end of the project. I might get the same tool out 10 times, use it, then put it away. Even big tools like welders and planers.\n\nPeople ask me about it, because they see me get a specific tool out, use it, wrap it up and put it away, only to see me get it out again ten minutes later when I need it again. They ask, wouldn't it be easier to just leave it out and put everything away when the job is done?\n\nNo. No, it wouldn't. \n\nFirst, when you need it, you know *exactly* where it is. Even mid-job, a certain bit, blade, or wrench gets buried under the rest of the stuff, materials, etc, and you search for it. The time you put into putting it away every time you use it, is more than made up by never, ever spending time looking for the goddamned thing under a pile of other tools.\n\nSecond, it clutters up your workspace. Over a 6 hour job, you'll get out 50 different tools. If you wait until the end, the clutter around your work area gets overwhelming and costs time and patience. \n\nThird, stuff gets broken. This isn't as big a deal with mechanics tools, but my woodworking tools can be delicate and precise. If you bend an engineering square just a fraction of an inch, it's useless. A fine finish blade or bit can cost $50, and is entirely too easy to screw up with one errant tool in the way.",

            "I was reprimanded at a meeting for having a general poor office etiquette. I immediately felt offended and slighted for having been reported for this, and chalked it up to other people being too sensitive. \n\nBut I decided to read a lot of suggestions online, and in self-evaluating my behaviour I realized I wasn\u2019t being professional in many ways, mainly because I saw my coworkers and superiors as friends, not colleagues. That, I have found, can be dangerous in a work environment if you have a quirky personality, like to joke a lot, and don\u2019t take everything so serious.\n\nBelow are my own points of improvement that has helped me improve my office interactions immensely, and has led to great results at employee evaluation meetings.\n\n**Communication**\n\n* Always be pleasant and polite.\n* Do not swear. Ever.\n* Do not interrupt people when they are talking.\n* Do not try to finish other people\u2019s sentences. Let them finish themselves.\n* Keep jokes to an absolute minimum.\n* Especially never joke directed at a specific person.\n* You are always needlessly entering into a minefield.\n* Sense of humour is not required for your job, and will not advance your position.\n* Never write jokes in emails or office IM clients. Not only do you have nothing to gain, your wasted efforts will be recorded indefinitely.\n* Never raise your voice. Keep a calm collected demeanor, even when stressed. \n* If there are disagreements that are work related, think about the fact that you are paid for your time - not your commitment to make the best product. This company does not care about you as a person. You are there for money. Take deep breaths, and realize you are just there to sell your time. Anger and frustration will not increase your hourly wage.\n* Never touch anyone except for handshakes.\n* Refrain from discussing politics, religion, and other topics that can easily cause divides and upset other people, and yourself.\n* Never make any comments that could be viewed as racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. What you might have meant will always come second to what others interpret.\n* Do not gossip about other employees. You never know who overhears, what lies you might be spreading, and you have nothing to gain.\n* Do not overshare about your own personal life. This makes for awkward interactions, that can often alienate you from coworkers, especially if they disagree with your way of life.\n* Meetings are for serious talks, not for joking around, especially with superiors present.\n* Do not ask pointless questions. Do not talk if you have nothing to add to the conversation. Think about how much you hate when others talk just to hear their own voice and drag out meetings. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n* Both sit and act appropriately in meetings. Slouching sends a bad signal. Eating food, chewing gum, etc. is all distracting for others.\n* Keep at least a seemingly interested focus. Do not check your phone. Wear a watch to check the time, otherwise you look like you are checking your private text messages.\n\n**Behaviour**\n\n* Be serious around superiors. Can not be stressed enough. They may often only see you briefly a few times a week. Many small interactions can lead to a huge incorrect impression of you.\n* Do not openly show timewasting. You might be taking your first 10 minute break of the day reading reddit, but to a superior walking by it looks like you have been on reddit since 9am.\n* Do not give orders to your colleagues if you are not their superior. Always ask politely.\n* Do not in any way take credit for other people's work.\n* Give people credit for the work they do, especially with third parties present.\n* Do not let anyone assume you did work others did. It can come back to bite you.\n* Do not question decision-making in other people's areas of expertise. \n* At most politely give your opinion, but immediately defer if challenged.\n* Especially around superiors.\n* Admit to mistakes made. No excuses.\n* Accept suggestions to your work that improves it. No excuses.\n* If you need to interrupt people who are working, ask politely if they have time for a question or if you can drop by later. Do not assume other people have time for you at your convenience.\n* When sending emails, the TO field is for people you want to respond to you. The CC field is for people who you do not expect a response from. Do not CC people unless it is necessary.\n* Don\u2019t complain about your workload to people who can do nothing about it.\n* Stop complaining about little things that make no difference anyway. Negativity spreads.",

Being nice and competent is fine, but many are nice instead of competent just to stay under the radar as far as actual contributions go.

Because you don't lose much production value by promoting a nice but incompetent employee from a producer role to a management role like you do if you promote a producing superstar to a management role. Good producing employees are deemed too valuable to promote all too often, and it causes a huge level of dissatisfaction because it quite often turns out that the competent are led by the far lesser qualified individuals.

As much as we want children, I can not do it without my wife in my life. Losing her, I know, would kill me inside. I would maybe have a child, but I know I would spiral out of control if that's how she goes. On top of seeing that child and being reminded every single second of my wife. I just couldn't do it.\n\nSo, instead we will adopt. It's a long process but there are plenty of children who need love, and boy howdy do we have an overwhelming amount to give.\n\nBut in the meantime, any time anyone asks me about kids it's everything I can do to hold back the tears. And I'm sure it's even harder for my wife.\n\nAnd then on top of all of that, every year about October I suddenly get depressed and then realize that it's brought on because about that time is when that child would have been born... This is the year my child would have been 7.\n\nFuck, this is tough to put out there... But I'm glad I did.\n\nEdit/update...\n\nThank you everyone for your kindness and encouragement.

We were about 2 blocks away from it, exiting a mall. We heard a blast, and before we knew what was happening we got pushed back, air out of our lungs, glass shattering all around us. Was more of a surprise than anything else, luckily - no injuries - but still... no time to react at all.",

Your nose is also connected to your pharynx-->eustachian tube-->middle ear, so opening the mouth, for a normal individual, should make no difference. \nAs I'm writing this I'm realizing probably the position of the mandible probably opens the eustachian tube, making it easier to ease out the pressure from the shockwave.\nFuck my anatomy teacher.",

            "I used to be a trainer for this specific practice. What he says is mostly proper practice but I have a few things I want to add. \n\nFurther things you should do. \n\n1. If you are inside and see a blast wave coming, the safest spot in a room is the wall closest to the blast. If you are next to a wall furthest from the blast, you may get hit by an updraft and launched into the air, you may also be potentially carried out a window. The proper positing is laying face down with you side against the wall. This only applies for rooms that have walls not made of windows. \n\n2. If you are outside, get aways from anything that may move, and put anything you can between you and the blast. Then lay face down with your feet pointed towards the blast. Ideally jump into a ditch.\n\n3. Stay down for longer than just the pressure wave traveling over you. Depending on the cause of the explosion, there could a separate one heading from the outside in towards the center of the explosion. I would recommend about 15 seconds longer, though it should be noted that the cause is definitely non nuclear in nature this step can be safely skipped. \n\n4. Don't gage how large the explosion is. Explosions over a certain magnitude can be extremely hard to gage the size. And as such can either be closer or further away than they appear to be. At absolute maximum you have about 30 seconds for a large yield nuclear warhead, usually significantly less time. Act immediately.",

Arrive to find a bathroom sink that takes 2 minutes to drain instead of 30 seconds...\n\nAnd for the no admittance fee, how about having raw sewage flooding a unit for 3 months because the resident won't let anybody in... I can not even imagine what the cleaning bill from that mess was.\n\nKinda funny how you have some people at both extreme ends of the reporting problems spectrum. Sadly those extreme cases cause the new rules in the rental agreement that can then be exploited by less upstanding landlords to hit normal tenants with undue charges.",

            "I have tucked in and laid down with my daughter every night since she was born, only missing a couple nights when I was in the hospital, or when work rarely makes me stay very late.\n\nEvery night we have said the same,\n\u201cGood night, I love you, sweet dreams.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s been really amazing because she has repeated it back to me since she was barely able to babble sounds. Hearing it develop into exact words plus seeing her understand what they mean, fills me with joy. I look forward to it just as much as she does.",
            "Add:  if one parent can't participate (i.e. - dad is home at night while mom works), have a signature stuffy that you leave across the room.  When mom comes home late, have her tuck the stuffy in with the child so the child has a visual that mom said goodnight anyway, even when child was asleep.",
            "God damn I just realized what my mom has been doing with me as a was a child.

            "Great advice. My ex had a little girl, and was horrible at discipline; she would just send her to bed without tucking her in and I had to go in with her and comfort her and remind her that mommy loved her, otherwise she\u2019d just cry herself to sleep. Still breaks my heart that such a sweet girl has a mom like that.",
            "My son was born early and had to stay in the NICU for 8 weeks before coming home. Every time I held him in the hospital and after coming home I would sing him the same song to sleep. When he got a bit older, I stopped singing that song and would sing other fun kid songs to him (wheels on the bus, baby beluga, etc.) Then one night a few weeks ago he asked me to sing, \"arms love\". I couldn't figure out what song he meant so I just started singing all the songs I could think of. Turns out it was the song I'd sing to him when he was a little baby (he's 2.5 now). I couldn't believe he remembered that. It completely melted my heart. That song will forever be our go to bedtime song now.",
            "Kids are tired at bedtime (duh!) so avoid cranky clinginess. Aim for fun, but go for a ritual format. If it's two books stick to it. I'd there's one song stick to it. Kids will want to test boundaries so be firm but fair.",
            "My daughters and I have had a sort of nightly ritual since they were toddlers. What started as \"I love you all the way to the moon and stars\" has slowly gotten longer over the years. Every so often one of us will add something to it. The next step was adding \"and back to goose poop park\" to the end. Which was a park near our old house that was always covered in goose poop. The current iteration is \n\n\"I love you all the way to the moon and stars, back to goose poop park and aaall the way to daddy and unicorns and sprinkles and sparkles  and fairies and rainbows and popcorn fields and cotton candy clouds and fireworks and hot chocolate and tastee-o's (who ever has a birthday next or holiday coming up) and daddy birthday butts and kitties and sloths and narwhals and zebras and reindeer and cuphead and mugman and bendy and borris too and all the most wonderful things in the world that make you smile.\"\n\nSometimes it's difficult to remember, but they're pretty good at helping if need be.",
            "Bed time with my mom is one of my favourite memories. We had a routine where she\u2019d tuck me in and we\u2019d say \u201cI love you to the top of the tallest mountains, to the deepest of the seas.\u201d It became a game where we\u2019d add something new every night \u201cto the jungliest of all the rainforests, to the sandiest of all the deserts.\u201d I\u2019m getting emotional just thinking about it tbh.. who\u2019s cutting onions??",

My mom would sing songs to me and my dad would tell me a story he made up and even would continue it each night. \n\nMy dad was the one who put me to bed the most and we had a game for a while where we would \"wrestle\" or play tug of war where the winner gets whatever sweatshirt my dad was wearing... I always won :) very comfy memories",
            "I\u2019ve got a 4 year daughter and we have a routine before she goes to bed but almost every night is a complete struggle to get her to actually accept its bedtime once the routine is over. Like she\u2019s ready to fight tooth and nail for her to continue playing or staying up and she is definitely tired.\n\nI\u2019ve only read a few of the comments but it seems like most don\u2019t have an issue I guess. Me and my wife really do our best to make sure bedtime is nothing but good stuff for her but what do you do when it doesn\u2019t matter to the child and they still act up? Are you saying to just ignore the temper tantrum and just not provide any discipline? Or is this meant for children who are older than toddler?",
            "That is a great advice!\n\nI dont have kids, but I spoke to my parents about that kind of stuff, and they said that they made sure that lunch, dinner or any other meal we had together was pleasnent, peacefull and reserved for generally pleasent talk. I am 27 years old and I still love having meals with my family. \n\nOn the other hand, my friends whose parents used family meals to corner (they cant leave untill they are finished with their food) them to give them a lesson, hate going to lunch with their parents.",

            "I try my best at bedtime for reasons mentioned. \n\nIt has been a difficult few months teaching at home, working at home whilst also parenting. Many days have been stressful for a lot of people. \n\nBut bedtime is like a reset to the day and nothing carries into the next day.",
            "Makes me wonder how you deal with them when they are being naughty immediately before bed. Threatening them with no story seems like the only leverage you have at that point.",
            "On the off-chance I'm 100% positive I'm gonna have kids. I'm going to remember this.",
            "great advice. I always do this with my boy, even if i had the shittest day or just want him to go to sleep so i can chill. I always put a 100% performance into the voices in the bedtime story, no matter how many times I've read it. he still gets a kiss and a hug regardless of anything going on in the world.",
            "As a college age adult by now with depression: if I end up going to bed in a horrible mood, it just ruins the next day for me, which ruins my next bedtime, which becomes a very strong feedback loop that generally only breaks through intentionally depriving myself of sleep until it stops hurting and I pass out more contently.\n\nAbove and beyond making bedtime positive, consider teaching your children ways to improve their bedtime and sleep experience. Tell them they are welcome to make suggestions. I for one as a kid and high schooler found that Mythbusters reruns on my phone, just the audio, made me laugh just enough to be able to fall asleep even when stressed. Long as they sleep well, don\u2019t judge what helps them.",

            "Routines seem good.  We read a book every night,  have a bookshelf specially for nighttime stories(objectively we choose easy reads for now vs lengthy small print ones) we sing a little lullaby and say a prayer,  the last two are the same every time. \n\nIt seems to help.  The stories let us all calm,  stil get excited but decompress.  Then the song and prayer are the \"reset button\"\n\nI'm not a good parent.  But im trying.

            "I use that time to tell my babies how wonderful they are. If they had behavioral issues, I just tell them that I know they can be the kind, considerate person I know they are tomorrow.

            "I\u2019m a single mom and like many other parents quarantine and homeschooling has been quite difficult. I definitely needed this reminder to just slow down sometimes. My son is always most willing to share his thoughts and feelings at bedtime and it truly is such an important time.",
            "We have a discipline system where you have to be kind and respectful if you want to keep your screentime for the day. After three strikes, you lose it. I used to include story time (in bed) with that. But after a couple of times I realized that it just wasn't worth it, and a little cruel, to take away story time. It just felt wrong. We actually watch an hour or two of a movie every night after dinner too, and I used to take that away also, but it's such a nice time for us to both focus on something, and to talk about it together. So now it's just screen time, and if he's used most of it already then we take it away from the next day!",
            "This goes for adults too.\n\nNo matter how hard your day was or how stressed you are, try to go to bed with positive thoughts and don't let any negativity ruin your sleep. If you have worries, tell yourself that there's nothing you can do at the moment and tell yourself that the best thing you can do is to focus on having a great night to be able to face anything tomorrow.",

            "i work in sleep and you are absolutely right. i used to work in pediatrics, spectrum disorder pediatrics specifically. and the real issue for a lot of kids is the parents issues, not the children's. \n\nthey need and respond best to positivity. the majority of my time with parents is them yelling at their children because that's how they went to bed. they are certainly doing it because they think it is best, but a relaxed, fun and interactive bed time will always win over anxiety, negative tone, and ultimatums.\n\nif that doesn't work then make an appointment with a sleep doctor. but a lot of kids just have too much pent up energy and need something to put that energy, be it a story, game, or just some time spent together. that sounds like common information, but it really isn't.",
            "About the alone time part: I have two kids, boy and girl (2 and 3 years old) who sleep in the same room together. They go to bed at the same time. They don't really have any 'alone time' since there's always someone around, even when they're in their bed.\n\nIs alone time something a young child needs and should I try and create a seperate room or space for them? I never really thought of this that way.",
            "I agree with the message of post, but I think you can take it too far. Any lingering negative emotion that YOU have been carrying should be left at the door. But if a child has been misbehaving near bedtime they need to be disciplined. Otherwise why behave around bedtime? Not to mention learning to deal with uncomfortable emotions is vital knowledge that you should deprive a child of. There\u2019s a median here, between abuse and coddling.",

            "I feel terribly bad now. We're having a real hard time getting our 5 y/o to bed the last couple of months. She calls us every couple of minutes because she forgot something, has something to say, is not comfortable with [fill in the most absurd blank] in her room. We're losing it a lot of times and just force her to keep it down already, and let the day end.\n\nWe tried it all: motivations and rewards for going to bed (and staying there), bedtime stories in bed and out of bed beforehand, incentives, cuddling, hours of rituals (with lists even), physical and mental exhaustion, and, of cource, authority.\n\nShe won't do it until she pressed the last drip out of her boundaries and our composure.\n\nFirst we were really understanding and forbearing and would give her all the love and calmness we could bring up after a long day, but it became increasingly uneffective and eventually you get to the point where you can't take it any more as a human being.\n\nIt breaks my heart afterwards to feel like the last asshole to **force** her to bed, but there is no reasoning and we cannot find the leverage to her motivation to go to sleep and stay there.\n\nOn the edge of your capacities you're at the point where you feel manipulated as a parent and it's incredibly hard, near impossible, to understand that you're dealing with a impulse driven, little child that doesn't understand that sleep is good and healthy and you can't keep your parents on their toes for 18 hours straight and everybody needs rest.\n\nI feel so selfish end egocentric writing this, but all I want is a healthy child that gets what it needs to be happy now and happy in X years, even if it drives me deeper into substance abuse to be able to handle the pressure.",
            "Even for me it's a reset button. My daughter is almost six years old and bed time is always at least 45 minutes. We brush our teeth together, read a story, cuddle, name 3 fun things that happened during the day, talk  and sing a song.\n\nThere was one time where we didn't do this because she was being an absolute little devil about something I can't even remember. I sent her to bed without any of those things and I felt so guilty afterwards that I snuck in her room while she was sleeping and just sat with her for a while.\n\nNow no matter what happens, we do our bed time ritual. It calms her down, it calms me down. Sometimes I have so much to do or am so tired that I don't want to spend 45 minutes getting her to bed, but I do it anyway because it makes both of us feel better and more relaxed.\n\nI hope she will cherish these moments just as much as I do.",

I would honestly suggest you don't do that as one of those whole pizzas has about 300% of your daily Saturated fats and enough salt and other crap to kill your heart real quick.\n\nAlso, once you have that EBT Food Card you now qualify for a free Obama cellphone that has unlimited data, talk, text.

            "Being homeless in central London - for about six years - was, other than the physical risks (weather, other people), surprisingly easy to survive. \n\nMost days there were multiple soup kitchens etc with chicken & rice to sandwiches to vegetable curries depending on the org. Several churches had sit down meals once or twice a week, and there were at least four day centres with food at minimal prices (5p for a cup of tea or 25p for eggs on toast).\n\nThe biggest issue was, despite daily showers, fresh hand me down clothes each week and access to laundry facilities in several of the nights shelters, staying fresh smelling. Cold weather made it worse, as bundled up, you sweated more.\n\n\nMy observation was that most homeless are so because of bad luck, rather than addiction to drugs or alcohol. The addiction often comes as a result of homelessness as a way of coping, at which point, they are functionally incapable of looking after themselves as independent people (everything will be sacrificed on the alter of their addiction). \n\nThe rest (4 out of 5?) just need somewhere safe to stay, and help with obtaining proper housing. Jobs follow naturally. Which is why I find the criminalisation  of homelessness in the US bemusing  - why deliberately remove a segment of the population to jail, rather than ensure they become contributing members of society?\n\n\n(Please note I was a 20-30 something male.

            "I was at a bike park a few months back. There are signs everywhere designating walking trails versus the biking trails, warnings about safety concerns because the bike trails are tight, fast turns and a walker could get injured by a biker hauling ass downhill on a corner. The signs also state that dogs must be leashed at all times. I was jamming through one of the bike trails, had some decent speed going. Came around a corner and almost smashed into a 25ish lb mutt running dead speed toward me off leash. I managed to dive to the side into the grass and actually kicked him a little. His owner was way way back, I could barely see him, and he just laughed. I rarely argue with people in these situations but I let that asshole have it.",

My dog is generally very friendly, but he has a high prey drive, and he can be reactive to other dogs.   \n Especially when the other dog is off leash and may be barking, or invading personal space, or any number of other things.  One dog leashed with another unleashed creates an imbalance, and any dog may react differently to that situation.",

I\u2019ve had several interactions with him while walking my reactive dog with my partner where I will have to yell and stomp my feet to stop the dog from coming up to us, while my partner quickly walks our dog the other way. This guy then asked me why I was doing this as \u201chis dog was friendly\u201d. I told him that it doesn\u2019t matter how \u201cfriendly\u201d his dog was, my dog was reactive and doesn\u2019t like strange dogs coming up to him.\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me that I clearly had no control over my dog and that I had a fucked up view of managing dogs, and this is how it\u2019s supposed to be.

            "I was walking my sisters 5 year old German Shepard. He\u2019s a good boy, but territorial when on leash. I was out for a run with him when while running through a park, a German Shepard puppy bolted after us. It was off leash and exploring the park while it\u2019s owner was meandering around calling out to it every so often. Keep in mind, this is a regular park with no fences or gates. It wasn\u2019t an off leash dog park. I didn\u2019t want the puppy to keep following us so I stopped so the owner could come get it. I hugged my sisters dog to keep it from turning around and confronting the puppy who was trying to smell his butt. \n\nThe owner of the puppy, still about 20 metres away shouts \u201cit\u2019s ok he\u2019s friendly\u201d. Irritated, I shout back \u201cwell mine isn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nThe owner strolls over and says \u201csorry I\u2019m just training my dog\u201d. As soon as he grabs his dog I let go of mine and we continue our run. \n\nI was blown away by this guys total lack of understanding of how to train a puppy. An open PUBLIC park next to a busy street with no fences is not a safe place for that puppy to be off leash. And his lack of urgency when I let him know my dog wasn\u2019t friendly was frustrating. This was about halfway through the Covid lockdowns in my country when there was a huge surge in people getting puppies. I feel as if one should have to get a license and do training before they are allowed to own an animal.",

            "The balance of synchronous vs asynchronous communication on Slack is fascinating to me. My observation is that >40 year old users tend to expect synchronous communication, while younger users do not. Older users also tend to treat SMS as synchronous, while younger users do not.\n\nI think it dates back to how >40 year olds grew up with the internet. If we set the epoch at email (ignoring things like BBS), our interaction with communication over the internet started as an asynchronous means of communication. Sending & receiving email meant initiating a dial-up connection that took several seconds and tied up a phone line.\n\nChat showed up pretty quickly. First chat rooms. There was IRC, of course, but IRC usage was pretty limited due to the technical complexity. Most ISPs had their own user-friendly \"walled garden\" versions; e.g., Prodigy, AOL, etc. The real chat explosion occurred when ICQ was usurped by AOL Instant Messenger (a.k.a., AIM).\n\nChat rooms, and then AIM, taught early internet users that chat was synchronous. If you wanted asynchronous communication, you used email instead, because early chat systems didn't work for asynchronous communication. You couldn't even message someone who was \"offline\" when AIM came out.\n\nYounger users seem to have skipped email entirely in their personal lives. Sure, they had to use it for school, but texting killed email for personal communication. This meant that this group of users used texting for both synchronous and asynchronous communication.\n\nMost importantly though, I think that AIM taught an entire generation of people that chat is for synchronous communication.",

Thanks!\"\n\nGive them all the info they need, then give them time to actually look into it.  If you expect someone to answer right away when they haven't been involved in the project yet, you'll just get frustration and a non-answer.\n\nEdit: Adding, if you send a lengthy email, **put the summary of the email right at the start.**  Don't dive into a bunch of data, supporting details, and attachments in the email, and then put the conclusion at the end;  start with \"After some research, I've found that the Dringle dispenser doesn't work right when it's trying to dispense Krungle containers, we need to adjust the settings on that.

You can also put the bowl in the refrigerator while you wait. I use that time to heat my pan and syrup.\n\nAnother tip is to wait to flip your pancake until the bubbles that pop remain open instead of filling with raw batter. The edges should also be formed.\n\nYour first pancake is the testing one so make it smaller as to not waste batter and change your temperature based off of that result.

I cleaned up the whole apartment so we could get our deposit back (we had the regular one and one for our dogs). When we left, we expected quite a bit of money since they said the deposit and the pro-rated would come back together. Instead, they sent us a bill saying we owed them money. They included a bunch of BS like \"heavy cleaning\" and treating the carpet for fleas (both our dogs take oral medication and hadn't had fleas in half a year). They also included a $500 charge that wasn't clear to us so we asked and they said it was because we didn't have enough money in the deposit and that we only had one deposit, the regular one. Even in the bill they included, they listed both deposits and it was more than enough. Not to mention, they fought back trying to keep our pro-rated amount for the time we didn't stay there.

We gave our 30 day notice and moved. 21 days exactly after we moved out we got a itemized list from them that seemed to say we were getting $500 back from our $900 deposit. That didnt set well with us but we decided probably wasnt worth fighting. \n\nOh, but we notice a couple days later that they arent giving us $500 back. They're trying to keep our whole $900 deposit and charge $500 for bogus stuff. \n\nThey tried charging for blinds, that the landlord signed our paper saying there was none when we moved in. They tried charging for paint, but we had pictures and written notice from us, signed by the landlord that the paint job was awful. They tried charging for carpet in all 3 bedrooms, but again I had pics and writing about how bad of shape the carpet was in. \n\nI wrote the new management a text and told them to please let me know when we can sit down and talk about this, so I can show them our move in documents and pictures and videos. All I got was \"trust me honey, you're going to lose a lot of time and money if you're going to try to fight this\" \n\nSo I messaged the landlord, who happens to be a lawyer. I told him every single tiny spec of damage we caused, which wasnt much. I let him know all the small repairs I'd made, and how we always paid our rent in full and early every single month, how we never had complaints or caused issues. His response was \"well the place still wasnt as cleaned as it should have been\" I told him he can hire a cleaning crew and I'll be happy to pay for it IF the can get it any cleaner than i left it because i scrubbed personally, top to bottom, for 3 days and also had pictures of the nastiness before we moved in, that he signed.\n\n\"You're wasting your time\" that's literally the text I got from the landlord who is an eviction attorney.\n\nI got on the phone, one of the tenants in one of the houses my company maintains was the district attorney for our county. He told me what I could get, I went to small claims. Filled out my paperwork, $900 for deposit and $1800 for statutory penalty.\n\nI paid $40 for my friend to serve him the paperwork the next morning and within 20 minutes of being served the court documents he texted \"I have your money\" I said \"great, let me know where to meet you for my $900 deposit and $125 court fees\"\n\nHis new manager met me later that week, gave me all my money, a glowing letter of recommendation and a \"heartfelt\" apology.\n\nMy parents are landlords, that's how they made their money, and they're really really great landlords and take care of their tenants and properties. I was angry that this guy was basically a slumlord, with the condition of his units and the lack of action the few times we had issues. \n\nI wish I could have sued him for enough to make him lose his rental properties.

            "tl;dr: Wetness is the essence of moisture",
            "This is pretty useless advice for most of the use cases you mentioned. Sorry.  \n\nFor those not in the know:\n\n1. Silica packets saturate quickly in anything but an already dry atmosphere. If you leave them just exposed to the free, open air, they will stop being effective within days, if not hours. Go on McMaster or U-line and look up some desiccant packets used for shipping. Take note of the size of the packet and the size of the container it's meant for.  Those packets in your food are meant for a volume of a few cubic inches. Toolbox, camera bag, etc. they will stop working in short order.\n2. They will not do anything to dry your moist clothes. This is a hilarious suggestion. How much water do you think they hold? Silica gel beads don't contain black holes that disappear water. \n3. Once they are saturated with water (this doesn't mean wet), they don't do anything. They can be regenerated by heating them in an oven to drive the water out. Indicating silica gel is way more useful as the color makes it obvious when they need to be regenerated.\n4. They will do literally nothing to dehumidify your windshield. They don't magically pull liquid water off of remote surfaces. Praying would probably be more effective.\n\nTL;DR: This advice is a lot of effort for no result. For these to work they need to be in an enclosed container with the thing you're keeping dry. That means putting them in your shoes which are sitting on the floor does literally nothing, except maybe make you feel good for some reason. If you're attempting to dehumidify your entire pantry then you will need a LOT of beads. Not a few packets. More like a shoebox full. And you'll need to regenerate them periodically in an oven. Which you can't do with the packets sealed in paper containers you get in your stuff. Those are disposable.\n\nIf you wanna do this buy indicating silica gel in bulk (it's cheap) and get some metal canisters with holes in them meant for the purpose. Playing card to paper-back book sized depending on where you want to put them. Once the beads turn pink, throw the canister in the oven til they're blue and you can reuse them forever.",

So putting it anywhere after unpacking is snake oil knowlege.\n\nWhen silica gel is packed at the factory it is directly afterwards sealed into the parcel and consumes all the moisture inside of the parcel. So it is already filled up with moisture even before the parcel leaves the factory. Your device therefore stays dry during transport. When you open your parcel you'll find an already inert package of silica gel. \n\nYou can reactivate it by heat drying. Do not use a gas oven, because it is very moist inside (the burning produces steam). In an electric oven with about 80 \u00b0C it will redry after a while.

            "A good way to not stress over anything and everything is to start focusing on your own mortality. Then it becomes your sole source of worry for the rest of your life. I'm currently in therapy after 5 years of dealing with existential dread, having uncorked that bottle during a particularly stressful time in my life.  I've come to various conclusions like: no matter how good life is, it's a curse having to face the fact that one day you will live the experience of having your consciousness, self-awareness, and existence obliterated into the void of nothingness -- an idea both incredibly terrifying yet not possible to truly imagine; and anyone who deliberately chooses to have kids is simply insane or arrogant/selfish beyond belief because it means deliberately inflicting life on someone who was previously blissfully unaware of such things as their impending existential annihilation because they didn't yet exist; and any other option beside utter destruction of consciousness and being is even more terrifying, because the possibilities presented by the potential for an outside, omnipotent influence are even more horrific still -- if \"someone\" can influence on a supernatural level something as base but complex as individual conscious self-awareness and awareness of experience, the \"someone else\" (or many someones) could exist which can wreak upon you unimaginable and unending torment and suffering beyond comprehension and for as long as they so desire (when ascribing human emotions and ways to such an entity as hate and sadism).  In other words, it truly is better to have never existed then to have to live with facing such a feeble fragility and mortality that is life.\n\nTL;DR: why worry about anything at all when there's really only one thing you truly need to worry about?",

He said \u201cEven if you\u2019re a lawyer getting arrested, remember: this is likely your first time being in this situation, but it isn\u2019t theirs (the police). No matter how smart you think you are, they\u2019ve done this 1,000 times and you\u2019re doing it for the first time. The only words out of your mouth should be \u201clawyer.\u201d\u201d",
            "EDIT: Someone suggested a minor improvement about \"I want\" vs \"I invoke\". Including it here.\n\nThe magic words are \"My name is X. I was born on X date. I live at X address. I do not voluntarily consent to any searches. ~~I want my lawyer.~~ **I invoke my right to speak to a lawyer.** I invoke my right to remain silent.\"\n\nI'm not sure on the first part. Many US States have laws that require you to identify yourself to police upon demand. Look up your individual US State for more information. I figure that's probably good enough to satisfy the identification demand, but that will vary State by State.\n\nSaying you do not voluntarily consent to any searches might be very important later.\n\nSaying you want a lawyer is very important. \n\nExplicitly saying \"I invoke my right to remain silent\" is important. If you explicitly say it, it cannot be mentioned in court that you otherwise remained silent. However, if you just remain silent without explicitly invoking your right to remain silent, that *can* be used in court against you.\n\nDon't be funny or creative with the words because at least one court case has ruled that saying \"I want my lawyer, dawg\" means \"I want a lawyer who is also a dog\", and does not count. I wish I was joking, but I'm not.\n\nHowever, please also read up on the privilege of shutting up by Popehat.\n\nhttps://www.popehat.com/2014/01/15/the-privilege-to-shut-up/",

            "This should come with a \\*massive\\* jurisdictional health warning. This could be terrible or at least wildly misleading advice in some places. While I am sure it works in some places outside the USA, it would help if people writing LPT's that were based on their American experience, said so very clearly. \n\nFor example, in England and Wales, the fact that you do not say something which you later try to use in your defence can be used against you. See, for example, the caution: \u201cYou do not have to say anything. But, it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence.\u201d \n\nProsecutors should (though of course sometimes they do not, and that in turn sometimes causes convictions to be overturned) supply the defence with material which may exonerate the defendant and/or undermine the prosecution case. In particular, \"There is zero benefit to you talking since your statements to police can\u2019t be used in your defense\" is not true.\n\nAnother factor in our law - but not in American law I suspect - is that an early admission of guilt may reduce the sentence. We do not have plea bargaining (thank God) but we do have a reduction in sentence of up to 1/3 for a guilty plea. In some cases, an early admission will help.\n\nNow the reality is quite nuanced. The police are constrained (by PACE) to some extent by when they can ask you questions and their admissibility in evidence. Confessions in the police car on the way to the station are much less useful to the police than they were pre-PACE (when they claimed many defendants did just that, only to recant their statement in the police station), which is why recorded interviews at the station are so important. Where and when you say things is therefore quite crucial and, if at all possible, you should make sure you have a lawyer advising you what to say, but the blanket statements in this LPT do not apply.\n\nIn my experience, the problem was not what the defendant \\_said\\_ but what police officers said they said.",

            "April 29, 2020\nI live in a non- \u201cStop and Identify\u201d state. There is also no curfew in effect. I dont drink and I dont use illicit drugs nor do I have any prescriptions that could be classified as such.\n\nWith no reason other than I was in my car in the Lowes parking lot at 3am, I was approached by two officers who demanded that I present ID. It was clear I was alone in my car and that I was eating McDonalds (from the restaurant in the adjacent parking lot).\nI asked (multiple times) what crime I was suspected of committing to which the response (multiple times) was that I was wasnt in trouble and didn\u2019t do anything wrong. That changed eventually to \u201cviolating SAH orders from the Governor\u201d.\nI stated that I am not required to provide ID to which (multiple times) I was told I am wrong and that I do have to identify myself when approached by police in this state. This is true at a traffic stop when operating a motor vehicle (which I was not) and when suspected of committing a crime (which I was not).\nAfter repeatedly asking if I was being detained and told \u201cNo\u201d, I asked repeatedly if I was free to go.  \u201cJust wait\u201d. It was at this point two additional units arrived, totaling 4 officers on scene.\nFinally, I was told that I was being detained for failure to provide ID and ordered out of my vehicle.  After initially refusing, I was told that I was being detained and again ordered out of the vehicle.\nI complied at that point and after several minutes of back and forth about refusing to provide ID, I was placed in cuffs.\nI was told \u201cWe\u2019ll just search your vehicle\u201d.  To which I replied, \u201cI do not consent to any searches of myself or my property.\u201d\nVery flatly, I was informed by one of the cops who had been circling my car and decided he needed to get very close in order to be heard \u201cI dont need your permission.\u201d  \u201cGood, you dont have have it.\u201d  \u201cWell I dont need it\u201d.  He then walked away and stopped circling my car.\nAfter about 10-15 minutes of threats of both arrest and being charged with Class II misdemeanor for failure to comply with SAH and with ROD (sic) (Resisting, Delaying and Obstructing an Investigation), I provided my ID, which was then confiscated.  I was uncuffed, provided a receipt for my ID and released to find an alternate way home.  When I asked \u201cWhat investigation?\u201d, I was told \u201cWe are investigating who you are\u201d.  It was hilarious.\n\nMultiple officers on the scene violated social distancing protocols to detain me while sitting alone in my vehicle, place me in cuffs, and make threats about bringing me to jail where I could potentially be exposed to a concentrated area of sick people.  Additionally, when provided the receipt for my ID, I was instructed to go to the DMV to retrieve my ID, another potential hotbed of illness.",
