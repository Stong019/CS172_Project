When I got up and saw that I missed it, I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses, in the hope that maybe, just maybe, they'd be understanding and give me another chance. \n\nInstead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. \n\nThey replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?\n\nDon't ever volunteer information, kids.

I have always found that having a diversity of skills and experiences to be far more useful than the particular depth at which I was able to understand a given concept. As far as happiness and life satisfaction, intelligence can even be a detractor that\u2019s attracts excess and unpleasant obligations from both internal and external sources  after a certain point.",

            "I did this with my kids.   They could read before kindergarten.     I made it fun. We worked on letter sounds in the car, or practiced sounding out words in Target.  Teach in small chunks, and let them process.   Then teach them something else and let them process.   We used free computer games at the library.   And flash cards with primer words.    If they seem uninterested, stop and do something else.    Parents are their child's first teachers, and you are so important and capable of teaching your children.   Make sure it's in a fun, relaxed way tho or else that love of learning will not happen.   You have to figure out how your kid learns by providing a mix of methods, computer, video, one on one, using tactile methods like letters that stick on the fridge or auditory like saying a letter and asking them to tell you what sound it makes.  I get so excited about this because it really changed my kids lives for the better."

Okay, hyperbole aside, it is not unusual to see potholes feet deep (not inches: feet). They can total cars and even flip trucks under the right conditions (high-rise trucks need to be especially careful due to their high center of gravity).

You'll want a few seconds to react when you see the car in front of you lose its tire. \n\nYou can bend your rim or worse...tear the tire completely off of your car. I saw one poor guy that lost 4 tires to a series of potholes.\n\nAlso if you do damage a tire to a pothole often times the city is responsible for the cost! You might have a hard time qualifying but it's worth a shot.\n\nFor example where I live we have a pothole map that shows where all of the worst potholes are. If you hit one and file the claim the city pays for it. The catch is you have to hit a pothole that is on the map AND prove you hit it. The proof is usually call the police and they file a report.\n\nGood Luck!",

Half helmets simply don't give that protection.\n\nhttps://electricboardingco.com/collections/tsg-helmets/products/tsg-pass-full-face-helmet?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3Y-ABhCnARIsAKYDH7srQTEg5fChFwZAiCMbg04cZ1KcQrgh02YGbYlNl3ditWxamOX-kp0aAoaoEALw_wcB&variant=32145102176323",

            "Thank you for this post as it struck a chord in me. Where I live, male citizens are conscripted to two years of military service and during these two years, some are selected to go for command school to be sergeants/officers. \n\nA close friend was enlisted into the army one year earlier than me and he was selected for sergeant leadership course. He was having a hard time at the start and wanted to give up so he came to me for advices and a listening ear. I would regard myself as the \u201cmore mature one\u201d in the group while growing up and tend to provide more advices. I told him to persevere and use it as a huge learning experience during these two years of service that will eventually end. He listened and persevered through and I\u2019m really proud of him. \n\nWhen it was my time, I was selected to go through this officer leadership course and similarly, I had a rough time adjusting to life and I did not know why I was so negative and fearful of what\u2019s to come. My close friend advised me to stay and persevere through as well. However, I was not brave and strong enough and thought it would not be worth it at the end to be an officer. I buckled and voluntarily gave up the course. \n\nI regretted my decision during these two years of service cause I know I have so much more potential and could be doing more. I felt that if I completed the course, I will not be lead by certain commanders were incompetent and lack the right leadership qualities to lead. \n\nMy decision haunted me and I frequently look back on it and be ashamed that I did not push myself further. I felt like a hypocrite, advising my friend to persevere and yet I gave up when it\u2019s my turn. I stopped giving advices ever since cause I felt that I lost the right to do so. \n\nI\u2019m coming to the end of my service and chancing upon this quote helps me see another perspective on this and I hope I will emerge as a better person in the future.",

            "That reminds me of a common mythological motif. It's something like you're not suppose to live on the flesh of your dead ancestors; instead you're suppose to revive your own culture which calls for updating it because its certain that overtime it becomes flawed and corrupted. So you're suppose to look to your father for wisdom up till a certain extent and then transcend it which makes your family's culture become better over time for your children. Obviously there will be cases where parents are absolute hell and the circumstances will be more difficult to contend with. I feel like the point might slide across for some people because it revolves around a family value, but the main point is to aim at something transcended that is above of what's already there so you're not shackled to the burdens that have been conditioned on you.",

I got a job (2003) which I would stay with for 16 years, long enough to retire. when I first got the job, I found out that the parking lot was about a half mile from the building where I would be working.  That half mile was all uphill at about a 15-20% grade. There was a shuttle bus, but I decided that I would give myself a bit extra time to walk that half mile uphill whenever I could.  The first day I thought I was going to die.  but I continued to do it every day. It got easier.  Then I started adding an extra block, and then another, until I was walking a full mile to work every morning.\n\nThen the office got bus passes for us. The bus dropped me off 1 block from work.  BUT the bus stop was 1.12 miles from my house! (Yes, I measured it.) So I again took to walking.  By this time I was in a bit better shape, and did the full 1.12 miles in 20 min. Every day, except for icy days, I would walk to the bus. I carried a backpack and my lunch. \n\nResult: Over those 16 years, I lost 50 lbs and my Doctor was impressed.  He even could take me off one of my high blood pressure meds. \n\nYou're never too old to find something to do that will help.",

I've seen significant improvements in my strength, muscle mass, body composition, and overall energy and well-being, but I'm never going to be Mr. Olympia or anything and I still have some stubborn flab around my gut that I just can't seem to get rid of. But I'm really glad I started this and have stuck to it.

My dad was a kind but extremely anxious person. But he also became the nicest, most caring, most genuine person I've ever seen in my life. It's like I got to see his true essence for the first time. I attribute that to music. \n\nDon't get me wrong - it's a horrible disease that wreaks havoc on the patient and his/her family. The person  is taken away one piece at a time. Theres disorientation,  confusion, anxiety, fear, and helplessness.  But music brought him joy, for a few moments anyway. It was a real gift in the middle of all that chaos.\n\nOf course it didnt last, and I knew that things had gotten really bad when he didn't recognize \"We Will Rock You.\" That was his favorite song, but he thought he was hearing it for the first time. Whenever it came on, he would tell me what a genius  Freddie Mercury was even though he had told me a hundred times before, and of course I knew already. So we switched roles and I told him everything he used to tell me about Freddie. He was enthralled by it - I told about Bohemian Rhapsody and then I played it for him. I also told him about the song \"The Show Must Go On.\" He didnt remember a minute after I told him, but he really enjoyed himself.",

            "Both my grandma's suffered currently suffering from dementia.  2 key things I learned which have helped is\n\n1. When they ask where friends and family are (who have long since died years ago), simply tell them they went to the store or are on their way over.  It saves you from telling them that somebody had died, and they have to re-experience the news again and again, and they're forget about it later anyway so they don't expect them to show.\n\n2. Watching sports is an activity that can keep them occupied and focused for a few hours, unless they outright hate sports.  It's generally faster paced, keep a lot of relevant info on screen at all times, and are constantly updating you as it moves along.  It beats watching movies to shows where you have to remember plot points from earlier.",

It\u2019s fantastic that this topic is being discussed and the advice is wonderful and I did play music on my iPhone for my mom and we sang and I\u2019ll cherish those moments until my last breath.  But here, here is what I want to tell you and what I still regret not doing more. TALK now, all the time, to you older generation family, even talk more with your parents and your siblings. TALK and LISTEN to each other while there is still time.  My dad died when I was 26 and my mom, 4 years ago when I was 55.  I would give anything to have talked more to them than I got to.  The world is changing and people don\u2019t talk as much anymore. Don\u2019t let that go everybody. Do it now. Ask them questions about the lives, about things you don\u2019t know, talk to each other with love. Do it now.  This is not bitter regret or grief or anything like that. It\u2019s just, if I could have one thing, I wish I had known my parents better, as people, because that\u2019s who I miss. Over the last year I have made an effort to get to know my brother better and man, I know I\u2019m lucky because he\u2019s a good guy. I know some aren\u2019t worth the trouble but I can honestly say we are closer than ever.  I\u2019m trying and I hope you do too.",

            "I worked at the VA hospital and interacted with dozens of dementia patients who couldn't tell you what decade we were in. They would sometimes get violent or become disoriented all of a sudden. One day I walked in on a particularly unruly patient and he had a huge smile on his face and was bobbing his head and singing incoherently but singing and smiling. They had just started a music therapy program and the nurse said she could usually guess the patients age by which songs they sang in the playlist. \n\nI never saw any emotion from dementia patients unless it was anger or frustration but music therapy turned the clock back for them and they appeared to be people again. Dementia is scary, the most horrifying experience of my life was walking into a nursing home for patients with dementia. People screaming at the tops of their lungs, trying to sneak out and escape, terrifying. There were patients earlier in the disease there too, imagine knowing your facilities are leaving you and seeing what you are about to become. I imagine the early patients rapidly deteriorate in an environment like that.\n\nRegardless, thanks to all the nurses! If you have an unruly dementia patient, try old music. It blew my mind how well some patients responded to it.",

I believe they get stored in the cloud and you pay for it, but you could also just record stuff on a phone or something as an alternative.\n\nOften with augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) for patients who have speech and language impairments, the voices that can read phrases from a device are so robotic and can make a person feel like they\u2019ve lost even more of them self than they already have. \n\nIt\u2019s hard regardless and it\u2019s very individual dependent, but it can be helpful for some folks!",

Every time she tells it, most of the time in front of me, I just want to crawl under the table and hide. However, that would give her another humiliating story to tell.\n\nJust because you're a parent doesn't mean you have a right to humiliate them for a laugh.\n\nI do think that telling about something cute they once did (pronouncing something wrong, for example) is different to an embarrassing story, but if your child doesn't like you telling about it then you should still find something else to talk about.\n\nEdit: I mean telling stories from any part of your child's life at any part of your child's life. When I say child, I don't mean only someone under 18, I mean the person that is your child.\n\nEdit again: This post blew up, can't believe how big it has gotten. Getting a lot of comments from the children (including adult children) involved but also parents which is awesome.\n\nIm also getting a lot of comments about how this is a self-selecting sample and in the wider world, not as many people would support this. All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people?\n\nThere is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.\n\nI don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down. Embarrassing someone to give them thicker skin is a massive gamble between ended up with someone being able to laugh at themself and someone who is insecure, or at worst fuels the fire of an anxiety disorder. I'm not gambling with my kid.",

I spent my first two years of college going to house parties and not really giving a fuck about the mess I was making (leaving cans all over, overflowing the trash can, tracking dirt inside, not flushing the toilet, etc.). Fast forward to my junior year me and four other buddies moved into one of our main party houses (we\u2019d usually alternate between 4 or 5). This was THE house though. Right across from the dorms, perfect location to have a good time with A LOT Of PEOPLE. Never in my life have I regretted partying so much. We\u2019d wake up the next morning and just bear witness to the hurricane that had run right through our house. \n\nI remember our worse night, Fourth of July I think, everyone came back into town for one of our good ol\u2019 shindigs to celebrate America. It had rained all day and parts of the night which meant the ground outside was wet and muddy. To add onto that, we had twice as many people that we usually did (which was odd because it was the summer and the dorms were closed). We woke up the next morning to an entirely new and darker shade of carpet, hundreds of beer cans on every flat surface, half of our pots and pans had been stolen, someone peed on our couch, and to add the cherry on top someone went through our cabinets and ate a shit ton of our food. \n\nThose years are behind me now.

In other words, if you have any legitimate reason to pause/cancel your gym membership and the gym is not cooperating, call your bank and explain. They will likely support you if your have a legitimate reasons.\n\nEdit: I should add that this should be the last resort, after numerous internal requests to the gym, and you need to keep the correspondences saved.",

            "As an ex manager of a Club Platinum and Purple location, I would like to mention that each is individually owned and operated. \n\nOwners pay franchisee fees and have to basically have a set color scheme, square footage, and trainer/base equipment package and well, that's it. AF corporate doesn't give a shit.\n\nAnyway, if you are in a contract, please email the club and ask for a copy and check the Auto Renewal section. It should say TERM or MONTH. \n\nTERM means that the owner/manager/employee has you set to be locked in for another 12/18 month agreement.\n\nYou can call ABC to change TERM to Monthly renewal or cancel renewal all together if your club is being a jackass, and many of them are. You can also call the club and ask for late fees to be waived as long as you don't have a habit of it. The late fees don't go to the gym, ABC pockets that amount (typically $30!)\n\nI'd also like to say that if you sign up with a credit card you're more likely to have success disputing the transactions, but READ THE CONTRACT. Some managers (like me) couldn't care about the money and just want members happy. Others will do everything possible to nickle and dime you so you give up, which seems to be the majority. \n\nAlways ask for a copy of the contract. Any club using an iPad can email it to you. If they still use paper and the power isn't out, RUN. \n\nIf the club refuses after you sign, you usually have 3 business days to drop off a certified letter asking for the agreement to be cancelled and all monies paid refunded (just make sure you return the key!).",

At some point you should get a manager who is invested in your development and how it helps the company rather than just treating you as a wage-slave, this will help the process and make it more enjoyable.\n\nAlternatively you can rise to whatever level you enjoy and then coast on not needing much hours/effort to do your job, and then put your effort into whatever you want outside of work.  That is also a fine choice (and you'll probably be happier than the eternal ladder climbers)\n\nPS. My actual tip if you are a new hire that thinks you are 3x faster would be to double-check that you've done it right and then call mgmt for confirmation.",

(maybe for a few days, to make sure you are doing everything properly, and that you really are more efficient). Proper compensation comes from moving to a different position. If you are excellent at an entry level position, there is usually more value in moving you to a position that is more difficult to fill with quality workers. Promotions are often given to the most efficient and reliable workers. It's not about being compensated more for that particular job, but if you get noticed because you outperform everyone else, you will likely be identified and moved. At my place of work, this exact scenario plays out over and over. The most productive people move up to bigger and better things, with much better compensation. Entry level positions are the \"farm team\" for finding good people. If you just do what everyone else does, that is perfectly acceptable, but don't expect to move. If you outperform everyone else, expect to be promoted. I understand everywhere does not work like this. I do like the comment about documenting what makes your process so efficient.",

We got a new apartment, the day was planned to get the UHaul, move the shit, and spend the night unpacking. I asked our realtor to email my wife and ask her to meet at the house at 8AM because she had an \u201cemergency\u201d to handle and needed to leave town early (my wife works third shift and went right after work) so she could get us the keys. She gets to the house, finds me there in a suit, while our favorite song is playing. We slow danced, and I proposed to her in an empty house. I knew I could catch her off guard if I did it the day we planned on moving because her mind would be on the move.

            "Our daughter and her boyfriend had discussed marriage, to the point that she had pointed out engagement rings she liked. They came to our house in September 2017, and our son and his gf came to spend time with the family. My mom was living with us. So my husband grilled some chicken and I made some sides, and invited our niece, my sister and BIL, and our daughter's best friend and her fiance.\n\nWith this crowd in attendance, daughter's boyfriend pulled me aside and told me that he had a ring custom-made for her, and asked if I would give them my blessing. Of course! He also wanted me ready to record the proposal. \n\nFinally the moment came after dinner,  with everyone in our living room. He nodded to me and I nodded back. He stood up and took my daughter's hand. I began to record. When she said yes, I'm pretty sure we all needed Kleenex. Big celebration. Perfect moment. Less than a fancy romantic venue, but there was so much love and joy in that room.\n\nEdit: obviously such a setting isn't for everyone, but we are a close and loving family. That's why it was perfect. YMMV.",

            "Absolutely agree. My ex fianc\u00e9 proposed last Christmas, we had talked some about marriage but I had made it clear I was in no rush and wanted to wait until at least his oldest was out of high school - there were issues with their mom/ parental alienation, it was a mess.  I was very clear on waiting, he seemed to agree and then out of nowhere proposed. Tried to question him and talk it through, he just kept insisting it was time. I wanted to wait, again, until the oldest was out of school before planning the wedding, plus I wasn\u2019t in a place with work and my own school to plan a wedding. Again he pushed for us to marry in a few months. Flash forward it was the worst thing he could have done and the worst thing I could have agreed to.  It should\u2019t be a surprise, that\u2019s not romantic. Clear, open, honest communication and listening (respect) are romantic.",

            "I disagree slightly. The idea of marriage should be discussed in advance - but the actual timing and method of proposal is still a surprise. I was plenty surprised when I got engaged because we had been talking about it for months and I didn\u2019t know when it was coming.",

            "My boyfriend of eight years proposed to me on my birthday this past August and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I know we will last. So many of my girlfriends have had children with or married the wrong man and I\u2019m so glad I avoided that. I had a few close calls, trust me. I\u2019m 31 now and ultimately made the best decision for myself.",
            "Agree but also disagree. Yes, definitely you should discuss it and make sure you and your partner absolutely want to get married - but the timing and location of the proposal itself can still be a surprise. My brother proposed to his girlfriend of 5 years a few weeks ago. They\u2019ve discussed marriage, starting a family, etc at length, and both knew they\u2019d eventually get married - but she was still pleasantly surprised when he proposed while they were visiting us over the thanksgiving holiday. He\u2019d arranged for us to be there and take pictures, and he make sure she was able to get her hair and nails done in advance while still keeping the proposal a secret. If you do it right, you can make it a happy surprise without completely sprinting engagement on someone who doesn\u2019t want it.",

            "I was raised with chores not being a punishment or a thing you do for a reward. They are just a thing you do. No excuses. As a mature human child or adult you take care of yourself and the area at which you live. No excuses. It made things that were tedious or annoying just be a thing to check off the list every week. And made some of the actions almost enjoyable or meditative. Everyday after work I come home and do the dishes. Just as a reflex. It gives me time to switch into home mode and the running water and white noise just lets me wash the day off me physically and mentally. And then if I have anything I need to discuss with my partner it\u2019s given me ample time to collect my thoughts and process any emotions that come with them so I don\u2019t over load my partner in case their day was stressful.\n\nEdit: thank you for all the awards. This is my first time receiving them so I don\u2019t know what to say. But thank you to all who commented I wish everyone a happy holidays!\n\nEdit 2: some people mentioned how do you get kids to learn to do chores or clean up after themselves without punishment or reward. And the answer is depends... haha. Some kids will understand and process things through a positive reinforcement and some will through a negative reinforcement. If you can help it it\u2019s better just to develop a routine habit so it\u2019s not something they have to actively think about doing or not. And you can start by example. If you\u2019re showing them how to take care of your home and you actively invite them to help and join in. Most people will naturally want to help/ be included. Especially kids, if you make it fun. And with kids you can disguise almost anything into a game. \n\nI also find it very helpful to explain why. Most people even kids run off some form of logic. And if you can rationalize why some action is valuable or beneficial to them and can show the results of that action. It makes it much easier to reinforce that type of behavior.",
            "Six months late bro. My roommate divorced me.",
            "I had a roommate a few years ago that I shared a bathroom with in the basement of a student house. I asked him shortly after I cleaned the bathroom for the first time after I moved in how often we wanted to clean the bathroom and next time maybe he could do it, etc. \n\nHe was like \u201cno. I don\u2019t care if the bathroom is clean. You do, so you clean it\u201d and no matter what I said he refused to concede. \n\nHe moved in with his girlfriend last year and I feel sorry for her, I hope he\u2019s grown up since then",
            "My GF and I have a routine called \"Confession\". It works like this:\n\nFor five minutes, she gets to tell me how she feels when I do/don't do something (e.g. \"When you stay up late to watch old movies, I feel you are trying to avoid me.\", \"I feel annoyed when you don't put the cap back on the toothpaste.\"). I am not allowed to explain, deflect, minimize, or argue. I just listen. (I'm allowed to ask clarification questions). \n\nAfter that, it's my turn. Same rules. This allows us to express our resentments without it degenerating into an argument. It's important, though, that each person expresses how they feel, and not ascribe motives to the other. e.g. 'When you promise you'll do x, and then don't do it, I feel disappointed, and it makes me feel insecure about our relationship\", NOT \"When you promise you'll do x, and then don't do it, it makes me wonder if you are committed to our relationship\". The first way she is telling me how *she* feels; the second way, she is accusing *me* of not caring. \n\nOnce you've both had a turn, that's it. Don't try to process anything right away. Just try to remember what the other person said over the next week. A lot of resentments start over little things - not putting boots on the bootrack, not refilling the toilet paper - and we found this an easy way to resolve things like that. \n\nThe hardest thing is to listen EDIT: *without interrupting*. I should have mentioned this above END. We're all tempted to explain our behaviour ('But I was just..'), or to point out the other's offending behaviour ('Wattabout the time *you*..'), or to minimize the act  ('Oh, it wasn't that bad'). All that does is start arguments. \n\nIf you just listen, and take it to heart, you'll find you'll start to make the little changes that eliminate a lot of arguments. Most of them stem from not understanding how we were affecting the other, and my experience is that clearing the air with Confession helps prevent those misunderstandings from turning into bigger issues.",

            "The worst thing about my last roommate wasn\u2019t even the messiness, it was his laziness. It was weirdly exhausting living with a roommate that never left the same spot on the couch.

He was 38 and had the lifestyle of a teenager.\n\nHe didn\u2019t act like that until a few months in, and I imagine it\u2019s the same with marriages. If someone shows their true colors after a few months/years of living together or being married, and you realize they\u2019re a lazy waste of life, you\u2019ll start to resent them.\n\nEDIT: reading this over I definitely sound like an asshole, my bad. I was just trying to say that after going through that experience with a roommate, I can see that applying to marriages also. As in, you don\u2019t really know somebody until you live with them and spend all your time with them, and the issues that arise might not be as simple as that person not doing their dishes, or pissing on the toilet seat. It might be a deeper issue of general lack of motivation to do anything with their life.

            "A funny story about this...sorry if it's long. I'm Canadian and I was living in Asia. I had been dating a girl for about 3 years. She was from another city and we saw each other only on weekends. When, finally, she moved to where I was living, for a job. We decided to move in together. (she decided, I said it was a bad idea) she was the youngest of her family, and therefore was taken care of by everyone. After two weeks, I told her she had to move out and live on her own... Learn what it's like to take care of herself. I had been dealing with the fact that she was clueless about washing dishes, doing laundry, etc. I helped her realize that it would be good for both of us. She agreed and I helped pay for a small bachelor apartment down the street from mine. It was great. She lived the independent life and loved cooking for herself and all the other perks that come with living alone. She still had me just 5 minutes away, if needed.\n\nAfter a year was up, and her lease was over, she thought she was ready to move back in with me. I sat her down and explained that living with someone was much harder than living alone and that she should live with a roommate first. This did not go over well, at first. Arguing ensued, but I eventually convinced her that it would be better for us in the long run.\n\nShe moved in with a friend from her work, which I was against, because it's like spending 24 hours with someone, 7 days a week. I lost that argument, but, it should have been ok. Fast forward six months. She complains almost everyday about them not getting along. Fighting over bills, music, food, etc. She starts to spend more and more time at my house. Decides that living with others is a bad idea. Breaks up with me, and breaks my heart. Moves into an apartment on her own and she lives happily ever after... I think.. She never talked to me again.\n\nTL;DR helped my gf become more independent and as a result she dumped me because she likes being independent.",

I use the Cornell method because I like the way it's organized, but find something that works for you. Good notes that are easy to understand make studying easier. And, if there's a particular concept you don't understand, good notes also make it easier to pin point where in a lecture you got lost, so that when you bring it up to your professor at their office hours, they can help bridge that gap instead of trying to summarize the whole lecture again.

Being away from home for the first time is just too much for a lot (most? all?) students, and the first thing to go is your ability to keep a manageable sleep schedule.\n\nSecond to the sleep thing - but also helps with mood, focus, class attendance and all that good stuff - is try to eat as healthy as possible.

Pay attention, take notes, and ask questions when you don't understand something.  Keep your phone in your pocket.\n2.  Read your textbook and any other assigned materials.  If it doesn't make sense, read it again.\n3. Make sure you do all of your problem sets, response papers, projects, or whatever crap they have students in you major do.  Start early and don't half-ass them.  You learn by doing.\n4.  Don't focus too much on your grades.  Instead, focus on understanding the material.  If you do that, the grades will come. \n5.  If you don't understand something, wrestle with it for awhile then go to your Prof's office hours.  Faculty are an under utilized resource, but you'll benefit more if you put in the work first instead of showing up saying \"I've tried nothing and I'm all out of ideas.\" \n6.  Don't cram for exams. Master the material each day as you move through the semester.\n7.  Set aside certain times outside of class each week to devote for your school work.  A good rule of thumb is two hours outside of class for each hour inside of class (that's what makes a 15 hour course load \"full time\").  If you can master the material faster than that great, but make sure you have it down cold.\n8.  Get a good night's sleep before your exams.",

I dropped out, chased a few different life paths and finally decided to chase my childhood dream.\n\nIn my opinion, some people are not meant for college, myself at 18-30yo included.

            "Can confirm. It\u2019s also a huge help if you happen to be battling depression. It\u2019s the reason you get dressed, go outside, and do a thing. Even if you don\u2019t talk to anyone, feel like shit, and generally hate existence- you did good things that day.\n\nPlus, even if you get copies of notes or the professor posts their PowerPoint lecture notes, they LOVE to test more on their own interpretation of the material/reading, rather the actual reading/material itself.",

            "On the other hand I barely went to class because almost every one of my instructors would post the lecture online. I figured why wake up early when I can go over the lecture after a nice breakfast and workout. Bad advice but I feel like this is happening more and more",

            "Eh... it's good starter advice, but it's also important to be able to determine when a lecture[r] isn't worth your time. If you're consistently falling asleep in class, then sure, the long-term solution is to fix your sleep schedule, but you're not getting anything out of the lecture *anyway*, and you'll get more restful sleep in your bed in your room than in the middle of a lecture hall, which will give you the energy to better focus on your homework, lab projects, and exam studies. So in the short term, skipping class is usually more correct.\n\nSource: went to MIT. Didn't get all As but got more As than any other score. For classes that were taught straight out of a textbook^^1 , I skipped all^^2 of the lectures, because I was just going to refer to the textbook while doing my homework anyway.\n\n^^1 About a third of my classes. So I usually attended lectures for 2/3 of my classes.\n\n^^2 exceptions were made for classes with mandatory attendance, of which I had 2 that were also taught straight out of a textbook",

            "Even a assignment worth 1% is worth the time. Miss two three of those and you are automatically getting 1 lower grade then you need",
            "I am in disbelief at the number of agreements here. Did no one go to a college where attendance was not mandatory, skip class, and still do fine? I skipped lots of classes, all the time, and my grades and learning were fine. Not everyone learns from being lectured to. You know... Different learning styles... Anyone? Or online lectures you can watch? Doing the homework and going to office hours for help?",
            "Additional LPT: At the end of the semester, always rate your professor! Some students/teachers clash and this could help a future student/teacher be more successful.",
            "Gonna disagree a bit here. In my first year of college, we were about 800 people in the class. No one gave a shit about whether you were in class or not, especially not your professor. You were just one among many, and the classes were really just lectures in which the professor would rush through a ton of material in way too little time. On top of classes you also had tutoring lessons in which somebody would go through last weeks homework. And, of course, homework. So the schedule was pretty packed. I went to all classes for the first couple of weeks and quickly fell behind in my homework assignments because I simply didn't have the time (it was technically possible if you had little regard for your social life, but fuck that). I also noticed that in some classes I would sit through 90 minutes of lecture, walk out, and not understand a thing that was said. So I would have to repeat everything on my own anyway. I could have spent those 90 minutes, plus the time it took to get to class, on doing homework or going over the material again.\n\nSo, my advice if your first year is the same as mine: Go to the first couple of lectures in each class. Get a feel for what classes you're comfortable with and which professors are actually able to explain the material in an understandable way; so basically which classes are worth going to. For all the other ones: Find a group of people and a set date where you go through the content of each weeks lectures and homework. Summarize it. Use the summarization to prepare for the exam. And if there is a tutoring class where somebody goes through the homework, absolutely go there. Whats in the homework will probably be on the exam. These classes are also way smaller, so you have a chance to get on good terms with the tutor. He might not be the professor, but he'll at least be able to help you if you don't quite understand an assignment or something.",

The 3rd, I asked him by name to stop doing it. And by then my steam had passed and the few forced questions  I tried to answer minus any confidence. I just started talking about something else. The couple just looked at us. Blank. She was a push over as it was. And this uncle, I only see him in groups anymore. He gave up asking me out after the 12th decline. That was 3 years ago.

For one, because it feels like I don\u2019t matter; for two, because it\u2019s a reminder to myself about how shitty I am, and I start to feel guilty and worthless realizing that no matter how hard I try, I still can\u2019t be normal. \n\nI know I\u2019m not supposed to interrupt people, but sometimes I do, and it reeeeally sucks when the group acts like I\u2019m a piece of shit for it when it happens. \n\nI think this is a great LPT but be careful not to shame the interrupter, because they might be trying and shaming someone is usually not going to do anything except make them feel bad. I spent a lot of my life pre-diagnosis hating myself because I believed that everyone else hated me, that I was annoying and  that my thoughts weren\u2019t valid because no one ever wanted to listen to my stories or opinions. \n\nAlso again, if you are someone who interrupts a lot (or the parent of someone who does) there are a LOT of tools you can use to learn how to get better at just listening (and not listening and exploding with your own story). Just because you might have a problem like this that isn\u2019t your fault, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not your responsibility to do your best to try. \n\n- If you\u2019re sitting, try sitting on your hands (if you tend to get excited when you talk, you may talk with your hands, and if your hands aren\u2019t readily available it\u2019ll cause you to stop and think before speaking.\n\n- bug a fidget toy that you can keep on your keys, or phone, or belt (something you have with you a lot), and play with the toy while you\u2019re having conversations. It can help to release that extra energy on the toy instead of having it floating around ready to burst (it can be easier to focus on what someone is saying if you have something physical but not mentally strenuous to do while they\u2019re talking). \n\n- CBT in general will help a lot with recognizing thoughts and slowing down.",

I was fortunate to have a two car garage but parking while out in the city is always a hassle.  Luckily, I never had my car broken into. \n\nI moved because the owner of the house I rented did an Ellis Act eviction and I couldn\u2019t afford to continue my lifestyle there.  I rented a house with two flats, two car garage and big backyard for SF.   I ran my business out of the bottom floor flat.  Because of rent control I only paid $4000 a month total for flats that would easily go for $8000 each a month now.  \n\nIf you can afford it, I think SF is still a great place to live.  Yes, a lot of the interesting people have moved away because of cost of living but there\u2019s still really smart creative people there.

            "Nothing to do with being \"strict\". All parents should be 'strict' by setting realistic expectations, acknowledging with positive reinforcement and conversation especially after mistakes are made.\n\nAnd those realistic expectations -- think \"Highway Patrol\". No need to get yelling and act like an asshole to your kids -- the rules were made and a break of the rules is X consequence, calm and matter-of-factly. Simple, no stress, best learning for the child.\n\nThat's what a realistically strict parent is and should be.

            "My parents installed spying software on every piece of software I owned until I moved out. Even things of mine they didn't buy me, that I got myself with my own money (such as a laptop I got at 16 with money I'd made from my job), they literally hacked through the internet at home. I don't know how. One time when I was 16 I was watching porn on said laptop and masturbating, and my mom burst in and told me they could see everything and I needed to knock it off. It was a horrible experience.\n\nThey also monitored everything I said to my friends. I couldn't ever reach out to my friends when I was depressed or anxious, because it would later come up as a \"casual\" belittling remark from my parents about how I was just sensitive or overdramatic. This led to a habit of me not talking to them or anyone else about my problems, and at 14, I was severely self harming. At 15, I tried to kill myself. I couldn't reach out to anyone or look for resources, and I couldn't reach out to my parents because they acted like every negative emotion of mine was stupid and irrational and *such* a burden on them.\n\nI grew up completely uncultured because of this, too. I was unable to explore things many people my age had been able to. Abstinence education didn't help this. I had no idea how to use a condom or even what color cum was by the time I eventually became sexually active (at 16 going on 17). I knew little of popular culture, memes, or even how to kiss or resolve relationship issues. I felt I had to hide everything from my parents, and if I needed help with something, I had literally nowhere to turn to.\n\nI now am left with severe privacy issues. Whenever someone asks to use my phone or computer, even if I KNOW I'm an adult with nothing bad or unreasonable, I'm scared someone's going to find or look for something to use against me or \"get me in trouble for\" like my parents often did. Though I'm now 21, I still learn things all the time that a lot of people have known since they were teenagers. It took much longer for me to find out what I wanted in a partner, what kind of music I like, and what's interesting and fun to me, since I couldn't explore on my own. I also struggle to trust people in general, to rely on people, to talk about negative emotions, and to ask people for help\n\nTo wrap this up, I am COMPLETELY against tracking your child's internet usage to this degree, especially after a certain age. Kids need privacy and trust and room to grow. You have to give them a chance to make mistakes and you have to let them feel like they can talk to you. Being critical, possessive, controlling, or invasive with your kids will do much more harm than good. Fostering an environment where they can trust you and you can trust them will set your child up to be much happier and more successful in their lives than creating an environment based on fear.",

The problem is that once you start engaging with \"rage bait\" content (politics, culture war, news, etc) the social media algorithms, which aren't that bright yet, assume this is ALL you want to see.\n\nYou feeds begin filling up with content that contributes to a few things.  First your anger obviously.  But secondly you begin to get a sense that the issues/viewpoints you are seeing are MUCH more prevalent and you are more \"correct\" than they/you actually are.  You start to fall into the trap of \"echo chambers\", where you become insulated from opposing views, which makes you less informed and less able to intelligently develop your opinions.\n\nFor example:  If you engage with content showing that your political side is correct to the point of all other points being wrong (or worse, evil), that is what the algorithms will drop into your home screens and suggestions.  This causes the following\n\n* You begin to believe your opinions represent the majority\n* You begin to see those who disagree with you as, at best stupid and uniformed, at worst inhuman monsters\n* You begin to lose empathy for anyone who holds an opposing  view\n* You miss out on the opposing side, which may provide valuable context and information to truly understanding the issue (you get dumber)\n\nMake a conscious decision to engage with the internet positively.  Your feeds will begin believing this is what you want.  You will be happier, your feeds will be uplifting instead of angering, and you will incentivize the algorithms to make you happy instead of rage farming you.  The people fighting back and forth online over the issues of the day are a small minority of people that represent nobody, nor are they representative of even their side.  \n\nOh, and no, I'm not on your political \"side\" attacking the uninformed stance and tactics of the other.

We sometimes forget and when a reminder appears, we can't help but want to like it. But I would be lying if I said I wasn't tired of seeing nothing but basic human decency being recommended to me non stop. Usually something happens in someone's life, made them think a bit and they go home to make a LPT out of it.  \n\n\nExample 1: You were a bit on edge today and got a bit heated with a co-worker who screwed up a task and said something mean? They go home and here comes the LPT ''Your co-worker might be going through a divorce and is having a hard time. Next time you lose your cool with them, think about what they might go through. It could destroy their day. Everyone can make mistakes and you being understanding will help them tremendously''.  \n\n\nExample 2: Your friend is bald and your buddies, you included, are used to make fun of it and he laughs it off every time. He goes home one day and you see ''LPT: Your friend who's bald might have severe depression caused by it and is only laughing about it because they don't want to be a downer. It's hard being bald young, think about them. If you call them beautiful, they'll remember it forever and be more comfortable in their body''.  \n\n\nAfter years, you're just like....very tired of seeing these very specific LPT about basic human decency that takes a few seconds of reflection to think about. I understand the need for constant reminder since humans always forget and can be unbearable in the moment, but God am I tired of seeing them.  \n\n\nI am so sorry for the random segway into a small rant.",

            "For those that don't accept or just 'want to be invited' - understand that it is also a cost to the person doing the invitation to be rejected repeatedly.  There is no guarantee that the person doing the invite is a social butterfly that will gather 5 others and enjoy the night without you.  Even if they are, there is no positive reinforcement to the person doing the invitation and there is no reason they should be asked to repeatedly subject themselves to rejection.   If you want to make or maintain friendships, you need to accept an invite like that over a netflix night sometimes.",

Being direct and honest is the best, and it's what I'm looking for in other people.

            "This seems to be shifting the blame on who should be doing what.

So better LPT if you deny invitations keep showing interest in going out and keep in touch over little things.",
            "On the flip side, if you\u2019re the person who wants to keep being invited please be aware of two things: \n\n1) You\u2019re asking a lot of your friend. It takes emotional and sometimes physical energy to make plans for a group. The payoff is getting to spend time doing something fun with people you like who like you enough to make the effort hang out with you. For \u201cplanner\u201d types, that\u2019s the recharge that makes the effort worthwhile. When you repeatedly say no but still want your friend to keep inviting you, you\u2019re asking your friend to essentially throw that emotional energy into a hole with no return. That feels bad, just like not being invited feels bad. \n\n2) The group dynamic is evolving while you\u2019re not there. People\u2019s roles and relationships in friend group grow, shrink, and shift all the time. New people come into the group and others drift away. The \u201cplanner\u201d role may get taken over by someone who doesn\u2019t know you well enough to keep putting in energy to ask you. You\u2019re probably going to get left out of some things because you weren\u2019t there when the idea for them came up. It\u2019s not an intentional slight. \n\nBasically if someone does keep inviting you when you keep saying no, please know that\u2019s a valuable gift and do your best to respond in a way that lets your friend know you recognize that.",
            "I disagree.  At a certain point the invited person who always declines sends the message that they actually do not want to hang out with the person who invites.  \n\nI get it.  People are shy and nervous in public but they must realize they are being selfish in their reclusiveness.   Their friend might need them to be a friend.",

The rest of us are not NPCs that exist to suit your particular needs. You wouldn't burden a friend by asking them to perform life-saving surgery on you, and it's equally unreasonable to expect normal people to be responsible for your life-saving mental healthcare.\n\nGo see a professional.",
            "I mean, in theory this is a good LPT, but lets be honest, if i invite you 7 times and you say no to all of them, you're a shitty friend and i don't want you in my life.  yeah, you may have other obligations, but 7 times in a row? friendship is a two way street.",

So there was that weird period where i would not even dare to ask my friends if could join them. I managed to talk about it to them after 3 long spring/summer month. Now it's all good and it's been pure joy. Hanging out cement friendship, even if you're the asocial solitary type of guy like i am, accept once in a while, just to make your friends happy. If they are asking you, it's not for nothing. A link has to be maintained with the people you care.",

People don\u2019t bother inviting me anymore.  I don\u2019t care for the most part.  I try to treasure my good days regardless of what I\u2019m doing or who I\u2019m with.

            "What a load of shit. Friendship is reciprocation. If someone continually turns me down for bullshit reasons and then doesn't ever invite to anything, either they don't like me or I'm not worth their time for whatever reason (which happens). \n\nThis introvert shy person horseshit really gets my blood going. Go figure on Reddit this gets 10 different silver/gold awards. Where nearly everyone self diagnoses their \"anxiety and depression\". That's not a reason to not be a good friend. Period.\n\nIf you have other obligations that's no problem. If you need a night to yourself, that's fine! But be a good friend and say that. Say hey man no thanks but I'll catch you next time. Hey man no thanks maybe we'll catch a movie next week. This is basic interpersonal communcation.",
            "I disagree, I get that people have social anxiety and such, but odds are if they stop inviting you, it's because you declined one too many times. Never decline without offering a backup/alternative time to hang out. It sends a message that you're disinterested if you don't.",

Really try to understand their side and why they believe what they do.  And keep asking even when it seems like it doesn't make sense.  If you do it politely, the other side will probably be happy to talk about their views.  At some point, in a best case scenario, they may reach a contradiction in their logic that makes them question their own views.  Alternatively, they may end in a position (such as a full blown conspiracy theory) that you know you can never contradict logically and then you can walk away knowing the base of their knowledge is flawed to its core.  Or maybe worst case it results in name calling or voice raising and once again you know it is not good faith and can walk away.\n\nBut at least you learned what really drives the heart of their views, you did so without judgement, you may question your own views which is good, and just maybe you get them to question theirs which is also good!",

Not only that, but they can also charge their competitor's fees just to be able to consume GE's electricity within their area of coverage.

That can damage them enough such that they will not work properly - to disperse the force away from your head, much like crumple zones in vehicles are designed to minimize force to the passengers.\n\nEdit: lots of comments asking about specifics. \n\nDifferent manufacturers produce different products. They would know more than an internet stranger. Helmets are not a buy it for life (though you should buy it to *save* your life!) item though in that they should not last forever. As many have pointed out, they have a lifespan both in terms of expiration and force applied. Different styles of helmets also have different recommendations.\n\nIn general, my internet stranger's recommendation is that if you fall and hit your head hard enough to think you are glad you had a helmet on, you should absolutely look into a replacement, or at the very least, see what the manufacturer recommends. Follow up with the manufacturer as well, some offer discounts for replacing. Some helmets are designed for repeated \"small\" hits, but probably not reusing after skiing and crashing into a tree. If you just tap your head on a garage door walking out, you are probably fine. This was just intended as a PSA for those who may not be aware.",

Or sat in the archives. I\u2019d play games on my computer and just do the bare minimum. I even answered the phone to my boss by saying \u201cWHAT?\u201d \n\nThey didn\u2019t budge. I think the management above my direct knew she\u2019d been hitting me etc and they were cutting me some slack. I talked to someone about it and they said they were trying to make it work out. I think the fact she had family that worked there was an issue too. \n\nIn my final month there I was sent to do my underwriting exam on zero revision and got 98%. Humiliating the other 3 guys. The boss threw a card at me on the sly while no one was looking that just said well done from the company. Usually when others passed it was a major celebration. But I knew it had upset them so I was happy. \n\nThe daughter was shouting at her boyfriend for running late one day and while running to get to her on time whilst apologising to her on the phone, he got hit by a car. He was fine but seeing her learn what a PoS she was felt great. She was extremely humbled. I heard the whole thing live from her perspective and it was incredible. \n\nHer mum (my boss) got into some kind of fight with the wrong person and came in with 2 black eyes. She too wasn\u2019t the same after that. She wore dark glasses for ages to hide it and didn\u2019t talk to any of us with the same anger. \n\nI finally got called in one day and they said they had decided to let me go. I was clearly unhappy and it wasn\u2019t working. They said they appreciated the situation was crap and they\u2019d pay me 2 months wages as a severance. I thanked them and left. On my way out with my things I mentioned I was off to uni at the end of the month and off I went happy that it had played out perfectly. \n\nDon\u2019t quit! It could work out so well!",

One day my father saw a group of birds gathering in one place and panicking, so he called me and we went on to check it out what that was. It turns out that there was a snake there which recently ate one of the birds. We were amazed by that fact that birds actually can help you find out location of snakes. So if you needed confirmation, here is it. \n\nIt happened several times to my dad back in day too, so it is not random gathering, you better check it out before it gets away.",

            "Story time because you talking about the birds bedding down for rain reminded me of this: \n\nWhen my indoor cat was only a year old it began raining extremely hard one night. He was at the back door literally wailing like he was in pain to go outside. He never went outside, even though we lived in a small city with a lot of green spaces, I was afriad of him getting hit by traffic as my sister's cat had passed away from a car accident. I kept telling him it was pouring out but he kept wailing insisting on being let out. \n\nSo after about 45 mins of him not letting up with the wailing I caved and decided, since it was late and there was not any traffic out especially with the downpour, to let him out into the storm. I woke up the next morning at 6 am and I got up to go call him in before the traffic got busy. I opened the back door and called his name and in about 5 second he sprang over the fence with a happy sounding 'Meow Meow' and came running to me. When he came near I went to pick him up, that's when I noticed it... Sitting beside the house just adjacent the back door were 5 dead birds missing the tops of their heads and brains and two big grey squirrels all in a perfect row, with the same head trauma, skull capped and missing their brains. \n\nI then realized that Thorington Wellson loves to hunt in the rain... the birds and squirrels could not hear him coming during a hard heavy rain. How he learned this behavior I do not know as he had been an indoor cat prior to this and I was under the impression cats disliked getting wet. When I got him when he was only a few weeks old with his mother in a garage. He's an interesting being, wise beyond his years and form.",

            "That works for a lot of mainstream music, but not for most rock/jazz/metal/alt pop/indie/etc... bands. Also not classical composers, and probably non-mainstream electronic music. Mostly won't work for people that are not hugely famous.\n\nWhen the band/musician  actually writes their songs, the producers matter less (in many  cases the producers will be the musicians themselves). In this cases, learn who is the songwriter, and follow their path.\n\nExample: Italian metal band \"Rhapsody\" used to have a neat \"all music writen by Luca Turilli\" line in their booklets. Luca Turilli was the lead guitar player, and has been in a few bands. If you like their music and want more, you search for the person who wrote it.

            " A good use of this time is to pack an overnight bag for your loved one. Being in hospital is shitty, but it's even worse without clean underwear.",
            "This is good advice. \n\nWhen my son (3 days old) was taken to the hospital due to him fainting, my wife was in the ambulance with him and I drove behind them in my car. It's only a 10 minute drive to the hospital, but halfway they suddenly turned on the lights and sirenes and blasted away full pace. It took everything I had to stick to the speed limit and continue my own way normally, but I'll never forget the fear and primal reaction I felt when that happened, you lose rationality and that's seriously dangerous when driving alone. \nI honestly don't know if I could have waited five minutes, but certainly better to drive where you don't see them.\n\nEdit: to clarify, my son survived and is a happy four year old now :) \nWhat happened is that we were breastfeeding at the time and although he sucked happily enough, it turned out that there wasn't much milk coming, so he didn't get enough nutrition. That's what caused him to go out after three days, but us being tired first time parents had no idea, he looked healthy,gained his weight back and all, so we never saw any warning signals. \nOnce he was in the ambulance, his heart rate slowed too much, which is why they went faster. \nDon't know exactly what they injected him with to save him and get him back up, think some sugar/nutrition, and then it was two weeks in the hospital in which he slowly improved, every few days less tubes, every day a few more reseaevh results that it wasn't diabetes, it wasn't scary disease X, etc, until everything they feared was disproven and we could take him home again :)",
            "This advice is golden.\n\nWhen I lost my wife, the EMT team worked on her in our house to try and resuscitate her before being able to move her.\n\nWhile they were working on her, a 2nd ambulance attended and it was solely for the purpose of getting me safely to the hospital.\nIt parked in such a way to block my car from being immediately able to follow the main ambulance and one of the 2nd ambulance's EMTs drove me, in my car to the hospital.\n\nI'm glad they did that, but I often wonder if a call response was missed or delayed because of the need to keep my crying panicked ass from trying to follow an ambulance Die Hard style.\n\nI lost my world that day, but thankfully I didn't inflict any harm by driving in such an emotional state.",
            "In more than one occasion I\u2019ve seen an accident by someone who was following an ambulance. It\u2019s already dangerous enough that they could cause an accident by themselves. This is very good advice.",
            "Great point, but what about if I hitch on to your tailpipe with my skateboard?",
            "When I had to call for an ambulance for my dad, police officers responded along with EMS and gave me the same instructions as the ambulance left - wait here for 5-10 before leaving, breathe deeply even though you don't want to, don't be in a rush because you can't be there in ER anyway. \n\nIt felt like the longest 10 minutes ever, but as others said, it gave me time to grab a few things and take pics of all of his medications. I was in a much better state to drive by then and was so grateful to the responders for giving me that advice.",
            "I have never been in this situation (touch wood) but this makes a lot of sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKinda related but I busted my front tyre on a curb while panicking to give way to an ambo. I'd be a mess following an ambulance. :/",

            "Additionally, DO. NOT. follow the ambulance into the actual unloading dock at the hospital.  That is a highly restricted area, not just to preserve patient privacy but also to make sure that you don't get hit by another incoming ambulance.  Go to the main entrance and let the EMTs and hospital personnel do their jobs.\n\nUnfortunately I see this all the time with patients' family members \"following them to the hospital\" and they get in the way in the ambulance bay.  All this does is obstruct the hospital's ability to care for their sick loved one.",

            "My parents took care of my cousin for a little while before I was born. He was about 3, and had a massive asthma attack and had to be taken by ambulance into the city.\n\nMy father was in the back of the ambulance on the way there. He said \"We passed cars on that highway so quickly that it looked like they were all backing up at 100km/h.\" (60mph-ish).\n\nNot only should you \\*not\\* try to follow, in many cases your car isn't capable of it.

            "im surprised you cannot  be onboard the ambulance while they go to hospital. \n\nLast year when my girlfriend had a bad infection and couldn't breathe well, an ambulance came and they let me hop in to the hospital. I didn't have a car that I could have driven though.",
            "LPT for EMT staff\u2014be very clear on where you are going. That\u2019s a big reason people want to follow you\u2014they\u2019re not sure where they\u2019re going. \n\nI think if I were an EMT, I\u2019d have a supply of business cards for the hospitals I went to, so I could hand them out.",
            "Yeah and don't expect to get right into the room. The nurses/doctors need time to triage the patient. I work the front desk at an emergency room and I often get screamed at by entitled visitors who demand to be in the room the moment the patient arrives. I understand for minors/elders when you are the guardian but most of the time these people contribute nothing to getting the patient better and only get in the way/make a scene. They also aren't too thrilled about the covid visitor policy.",
            "One time I was the medic in the back. I had my parter pull over, so I could tell the patient\u2019s wife this tip. Patient was stable. \n\nWe ran lights and siren to the ER. Unfortunately he died before she arrived. Still feel shitty, should have put her in the front seat.",
            "Also, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to be let into the room with your people right away. If someone\u2019s being brought in in an ambulance they\u2019re likely going to be immediately whisked away to wherever they need to go, and you\u2019ll be left in the waiting room for hours.",

            "Almost, make sure the hospital is accepting visitors at all.",
            "Also, once you get there, they are just going to make you sit in the waiting room forever anyways, so honestly.... you have time.            \nI rode in the front of the ambulance with my husband when he thought he was having a heart attack. They wouldnt let me in the door where they take in ambulance patients, I had to walk around the building to the front where the normal ER door is and wait for over an hour in the waiting room until he was settled and I could go back.",

            "We stopped by Publix and ordered a couple of subs.  Best high quality sandwiches using boars head meats and freshly made artisan breads. \n\nSat in the car and enjoyed them before heading into the hospital during a pandemic to be told that we couldn\u2019t come in anyway even though my wife was her  moms power of attorney for all medical decisions.  6 hours later she was allowed in after legal threats to the hospital administration. \n\nSo yeah. Take your time. Have a sandwich.",
            "I don't know what kind of people you deal with but when I say \"I'll follow you to the hospitall\" I do it within reason. Like if I hit a red light I don't then just blow the light; I wait and continue on when able.",

            "I would guess it is way easier said than done. If my kids were rushed away from me in an ambulance and I knew their life was hanging by a thread, I would be right behind you.\n\nEdit: your post makes logical sense. I agree with it, I just don\u2019t know if I could do it. I just can\u2019t imagine staying back at home to pack a bag and calm down.",
            "I, could agree. I do I mean. But, when we were following our son, and the hospital destination was 80 miles away, we followed. At the same speed, we had distance from them but, we made sure to be there, right beside him. And, I'm, happy to say that because of that ambulance crew I was able to say goodbye. If it wasn't for them, things would have been very different. Not every situation will be like that either, where it's mostly highway to another hospital in the middle of night in the rural hills, so yes, be safe and follow laws.",

I was mostly successful, but the huge train horn on the ambulance was a bit more effective. Lol.\n\nYeah, I shouldn't have done that, I know. Your LPT is a good one.",
            "Trust me, pack a go bag. Especially during Covid, you may or may not be able to accompany your loved one into the ER. You may need supplies to stake out nearby, or you may need supplies to camp out in the hospital with them. Here's a little checklist of things I highly recommend after frequent hospital campouts:\n\n-Extra clothes, especially underwear, and hospital gowns are tops, so pack heavier on bottoms. \n-A firestick/chromecast or other streaming device. I say these in particular because some older hospital TVs you cant change the input on bc they're locked, but you can get these devices to make the tv auto switch to its input! You just might have to turn that option on--should be in power settings. \n-phone chargers with long cords. 6' should reach well; most rooms arent that big.\n-toiletries like deoderant, mouthwash, toothbrushes, and stuff to fix your hair cuz a few days in the hospital will make it look like you just invented flubber\n-any relevant medical documents and all current medications\n-a notepad or something to take notes with.\n\nFinally, a little advice of you or a lpved one is going to the hospital. You HAVE to ask questions. Doctors are not \"medical detectives\" like House--they will find 1 practical thing and go with it to see if it works, and if it doesn't they will try something else. They will not hunt down every little lead and obscure condition, especially ER doctors as they mainly want to stabalize you. You must ask questions and bring up issues yourself, or your concerns will never be heard. So write those questions down on that notepad you brought, and bring all questions and concerns up politely but firmly.\nGet or be an advocate! An advocate is a trusted person to help explain things and manage care. This is incredibly helpful if you are in a great deal of pain or can't articulate well. \n\nAnd please, for the love of God, think of the people trying to help you/the patient. The guy transporting beds is not the one to bitch to about the temperature in the room--he's just moving beds, and it's more appropriate to talk to the nurse/tech about those issues. If you don't know who to talk to, ASK! And keep your ire to yourself. No one needs your bad attitude when it's life or death.",

Mid day- they have a cafe and you are good.  2am and even the little 7-11 in there is closed.  \n   * I normally grabbed a small cooler and put in a few waters, sodas and would basically make a large lunch spread.  \n   * YOu do not want to miss something major since you had to run out for food- so expect to have to eat at least one meal in a waiting room before you will have a chance to run off and do other stuff.\n* Basic bedding\n   * My rule was that if he was there for more than a night- i went home to sleep and take care of things at home. \n   * Still a good idea to grab some sort of bedding if it is late.  They will not provide it.\n* prep the house for no one being home for a while.\n   * stove turned off, back door locked, ect.\n   * If you have pets, have a plan already in place.  We had a neigbor who had a key that would feed them and at least let them out a few times a day for us (she would often just take the doggo home with her for a few days if it was going to be a while).

Roasted vegetables all get that char flavor instead, which is nice for veggies you don't like. \n\nA tip for cooking for kids: rather than hide the veggies,  leave the pieces large enough to distinguish.  Have at least 2 kinds. They can choose one veg to reject, only tasting one piece,  and the other to eat a full helping of. You can model this behavior yourself, if you want.",

Their manager has been with the company for over 5 years, and people who have been there 2-3 are complaining, but it doesn't affect them; why should they care to those they view as replaceable.\n\nListen for learning about the character of the person talking and the most likely biased version of what is going on in order to form your opinion or realize what drama is going on around you that you don't want any part of.

Or are they all born psychopaths that get off on pretending to be your friend while sharpening the knives as soon as your back is turned?\n\nIf it's the former & they really thought they had the best intentions before going into that field, are they truly incredibly ignorant & they don't know about the reputation that HR has in the corporate world?\n\nIn my experience, I have known 1 HR person that I think was really genuine & into helping people. I have also known someone that worked as a manager at a smallish retail operation (\\~100 employees at its height) who was studying to go into HR. That person was EXACTLY the kind of person I expected to go into HR: a 2 faced snake of a person that could really convincingly fake being on your side while constantly having gears turning in their head calculating whether it made more sense to keep you on because of your institutional knowledge & productivity, or find a way to get you to quit so the business could save money on payroll with a new hire at lower pay.",

I am so sick and tired of making meals for them, unprompted, and only because I feel like sharing cause there\u2019s enough for 2 more. I buy the food, I cook the meal, we eat, F asks M to clean (she has a bad back and can\u2019t stand at a counter for too long) and M says yes. A WEEK LATER it\u2019s still there. Now I\u2019m cleaning cemented, dried dishes that would have been easy to clean if done same night. Now when I cook, I find it\u2019s easier to clean as I cook. Heck last few times the food was ready, they were served, I put mine onto my plate, and I cleaned right after. On Labor Day F got pissed at me cause I wouldn\u2019t eat with them. I told her that I had to clean the grill cause it would get stuck on if I didn\u2019t get it. She said M would do it but I told her, in front of guests, that it would take 3 months for the grill to get cleaned if M did it. So my food, her food, her parents food and his food all were cold by the time I finished. Not gonna lie, it kinda felt nice to ruin a holiday meal over something petty. \n\nGod November 15th can\u2019t get here soon enough!",

The meal was fantastic and she thoroughly enjoyed it and gave me plenty of compliments.\n\nAfter eating she got up and went to her room to watch Netflix and relax. Leaving her plate and silverware on the table for me to cleanup. I was beyond surprised at the lack of table manners and respect. She didn\u2019t help at all with the dishes or cleanup. I lost my crush pretty quick and realized that I hadn\u2019t known her as well as I thought. We stopped being roommates once the lease was up.

Turned out to be one of the better decisions I have made in my life.\n\nTLDR: cooked for a roommate/friend I had a crush on, she didn\u2019t help cleanup even her own dishes.

I'd rather just heat up something premade ad frozen and not have to clean the 3 frying pans caked with grease and whatever else that it took to make this fantastic meal. The meal just doesn't mean much to me, and it is certainly (to me) is not worth all the effort to cook it only to have to clean up so much afterwards. Not only that, but because its your \"passion,\" you seemed to enjoy the cooking part. And now I get to clean up. \n\nThis is about the most cynical I can be about this. I know it is a nice thing to do and I know im in the minority. When my friends offer to cook, I accept, I clean up after...but mostly its for the bonding experience with my friend...not because I am happy I am getting some incredible meal. \n\nTaken alone -- meal for cleaning -- the trade off does not come even close to worthwhile for me.

I get emotional talking about it but our owner has gone above and beyond anyone\u2019s expectations as far as keeping us safe.

No access to water - recommend bringing a 5L bottle of water for yourself. Bring your own kettle if you want tea. \n\nYou get the idea.\n\nMy hot take, if an office cannot manage to provide a decent work environment and uphold social distancing and is capable of staff working remotely then bloody work remotely.\n\nIf you don't feel like you can trust your staff to work remotely, re-evaluate your management techniques.",

If you said something at some point, lied on your application (or didn't recall), they may find it, but if not they may find later and not pay out on your death too, so it's a gamble. It also depends on whether the doctor or nurse entered the info on your medical record. Also reg health insurers can find this stuff out too but are less interested, however if it's a big time claim the chances of them doing an investigation are higher. Record keeping by hospitals is a booming tech segment, as a lot of records are kept by hand, many hardly legible, and therefore can't be combed with a spider, but this is changing.

But telling your doctor you smoke marijuana 2-4 times a week for the last 5 years when you are coming in for a flu shot can bite you in the ass later. \n\nExample: I just did a jury trial where my client had a torn rotator cuff following an accident. Client disclosed to his doctor previously he had smoked marijuana for unrelated issues from his time serving in the military. The insurance company got to present that fact to the jury because they argued it was probative evidence that the jury could use to decide that he was in plenty of pain before the rotator cuff injury so his damages should be kept low. I had several older folks on the jury that I could tell looked very disapprovingly at his marijuana use, and I am fairly certain it played a part in the verdict amount. \n\nYour medical records can and will be used against you in any future proceedings where your medical history is relevant, including lawsuits, benefits and injury assessments, etc. \n\nJust a heads up.

We were informed after the deed was done. I understand our parents wanted to spare some tears and sadness, but personally for me, the protection was completely unnecessary and even damaging.\n\nI needed to say good-bye to my dog, pet her one final time and assure her everything will be better soon. I needed to see with my own eyes she wasn't suffering anymore and that she went peacefully.\n\nI didn't get to do any of that and it's been haunting me ever since, it still does 15+ years later.",

Years later we had to put down another cat and we were in there for the whole thing.\n\nWhen the time comes to put down my sweet old cat, I want to cradle her like a baby.

Saying goodbye to your pet is an incredibly difficult thing to do. \n\nDo not let anyone on the internet tell you the \"right\" way to do it. They don't know. Neither do I. Neither does anyone. There's no overwhelming evidence that suggests pets are more or less distressed by their owners being present or not during the euthanasia. \n\nFor some people it would be incredibly distressing, and having a very distressed owner present would be more upsetting for the pet than the (painless) procedure of putting them to sleep. \n\nThere is absolutely no reason to shame how people manage their grief in these settings.

            "I work at an animal hospital and explain the process of euthanasia to the pet owners once the decision has been made. One thing I always ask that often gets met with odd looks and comments is when I ask if they wish to be present for the euthanasia. I understand why I get these looks and comments, but I also understand why it's important to ask and to never think or speak negatively of someone who does not wish to be present for their pet's euthanasia. We can never know what each person is going through in their life. I had a pet owner tell me he was in the end stages of HIV/AIDS, another owner with end stage cancer. They hated themselves for not being present, but seeing their pet being euthanized brought about painful thoughts of their own impending deterioration in condition and death. \n\nWe shouldn't think less of people or demonize those who do not wish to stay for their pet's euthanasia. We will never know what people are going through, and the last thing they need is negative comments from strangers, friends, and family after making an extremely difficult decision. \n\nIf you are in a situation where you must euthanize your pet and you do not believe you can stay for it, don't. We won't question your decision or think negatively of you.\n\nEdit: I also remember a woman who declined to stay. She had recently watched her husband and young son pass away in the hospital and seeing her pet in the same situation would have only worsened her depression and pushed her further to suicide. She disclosed all that to me because when felt the need to justify not staying to me.",

            "Depending on what's available in your area and what your situation allows you to do, in-home euthanasia was the best choice I made the last time I had to let a cat go.  He didn't have the stress of having to go to the vet's office when he was already sick, the service I used was fantastic. It was more expensive than my vet's office would have been, but it was worth it to me.",

No reason to make him any more nervous. I brought my wife's mask in so he could at least smell her in the room. I ended up just whispering the same thing I did every night to him. \"Let's go bed, boy. Bed time. Good boy.\" It was the hardest thing I ever had to do but Im glad I was able to at least be there to try and make it easier.

It was so sad having them come in to a scary place and have that scary place and strangers be the last 24-48hours of their life...we always gave them the best care we could and extra love but it wasn't the same. We ended up starting to just pay for people to do it themselves if they were going to surrender - we'd call the vet and book and have the bill sent to us but at least the pet's last hours got to be with their owner. It helped take the emotional burden off us as well.",

It removes the pet's stress of going to the vet and your stress of sobbing in front of strangers.   \nI haven't been able to stop crying but I'm comforted in knowing she spent her last moments eating chicken and being at home with us where she was comfortable and loved.

            "So I have mixed feelings about this post. I am a licensed veterinary technician and have seen and personally euthanized quite a few animals, and it\u2019s different for everyone. While some people want to stay (I am one of these people), for others it would be more harmful and disheartening to see their loved one like that in the end. We sedate your fur baby heavily, usually intramuscularly for a longer duration of action, and usually they are so far gone they aren\u2019t even present. I would never guilt someone into staying with their animal. Simply because it\u2019s cruel and because it\u2019s not the right decision for everyone. Some clients want to remember their baby as they were. And it can be traumatic to stay if they aren\u2019t ready. Usually if you are choosing humane euthanasia your animal is very far along. \n\nThere are times when your animal is so far gone that there has to be multiple attempts at Venipuncture with the euthanasia agent (which is just an overdose of sedation) due to hypotension. This for some people is really hard to see- which I totally understand. Sometimes there is nothing left to do but a literal heart stick. Please don\u2019t make people feel less than because they don\u2019t want to be there in the end. It\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s also not correct.",

Just an FYI apparently some (a lot?) vets do this.\n\nI really wanted to be present even though it wasn't my dog, but that was too much money for me at the time.

He said I was a disgruntled ex employee. Fuck them.\n\n*Edit:* further info on the story for those asking! This happened maybe ten years ago. Basically my young family (me, wife, baby) were living in an apartment building just outside of Chicago. The building was old, around turn of the century, and it still had old pipes running through it that used to be for gas lighting. One of those pipes came through our kitchen ceiling, and we wanted to get rid of it in order to replace it with a modern electric light. We booked a contractor come out and take care of it. There was a bunch of problems right away - no shows, weird excuses, etc. Then the day he finally showed up, he arrived 2 hours late. He was one of those guys who has a different dramatic excuse each time, from someone close to him just dying, to him getting in a car crash, to him being robbed, etc, etc. We were exhausted by him and just wanted the problem fixed.  \n\nSo, he proceeds to start the work. He ended up cutting the pipe and then stuffing it with some kind of putty. We had no idea what needed to be done, and trusted he knew what he was doing. Later that day, we started smelling gas in the apartment, and we called the gas company, opened the windows, left the apartment, etc. We ended up calling out a different contractor to look at the job, and he was astounded as to how bad the job was that the previous contractor had done. He told us there were all kinds of problems and short cuts, and that it was amazing our kitchen (and apartment) hadn't blown up and killed us. I tried to get hold of the guy who did it to tell him about it and ask for refund, but could never reach him again. So, we went to Yelp and left a bad review warning others not to use him, and how he put our familys life in danger. He responded by telling Yelp that I was an ex employee who had blackmailed him by saying he'd leave a bad review.Yelp left my review up, but also allowed the contractor to leave a reply saying I was a disgruntled ex employee, and that everyone should ignore my review. I contacted Yelp to prove to them I was a customer, but they ignored me and said they were going to keep out of it. I told them our lives had literally been in danger, and they had a duty to warn other people, but they didn't care. So, FUCK YELP.",

When a reataurants yelp page has grubhub integrated into it, their number may change and grubhub can charge money. Idk exactly how it works with calls, but Grubhub takes a percentage of online orders, just like doordash, postmates etc. There have been laws passed/proposed to cap the percentage charged...they especially became unfair in early covid days.\n\nYelp offers this service of call tracking to its pay-per-click (PPC) advertisers as optional and does not charge extra for it. \n\nI'm not surprised at how many people hate on yelp for various reasons, but I am surprised by how little business owners understand about online advertising...yall need to know these basics in case the day comes where advertising is necessary to stay competitive/relevant. \n\nA standard Yelp page is free and can be a great place to showcase your business, if you really dont want pesky yelp calls, you can ask them to put you on the Do Not Call list.",

            "Actually, this isn\u2019t quite true. I own a small business (a dance studio) and we don\u2019t pay for Yelp advertising. We don\u2019t get charged when people try to call us. In fact, our number is shown when you click on the \u201ccall\u201d button. This MIGHT be true for people that \u201cpay per click\u201d for them...or \u201cpay per conversion\u201d....but only as a way of tracking interested users when they show your business more than the other guy. \n\nNow this being said, we have used Yelp before for advertising, and I did not see a big difference in interest in our services. So we have decided not to use Yelp for their services. \n\nBUT, Yelp itself is essential to a small business like me. We have 30 or so yelp reviews and every single one of them tell of someone\u2019s experience. Those yelp reviews are crawled by Google, and then when someone searches for \u201cdancing\u201d we are more likely to show up on the front page. We focus on encouraging those that have raved about our service to write about it on Google, Facebook, or Yelp. \n\nHowever, I am always worried about that one person, either through the business or personally, that wants to just blast us on Yelp. We had a really horrible experience with our kitchen designer when we remodeled our house. What kept me from writing a bad review about her was my fear that she would turn around and write a bad review about me (of which she clearly never used our services). \n\nBut in summary, yelp can really help small businesses. In fact, during Covid, one of the ways you can help out your local small business is to go on to their Facebook, yelp, and Google page and write a UNIQUE (meaning don\u2019t just copy and paste on all three sites) and POSITIVE review about them. Many small businesses are suffering right now, and this is how you can help out the most!!

            "Beekeeper here.  Husband and I would do this to get more bees.  Freebees we call them.  In our city, and in many in US, you can call 311.  311 will have a list of beekeepers in the area you can call.  So, bee light goes off in the sky, we jump in the bee mobile, and make a beeline to rescue those bees.\n\nWow!!! Thanks all for the upvotes an the award!!!  That was my first ever!!!\n\nGold!! Thank you kind Redditer!!!  I really should tell you all my swarm in the car story!!\n\nSwarm in the car.  I am on mobile so please be kind.\n\nSo, it was over 10 years ago and we got a call from the fire department.  If you had a swarm you called 911 and police or fire called the beekeeper.  Husband had the bee vacuum on another call so I took the swarm box (plastic file box with an empty honey frame in it) and went in my minivan to the far North of my city.  We live in the far south.  It was late afternoon and when I got to the business all of the workers were inside looking out the window.  They had locked the door....likes bees would know!!\nThe swarm was about 4 ft off the ground and around a tree.  Very easy.  Put on my bee jacket with helmet and veil, my bee gloves and took my swarm box and bee brush.  \nVery easy to brush the bees into the box.  Put the box on the ground and spray liberally with prepared sugar water (like nectar) and wait for bees flying around to go to the box.  If you have the queen, the bees will follow her.  \nEasiest capture I had ever done.....or so I thought!!!\nI put the uncovered box in the back of my minivan.  You keep it uncovered so they don\u2019t suffocate.  Took my gloves off and placed them next to the box.  Took my jacket off and put it on the passenger seat.  Waved to the business people and drove away.\nGot on the freeway right at rush hour...  within 20 minutes the bees had licked all of the sugar water off each other.  All of a sudden I heard what sounded like an airplane taking off.  I look in the rear view mirror and see all of the bees flying straight for the front of the car.  \nAll of the windows except windshield were tinted so the bees were going towards sunlight and out!!! All over windshield!!! Flying all around me, 10,000 (approx) bees!!!  \nI turned on the defroster to get them off the windshield and they started clumping up on the window.  Many bees fell on to my jeans and then crawled up my jeans.\nNow remember, I don\u2019t have my jacket with helmet and veil on.  So, I get downtown and traffic is stopped!!  I am able to gently get bees off my face and get my jacket with helmet and veil.  \nI keep driving.  I get to my exit.  You can see the bees flying all over inside, clumps of bees on windows\nDOT is closing my exit.......WHAT!!  I start honking.  Guy putting out pylons has his back to me and is waving me off.  I keep honking.  He turns around with a surly look on his face.....then he sees them!!!  He says O My God!!!  Could read his lips, didn\u2019t have to hear him!!!  He lets me go!!!  Thanks!!!  \nI get home and husband is home by this time, sees my plight and laughs!!! I climbed out the back and we were able to vacuum up the bees in the car and hive them!!!\nNot the end of the story....I was at a conference a few years later (not a bee conference) and the head of the department of transportation for my state was there and talking about the funniest things that happened on the major Interstate.  1. Vodka tanker spilled into the river. 2. Some crazy lady was driving around with bees in her car.....I raised my hand...that was me!!!  Crazy bee lady!!",

After some calls, a super cool 18 year old guy came at like 11 pm, climbed the roof, sprayed the bees with water so they couldnt fly, and then he scooped them all down into a box. He had brought baby bees to put in the box, because if a bee swarm sees baby bees they wont leave them. So all the bees moved into the box and he could take them home. A swarm that big would have been very expensive for him, so it was a winwin. He got bees and we got rid of bees. :)",

And when I tried to talk to people they were really dismissive and made me feel like they didn't want to talk to me. It really knocked my confidence and self esteem down to 0. And it wasn't fun standing there with no one to talk to. So I wish it was that easy but in my opinion it's not and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.",

In 2008, I was going through a nasty breakup and the guy kept stringing me along with FWB stuff, teasing me about getting back together. \n\nOne April weekend, I took a road trip by myself to the other side of the state to a place I'd wanted to visit for years. Spent half a day in the car driving, then spent the next day exploring the area before I drove back home that afternoon. \n\nI took pictures of that place (in 2008, social media wasn't everywhere) and I still have those photos stored in multiple places in my computers and storage devices. \n\nI did a lot of thinking those two days and knew I had to let that guy go.

Would love to taste different stuff, but similar to drinking, eating alone in a restaurant is also kinda weird. Not that it would hinder the stuff I do, but there are still A LOT of things you simply cant do or simply arent as enjoyable to do alone as with company.\n\nThats why I (and probably a lot of people) stick to gaming. You can enjoy a lot of online games alone and can interact with stranger if you want to. And if you interact with people, if you come of as weird you can just leave, block mute or other stuff. If I go to a restaurant or a bar alone and try to do a conversation with a stranger your mind will connect that place with that awkward (if you did try but felt uncomfortable) or lonely situation (noone to share your experience with).\n\nI still enjoy my walks and jogs through the park and general sports outside alone, but yea, there is other stuff that I would like to do too. I am totally fine with myself and I am confident in myself, happy to be alone, but yea, some stuff is still weird alone.",

I went to this festival alone. It just made me extra paranoid of pick pocketers (something very common at festivals) and made me feel lonely watching other people chatting and dancing with their friends. Yeah I got to see the artists I wanted but felt lonely the entire time. It was a three day festival too. Yeah I went all three days. Yes I met some people and had conversations. But it sucked, ultimately. Had to rent a hotel alone, had to get ready and hype myself up alone, had to drive there alone and pay a steeping $20 to park every night. It was awful. Am I glad I got to see my favorite artists? Yes. Did I maybe enjoy some of the time? Sure. Would I do it again. No.",

            "Discussing salary is a double edged sword. In environments where personal performance has a meaningful impact on work product (mainly professional roles), different people bring different value and should be compensated appropriately. Fran and Joe have the same job title but Fran objectively delivers more value and gets paid more, but Joe doesn't see that piece, he only sees Fran gets paid more.\n\nIn my experience in this type of environment, discussing salaries led to an outcome that basically meant we stopped rewarding personal excellence. Our group stopped giving out performance based bonuses and raises because people discussed them with each other, got upset when person Y got more (even though they deserved it) and it took a huge amount of effort and energy from our leadership to deal with, it was just easier to pay everyone average pay, despite some people clearly putting in more effort and bringing more value.\n\nSo beware, discussing salaries can be helpful against exploitive leadership, but it can also remove opportunity for rewarding individual excellence.",

            "Not many people know this but middle management makes most of their money in some form of wage theft. Some companies will actually give incentives to management teams who get labor costs down and usually they do this by fucking over workers\u2019 wages (I call it double dipping). This is how they do it in the restaurant/hotel industry. I co-owned a restaurant but I was really just a slave to the other owners and things are set up in a lot of businesses to have so much gray area around payroll and labor. I remember once when I was trying to keep the other owners happy by cutting down labor by like 12% which (if you know anything about any business) was huge down from 35.3% to 22.8% and then down to 21.1%. This was a really disruptive process for employees financially and probably one of the worst mistakes I've ever made in business. Our best employees left and the ones that stayed got other part time jobs that made them give a shit less about this one which I understood and I would soon have the same experience myself. The other owners (the investors in the business maybe showed up physically twice in two years of ownership) Also, In that process there were so many opportunities for me to fuck employees out of wages they didn't even know they were entitled to. Like, one of my servers made $400 in a night she fucking killed it but the way our system worked is we didn't have enough cash to tip her out that night so I gave her $250 and the other $150 was to go on her paycheck at the end of the week. In between those two days to process (that 150 is in limbo now) I can keep that cash because when she gets her check she only knows her \u2018percieved\u2019 income because it always varies. I accidentally forgot to put it on her check and enveloped $150 in cash (something I typically do so high volume servers don't have to pay that much taxes as it's not recorded as income) and gave it to her *bows my head in shame* two months later when I found it in the bottom of her \u2018drop\u2019 in my filing cabinet. If she wasn't one of my close friends (who would go on to help me close this disaster) it could have been a huge problem. But if I didn't see the envelope and give her the cash she never would have noticed it was missing income in the first place, get me? I have four more instances just like this in similar \u2018incentive\u2019 or commission-based industries. But they're TL;DR\n\nI know you're probably thinking \u201cthats gotta be pretty isolated\u201d no, no it's not at all. It's happening at every fucking restaurant, bar, hotel, car dealership, employment referral service, construction agency, ice cream stands for fuck\u2019s sake in this country. These people are fucking reptiles and they will rob you blind. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS keep a close eye on your wages and educate yourself legally as a worker. It\u2019ll make you harder to hire because you won't be advertised as a slave which is what every management team in the universe wants, but it'll be worth it not getting fucked in the ass by the no condom wearing shit-eating Chad that will be stealing your wages while, trying to make up for it karmically by throwing you a surprise birthday party.\n\nTL;DR Eat the rich",

In about a year or so, I lost 65 lbs, went from a tight 36\u201d waste to a loose 32\u201d.  I have since retired and now walk 6 miles, 5 mornings a week (rain, snow, sub-zero temps, never miss a day) and lift weights for 40 minutes.

            "I would add all the big \"don't go there\" topics for co-workers. If you are going to get married to them make sure you discuss abortion, politics, aliens, religion, flat earth, video games, vaccines, LGBTQ, if its okay to say a celebrity is hot. This goes a long way. You don't have to agree on everything, it's just good to have these topics out of the way and know there aren't any dealbreakers. It's also a good gauge of relationship maturity if crucial conversations can be had without it having a major impact on other areas of the relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the replies and for sharing your perspectives. I've learned from many of the comments. I hope you got as much out of my comments as I got out of yours and I sincerely hope you enjoy your week with all that is going on in 2020.\n\n1. As a general aside to any comments such as \"what's wrong with\\_\\_\\_!?\" I feel this is a good example of why these topics bear discussion. I have without expressing my own view pointed out polarizing topics that have made many marriages harder because in courtship a couple avoided discussing those topics or assumed because they love that person that it doesn't need to be discussed. You don't have to take my advice but it was advice that was given to me by people who had been divorced and wished they had done so sooner. I feel it qualifies as a LPT because it has helped me a great deal in my relationships, but take it as you will.\n2. I believe in firebreaks, that's all. People can fight about anything, just ask my parents. They fought over if the blinds should point up or down when fully closed, which way the toilet paper should go, sometimes I don't even know what they were fighting about; but it was traumatic and they both agree that there were things they wished they had talked out more thoroughly before marriage. Just my 2 cents. Granting that couples can fight over literally anything, discussing polarizing topics can give you a glimpse into how well you will do in those stressful moments after the honeymoon is over... And I'm sure there will be some topics you don't agree on. But knowing before hand is preferable to me in either case. These topics are a gage of emotional maturity and ability to talk through feelings and  I would much rather have these discussions before I share a mortgage with someone or children.\n3. I would also add the advice my lunch lady gave me once. She made me promise to take my potential spouse kayaking because her first marriage, the guy was so sweet etc. and her only glimpse that the marriage would be horrible was how poorly he acted when they went kayaking together. I kept my promise and I'm glad I did.",
            "You couldn\u2019t be more correct OP. I\u2019ve been happily married for 20 years. It\u2019s amazing how many things life will throw at you and they\u2019ll be plenty of topics that you never considered discussing. They\u2019ll be plenty of those that you don\u2019t agree on. Which is okay,    but, they can be hard to navigate. If you have the core principles already worked out, it makes it a lot easier. Not easy, just easier.",
            "Second this. Have a friend who's fiancee casually said \"when you quit your job to stay home with the kids\" in a group conversation and I just saw the horror on her face.

If you want kids and your partner doesn\u2019t, you can\u2019t have half a kid. If you want to live in NYC and she wants to live in LA, living in the middle does nothing.\n\nI would also highly recommend seeing a couple therapist. Just think of it as wedding insurance.

            "I think it's a good idea in theory but not something you can count on as solid intel. People often say what they believe when they perceive themselves as the best version of themselves.  I'm sure any discussion about cheating is going to sound the same because no one is going to admit they have the potential to cheat.  No one is going to admit they won't give your mentally ill sibling another $5k to bail them out of financial trouble.\n\nAlso, people change their minds on things, especially when something happens to them which might open some insight or alternatively close their minds even further. Most people will believe a health crisis just means sticking together through sickness and health, but no one wants to admit that a brain injury can turn someone violent.\n\nHaving these convos can provide some insight for sure, but there's an element of it that sounds like you're looking for assurances and fixed thinking. That is not how life works in my experience.\n\nBoth my husband and I had endless conversations about many topics before marrying but still to this day I often come across something controversial that we agree on and I think if we didn't agree on this, I'm not sure how I'd feel about him. And yet we never discussed it prior to marrying.  At the start of our marriage, I kind of patted my own back for how careful my choice of partner was, but in many ways, I feel I just fluked it.\n\nI feel if there's one key to identifying a successful marriage, it's understanding how they communicate, or whether they communicate at all.",

But he is more concerned with timing on big things like buying a house, moving to a new city, and having kids. They've done everything she wants, just not right away.

            "My fianc\u00e9 have been engaged for a while now, and once we got engaged we realized how many couples DON\u2019T talk about these things beforehand. You should know all the answers to these question before you get/wear a ring.",

            "A comprehensive set of questions to discuss. Found it here : https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomen/comments/8wbgpe/_/e1ujfjt\n\n---\nI'm going to give a very detailed response because simple statements like \"you work well as a team\" or \"you respect each other\" aren't sufficient. Important, yes, but not sufficient.\n\nYou know your partner is the right one to marry when you love them, are willing to make sacrifices for their happiness, they are willing to make sacrifices for your happiness, and you have thoroughly and exhaustively discussed and considered the following list of items which frequently lead to marital strife and divorce.\n\nFinances. How do you view money? Spend money? Save money? What are your goals, expectations, habits? How do you feel about debt? How much debt do you each currently have? How will that impact your marital life? Finances is a huge source of stress on a relationship. Be on the same page.\nFamily planning and parenting. Kids / no kids? How many? When? What to do if you have an oops pregnancy? How would you handle infertility? How do they feel about adoption? How do they view division of labor in parenting? How would they discipline?\nHousehold labor and standard of cleanliness. How much dirt, clutter, or messiness are they willing to tolerate vs how much you are willing to tolerate? If you feel you do a little bit more than you should now, that will become a LOT more than you should after you have kids. Make sure you and your partner are on the same page here because it does not get better and usually gets worse.\nReligion and politics. You don't have to be in perfect alignment, but you do need to be able to respect one another's views and logic. People's religion and politics do change over time, but they tend to get more extreme not less. Look into the future to see how life will look in this area especially if you have kids. It's one thing to agree to disagree before kids, but it's quite a different matter to watch your partner teach your child things you disagree with.\nExtended family expectations. How close are you to your family? How close is your partner to their family? How do you each feel about each other's families? How do your families feel about you and your partner? Will you be cool seeing these people for every major holiday for the rest of your life? How will you handle elderly parents who need assistance? Take a look at any of the toxic family subreddits to see just how much havoc the inlaws can wreck on an otherwise happy marriage.\nCareers. How important is your career to you? Your partner's to them? Who will sacrifice in this area if one of you needs to move for a major promotion or opportunity? Does your job require you live in a specific area? How do you feel about living abroad for a while? Does one of you want to be a stay at home parent? How do you each feel about that? What if one of you has to stay home because you can't afford childcare? How will you handle that? How will division of labor change? Does your partner respect your career even if you don't earn as much? Would you respect your partner for earning less? Wage inequality can do weird things to power dynamics in marriage. It can lead to lack of respect or a feeling of superiority or inferiority.\nSex and fidelity. You need similar sex drives. If one person feels pressured for sex all the time while the other feels sexually frustrated all the time, it will kill your relationship. Be on the same page from the start. Settle into the relationship to get past the honeymoon phase where you boink like bunnies to see what your real sex drive and sexual needs are. You need to be able to discuss sex candidly without embarrassment or shame. Fidelity goes beyond affairs. How do you feel about outside sexual influences? Discuss porn, online chats, \"gone wild\" content, flirting, dancing, close relationships with people you're attracted to outside of your marriage. Everyone's line here is different. You need to know what exactly will be hurtful for your partner, and your partner needs to know what will be hurtful to you. Does it bother you when your partner looks at other people with sexual desire? Does it bother them when you do? Discuss your boundaries thoroughly. Really think about anything that's bothering you in this area because it will not change when you get married. People have this idea that their partner will \"fully commit\" to them and stop any wandering or flirting once married, but that's rarely the case. People are who they are. Decide if you can live with who your partner is.\nCommunication. Does your partner make you feel good about yourself? Do you share a sense of humor or at least respect each other's senses of humor? Do you handle problems as a team? Do they \"fight\" fair? Are arguments productive? Do they listen to your side and really consider what you say, or are they set on \"winning\" every argument? Communication problems are like a magnifying glass for the original issue. If you don't communicate well and kindly, you will drive a wedge in your relationship. If the communication problems are on your end, fix this about yourself before getting into any relationship.\nHobbies and leisure time. What are your expectations? How much money is appropriate to spend on hobbies? Do you share at least one interest in common that you can do as a couple? Do you respect your partner's hobbies? How will your leisure time change with marriage? With children? A mismatch in this area can leave you feeling alone or abandoned. It can leave you feeling disrespected and belittled if your partner is the one who doesn't respect or support your interests. People's hobbies and interests change over time, but how passionate they are about their current hobbies and interests generally stays constant. If your partner spends 20 hours a week on hobbies now, they will always want to spend 20 hours a week on hobbies even if those hobbies change. Kids can really magnify an imbalance in this area especially if one partner is constantly off enjoying themselves while the other partner gets stuck at home with the kids.\nRed flags. Is there anything bothering you? Does your partner drink a little too much? Treat wait staff a a tad poorly? Drive aggressively? Defer to you on everything? Put their family before you? Spend money recklessly? Tease you a little too pointedly? Push your boundaries? Sulk when you say no? Make you feel guilty? Pick arguments over inconsequential stuff? Blow hot and cold? Whatever it is that gives you that little check in your gut, listen to it. Analyze it. Take your time to watch that element closely and decide if you can live with it for the rest of your life.\n\nYou will grow and change over time and so will your spouse, but if you start on the same page in these areas and maintain good communication, you will greatly increase your odds of growing together in the same direction. Those 80 year old couples who've been married 60 years and still hold hands in the park are still together because they walked the same path side by side every day of their lives. If you don't even start out on the same path, how can you stay on it?",

My first thought was here we go, this is going to be some bullshit about trying to convert me and attacking my non belief. What I found was a questionnaire about pretty much everything OP has said as well as expectations of roles of each partner etc. it had nothing to do with religion and really didn\u2019t mention it at all. Looking back now it was one of the best things we did before we were married.

            "Yes. I can't recommend this highly enough. So many relationships and marriages end because these subjects are never broached.\n\nGranted, sometimes people have views that align completely, then one or both of them change over the years, the issue comes up, and suddenly they don't agree. That's life. But having had the discussion beforehand at least lets you know where the land lies, rather than simply assuming that your spouse will be in your side instead of as far removed from yours as possible.\n\nEven plan for things that are extremely unlikely, such as large financial windfalls. You do not want to win the lottery, inherit a large amount of money, or suddenly find your stock portfolio is worth millions only to learn that you spouse's attitude is to use most of that money to help out your families, where your attitude would be to use a little of that money to help the people who need it the most (sort of like financial triage), save a little, and invest the rest to live on the drawdown and be able to continue helping *as needed*. Those arguments can be divisive enough *without* having the money in the picture - then you're just arguing hypotheticals. But if you've actually got the money in hand, then the situation is real, and can make or break you both.\n\nI'm so very, very glad my wife and I got that ironed out ahead of the financial windfall we're yet (and just as unlikely) to have. That argument would have gotten *ugly*.",

They are incontinent, one is mostly blind, the other has a heart murmur that the vet describes as \"sounds like a washing machine\" and I am struggling to understand if it is time to put them down.  They still wag their tail when I pick them up, and cleaning up after them isn't so much of a big deal that they should *die* in my opinion but 18 is crazy old for even a little dog like a Bichon Frise.  \n\nI wish I knew what the right thing to do is.  My vet says \"You'll know\" when it's time,  but what if I don't and it is way *past* time?  My wife wants them gone and hates their level of high maintenance (even though she does none of it)... and I can't understand that level of being \"done\" with pets that have been a part of the family for so long. \n\nI had to travel for business this week and was gone for about 36 hours and my wife just let them wallow in their own pee and shit in the crate/pen area I set up for them in the garage so she didn't have to deal with them very much.  Her interpretation of that was \"not at all\" and to text me about how abusive it was to abandon them like that (even though she was home). I came home and they were filthy and terrified and I just can't be with them 24x7 like the last 2 years of the pandemic has allowed.  They don't have any pain or debilitating health issues and I feel like this is just what we signed up for when we got dogs, they are ours to take care of until it is more of a mercy to let them go.  It is a really difficult decision and I don't want to be selfish and just throw them away because they are inconvenient.",

All that being said animals are not stupid. He knows he\u2019s supposed to do his business outside and even with never having been punished by me I can tell he\u2019s fearful that he might be. Thank you for pointing this out. It\u2019s best to teach by reward you can tell them \u201cwe go potty outside\u201d or however you like to say it (simple is best) and move on.

One surgery to remove most of his teeth later, my boyfriend and I adopted him and he's been our best friend ever since. I'm grateful I get to love him and be his family, but my heart breaks for the pain he went through when he was abandoned.

It was taking a lot of effort to get her moving. Every few minutes she would just plop down and look at me wistfully, but I was on a schedule and was oblivious to what it meant. Instead I kept scolding her, lifting her up, forcing her to keep moving. Later that night, she was completely unresponsive to any of the things that had given her so much joy in life, and that's when it hit me that she was in trouble. Brought her immediately to a 24-hour animal hospital, where she was forced to stay overnight (thank god it wasn't her last). Turns out she had an aggressive tumor wrapping itself around and squeezing her main artery, to the point that it was suddenly causing an almost catatonic degree of fatigue.\n\nThe prognosis was fatal but the timeline unclear\u2014she had an outside chance at a month or two more\u2014and the tumor was so enmeshed with the artery that surgery itself could easily have been fatal. So we simply took her home. One hour she would seem fairly normal, the next totally out of it. She only lived two more days, for which I'm still incredibly grateful. I was with her when her last moments came. I shouted to everyone, and we held her as she died, and afterward too. We kept locks of her beautiful tricolor hair.\n\nBut even the knowledge that we'd shared 10 years of love and good times can't stop me from tearing up when I think about that one walk.",

After being told it was a UTI, and then that it was due to an enlarged prostate (unfixed dog), and then finally that he was dying of terminal bladder cancer i took it upon myself to learn every single thing about dog bladder cancer. I learned that he might benefit for a long time from some chemo. So I took him to our local vet school to see the cancer vets and it turns out.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have cancer at all. His prostate was shedding \u201catypical inflammatory cells\u201d that look kind of similar to cancer cells. And my first vet decided that was enough. If I\u2019d have been someone else - I might have decided to just put him to sleep. \n\nToday he got neutered. He\u2019s only 12. If I\u2019m lucky we might have another 5 years together.\n\nAlways always always make sure. I got the best gift in the whole world - what everyone wishes for when they hear this news. Being told it was a mistake. A bad dream. And I cannot believe how fortunate we both are that I knew enough to read about the standard of care for the cancer they told me he had.",

When my dog got old she started having accidents, beforehand she was absolutely fine and would tell us if she needed to go beyond having a stroke that she was recovering from, turns out her entire abdomen was lined with cancer. It definitely wasn\u2019t the only signal of her being sick, but that was one of the things that contributed to us finding out later, by the time we were able to take her to the actual vet as opposed to just texting and calling her, it was best for our dog for us to let her pass on with no pain. It would have been beyond mean of us to keep her here when she was clearly suffering. If you know your pet well, they let you know these things, but chances are if you\u2019ve potty trained them that they aren\u2019t doing this on purpose to make you mad.",

            "Honestly just never be too hard on your pets. \n\nDepending on many factors, but generally speaking, any of their bad habits are actually poor training on your, or a previous owner, etc, or something they cannot control like op pointed out. Pets don\u2019t screw up because they want to, they do it because they don\u2019t know better. Training with love and affection and attention will always go further than shouting. \n\nI remember trying to teach my small dog how to walk better on a leash, and at times yanking her around. Never hard enough to hurt her or make her yip or anything, but enough that I certainly wasn\u2019t being nice. And she never once learned anything from it. After she passed two years ago, I only have so many memories of her. A lot of good ones, the moments before she passed because they were the most recent, and a few of me being an asshole to her, when she honestly had no idea and was just excited to be outside walking with me. Don\u2019t do what I did.",
            "this was a hard lesson for me to learn too, but scolding pets/animals really doesn't work and doesn't help.  They don't understand.  Yes they know you're angry, but not why.  And it can have serious repercussions on your relationship with your pets.  I had a cat that was having similar issues and thankfully got him to a vet quickly and he got the care he needed, but I felt horrible.  From that point on, I decided that scolding an animal for being, well, an animal is a stupid human trick.  Yes they can \"misbehave\" but it's up to us to be the leader and show them and teach them, not scold them or get angry for them being what they are.",
            "I'm a vet. There's a couple things I think need to be said here. Firstly, your pet loved you. With their whole heart they loved you, even if you did discipline or scold them for something outside their control. We've all experienced that from our parents and most of us deeply, completely love our parents. I promise, they didn't blame you for it and still loved you every single second between the accidents.\n\nSecond, it's good advice to consult a vet if you notice a sudden change in bowel movements or urinary pattern. Volume, frequency, color, smell, all of it does matter. Could be as little as a UTI, could be kidney issues, bacterial imbalance, diabetes, adrenal disease, SO MANY diseases first show up as increased thirst and increased urination.",

What the study found was that the answers were consistent among people born into the same social class, but varied widely between classes.  \n\nAs I recall, people born into the upper class said success depended on talent and motivation... people born into the middle class said education and hard work... and people born into the lower class said it was luck and connections.\n\nThis is remarkably consistent -- people who weren't part of the study tend to strongly gravitate toward one of those answers and strongly disagree with the other two, correlating with their own social class at birth.\n\nTo me, though, what's really interesting there is that the underlying function of each answer is not to achieve any special explanatory power -- it's clear on reflection that all of those are factors in what we call success -- but rather to discount the other perspectives.\n\nThe middle-class answer for example is not really trying to tell you about the importance of hard work, it's a self-aggrandizing reinforcement of solid middle-class values:  everyone has an equal shot, and if you don't make it then it must be your fault for not working hard enough.  The lower-class view meanwhile wants you to believe that nothing you do makes a difference and outcomes are all foreordained.  It has an unlikely ally in the upper class, which also believes in foreordained outcomes, but instead based on a vague idea of aristocratic merit.\n\nIf you look at the lives of people who have become rich and famous, they are always some combination of 4 or 5 of those factors.

Often, I spend about 2-3 hours per location on a average day. Heck, I'm working remotely right now.\n\nSome things to note. **Your mileage may vary depending on the city.**\n\n* Not all libraries are the same, especially if you're in a major city. The library I'm near has lots of open rooms to work, but almost every day, a person with too much drugs/alcohol in their system needs to be escorted out. They no longer call police because the transients have nothing to lose, and escalating it to police increases the chances of damage. BUT -- libraries still are one of my go-to places. \n* Most fast food places (McDonalds) are terrible places to work. Besides potentially lacking power outlets/, they're not exactly filled with the best kind of people. I've been to some really good McDonalds in the suburbs. but in the inner city, it can be a shitshow. I still remember the one time where a family with 6 kids, two kids couldn't stop asking me questions while another kid grabbed my mouse. \n* Something to note about Starbucks is consistency. While it can be hit-and-miss - once you find a good one, it can be your goto place for a long time. If it ever gets too rowdy, there's often another starbucks a few blocks away - and they don't care if you bring your drink from other locations. I pay $3 to spend 2-3 hours with consistent wifi and distraction-free clientle.\n* ALTERNATIVE: Look to college student centers/Community College Centers as a alternative. The handful I've been to have guest wifi, and are incredibly quiet. They're free, and they often don't check for ID. Many now require a parking lot permit.

All free of charge and we are happy to provide.\n\nSome library's even have maker spaces and 3d printers for all kinds of stuff, many of which are also 100% free to use or very cheap depending on how many or what type requests that library has to deal with.\n\nSeriously though, the more people that come in the happier the librarians are because they get to help people and it also helps us get more funds to be able to do even more for the communities around them. Some library's are one of the only places a lot of rural and poorer families and kids have available for internet or computer access, so feel free to come in, look around, get a book, audiobook, cd, movie, whatever your fancy.

I LOVED that review and made me watch the movie and enjoy it even more.\n\nVague spoilers are like foreshadowing, in a way. Similar to rollercoasters, it's good if you can see the fall coming, but you don't know when or how it's going to happen.\n\nHaving said that, what would be a good middle point? I prefer spoilers that help get you in the right state of mind to enjoy the content.\n\nSaying (spoilers for GoT when it was good) >!Ned dies at the end of the season!<, is not the same as saying \"No one is safe! There are real consequences here\" or saying, \"people you care about will die\". Even saying >!Ned will not make it!< keeps you guessing about what will be the final nail in the coffin.\n\nI think spoilers can enhance your experience and convince you to watch/read something.

            "I like this post a lot. I've recently gone into recovery (hit my first month yesterday) and I'm finding the whole socializing aspect really challenging, especially given that I'm 24 and most social gatherings are very booze-heavy. I was always the over-the-top, funny guy at social gatherings and sort of made a name for myself in this regard. Since about the age of 14 I have always used alcohol as a confidence crutch due to crippling anxiety and self-esteem issues. However, once I'd had a few drinks in me, the scales tipped completely in the opposite direction and I would become the most uninhibited person at any party, which made for some very funny moments and I became notorious for my antics. However, what people didn't see was that my drinking was becoming increasingly problematic behind the scenes and causing me a lot of misery. Now when I find myself in such situations where I have to refuse an offer of alcohol, I find it creates somewhat of an awkward atmosphere which I can't shake, leaving me feeling incredibly insecure and uneasy. I'm no longer the crazy, funny hell-raiser I once was and I feel as though I no longer have any confidence or self-worth around people my own age as I don't have my confidence crutch anymore. This would be made MUCH easier if people were more tolerant and accepting of those who don't want to drink.\n\nWhilst this post is really important for people of ALL ages and backgrounds, I feel there needs to be more awareness for the younger generations that alcoholism/alcohol abuse is prevalant amongst these age groups, too. If you invite someone to a social function, invite them because you value their company and not because they may provide a few laughs and stories. You don't need to know people's reasonings for not partaking, whilst they don't deserve the unnecessary shame and guilt of having to explain themselves.",

            "I work technical support for a carrier that will remain unnamed.\n\n**Absolutely do this or turn it into the police. Do not rely on being able to call a family member.** Let me explain.\n\nWhen we look up a phone, we do not look up a serial, we look up the IMEI. The IMEI is similar to a serial, but different in that it is what the carrier uses to identify your phone. The serial is what the manufacturer uses and while it identifies the phone, it doesn't guarantee the carrier knows it because of unlocked devices not bought through the carrier. The IMEI is guaranteed to be kept on record except of cases of IMEI mismatches. It is important that the IMEI on your phone matches to the one on record so that the carrier knows that your phone is yours and to prevent your services from stopping working.\n\nUsually what happens is someone buys a new phone and takes their sim card out from their old phone and shoves it into the new one without informing their carrier. It works fine for a bit, but there is a chance that the services your carrier gives you will just randomly stop working or be flaky. So let me stress...\n\n**IF YOU GET A NEW PHONE, INFORM YOUR CARRIER OF YOUR NEW PHONE'S IMEI**. **DO NOT PURCHASE A NEW PHONE AND TAKE YOUR OLD SIM CARD OUT AND SHOVE IT IN A NEW PHONE WITHOUT INFORMING YOUR CARRIER.**\n\nIf you don't know what carrier the lost phone belongs to, you can also take it to the local PD. Carriers are not always obvious because some phones have weird carrier tags. This happens when a phone is registered with a carrier that's in a business partnership with one of the big 3.\n\nFinally... the reason why you might want to avoid using a tip in the comments\n\n\\>Tell Siri to call mom\n\nis because when the owner calls in to the carrier to report the phone as lost/stolen, that phone number is likely to be disabled once the report is made. In addition, the sim card might end up being remotely fried \\(it is a real thing\\). In addition the phone's IMEI could also wind up on the \"black list\" \\(because it is lost/stolen\\), thus preventing the phone from connecting to carriers across the US. This is a list that *all of the carriers use and have access to*.\n\nSo keep your IMEIs updated. This is the \"real life protip\" hidden in the comments.",

            "Alright this is mostly true but it's part of a bigger picture called \"being proactive\". Hopping companies may not be the best way to increase your salary because you may not be qualified enough to warrant a promotion from \"middle\" to \"senior\" or any other climb. Sometimes, you'll get a promotion internally much easier than externally.\n\nThe key word here is \"sometimes\". Being proactive means being self-critical and self-aware of your skillset and its value in the market. If you are proactive and talk to your company about your wants and needs, sometimes they will give it to you, sometimes not. Sometimes another company will see that value and offer you a better role or a better salary.\n\nWhat does being proactive mean? Speak casually with recruiters or companies reaching out to you and say that you're not actively looking for a change but are always interested in growth opportunities. In the job market every candidate and company are both buyers and sellers. The candidate sells their ability and knowledge and buys the salary and benefits. The reverse is for the company, they sell \"salary, benefits, cool office\" in exchange for your skills. If a company is interested in your skills, and you're not interesting in selling, then they have to convince you that what they're selling is worth, well, you.\n\nBasically think of your skillset as an asset that has value in the market. Buyers (companies) can make you offers which you can accept or decline, but if you're not visible or listening, you'll never know what that value is. If you do that, you'll always know what your salary and title could be and from there you can either use that information internally or externally.\n\nFor example: I interviewed at about 4 companies and rejected their offers before finally taking a 5th. When negotiating the salary with the 5th company, they offered me a salary about 10% below the other offers. I explicitly told them: X$ is my current market value based on recent offers from other companies. I won't take a base salary offer below that amount, let's talk about the package starting from there.",

            "The number of assumptions this tip requires to be true makes it poor advice to most of the population.\n\nIt assumes firstly that you\u2019re good enough at your job that you can comfortably find employers wanting to hire you every 2 years which for many isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s also not a good look on a CV as most employers don\u2019t want to be rehiring so quickly and if your CV shows you never stay then questions will be asked about this. \n\nSecondly, it assumes that there are enough employers looking for your skill set within the area you live in or alternatively that you are willing to move every few years. Thirdly, it disregards everything about work other than money. Plenty of people have friends they enjoy working with and who make the working day much more enjoyable. If you enjoy the culture where you work how much value do you put on risking that for an unknown? \n\nFinally, staying in an existing job often brings non monetary benefits such as increased holidays, company cars and medical benefits. If you only go to work purely for money then this is probably good advice but I don\u2019t think most people are that cut throat. It\u2019s usually a combination of the salary, the people, the culture and other benefits.",

At this point, the only way I can get paid more is by taking a management position at a competing company. Im probably one of the highest paid employees in my specific department, but this company will never promote me because I'm too valuable at what I do. The thing is, management knows this.

This is a super common tactic especially in small startups to trick people into thinking they have a good job just cause it\u2019s a fun place to work, that can be an extremely valuable aspect to a lot of people but don\u2019t confuse that with your other possibly greater needs. \n\nJobs are for making money, and businesses know that so they will do everything in their power to trick you into thinking you don\u2019t need to be payed more or shouldn\u2019t look for a different job because \u201cI\u2019ll never replace this work culture\u201d.

We value trust, integrity, and honesty above all else. We have kept underperforming designers way past their expiration date in the hopes that is just a slump.\n\nWe educate our staff with mistakes, learn from them and move on. In business since 1996 and range in employment terms from original years-3 years atm. A lot of us have been there 5, 10,12 and 26 years.\n\nNot all companies are evil is all I\u2019m saying. Good companies that value people over profits (to a point) exist and work life balance is a thing.\n\nAs a sales manager if your resume shows me you bounce, I\u2019m going to pass. We hire for long term and want all of our people to succeed. \n\nPlease use caution with this advice.",
            "Eh. This only applies to entry level positions. Once you have a few years of experience and hit \"market value\", you can jump positions all you like, but your salary will stay fairly flat. \n\nOnce you get to the leadership level, a large part of your comp is actually RSUs and Options which vest over time, and staying put actually increases your take home pay.",

Grass is always greener..",
            "As someone who doesn't hop, I highly recommend hopping at least a couple times.\n\n\nFirst, rewards for existing employees are a lagging by at least a year.  Most times you are doing the job above you, putting in free OT, or already were worth more from the start and then you finally get a bump that still puts you lower than your hopping peers. New hires can get their fair market value today. \n\n\nSecond, your comp will be anchored in whatever you first made when you started. Began around entry level making around 40k then educated/side worked yourself to what should be 80k? Good luck getting anyone to double your salary. \n\n\nThird, if you sleuth or ask around about salaries openly you will find out how much lower you are getting paid for being loyal.\n\n\nThe only counter advice I have is to try to arm yourself with as much information as possible. Learn what salary bands are, other compensations packages. Talk to recruiters to see what you should be paid. Come up with what's important to you outside of a base wage/salary and figure out what it would take for you to actually leave. \n\n\nSo far I had one company act all confused and give bs and another help a little when I had a direct talk and ask for a specific number backed up by some info. Neither case rewarded as well as hopping though."

It's amazing how I get voicemails and text trails from everyone else who wants to see me, but my phone just can't seem to get HER messages.

We used to live nearby and everyday we would go and come walking from school together for like almost 4 years. We used to hang out almost every evening I guess and do stuff that children our age did at the time... play on my wii, play outside with other mutual friends, just spend time together doing random stuff and all. After 10th grade we both changed schools and he even shifted to a place which was a bit farther away! We still kept in touch as we both enrolled to an evening class where we met like 3-4 times a week. Then I went away for college and we eventually stopped talking after some time! I did ping him a few times and I guess some times even this above thought of \u201ceven he hasn\u2019t reached out to me\u201d did cross my mind... but yea we eventually lost touch.\nFast forward to a few years to December 2019, I got news that he committed suicide! And I was lost at words... that was the worst day of my life and I don\u2019t think I have ever cried for so long ever.\nBut What I learn is that when I spent time with him all those years, he too spent that time with me and invested so much in me. Yea eventually everyone gets busy with their life and makes new friends and all but the occasional \u201chey how are you\u201d doesn\u2019t harm anyone! I have made sure ever since that day to put an extra effort to always keep in touch with people whom I have known and more so during this pandemic! People are genuinely happy to talk and if they\u2019re busy it\u2019s ok. But it\u2019s ok to always be the first one to initiate too... atleast for me it is as I feel that\u2019s the least I can do!

If someone needs to reach me, they can text me or leave a message. If they don't nag me within the next 24 hours, I'll contact them after the 25th hour. The more they bother me, however, the longer I take to reply. So if they nag me to respond for three days straight, I don't contact them for 3 day *plus* 3 days + 24 hours. One day for each day they nag me. Most people get it and realize that the less they bug me, the faster I get back to them.\n\nIt is, after all, my phone.

During this time I made it clear how much I was struggling and how my breakdown manifested, being the vocal one in the friendship, and I can\u2019t remember getting any recuperation or any real support helping me from just continuing down a self destructive path. \u201cthats a shame\u201d \u201caw man\u201d \u201csorry but im not good at this, it\u2019d be better to talk to someone else\u201d (the last one I can understand, but it\u2019s still hard to hear without any follow up or compassion for a long time) and eventually just getting seenzoned or a short reply that would very neutrally dismiss the possibility for a longer convo. \n\nSo eventually i wasn\u2019t able to manage, only compounded by not having anyone to talk to and noticed myself subconsciously cutting off negative feelings to cope rather than dealing with them having the support i needed. So I stopped reaching out cuz they left me and I didn\u2019t have the energy to talk or start anything else. \n\nIn this case, I may not have reached out to them for a long time, and they didn\u2019t reach out to me. But with them knowing that I was going thru a difficult time, not having the energy to talk unless it was out of desperation and asking for help (which was evident), and them still not reaching out, I think it it\u2019s a fairly one sided case.\n\nI didn\u2019t reach out because I had for the most part been driving the relationship, when I reached out for support I didn\u2019t get it, and so I stopped. So if they feel bad about reaching out, it would be warranted, they\u2019ll remember that I also hadn\u2019t reached out, and they know why.",

            "This is an absolute gold LPT that everyone should pay attention to.\n\nI was fortunate to attend several days of training by a guy who writes executive resumes for a living. He called this your *master chronological resume* -- it has *everything* you can think of, whatever you can show in terms of initiative, leadership, org impact, contacts, etc. There is NO length limit for this, it is your overall complete record of your entire career. According to him you should expect to spend approximately **40 hours** compiling this info and building this resume from scratch, and from my own experience with a couple so far that is a pretty accurate number. (you should also keep folders of example work from previous jobs if you can, sanitized if necessary)\n\nEvery time you apply for a job just copy that master resume to a new folder for that job, edit the resume down to target that specific job, create a new cover letter (tailored from your many others) and keep it there as well along with a copy of the job posting. If your industry wants a 1 page resume then take your 5-10 pages and whittle it down to 1. If 2 pages is acceptable then do that.\n\nAt the top of the front page list a few key skills you bring to *that specific position*. If you are a shit hot welder but the job is white collar (IT, health, etc) then nobody will care, and when you list prior jobs you can just list one line for each where you worked as a welder (unless you can show specific skills/impacts from that job that apply to the new one) and go in-depth for the ones that are relevant. And vice-versa of course -- if you are a computer guy but hate it and want to get into welding you may only want to show one line for previous IT jobs, again unless you can show specific skills relevant to the welding position. (including soft skills like customer service, attention to detail, etc)\n\nI've written a resume for someone close to me where we managed to finagle years of seemingly non-relevant work in a different field along with years of home health care of a relative into applicable experience bullets for a field they had never worked in before, and the resume made it to the final round of reviews.\n\nGetting through to the hiring manager is all about how you word the resume, and having the master resume current at all times gives you tons of bullet points to draw from to \"tell the story\" of how you are the perfect fit for this particular job.",

Unless you have a degree and plan to stick to that field, you need to remember these tips:\n1: list work experience without gaps, even if you have to lie. An employer will never hire someone they think sits around and collects unemployment checks. Most employers don't cross reference employment history and education unless corporate forces them to. In most cases you can provide fake references, if needed, through skype numbers. \n2: Only list the facts of your accomplishments. No one cares about your feelings or life goals. Are you going to make my company money for more than two years? Yes or no, and how. \n3: Format depends on your audience but never add: photos, elementary school as education, more than 4 jobs or 1 page, references unless they ask, or confessions. \nYou have 6 seconds to wow your audience, make sure it looks badass. \nLastly, even though employers can't legally discriminate against disability, race, and major life choices, they will every time. Don't give them ammo until you show them how amazing you are. I've been discriminated by gay employers for having a religious background, religious employers for not being the same faith, elderly employers for not having a family, younger employers for having a family, and call centers for having a work related injury. Everyone discriminates. The minute you think they won't, you lose. And if you have to sue a company to work for them, they might not be worth it, or you might not be either.",

            "I have a retired racer and she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. So calm and tolerant. She's just happy 100% of the time without a bone in her body that would do anyone harm. It's a bit different than adopting a normal dog since they dont know how to house, stairs, or dog in general but the transition doesnt take long. They catch on quick. Also they generally come already crate trained, housebroken, and used to being manipulated by humans (think vet trips and nail trims). The only drawbacks are the thin skin already mentioned and poor teeth that need to be brushed regularly. \n\nEdit: also check out r/greyhounds for more info and cute pics!",
            "As a PSA to anybody looking to adopt one. I looked into it years ago, and something important to note is that Greyhounds have very thin skin, so if you\u2019re planning on taking one somewhere cold, make sure they have a jacket. Also, scrapes can easily break skin. ",
            "Great tip! I've had two rescued greyhounds in my life. They are wonderful dogs. Sweet, surprisingly lazy, chill, great with kids, and such great conversation starters (\"Wow! That's a pointy dog!\").\n\nCheck out [houndsavers.org](https://houndsavers.org) to find dogs in your area who are ready for rescue.\n\nEdit: a few other things to note, retired racers are lazy, but their training to run fast after small furry things is permanent. A good harness and leash are a must. So too warm clothes for winter weather, and a big couch you don't mind sharing. Hounds are too skinny to be comfortable on the floor, so a thick dog bed is a must, but just the same, they tend to prefer the couch, the bed, the overstuffed chair that smells of their fav person",
            "Also, research if you have enough couches in your house, because a greyhound will be occupying one most of the day.",
            "Definitely do your research prior. While they are still dogs, they don't understand a lot of concepts that a regular dog would. Greyhounds don't know how to do stairs, usually don't understand the concept of glass and are thin skinned so they can get cold quick or injured easily from something a normal dog wouldn't. Also, it should be noted that the dogs true personality won't come about right away. They may be timid, shy or they could be down right crazy. I currently have 2 greyhounds and our boy has pretty much been the same when we adopted him. Biggest baby I know. Our girl however, went from not really caring about anything in the house to a nutcase. She loves to play with us and her \"brother\".\n\n[Here they are](https://imgur.com/kPVcv76)",
            "My neighbor has had a retired racing Greyhound for years. He fosters some as well who were no longer fit for racing. They all have their in-ear identifiers and whatnot. \n\nI quickly realized that I severely misperceived Greyhounds. Despite their size, insane running ability and power, they are some of the sweetest, most calm, laziest dogs I've ever met. They are so incredibly chill. It's nuts. I don't understand how a dog breed with so much ability and energy can just chill all day. \n\nThe following statements are completely anecdotal. \n\nWARNING: If you do adopt a former racing Greyhound, please realize that it will take them time to learn how to be normal domestic doggos. They have known ONE thing their entire life: racing. They eat, sleep, poop, and race. Whenever my neighbors bring a new foster home, they are incredibly socially unaware and possibly awkward. They don't really know how to socialize with other dogs or people. They are really mellow though. More often than not they'll just stand around looking lost. Or, you know, go straight to sniffing your butt. No manners. Lol. \n\nAnyway, they are sweet and reaaaaaaaally chill doggos. Now one of my favorite breeds. I'd post pictures of their dogs, but then they'd know my Reddit account. ;)\n",
            "A good friend of mine had rescued greyhounds and also fostered a few, really great dogs, although many of them have injuries and other medical issues due to the breed and racing. \n\nAnecdotally I went to the park a couple of months ago only to run across a gathering of greyhound owners and their dogs. Super chill, and it took me a while to realize that despite probably 100 dogs in the same vicinity I hadn\u2019t heard a single one bark. If you were wearing blindfolds you wouldn\u2019t have known dogs were even there. ",

            "I am a HUGE fan of greyhounds. We have had two and they a remarkably sweet dogs. They don't smell, they are relatively low energy, and are cuddly and fun. They are smart animals and can be trained rather easily. The thing to watch out for with them is that some have track trauma and, depending on how they were treated, may not mix well with other animals. They are sight hounds and if they have a prey drive, watch out for small animals in your yard/house. Our greys loved cats, but some do not get along with them. Make sure you have a tall fence if you have a yard, because they can jump over smaller fences--especially if they see a critter they want to chase. I was so depressed after my grey died in April I haven't had the heart to get another dog - but maybe now is the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne other thing - because they are pure-bred, and perhaps overbred to some extent, they are prone to cancer and other degenerative diseases. Both of our greyhounds died rather young (around 7) of cancer. It is heartbreaking, but giving them a beautiful retirement after racing life is such a wonderful gift to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdopt a grey today! You won't regret it. Here is a video I shot for greysave in CA. [https://vimeo.com/177948844](https://vimeo.com/177948844)\n\nEdit: it\u2019s been pointed out that cancer is not as big of a problem with the breed as I stated.

Most other dogs need far more exercise than them.\n\nI babysit a German Shepherd/Greyhound mix. He is the Best Dog, and the only problem with him is that he is far taller than me when we both sit on the couch. So he looms over me and judges me whenever I eat a cookie and don\u2019t give him any. It makes me feel like a bad person.",
            "We owned a rescue greyhound for 10 years.  He was a 100 pound cat.  Wonderful dog and was unique in that they never clipped his ears, so he looked a lot like a Doberman.  He was great around my kids and  very loving.  He had a great sense of guilt, so training was very easy.  Our only \"difficulty\" was his toenails.  Every once in a while he would need a trim and the only way we could do it was to take him to a Vet and have him sedated.  Even sedated he would howl.  He lived to be 12 years old and was diagnosed with cancer.  We opted to put him down as Grey's are not exceptionally long lived dogs.  I like to think we gave him a good life.  My advice would be to get a coat and footies if you live in a cold climate.  Also, have a comfortable crate for them to retreat to.  My grey was raised in a crate and it was always \"his space\".    I will probably adopt again once my kids are out of college.",

            "I had a retired greyhound who lived to 14. He was a great dog. It is very important to understand the breed, so do research before getting one. Lots of plusses, but also a few things to be aware of as with any breed. Mine was a great fit for my family, and even many years later is sorely missed. Very smart, sweet and sensitive, but not without work, especially when we first got him. Mostly they've only known their kennels and the track. There is a lot about the world you'll need to patiently teach them.",

            "While getting my degree in agriculture science I had to do many veterinary technology units as part of my studies. In one of my classes we focused on pet health care and our term project as a class was to take care of a bunch of \"retired\" racetrack greyhounds and return them to good health before they were adopted out.\n\nThe dogs lived on campus and we got to spend as much time with them outside of class as we liked, because part of the project was to re-socialize them. They had gotten very little human interaction, their whole lives were just being trained to race and then racing at that point. It was so sad, these dogs were beautiful and so timidly eager to make friends with us but had been trained not to bond. \n\nFor anyone worried about their energy levels: they mostly just want to sleep, snuggle, and be lazy. They like sleeping I think around 18 hours a day, I wish I could have that life! Take them on walks like a normal dog, give them a good place like a dog park to burn off their energy in one burst once a day or every couple of days, and then let them be lazy doggos. ",

            "I hope this comment can find its way to the top.  My greyhound story at the end, but want to add the following to all of the wonderful advice already given.\n\n*If you do not have any experience with taking in and caring for a greyhound, but are interested in fostering or providing a forever home, please take the time NOW to find a local greyhound rescue group and visit them, talk with them and be around the dogs and current/former adopters to learn and prepare yourself and your home.*  \n\nThere are so many misconceptions about this breed and quite a few unique things about their nature and care that just simply don't apply to any other dog.  Many of these have already been mentioned.\n\nOne thing that is not known at this time, however (although there is plenty of speculation), is the timing for the shutdown of the tracks.  Yes, they can begin as early as the beginning of 2019 and have until the end of 2020, but as already stated, the amendment did not provide any direction as to how the shutdown needed to happen.  It is very possible that there will be periods of a large quantity of dogs needing placement of some kind within a very short period of time.  No one really knows what flexibility the tracks, kennel staff and trainers will have or what support they will provide for the dogs until they can be placed with adoption groups.  There are thousands of dogs that will be coming off the tracks in addition to those already retired and waiting for adoption.\n\nSource: Have had 3 greyhounds myself and spent countless hours and weekends volunteering and working with adoptable dogs in a track kennel setting in S Florida. My beautiful girls and boy (who was adopted as a senior dog) have all passed, but lived to 11 and almost 12 years.  The joy they brought to our lives is something I will always value and look back on with absolutely no regrets.  We plan to foster when the track shutdowns start happening.\n\nPlease feel free to PM me if you have any questions about the breed, what it's like to have one join your family, or anything at all related to this topic.  I'm more than happy to share what I know and have experienced personally.",

Never. They will bolt 2 miles away after a squirrel in about 5 seconds (seriously) and then have no idea how to find home (lousy sense of smell).

            "As someone who has had the fortune of having three greyhounds over the last 9+ years, I have to say these dogs are amazing, they're gentle giant and a lot of fun with kids.\n\nHowever, be sure to do your research and make sure you can take the responsibility of owning a greyhound. They need an open area to run around (must be physically fenced off, greyhounds are too fast for electric fence), they need proper wear for the winter, they have very short fur and thin skin. Also a lot of dogs coming off the track aren't house trained. It's a good idea to look into foster care training for greyhounds, or you can train them yourselves, which includes being housebroken, stairs, meal times, etc.\n\nMy greyhounds have been the best pets I've ever had, and while they were hard work to take care of, they were the sweetest and best part of my family.",

            "As a 5 time greyhound rescuer I cannot express how great they are. Each had their own distinct personalities more so than other dogs. We used to joke that they are part human. \n\nMost people have mentioned many of the fun and unique parts of being a greyhound owner or having a greyhound own you. \n\n45 mph couch potato, yes. \n\nCome to your house and not know how to dog? Yes\n\nStairs were very confusing for them. They are quick learners, it was a matter of a day for them to build confidence to go up and down. A week for them to do it without looking like a maniac. \n\nMany have \"bald butts\" due to the constant rubbing of the small cage they were kept in all their lives. Those few that had it of ours never grew back. \n\nTheir hair is varying. We have had some that barely she'd and one that was a shedding machine. Generally they are non shedders and hypo allergenic.\n\nThey will come with scars. As mentioned by others, their skin is very thin. One of our dogs bit another dog in the side and it tore a 6\" long gash in her side that required stitches. \n\nSome will come with healed broken legs. 2 of the 5 had previous breaks. Very common in the racing world unfortunately. One dog didn't care about his previous break, the other didn't use that leg unless he had to, but his break was sever and he had plates put in.\n\nSome dogs were treated bad in their lives. We had one who's father was a grand champion. His bloodline should have meant he too would be a winning dog, but he was a clown. He was a goody dog. As a result he was beaten. He came to us with scars and clearly previous broken ribs. He was the sweetest dog you would ever meet, but he didn't do well with other dogs. So we had to rehome him to be a lone dog. \n\nIf you do decide to adopt one, be ready for an application process. The greyhound rescue organizations are hardcore. They fiercely love these dogs and you will have to prove you have an environment that will be good for a particular dog. Our rescue we got ours from makes you sign a document that you will never give up the dog, that if you do not want the dog for whatever reason, you have to give them back. They also recommend that you only leave your dogs with other greyhound families. I used to dog sit for a friend when they would go out of town. Having 5 Greyhounds in the house meant you had to fight your way to the couch.\n\nMost don't bark, unless your big mouth lab teaches him how to. \n\nNo they don't need places to run. Yes they love to go on walks with a leash. They are sight hounds, so they can see things you can. They can see and catch a rabbit in seconds. (The one dog we had with the bad break could run fine if motivated but a small creature.)",

Older dogs can be in a lot of cases easier to bring into your house than a puppie will be, and you can help a dog that's been left behind find a loving caring home. You kill 2 birds with one stone,and later on if you want that dog to have a friend, you can get a puppie. It's far better, and easier to raise a puppie if you have experience, and the older dog will teach the puppie very important social skills that unless you know what to do the puppie will either learn too late, or not at all.",

            "Got a story about this:\n\nTL;DR: had a roommate not check the magazine of a gun he was holding, he jokingly fired it at my neighbors head, the bullet missed his head and almost hit me in another house.\n\nIn college my roommates and I used to party with our next door neighbors alot. One of my roommates had a couple of guns along with one of our neighbors. \n\nWell one hungover late morning our houses were chillen together at the neighbors house cleaning up. The conversations turned to what guns were going to be bought next which naturally turned into let me show you my gun talk. So, our neighbor goes into his room and brings out his AR-15 with the magazine in to display the gun. We all look at it and do the whole \"that's cool\" sort of talk.\n\nWell, one of my roommates asks to hold the gun. The neighbor says yes, then my roommate takes the gun and begins to \"weight it out\" by putting it to his shoulder and serving around with it. He gets really into this and fakes clearing the room we are in. I got nervous as fuck because this dude is just being a full dingus with this gun that he has no idea if there are bullets in. From there I \"noped\" out and went back to my house to have some cereal and check on my sleeping gf. \n\nThat's when I heard a gunshot and felt a bullet go whizzing by me. \n\nI freaked out, dropped to the floor, and screamed at my gf to stay in our room and get on the floor. We waited there for two minutes. After which I crawled over to our room and held my gf as we both were shaking. We waited in our room for about thirty minutes before we heard our roommates come in. \n\nIt was super strange because they were quite as hell when they came in. I poke my head out and saw them sitting on the couch with the neighbor who had shown off his rifle. I then left my gf's and my room to ask what happened along with if they heard that gunshot.\n\nThey started to laugh, uncomfortably, but then full blown laughter. I was pissed at this reaction and started to yell at them about what had happened on my end. At that they stopped laughing and told me what happened.\n\nApparently, the roommate who was \"testing the handling\" of the gun as I left was talking about trigger discipline  and gun safety when he straight up pointed the gun at one of our neighbors who was sleeping on their couch. He aimed above the dude's head by a couple inches, standing 4 feet from the guy, and pulled the trigger. The gun went off and the bullet went through the couch, their wall, our wall, and almost hit noth me and my neighbor.\n\nI am a very patient person, but at this point I couldn't contain my anger and just blew up on my roommate for doing something so stupid. He had a \"oh shit\" eyes on because of how angry I was. After I finished telling him how he could have killed people with his idiocy, he looked at me and said, \"Calm down dude, no one got hurt. But, I get you. Sorry. But legit, man, it's all good, no one got hurt.\" \n\nI couldn't believe the words I was hearing and just walked away in a fury to my gf's and my room.\n\nWe moved out about a year after this happened because we signed on the lease about a month before all this shit. \n\nI was raised around guns and always understood to respect them, but this was just full stupid behavior on every party involved. From the owner to the roommate. \n\nThat same roommate tended to \"jokingly\" be really racist. And after he left our lives he joined the army.",

My essay was based on an interaction I had with an employee due to his BO and the many co workers that came to me about his hygiene. \n\nThis particular employee was 18 and it was his first job. His parents only let him shower once a week and provided zero toiletries. Me and my other manager apprentice that was training with me went in on deodorant, shower gel, soap, foot powder, insoles and some other run of the mill bathroom stuff and gave him access to our office so he could get to it. We got him a membership to the gym across the street so he could shower daily.\n\nWe lost him as an employee for about 2 months because he \"no call, no showed\" for 3 shifts. When he finally contacted me, he told me that he was basically kidnapped by his parents because he refused to turn over his paychecks and it took him a while to escape and set up living arrangements with someone else.\n\nWe hired him back shortly after and he was promoted once before I left for somewhere else.

            "I can smell myself as soon as I start to smell even a little. I can also smell if a person has put on 'clean' clothes that have been laying on the floor (floordrobe) or piled on a chair. I can smell if you need to/are due to wash your hair as you walk past me /pass me on the escalator etc. Basically, I can smell how you live.\n\nA side note, a lot of people don't know the difference between antiperspirants and deodorants. Antiperspirants reduce your sweating. Deodorant is just a pretty smell. A lot of people also don't realise that B.O. is the smell of by-products made by bacteria that are feeding off your sweat and dead skin. Antiperspirants = less sweat = less food for the stinky bacteria living on your body.\n\nThis is another reason why you should PHYSICALLY clean all your body and not just think 'the water will get it' when in the shower. You need to scrub your feet, groin, arm pits (the whole body actually) to scrub off the dead skin cells, which again, function as sweet, sweet food for the stinky bacteria that lives on your skin.\n\nBonus round: this is also why bath towels need washing at least once a week, 'even though they're' clean.'  As you dry yourself you rub off dead skin cells that accumulate on the towel. Combine that with dampness and it's the perfect breeding ground for, you guessed it, STINKY, STINKY BACTERIA.\n\nAnd final round: some people for medical or physiological reasons will still smell even though they clean properly. In those cases a medicted soap such as Gamophen may help.",
            "Another tip: If you seen to have underarm odor that seems to remain even right after a shower, you may have an overgrown bacterial colony in your pores. To solve it, spray a little white vinegar or rubbing alcohol into you armpits after washing, but still in the shower. We got a small spray bottle at the dollar store, filled out with vinegar, and keep it near the shower. Close your eyes before spraying- you do not want this in your eyes! Let it \"soak\" for a moment, then rinse. (Do it before shaving, as it will sting if you have just shaved!) This works on many other stinky body areas as well. The vinegar or alcohol quickly kills off the excessive bacteria hiding in your pores.",
