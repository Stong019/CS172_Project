        "selftext": "G'day mate! Looks bloody awful over in America, those wildfires are right nasty. Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. \n\n\n\n1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. \n\n\nPeople here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes.\n\n\nFirefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge.\n\n\n\n\n2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with  DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS!\n\nPlease fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets,  a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat.\n\nWet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet!\n\n\n\n\n3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way.\n\n\n\n\n4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now.  Your life is worth more than stuff.\n\n\n\n5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. \n\n\nPeople on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone.  Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it.  You're going to lose your house, get out now.\n\n\n\n\n6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked.  Don't die for stuff.  Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets.\n\nStay safe America!\n\n: EDIT :\n\n\nI had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends \ud83d\udcaa and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much.\n\n: POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING :\n\nA Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be.\n\nNEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels.\n\nActually I'm a chick \u270c\ufe0f\n\nLarge bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time.\n\nNEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend. Wool is best on a budget, duvetyne is probably the best material available, 100% cotton towels will also work in a pinch. Never synthetic .\n\n: EDIT 2 :\n\nWow this really blew up. I'm fucking honoured, and I'm glad to see so many people out there really giving a shit about fire safety. \n\nAll your suggestions, feedback, and positive discussion really reignite (haha) my faith in humanity. We can all get through this if we work together \ud83d\udcaa\n\nI'm working my way through all your comments (and there really are a lot of them), and trying to answer as many questions as I can.",

            "Another firefighter here. If you're going to stay at home, quickly do a hot lap around the house and remove anything that can easily catch fire. A lot of people store things against or near the wall of their house and that's just another way to catch fire.  This can vary where you live but check the roof and rain gutter for dried leaves and clean them out. Also the ground around your house should be clear of dried leaves and dried brush. Of course, all this should be done regularly, especially if you're in a high fire hzard area.\n     \nThat's a good point about filling your tub with water, but I want to clarify... This is so you have water to use afterwards. This is absolutely not for you to jump in when your house is on fire. This would be the same as a box of pasta that jumps into the pot of water to stay cool from the fire underneath it. Same thing with a wet cloth. These are not filters to breathe through. Do not have anything wet on you when near a fire, you'll just steam yourself (including your lungs). We're in a pandemic so you should arraly have plenty of masks, just wear those.\n     \nJust as OP and others have said, if the ground is already burned, it's (most likely) not going to burn again. Run there for safety. Just be sure to check the ground for and roots underneath that may be smoldering. You can also clear out a section of bare soil to hang out in until it passes. But stay inside *if you can.*\n     \nI forgot to mention, while you're doing your hot lap, check the attic vents. Make sure they're covered so embers don't fly in there. That's an easy way for a house to catch fire.\n     \nIf you're in an absolute pickle where you have to create some sort of makeshift shelter to cover yourself, here are instructions on how we're taught to use a fire shelter. Ideally make it airtight. Lie face down with your ~~head~~ *feet* towards the fire. Lie flat to the ground and breathe the air as close to the ground as you can (you can even dig a little to go deeper). If the fire is over you, you're going to burn, but at least you have air to breathe. If you can't stand the heat, well it's only hotter outside plus there is no air to breath (fire consumes oxygen), so you'll just burn your lungs. Suffer through and the fire pass. It's really shitty, thankfully I've never had to deploy a fire shelter outside of training, but we're always told stories of learning lessons. Be safe people.\n    \nEdit: correction above",

Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it. You're going to lose your house, get out now.\n\nThis is key. A site I work with in WA (thankfully quite a ways from the fires) has an impressive fire protection system that's gravity fed. We have a diversion dam in a creek, that can deliver 2800 gallons (roughly 10,000 litres) per minute of water to a set of 26 farm sprinklers that soak the site. \n\nThe weak point is the diversion dam and the creek. Since we had a major fire in 2015, we've rebuilt the entire structure out of concrete, thinned out the forest directly above the diversion structure, and added plumbing and pumping capabilities to protect the d-dam.\n\nThe other thing I'd add to this is absolutely make sure you have a safe area to flee to. When I was in the fires in 2015, we had 80 acres of gravel; if the fire had gotten bad, we'd go and sit in that and watch our treasured community burn, but we'd be reasonably safe. At our other site, we had a 1 acre lawn that was the designated safe retreat for the hotshot crews.",

Aussie fires are low brush, move very quickly, and tend to burn through an area without developing that much energy. American fires often occur in heavily timbered areas, develop much, much higher energies and burn longer. They're usually slower, but still can move very fast.\n\nBe aware of the fuel mix around you if you are in an area of fire danger. If you're in a heavy fuels area, get out early.

Look at the lapel, turn up the flap. If it looks like it was not a cinstructed lapel, but more like a convincing turn over of the bodice\u2019s fabric, keep looking.\nAdditionally, for the lapel, see if it has pick stitching.

And I almost quit because of her a little over three years ago. In 2015\n\nI work at a window factory and my job was, and still is, to deliver glass to production and Cathy's was to oversee delivery and fourth corner. What that is is when the glass panes are put together, there is one corner that is the weakest point of the unit, so, the people there would fill tje unit with argon and put a screw in it or skip it all together.\n\nAnyway, one day i was having a particularly rough time with one of my lines bc the leqd there dragged his feet to clear it so i could not keep more than one or two carts on the line. Which had been a problem for the past couple weeks or so, with many complaints to my then supervisor. Leaving me to almost forgo my other line that i was delivering to. I also had to deliver the repair glass, which now I'm having an absolute ball with (i want to quit so badly but i habe no plan) so I do that, panic over line B bc it had been so long since i delivered to them bc of line A. Line B was ok on glass. When I got back, Cathy explodes on my saying that Line A was out of glass. I dont remeber what she said, bc I had gone into extreme panic mode. I'm pretty sure she knew about how line A liked to stockpile thier glass. I had stopped bringing out the tempered at that point, which is the first glass they're supposed to run, because I think line A's lead just kept it there until the day it was supposed to go out to the trucks. Regardless, she acted like I was still supppsed to keep then stocked despite having no room. What i do remember from.her tiraid was ther screaming to take out glass to that lone woth another guy who was kust starting out. Later things cooled down and I was SUPER close to quitting. Like I had tears and my eyes and such. I decided to work through my lunch so (if memory serves me right) to stock up my otger line)\n\n\"Go to lunch [my name]\"\n\nI barely get a word in and just start sobbing. She was apologetic and all but that didnt change the fact that she screamed at me like that when she knew the trouble i was having for a few weeks prior. \n\n\n\"I was just trying to do my job\" i say. Between sobs.\n\nAfter lunch, we had our  daily meeting to discuss the quliaty test that we used to do, but not anymore i dont think. After which i was asked to stay in the office and I think \"fuck, now my supervisor will rail into me\" \n\nNo, he just asks what had happened, and tell him about how i was having trouble with line A all day and was just taking glass out to line B as to check on them. I think I also told hin about the trouble I havr been having for the last few weeks. He reassured me that I wasn't in any trouble. \n\n\nI never knew what was said to Cathy by my supervisor. But I cant help but wonder if she would have gotten fired if i had quit.\n\nBut she did get fired right before that Christmas becuase she failed the drug test.",

            "Dude 100%.\n\nIt seems counter intuitive but wearing good quality earplugs to gigs:\n\n- allows you to hear the music much more crisply and without all the ambient noise and frequencies muddying everything up (even if you\u2019re front row). You can actually hear each individual musician.\n\n- when the gig\u2019s over, your ears don\u2019t have that \u201cheavy feeling\u201d where you can pretty much feel the blood passing through your probably swollen ear drums.\n\n- you don\u2019t get tinnitus, which sucks so hard. As mentioned in a previous comment, the frequencies that concerts destroy in your hearing (mids and highs) are the frequencies we need when we listen to and understand speech. \n\nWatching everything with subtitles is fine until you watch something _without_ subtitles.",
            "Former touring audio tech here.  Can vouch that tinnitus sucks.  What sucks even more is that I can't listen to any content containing speech without having to turn it up to an unreasonable level.  Concerts will damage your hearing at very specific frequencies.  The same frequencies we need to hear for speech to be intelligible.",
            "It sucks that young me heard this advice all the time and it was internally translated as \"I'm old and grumpy and want you to turn down that racket!\" There's gotta be a way to explain that your eardrums really never repair themselves and it's surprisingly easy to permanently damage them.",

            "Never been to a concert, but worked around aircraft for too long. Even with double hearing protection my ears are messed up.\nThe disability check is nice, but not worth the repeated \"What? I can't here you! Speak louder and enunciate please\" conversations.",
            "I recently got tinnitus using headphone too much, for gaming. It's still mild and I've learned to ignore it. If you're like me, a good rule of thumb is to set it to low to the point where you can't hear any sound from the headphone at arm's length from you. Definitely below 50% volume though.",
            "I have tinnitus but no hearing loss. I got my ears checked and for my age I have greater than average hearing. Always wore ear plugs to concerts etc.\nMy doctor/the ears, nose and throat doc basically explained it as this:\n\nIf your hearing is greater than average, your brain perceives sound and frequencies better, which in turn means it notices the loss of the higher frequencies as someone naturally ages more than the average person. So basically my brain created sound to fill in the gaps of the frequency range which is normally imperceptible in average people's hearing as they age. Quite a weird phenomena, I mention it here because it's an odd thing and I can attest that you should always use ear protection! Tinnitus sucks!",
            "I went to one concert at 14, thought it was loud yeah but thought well surely if it doesnt hurt its fine...  still have tinnitus 14 YEARS later. 3 hours = 14 years.\nIT IS SO EASY TO GET TINNITUS ITS UNBELIEVABLE",

            "After my first couple concerts where all noise hurt for a day after, I got in on the earplugs thing. Now I work in a department where hearing protection is recommended but optional. I'm the only person who wears earplugs. Nobody else can hear unless you scream at them.",
            "Just a reminder: tinnitus sucks, hearing loss sucks, but for those of us who have it, take a moment to appreciate everything else you've still got. Yeah, it's scary and depressing. But it's not getting in the way of you petting a cute cat or doggo; there are still folks in your life who love you. The world is still full of good books and movies with subtitles and there is NZSL and hearing aids for if it gets worse. And you're not alone!\n\nSo yeah: avoid it if you can, of course, but if it's too late for you, as it is me, hi. You're still a cool person. DM if you want to tell me more about all the cool stuff you've done :)",
            "I swam competitively for 12 years, setting the stage for severe ear infections throughout most of my childhood (nine sets of tubes, and two mastoidectomies). Then I decided to be a musician before landing on a career in the firearms industry. Ear pain and hearing loss impact my life on a daily basis. Most of the damage was done when I was younger, but man if I would have focused more on hearing protection I wouldn't have to spend so much of my life saying \"what?\"",
            "[deleted]",
            "No one ever tells you that you need to see a doctor immediately if you have an ear infection. Damage can be reversed in the first 30 days. If you wait a couple weeks and see a doc maybe 28 days since you started having symptoms, there is a very high chance you will be looking at permanent damage, hearing loss, and coping with symptoms the rest of your life. All could have been prevented if you went to a doctor or the CVS minute clinic first. Time is of the essence when your ears are involved.",

            "Audio engineer and avid concert goer here,\n\nIf you think earplugs will ruin your experience, your ears will adjust to the music with earplugs and you may even find earplugs improve the clarity of the audio.  \n\nAlso you will have more energy during or after the show with earplugs because hearing fatigue is a very real thing.",

            "I speak from experience here. Do this. My hearing aids are 5k per ear and only last 3-5 years. It's not fun. Hearing loss leads to mental problems, too.",
            "Tinnitus is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.  Depression, breaking my ankle, car accidents, family deaths.  None of these compare.  It\u2019s basically Chinese water torture but for the rest of your life.  I got it at 29 years old.",
            "If you\u2019re a regular concert-goer please consider investing in custom-fitted plugs as soon as possible. They\u2019re massively better than 3M foam plugs or push-in bullets. I wish I\u2019d invested in a set 20 years ago. It\u2019s still not too late.",
            "[deleted]",
            "I do sound for a living. I have tinnitus, but that's because I really love loud. \n\nLikely one concert isn't going to do any lasting damage. The problem is how loud we listen to everything else. \n\nDo you normally keep your headphones louder than a conversation?\n\nHow loud do you play your music on the drive home? Do you have to turn it down to talk to people?\n\nHow loud is your tv? Can you talk over it.\n\nHow loud is your work? Do they offer hearing protection? Should you be using it?\n\nGeneral rule of thumb, if you have to shout over it to be heard, it's too loud. If you're listening to it loud for more than 15 minutes, it's too long. \n\nBe cautious, but it's a lifetime of abuse that will give you permanent tinnitus.",

            "It really only took two concerts to damage my hearing (a bit, I don't have tinnitus) as a teenager. I either stopped going or wore earplugs since then (even if I had to improvise with wadded up toilet paper at a club).

            "!remindme 25 years ago.\n\nTo be honest I was warned about abusing my hearing back then too but I didn't listen... the irony isn't lost on me!  I put my ears through a lot - loud music in headphones, loud pubs/nightclubs and riding motorbikes without ear plugs.  If you've regularly left clubs/concerts with a dulled sense of hearing and some ringing, you are creating a lot of trouble for yourself in the future!\n\nLuckily for me, it seems that I've had some environmental component to my more recent mild/moderate hearing loss and tinnitus, because about four months into being furloughed from work last year my hearing started to improve.  Where I'd estimate hearing ability in my left ear was at about 40% and my right maybe 80%, now my left is about 80% and my right closer to 90%.

If you take a 450 degree pan and hold it with a welding glove and with an oven mitt, you'll feel the heat faster with the welding glove.  Welding gloves being able to handle higher temperatures is useless in a kitchen, because your oven doesn't cook at 2000 degrees.\n\nAlso, most often mits have sticky pads on them (silicone?)

My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.\n\nI've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.\n\nI happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip. It surprisingly saves a lot of time, hassle and effort if you don't mind working a little later. Worst case scenario most people wear a piece of clothing once and stick it in the dirty clothes basket, technically you can get away with wearing something again in an emergency. Whatever works.\n\n**EDIT!!!: I thank you all for the awards, the gesture is appreciated, however you should donate to a non profit that helps during abuse situations, or natural disaster reliefs or something of that nature.** [**Here's a list of child abuse/neglect non profits.**](https://www.childwelfare.gov/organizations/?CWIGFunctionsaction=rols:main.dspList&rolType=Custom&RS_ID=75&rList=ROL) **There's also a nice list** [**here for non profits that help out in natural disaster relief as well.**](https://www.galaxydigital.com/blog/disaster-relief-organizations/)\n\n**Please consider donating to these non profits rather than giving me an award, I thank you for the consideration, but your money can be better spent towards these organizations of your choosing.

Having some actual changes of clothes was a godsend afterwards and the time saved allowed me to nab a pair of  extra sentimental items before we has to get out. Sure I wish there'd been time to stop and calmly think about what to bring, but there simply wasn't and grabbing the hamper was the best quick decision I made while in that panic.\n\nWe actually had one family friend that was given \\~30 minutes notice. She calmly sat down to make a list of what to important things to take with her.  By the time she was finished with the list and had *started* collecting stuff to put in her car, she finally realized her neighbor's house was already on fire and hers was about to catch. She had to run with only the clothes on her back and the odds and ends in her car.

            "Very great advice. \n\nMy family grew up in the mountains surrounded by forests during a severe drought. We often had wildfires and several times we were on the verge of being evacuated. Knowing we might have to leave at any moment we kept a few things handy. Usually a bag full of clothes, our important documents (birth certificates, deeds to the house, passports, photo and video evidence of property, living wills, etc.) And the animal carriers. We knew where they were and w're prepared to grab them, load them in the car, and go at a moments notice. \n\nEven though I now live by myself in the middle of the city, I have a similar setup. I have my \"bug out bag\" filled with blankets, pillows, an air mattress, an air pump, medical supplies, device chargers, a couple pairs of clothes, and even some dried food that lasts forever (thinking of adding some masks given the pandemic and some purified water.)\nI also have a bag packed with clothes, a power strip,  toiletries and whatnot already inside and my older handheld game systems with chargers. After all, if I'm in a situation were I need to leave everything behind and go, a way to destress and relax will be essential once I'm safe. \n\nIn the event I need to go in a hurry I can just grab these two bags, shove my cats in their carrier and go. My car is prepped for emergency situations with flares and the like as well so I can survive out of my car if needed so long as I have those bags.",
            "I have one of those blue IKEA laundry bags that has been with me for close to a decade now. It was inherited from my ex-fianc\u00e9e when she kicked me out due to my alcoholism. She left it and my guitar in the hall with a post-it telling me to go.\n\nFor a while, everything I owned fit inside that blue bag. It was with me when I was living in my car and taking showers with gym memberships. It was with me when I finally got off the streets, sobered up and into an apartment. I\u2019ve had guitars stolen, mysteriously disappearing band t-shirts and pawned computers but the Blue IKEA Laundry Bag remains.\n\nIt shows no signs of wear and is still a good servant when I do laundry on the weekends. It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s still around to be an occasional reminder of when it contained all of my worldly possessions  and it reflects back how little \u201cthings\u201d matter when it comes down to it.\n\nHonestly I could put everything that doesn\u2019t fit inside of it in the dumpster and I would probably be just as happy if not happier than I am at the moment with lots of stuff. \n\nThanks, Blue IKEA Bag.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:\n\n1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.\n\nSo when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!\n\nUse the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.\n\n2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)\n\nHere\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)\n\nIf you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.\n\nIf the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or  \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.\n\nPractice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.\n\n3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.\n\n4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.\n\n5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.\n\n6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?\n\n7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?\n\n8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.\n\n9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.\n\n10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.\n\n11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.\n\n12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It\u2019s also pretty important. You\u2019ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it\u2019s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that\u2019s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it\u2019s adding, but sometimes it\u2019s subtracting). I don\u2019t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.\n\nSo what you\u2019re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it\u2019s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You\u2019re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find \u201cshort term fuel trim\u201d and \u201clong term fuel trim\u201d. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.\n\nShort term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%\n\nLong term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%\n\nLet\u2019s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You\u2019re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the \u201cbank\u201d or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one \u201cside\u201d so you\u2019ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you\u2019ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you\u2019re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn\u2019t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.\n\nWhen looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you\u2019ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let\u2019s take a look at some examples on a V8:\n\nSTFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6\n\nLTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1\n\nSo the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That\u2019s pretty good.\n\nSTFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3\n\nLTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1\n\nBank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that\u2019s good.\n\nSTFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7\n\nLTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15\n\nBank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That\u2019s not good. Walk away from this one.\n\nHere's one more that's a littlte different:\n\nSTFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20\n\nLTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20\n\nHey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.\n\nCheck these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.\n\nPractice this on a car you have access to beforehand.\n\n13. Last and not least, don\u2019t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don\u2019t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you\u2019re worried about is no big deal, it\u2019s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it\u2019s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn\u2019t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don\u2019t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.\n\nI would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents\u2019 cars, friends\u2019 cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you\u2019re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won\u2019t forget anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2 - Fixed some formatting\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards. I'm glad people found this useful. But seriously, no more awards. Save your money for gas to return all those Christmas presents you don't want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT4 - There are lots of comments and questions. I'll try to answer what I can but there are so many. I'll get back to most of you eventually. Gotta get some work done....working on a Saturday (sucks)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT5 - I'm back from the dead!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT6 - added some good info brought up in comments, expanded on a few things, laymanized it a little more, explained some technical stuff. Still can't get the STFT and LTFT examples to format the way I wanted. Best I can do\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 8 - Good night everyone. Thanks for all the awards and comments and conversations. I replied to all the PMs and chats. Tried to reply to as many comments as I could, but holy cow there were just too many. I just hope I did better than Woody Harrelson.",

            "Great post, here\u2019s my number one tip:\n\nCheck the forum of the car you want to buy: There is a car forum for everything! They\u2019ll often have stickies on what is a common problem for that model. \nExample is the Audi 2.0 has oil burning and timing chain stretch and tensioner failures. There will be specific instructions on how to check for these.",
            "This is a \u201cprotect yourself\u201d tip: If you are buying a used car from a dealer or private seller, ask to see the title. If they won\u2019t do that, ask to see a copy of the title with the previous owner info blacked out. It should be a red flag if they refuse or blackened out more than just the registered owner\u2019s information. \n\nWhy? First to make sure they actually have the title. When I was young and dumb, I was once burned by a licensed motorcycle dealer not having the title and lying about it. Although rare, some sellers don\u2019t have their ducks in a row when selling a car and will sell the car before all of their documentation is completed. This can turn out really bad for you if the seller never gets you the title or registers it to you. In my case, the dealer failed to tell me it was a consignment sale, failed to give the owner the money from the sale, which meant the owner never gave the title to the dealer. The dealer then suddenly closed his business. It lead to a large lawsuit with many involved parties.\n\nSecondly, seeing the title will potentially allow you to see how many other dealers the car passed through before yours. In most states, dealers are supposed to record a running list of dealer transfers. Seeing a dealer-to-dealer transfer isn\u2019t an automatic red flag. Dealers swap cars ALL THE TIME when a customer wants a certain car. Dealers also get inventory from auction ALL THE TIME (more on this later). What is a red flag is an incomplete log (such as not seeing your dealer logged on title\u2019s running list) or several dealer-to-dealer transfers. Several transfers is a sign that it is a lemon that keeps getting passed around. \n\nThird, check the title to make sure the title isn\u2019t \u201cbranded\u201d, such as being a salvage car, flood car, scrap car, etc. You\u2019ll also see if there is an outstanding lien. Run away and don\u2019t look back if it\u2019s a branded title unless the seller is honest about it and you know what you\u2019re getting into. Buying a branded titled car is NOT a risk that an average person should venture into. Best case scenario? The car was totaled from simple cosmetic damage such as hail damage. Average case scenario? The car was in a crash in which the damage exceeded what the car was worth. Worst case scenario? The crashed car was fixed just barely enough to look good but still has a bent frame, has missing airbags, has unknown amounts of hidden mechanical damage, has severe electrical issues, etc. \n\nBonus Info: As a dirty secret of the industry, it isn\u2019t just low cost and questionable cars that get sent to auctions in modern times. Lease returns? The dealers have zero ownership of lease returns. It\u2019s the leasing company that does. Most lease returns are sent to auction. Low mileage trade-in\u2019s? Many get sent to auction by dealers that can\u2019t easily sell the vehicle (example being a Jeep dealer that is flooded with passenger car trade-ins and wouldn\u2019t be able to sell yet another one). A dealer can\u2019t sell a normally good vehicle after a couple months for whatever dumb reason? It\u2019s sent to auction. Brand new cars when a dealership goes out of business or when they just consolidates? They\u2019re sent to auction.\n\nI think many people would be shocked that almost all dealerships heavily supplement their used car inventory from auctions, or buy from wholesalers that get them at auctions. Just assume the used car you\u2019re looking at came from an auction unless the dealer came prove otherwise. Hint: Dealers hate saying it was an auction vehicle because of the stigma and will instead simply say it was a trade-in. Don\u2019t believe it unless they prove it. They don\u2019t consider it a lie because it was likely a trade-in at another dealer, but your dealer likely got it at auction. \n\nFinal tip: NEVER, EVER BUY FROM A \u201cBUY HERE, PAY HERE\u201d DEALER. It\u2019s a 99.9% chance they are a scum dealership catering to people with no credit or people that are completely clueless to interest rates and such. For those with no credit, you\u2019re better off saving what you can and then posting a wanted ad on Craigslist for a cheap car.",
            "Really surprised to not see this mentioned yet - OP this is great information and thank you for sharing.  Some people, however, either won't have the time or the intestinal fortitude to check all of these things.  For people falling into that camp, you can find a well reviewed and reputable master mechanic to perform a pre-purchase inspection.  I had one done for my last purchase, and he checked the same things you mentioned, also found on one car some paint work I missed and the dealership didn't mention.  He provided a PDF of everything when he was done also.  He checked for sediment in the oil to help understand how well it has been maintained, and after doing this, I will do it every time I get a used car from here on out.  Here's an example of one in the Denver area, where I'm from - http://sos-inspections.com/.  He saved me some major money.  Worth every penny to me.",

            "When buying a used, older car, buy on condition and service history, not mileage. A 5 year old car with 20k miles sounds great until you realise it means loads of short journeys where the engine, lubricants, oil and coolant has never got up to temperature properly. Many of these fluids act as lubricants or get thinner when fully up to temperature allowing them to penetrate small nooks and crannies better, keeping them working properly. A 5 year old car with 100k miles might seem like something to avoid like a dose of Chlamydia but chances are if it wasn\u2019t a taxi it\u2019s done mostly freeway/motorway miles where everything is warm and working well, it\u2019s not particularly stressful on components like continuous stop/start town driving and as long as everything has been serviced and replaced on time may not be the bad decision. A correctly maintained car and engine should easily be capable of 100k miles or more.\n\nCheck for any outstanding recalls (for my Ford Focus it\u2019s Ford ETIS and I can check it online for example) and I\u2019m sure other manufacturers have their own online checkers. These recalls can be minor or major and save thousands in repairs.",

            "I'd make a small correction as someone who sold cars for about 7 years. Buying from a dealer can be a good thing. It just depends what they offer with the vehicle in the way of warranty and maintenance. I'm not in the biz anymore and have no dog in the fight here. I just want you nice people to have a better idea of what you're doing when buying a car.\n\nI worked for a dealer that actually cared about our customers. What you want to do, is go to a dealer that sells new AND used cars. Not what we call the rock chip shops. Which, are the purely used car dealers. They buy their cars cheap as possible on trades or auctions, Jack the price up, you talk them down a thousand bucks, think you won, and theyre laughing all the way to the bank with your money. You just spent 6k on a car they bought for 3k!\n\nA respectable dealer will show you the INVOICE that they purchased the vehicle for. They are a business at the end of the day and aren't selling to you at the same price. They are going to make a profit, just not as much. \n\nYou can ask the sales rep this question too. Are you guys a volume or gross profit store? Some dealers will have hundreds of run of the mill cars like your Malibus, camry, corolla, etc and ask for a small profit on a lot of vehicles. Others will carry the harder to find stuff, and go for a bigger profit in hopes you'll make a purchase based on emotion rather than logic. They don't have as many vehicles though and are usually easy to spot.\n\nOne thing I can confidently say, in all my years doing that, I never saw someone get a warranty that eventually didn't pay for itself. At least get one that covers your power train. If you're buying a used car, it's probably safe to say you're not rolling in money like Scrooge Mcduck. A good way to know what that type covers, is the transmission, and anything that gets fed oil in the vehicle system.\n\nYou can determine monthly payment pretty quickly using this little formula. For every thousand dollars that you finance, it will cost about $20 per month. If you finance $10k, you're payment will be right around $200 per month. Then, closer to $15-$19 on spectacular credit. So, if i see grandma and grandpa pull up in their 1996 Cadillac in mint condition, I can start to safely assume they have decent credit if not great, and spit out payments while we walk on the lot.\n\nDealerships are set up from the minute you pull in, to the moment you're driving off in a new whip. As a successful car sales rep, I was looking at your car as you pull in. The trade appraise is almost meaningless to the customer. The real reason we do this, at least the ones actually selling, is to get information on you to build repoir. If I see dog hair all over the seats. Guess what I'm going to say when we talk numbers? Oh, looks like my girlfriend just text me to show me this cute thing my dog just did, check it out! Oh man, their not even part of the family, they are family! My little baby... Then the customer is like, oooooooooh! I have floofer too! Bitch, I know. I told my girlfriend to text me that to sell you a car. That's why you only see the picture and not my conversation. Another one, car seats were my favorite to see. The more of them the better. Now I know what the selling points are. We gotta get you in something sage for your babies! It just so happens that I'm going to convince you safe really means, a big ass, way over priced SUV. You deserve you know? Tell me, how hard do you work and slave away for your babies? We all know it's worth it, but what have you done for yourself lately? I think you deserve to have a safe, comfortable vehicle that you can be proud to drive. You can say, this is mine, and I deserve it! Your kids deserve a safe vehicle to ride in everyday too. You can't out a price on safety or gratification, you just can't. Let's get this thing cleaned up, and get you out of here in your new car? Big ass smile from me. \n\nThe point of that is just to show you that cars sales reps, are probably the best at selling you things you don't need out of almost any other industry. The dealership is literally set up to do this. The entire process is a sham, and set up to get you to buy. BUT AND HOWEVER, don't shoot yourself in the foot by not going to a respected dealership in your area who has the car you want. Get a solid warranty on it and you'll be alright. The bigger the dealership, the more expendable money they have. The more expendable money they have, the more likely they'll help you out in a pinch. Some, definitely not all, want to do right by you so you come back again for the next car. That, and tell all of your friends how good of a job I did so go to him and no one else.\n\nI really tried to do right for people. Now, there were definitely people that treat you like shit just because you sell cars. If some of you knew how much money you can make selling cars, you'd drop out of college, and go do it. I cleared six figures my first year. It was up from that, and even got close to $225k one year. Thing is, say bye to your family. The dealership is now your home. You will spend at the minimum, 50 hours a week, and that's a short one. I got out because I was working ten to twelve hour days, six days a week, every week, and took one small five day vacation to fly to Florida for my brother's wedding. That was it for the six or seven years I did it. If you look up on glass door the average for a car sales rep. It is waaaaaaay off. The reason for this is because about 95% of people who try, fail in the first few months. This drags the average down to the mud. Look at what the top 10-20% are making because either you'll make that, or you won't be selling cars at all. You will get fired. Or, sick of the hours and lose all motivation to stay at it. It is a fucking grind, and why I don't do it anymore. Even at the top it was the most stressful job I have ever had. I eventually finished my degree and took a Monday through Friday, 9-5er. If you're young and want to make some money, read a few car sales books, put a suit and tie on, and go to your nearest dealer. It's commission. So, you'll either make them money. Or, waste your time at the dealership. If you don't start putting your chalks on the board in a few months, they'll just launch you as dead weight. You know what? It took me 3 dealerships before I found my niche and started making real money. In that industry, you must learn to persevere, never quit, and just keep going at all costs. You'll make it with that attitude, you have my word. \n\nOh, I wanted to add this to help with negotiations and forget. So, it's out of place at the end here as I'm typing on my phone and not about to do that level of editing. Anyways, stick to the BLUEBOOK PRICE!!! That goes for buying a car, and trading yours out. It doesn't matter what the sticker says!!! I promise you this. First, if they won't show you the invoice, walk the fuck away immediately! I would show the invoice, and after that deal by asking the customer what they think a fair profit was for us. 5%? 10%? Did you have a number in mind? Obviously I'm not selling under invoice unless my manager says move the unit and sell it. Here's the invoice, do whatever you want, don't go under x number, if you sell it I'll give you x commission since the profit is gone. We have to do lot upkeep, wash the cars, change the oil as per manufacturer recommendations, etc. The cars start racking up money just sitting on the lot. If they sit for a year or more, it's time to move it. I'm rambling again... \n\nHere's the trap you don't want to get stuck in. I saw so many people pass up legit amazing deals simply because we refused to negotiate on them. We were rock bottom on it to start. A lot of people don't think they got a deal unless they got us to lower price. Here's the scenario. Dealer A has a car listsd for $10k, and it books out at $9.5k. Most people would rather go to dealer B where the car is listed for $13k. Then, talk them down $2k, and buy that same car for a full thousand dollars more, all because dealer A wouldn't haggle. So, watch out for this, and stick the BLUEBOOK. It exists for a reason, use it.\n\nIf you're buying a car and need advice feel free to pm me. I still enjoy helping people make a good decision with their vehicle. It's the second biggest purchase most people will make. I really tried to not be the slime ball and get people what they wanted at a good price. I had no interest in ripping anyone off, and told the managers so when I started. I told them of I do this, I'm doing it right. I thrived on return customers and referrals. Word got out that there was actually a car salesman who was on the customers side and not just trying to make a ton of money. Well, unless you are a dick. In that case, I'm going to do what's called smash your fucking head. That's when I profit something stupid like $8k, and take home 30-40% of it. Was easy to do on dick heads with big trucks. I would just massage that ego. What, you're telling me you can't afford a $900 a month payment? I thought you were a millionaire when you pulled up! Stop lying to me, I know you have piles of money in your bank. Let's sign these papers and get you out of here and back to work at your construction company? Boom! I ALWAYS gave them multiple chances to be nicer. If they didn't, either I was making a bunch of money. Or, you won't buy it and go somewhere else. I'll just move on to the next. \n\nSeriously, pm me if you have a question. I really enjoy helping people get better deals on their cars. Saved my brother $5k on his new Subbie. Saved my buddy almost $10k on a new Toyota truck. They were trying to smash his head on the trade in. I told him to just get up and leave because he was at the wrong dealer. He did, got new numbers, haggled a bit, and saved $200 a month in car payment. I'll do it for you as well, free of charge. \n\nTldr, I sold cars for quite a few years. Pm me if you need help buying one.",

            "Here's a copy of the post (part 1) from https://snew.notabug.io/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people:\n\nI\u2019m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:\n\n1. Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. Practice using it on some cars. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. There should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS and SRS modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either.\n\nUse the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign. Walk away.\n\n1. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0\n\nHere\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng\n\nIf you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.\n\nIf the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this.\n\nPractice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.\n\n1. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.\n\n1. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.\n\n1. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Shitty Independents fall into the latter as well, but for different reasons.\n\n1. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?\n\n1. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Zip ties, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?\n\n1. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.\n\n1. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.\n\n1. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. Most cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but most. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd.\n\n1. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.",

            "The best advice is to have a car inspected by a trusted garage or service center.  You need an objective opinion on the car. It is very easy to overlook problems because you are distracted by appearance items that really don't contribute to the reliability of the car. Also very easy to be too picky and pass over a good buy. Remember an older car with higher mileage is going to have a few issues, it is up to you to decide if you can live with them or fix them.  Newer cars should have fewer issues, that's why they cost more.   Higher mileage late model cars tend to be a better buy than low mileage older cars, in my opinion. Time affects the reliability of a car just as surely as maintenance and miles.",

            "I\u2019m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I\u2019d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn\u2019t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it\u2026.ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that\u2019s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:\n\n 1. Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot, as they\u2019ll all do what you need here. Practice using it on some cars. You don\u2019t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. There should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there\u2019s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules for codes. However, it\u2019s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they\u2019re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS and SRS modules normally shouldn\u2019t have codes lingering either.\n\nUse the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven\u2019t passed, then it\u2019s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there\u2019s a problem that isn\u2019t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign. Walk away.\n\n 1. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what\u2019s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don\u2019t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You\u2019ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it\u2019s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.\n\nFor reference, here\u2019s what a normal cranking sound should be: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0\n\nHere\u2019s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It\u2019s at about :55 secs :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng\n\nIf you listen closely, you\u2019ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.\n\nIf the car you\u2019re looking at doesn\u2019t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don\u2019t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you\u2019re looking at with something like \u201cYYYY Make Model clear flood\u201d or \u201cYYYY Make Model disable fuel pump\u201d and see if there\u2019s an easy way to achieve this.\n\nPractice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.\n\n 1. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don\u2019t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you\u2019re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it\u2019s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it\u2019s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford\u2019s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That\u2019s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven\u2019t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That\u2019s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that\u2019s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That\u2019s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don\u2019t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you\u2019re SOL there.\n\n 2. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it\u2019s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.\n\n 3. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they\u2019ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It\u2019s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that\u2019s better. Indy\u2019s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that\u2019s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that\u2019s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don\u2019t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn\u2019t even need. Shitty Independents fall into the latter as well, but for different reasons.\n\n 4. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?\n\n 5. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Zip ties, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can\u2019t see?\n\n 6. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.\n\n 7. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they\u2019re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.\n\n 8. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. Most cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn\u2019t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but most. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They\u2019ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They\u2019ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you\u2019re buying a polished turd.\n\n 9. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you\u2019re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it\u2019s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you\u2019re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it\u2019s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.",

            "Will probably be burried but here is some comments on this:\n\nFor Torque, check in the sensors for \"Distance travelled since codes cleared\". It should be an high value. This data indicate when the last trouble code got cleared. It may indicate that they are hiding a problem if the value is low. If you can, check before buying. Also, check for pending and history codes. Pending are faults that need to happen many times before being active. For example (that may not be true but shhh): excessive crank time. For some reasons, it can happen from time to time, so let's say the max crank time is 5 seconds. The first time it go pending. Will be automatically cleared after 3 successfull (within specs) starts. But if it don't clear and get triggered 3 times it goes active. This mean that there is most likelly a problem.\n\nFor the crank test, if you can't get it to go in clear flood mode and just crank, open the hood fusebox, look up for the fuel pump fuse or relay, pull it out. Now you can safelly crank and it won't start.\n\nCooling fluid. Whatever the color is, it should be of a good looking color. Yellow is really yellow. Green is really green. If the color look weird, it probably mean that an inapropriate coolant has been mixed or there is some contamination. Not good.\n\nSome engine noises on some models are normal, but walk away. For example, some fuel injectors are known to be noisy. But that should be about the only noise you can hear! \n\nFor the tires, look at the threads of each tires. The wear should be even. If for example the inside of both front tires are worn out, that's most likelly an alignment issue, which may be the result of some worn out parts. It may not show up on the steering.",

If it has trouble starting or doesn\u2019t start don\u2019t touch it. \n\nFurther if you have a little magnet you can put it in places where the body line gaps are questionable (Meaning a repair was made possibly from an accident). If the magnet doesn\u2019t stick it means a repair was done or the body panel is aluminum. (You can also knock on the car with your hand of a questionable area and if the pitch changes the metal isn\u2019t consistent and a repair was made). Having a car repaired is fine but a lot of shady repairs over rust are made and cars can rust from the inside out of this without you ever knowing. \n\nOne more thing which is the most important imo is on a test drive don\u2019t be scared to give it some gas.

Use the closest intersection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shared a Lyft ride with my female friend. The Lyft driver immediately started hitting on her. When he asked who was being dropped off first, I told him she was first stop. He started berating me for scheduling a ride and having her as first stop, started yelling about why he could not drop me off first.... During his tirade he got lost and when I tried giving him directions he just yelled at me. It was not amusing, it was scary - because now this drunk/high/creepy a-hole knew her address and mine.",

            "I was just talking to some friends about this very same thing. Every single one of us had an experience or two in a ride share where we felt unsafe. I had to take a Lyft to work the other day because I didn\u2019t feel well and was running pretty late. When it came time to drop me off the driver took a wrong turn and made a joke about how he might just take me to his house instead. Then he turned around and said \u201cyou\u2019d like that wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I have friends who\u2019ve had the driver cancel the ride with them in the car, been asked out within the first minutes of a ride, been locked in a car by someone making aggressive advances, had to get out of a car in the middle of a busy road, and lots of tiny comments and moments that make you second guess putting your life into a strangers hands. I hate how cynical I\u2019ve had to become :(",
            "My girlfriend uses Uber a lot and she had a guy show up to her house with flowers and a key he found in his car that he said was hers. It was not. When he had given her the ride initially he mentioned where he lived which was an hour away. This creep drove an hour to bring her flowers and a key that was not hers. \n\nForgot to add he showed up over a week later. \n\nThis is a good tip\n\nI\u2019m surprised how many are saying this isn\u2019t creepy at all... now I wasn\u2019t in the Uber myself, but it was about a 15 min Uber ride from across town. Not only that, but it was a ride share meaning someone else was in the car. She had said there was very little conversation at all. Again I wasn\u2019t there, but I have no reason to not believe her. When he showed up at her house she said it was very uncomfortable. She did report it, this guy had no business showing up at her house. If he felt he found her key in his car he could have let Uber know. Not only that, but it could have belonged to the other person too.. I\u2019m thinking the driver has seen one too many romantic comedies or pornos to think that\u2019s acceptable.",

            "This situation is familiar to me. I got a Lyft in Chicago, solo, I had been drinking - but I wasn't drunk. My Lyft driver was extremely inappropriate with me. He told me he wanted to go somewhere and \"be with me.\" I told him I was married, in hindsight, he didn't give a fuck about that. \n\nI was so anxious that he would take me somewhere unfamiliar and away from the busier main streets in the city that I asked him to stop. I lied and said I was feeling sick. He stopped, I got out and ran into a  CVS. I knew I was only about a half mile from my hotel. I waited inside until I saw him pull away, he sat and waited there for at least 7 minutes. \n\nIt was a very scary situation. I felt that I was in serious immediate danger. I refuse to use those services alone anymore and I never use my home address.",
            "I live in a giant apartment building in a city now, but when I was living in a more suburban neighborhood, I often had Lyft drivers ask me \u201cis this your home?\u201d I found myself usually lying and saying something along the lines of \u201cno, visiting a friend,\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s house,\u201d because the truth was I lived alone and no one needed to know that.\n\nEdit: Because I have been accused of \u201cfear mongering\u201d (lol), this is the question I often get when I get *in* the car. Not when I\u2019m getting dropped off.",
            "I do wonder this every time I'm taking a Lyft or Uber to the airport.\n\nIt's perfectly natural for a driver to be like \"So, where you headed? How long you there for?\" in normal conversation. Even without saying anything, they can see the size of your luggage.\n\nMay as well be asking \"So, nobody's home this week, right? Mind if I tip off my friend so they can pop by and steal all your stuff?\"\n\nI have a make believe roommate I like to bring up in conversation. He's an MMA fighter and has a lot of guns and anger management problems.",
            "I agree with this tip for home safety.  My wife and I take lots of short weekend trips and it always kinda freaks me out when the driver picks us up and we have suitcases.  I think it gives the impression that no one will be home...so a great target for a burglary.   Got lucky the last time--lyft driver was a retired cop and we had mutual friends.  I try to use a neighbors address, or have friends take us to the airport or port. Wife considers this a mild paranoia on my part.\n\nI also second guess valet parking because a car usually has some mail in it or a registration...and that has an addy on it.\n\nSorry for going on a tangent...stay safe yall.",
            "As an Uber driver when I get close I always try to keep it in the passengers hand and ask where they would like to be dropped off. I know it\u2019s probably nerve wracking enough driving with random people so I try to give all my passengers full control of the situation so they are comfortable and I can just do my job.",
            "I had some houseguests staying with me for a few months a year or so back.  Having wrecked their car on an icy road, the were using Lyft to get around until they could save up for a new car.\n\nWell, one day, their Lyft driver's girlfriend broke up with him via text while he was bringing them to the house.  He then used our guests as impromptu therapists and unloaded all of his issues on them, crying for the whole trip to the house.\n\nThem being polite and uncomfortable, they just went with it.  When they got to the house, he continued to talk to them, and they were awkward enough that they couldn't get away.\n\nFinally, he mentions that he has to pee, so he just WHIPS HIS FUCKING DICK OUT AND PISSED RIGHT THERE IN MY DRIVEWAY.\n\nWhen I first saw the wet spot, I figured it was air-conditioning runoff or something.  Nope.  Piss.\n\nThey called and filed a complaint and he was deactivated.\n\nI mean, I feel bad for the dude - his girl left him AND he got fired in the same day, but you don't whip your damn dick out and piss in front of your customers, what the fuck, man?",
            "Oh damn I didn\u2019t even think of that. As a female who Ubers alone a lot I really thank you for bringing this up",
            "While I was using lyft I would put in my real address because I live inside a gated park and always had them drop me off outside the gate. I has a key for the pedestrian gate, so I would walk in, close behind me and their car would still be outside. Still was not a great idea on my part... I ended up getting a driver that I think was actually harmless and was just new to the app, but he came off so sooo creepy. \n\nHe was worried he wouldn't get paid if he didn't go up to the exact dropoff spot. Wouldn't listen to me when I said he would. I was patient at first and tried to explain he could end the ride, everything would still work. He didn't care. He then got upset with me and kept trying to argue when I told him I wasn't opening the gate for him. I told him NO, that wasn't happening and then simply \"I'm not doing that\" when he asked why. He then unbuckled his seat beat and started like he was getting out of the car while telling me \"Then I'm walking inside with you!\" \n\nI am not great at standing up for myself and I'm honestly pretty meek, but I was tired from my 10 hour shift of physical labor and I was so done with this dude. Again I told him No, and when he whined \"I'm not going to get paid because of you!\" I finally snapped at him \"Well we'll just see then won't we?!\" And left. \n\nI felt so terrible, but also so so mad.\n\nI'm really lucky he was just clueless and not someone with bad intentions.",
            "Oh my gosh this is so smart. I had a horrible experience with an Uber driver. He started asking me questions about whether I lived alone, had a boyfriend etc. I answered honestly no single, live alone. So dumb. It was a long car ride 45 minutes so he started hitting on me and asking me out. I told him I\u2019d think about it. And when we got closer to my friends house he\u2019s like \u201cdid you decide?\u201d I just said no. This was a few years ago but it\u2019s still so chilling to think about.",
            "Prosecutor here that specializes is prosecuting sexual offences.\n\nNever get in the front seat of an uber. (This is common here in Australia) unless you have other friends with you and the back seat is full. If one of you have to sit in the front, if there is a guy in the group, ask him to.\nTake a photograph of your driver on your smart phone, and make sure they see you doing it. If questioned tell them you are sending it to your dad/husband so they know who is driving you home.\n\nDon't get into an uber by yourself when you are very drunk. If you know you will be travelling home alone, don't drink so much that you'll pass out on the way home.\n\nIf they offer to walk you to the door say no sorry, if a stranger comes to the door my dogs go crazy and will try and attack you. \n\nPeople seldom commit sexual offences against people that they think will report it. These are some ways you can deter would be offenders.\n\nUnfortunately ride share drivers form a massive percentage of the sexual offences I deal with.\n\nCheck out if there are alternative female driver ride shares in your area.\n\nHave your home address set a few doors from your actual house.\n\n\nEdit: also do the obvious things like check the licence plate and photo match the description the app has given you. This won't work for everyone, do what you feel comfortable with. Travel with a friend where possible.",
            "I'm a relatively private person with my information, so I've always set \"home\" on all my maps at a nearby business. If I ever lose my phone, computer, etc, or my vehicle gets stolen; my home address is the 7-11 three-four blocks away. Maybe it's a dumb idea, idk. I've just always done that.",
            "Omfg these comments gave me the chills.\nAs a 20ish male living with a big family, I never had to think about these things.",
            "I always greeted my Uber passengers with \u201cYou have a good day/evening\u201d after I dropped them off. I would always ask how their day or night was going and judged by their response if I should carry on a conversation. There are subtle cues that will let you know like silence after a question, to shut up and just drive, maybe put the radio a little louder. Never ever ever ask personal questions and never engage in politics. I always talked sports or movies or food ! I would hate to feel nervous or uneasy riding in a strangers car so I make sure my riders feel ok.",
            "Lyft is the biggest piece of shit when it comes to service and drivers. One driver committed fraud on my card for $340 for a $37 ride. Took me one month to get someone to take care of it. 2 agents and a supervisor fed me with lies that my money would be refunded. Kept calling almost everyday until one actual responsible employee made sure I actually got the refund. Bless that guy. Deleted Lyft, never using again.",
            "When I travel I use the local bar as a pick up spot so the driver doesn't have my address. He sees the suitcase and that I am going to the airport, so he would know the house is empty for at least the night.  Don't want to give a stranger the ability to case the joint.",
            "Another reddit post a while ago described how someone used a ride-sharing service to get to work every day. He gave an address down the block from his house, and walked half a block to catch the ride every day, worrying that the driver would know he was gone and come back and rob his house.\n\nOne driver did come back, and robbed the neighbor's house.\n\nGenerally I'd change the advice to \"stop using Lyft/Uber as far as possible\".",
            "I had this girl tell me she was in town apartment hunting. I remember thinking things like \u201chuh that\u2019s weird, I wonder how she got into town? And she didn\u2019t rent a car?\u201d After the trip, I realized it\u2019s probably something she says to random drivers.",

            "Guy I had called me really hateful names - yelled til he was spitting mad and threatened to dump me out if the car late at night in a really dodgy and dark location simply because I asked if he was the ride I was waiting for. You know, the simple human exchange of verifying names. A habit as a woman and from past regular cab experiences when drivers try to pick up wrong ride. .... My friends ride was worse. Her driver tried to drive down side streets not on route and when she challenged him, he stopped, she got out and he got out, forcefully 'hugging' her, rubbing his boner on her, and when she got away and ran blocks toward home he chased her for a second, yelling her name after her.",
            "Yes!! Myself and a close friend have both had VERY scary fucked up experiences with Lyft drivers and the first realization when this happens is now this guy knows where you live. I bought a stun gun and now am just risking late night bus stops home. This risk feels safer than what I and she went through. Don't feel safe in a car anymore with a stranger/driver.",
            "I was in an uber once around 3am, very intoxicated as in trying not to throw up and probably slouching quite a bit. Driver kept asking me if I had a boyfriend. Or what a cute girl like me was out late without her boyfriend. I said I had one. I felt really uncomfortable and nervous at this point. Then, when he was pulling up he asked me if I lived alone. I said \"yeah\" not thinking, because I was drunk and exhausted, but then I changed my answer to \"well kind of not\" and I got out of the car as soon as it stopped, ran down the drive way and locked the door. Once I did, I realized that was a dumb way to answer. Nothing happened, but I always think about how nasty that could have turned.",

            "I always get cabs to drop me off near my house, but close enough (usually a two min walk). If any of them.ask if I'm single/where I live etc. I find just asking them outright why they want to know makes it awkward enough to stop them in their tracks",
            "I (22m) got a great story about why I stopped giving my address. About a year ago, when I was in college, I took an Uber pool home from North Philly to West Philly which was around a 20-minute ride. We stopped at a bar to pick up another passenger, and the Uber driver is shouting her name into a HUGE group of people waiting for rides. Out of the entire group, one girl falls off the curb and completely eats shit. Yes, this was the girl we were picking up. Her less drunk friend decides to sit in the passenger seat and leave the hammered girl next to me.\n\nThroughout the ride, I can feel the girl next to me staring at me, looking at my phone (even laughed at a meme I scrolled past on Instagram). I keep looking out my window and keep to myself. Then she starts tapping my shoulder, and when I look at her, she turns away and giggles trying to be cute. After the 2nd tap, I told her \"please stop touching me\". She disregarded and I ignored her for my own safety and went from touching my shoulder to groping it, my neck, face, head. I kept telling her to please keep her hands to herself and she was not able to comprehend. Turns out she lived pretty close to me, she went to a neighboring school. Once we were 2 blocks away from my house I asked the uber driver, \"Hey, can you please drop me off here and I'll walk the rest of the way? I do not want this girl knowing where I live as she has been touching me after I told her not to several times\". The drunk girl is shocked, calls me a fucking piece of shit asshole then blames her friend for seating her next to a guy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoy, if the roles were reversed on this one I would've spent the night in jail.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: ITT- horny guys who are blown away that a man would not want a drunk stranger touching them",
            "Great advice! Also if you feel unsafe in a situation especially like Uber or Lyft but not at the point where you should call 911, Noonlight app is really helpful - you press the button on the phone until you get safe, then you enter the password, if you let go of the button and don\u2019t enter the password, cops will be called to your GPS location. \n\nThe app costs a few dollars a month and can be life saving, you could even use it to verbally ward off a potential attacker.",
            "I'm so happy this tip was mentioned. I was in a situation years ago where i needed to uber/lyft to and from work everyday and learned quickly to lie about where I lived and change my pickup/dropoff to a few houses down. I had a few drivers follow me into my work repeatedly, force their phone number on me, and ask inappropriate questions such as if I was married, how many people I lived with and what their work schedule was like. It was like walking into a red flag store.",

FOUR MONTHS LATER I find a note in my mailbox with his name and phone number (and a creepy winky face). Had to google him to figure out who it was then was freaked out this guy seemingly saved my address and came back later.",
            "Damn, being a woman seems scary. The only thing I really worry about when I take an Uber is wether he'll try to make small talk while I am thinking about embarassing moments from the past.",
            "Agreed. Was ubering home drunk, with a male driver. He kept  trying to chat, but I'm a very quiet rider.  \n\nHe then asked,\n\n\n\"Are you headed home for the night?\"\n\n\nRed flag\n\nI immediately replied \n\n\n\"No, headed to my friends place then headed back out.\" \n\nDid NOT want him to know where I lived and wanted him to feel that someone was expecting me asap.

I was SHOCKED and bolted out of the car.\n\nI reported it, yadda yadda, but was terrified of him knowing my address. He was fired. What if he came after me for retribution? What if he had kids? What if that was his only job? \n\nI lived many long months in terror when leaving/returning to my apt. I never used Uber again.\n\nI mulled over the damage I could do by going public with this. This is when Uber and Lyft touted themselves as \"getting rides from your friends\". I'm not really sure why I didn't.*\n\nSince then I walk down the block and call from there. I really hardly use Lyft at all anymore though. Why trust an absolute stranger with your life? You don't know anything about these drivers and I've been in some other questionable scenarios. One involving a male passenger almost launching into the backseat to assault me because I told the driver a shortcut. Neither the driver nor other male passenger said a THING. Thanks. \n\n*I just remembered why: Uber repeatedly asked me if he touched me anywhere. They asked several times if he touched my breast. He did not. I bailed out of thar car like a rocket. I found out that it is not considered assault unless they touched you there (or on private parts). WTF?!",
            "As a male Lyft driver in his late 20's, I almost always give the rider peace and quiet. I keep a neutral radio channel on spotify and let the rider lead the way of conversation.

            "A couple of years ago I got an Uber in Switzerland. The law over there is that you have to have a taxi license to be able to drive for Uber. When I got into this guys car he immediately sounded seedy. Soon after the police pulled him over, they spoke in German and he showed some papers and we were off. He said that he only had a bus drivers license but the police \u201cdidn\u2019t mind\u201d. I watched him driving on the satnav and he was purposefully not following the satnav adding on a lot of extra time to my journey. I was alone in the car and terrified because I\u2019d had a few drinks with friends and was on my own when getting home in the taxi. Eventually, he pulls into an empty car park near my old appt and stops the car and goes to turn round. Before I knew what I was doing I hurled myself out of the car and ran as fast as I could away. I left my purse in the car but it was worth it if it had potentially saved my life. Unfortunately I also put my address in and sometimes I felt like he would come back to get me, it was awful. He got reported to Uber and my trip got refunded thankfully but always be careful, especially when under the influence.",

I made a point to talk about how we were leaving the dogs behind with a sitter. \n\nWe live in a secluded cabin in the woods and I got so much anxiety while we were gone that someone might break in.

Kept driving fast enough in circles where I couldn\u2019t get out. He refused to let me out until I called his phone with mine. I didn\u2019t think at the time to call the cops. I was so terrified I just wanted to get out as soon as possible. I told uber immediately after I got inside and they refunded my ride. That\u2019s it.

All my caution would be pointless if a neighbour of mine started using my address every time they took a ride share. \n\nIf you need to give a location, give the nearest bus stop. There is a bus stop nearby in almost every town. Then tell your driver that you're connecting with a bus there to save money, or tell them a roommate is picking you up at that bus stop or something. \n\nPlease don't offset all your paranoid concerns onto unsuspecting neighbours.",
            "Also, when you approach a lyft/uber, before you put any body part in the car ask loudly and clearly for your name. If they cant tell you your name they are not your driver.

They could not pick up within the city limits without it. So that went out the window with Uber and Lyft.\n\nThe other thing I can tell you is that if you are concerned with privacy, you are always able to pick up a block or two away from your original location, and drop off a block or two away from your actual destination. Contrary to popular belief, taking a taxi is a great way to get around with no record of your travels. Most cab companies don't keep detailed records anyway. Uber and Lyft however know and keep everything, so don't use them as a get-away car.",

            "This is the truth.  I remember my first job, when I became the senior engineer at a company after about 10 months.   It was one of many big red flags.\n\nother humorous ones: half the company had a paycheck bounce.   my boss told me to take a 1 week paid vacation so I could dodge a subpoena that would be harmful to him.  got a thank-you gift for pulling an all-nighter - an expired calendar and a shattered desk lamp.   oh, and a parting red flag - I got an urgent tech support request from one of our remote offices ONE YEAR after quitting.  I told the guy I couldn't help him because I'd quit a year ago, and he said \"goddammit, nobody tells me anything\".",
            "When I started at my current job, about seven years ago, person who had been there the shortest time was a lady who had been there for almost five years. I was so surprised.

            "I got hired as a regional sales manager for a new division of a VERY large company. I had nowhere to go but up. Compensation was 85% salary, 15% commission.\n\nSo I first got everything rolling smoothly at all of our current accounts. They were all carrying my product line, and sales were growing steadily.\n\nThen I started looking for new outlets for my products, and started finding them. Then I started selling to a couple of regional chains just before they went national. They went from 25 outlets to 500. My commission boomed.\n\nAt the same time, I was looking at neglected product lines in other divisions and got HQ to shift their responsibilities to my division. That gave us more to sell, but also more opportunities for commission.\n\nMy commissions exploded! Instead of being 15% of my compensation, year after year my commission was more like 50%. So each year they would take my total compensation (salary+commission) and make my next year's salary 85% of that number. Then I would go out and do 50% commission again. Within a few years, I was making far more than any other regional manager in my division, and even more than senior managers in larger divisions. Great, right?\n\nWrong. Some bean counter got to wondering why some Midwestern regional manager was making so much money, and recommended that I be fired, and my territory given to a guy who made far less. I was too successful to keep.\n\nSix months later, one of my old clients called me up and opened the conversation by asking \"Hey Gronkie, were they paying you $500,000 per year?\" Of course not, I told him. Well, that was how much his company was down in business. He hadn't seen a sales rep since I left, to say nothing of a sales manager. Not a phone call, not an email. He hadn't placed a single order, and they were now on pace to be down more than a million bucks over the previous year. It was okay, he got similar product from a competitor. He just wanted me to know that firing me had cost the company at least a million bucks, and that was only one client. He assumed it was the same with all of my other clients as well.\n\nAll because some accountant didn't bother to look into commissions vs salary. The more money I made, the more money the company made, but accountants don't think like that.\n\nSince then, I have started my own business, and occasionally I have an accountant try to give me business advice, and I always tell them \"Accountants count the money. Just keep counting and leave the creative business strategy to me.\"",
            "My situation. But what can you do? Jobs doesn\u2019t hang on trees at the moment.",
            "It MAY be a red flag, but not always. I\u2019m on a team where all but one person is new (less than a year). The team recognized some strategic changes had to be made to keep up with how our role has changed - we need data analytics/tech skills and deeper industry background/strategic insight. Unfortunately 4 members were unwilling to reskill/learn things like Tableau or pursue (company paid) certificate programs or contend with our new, broader scope. So they parted ways and I think it\u2019s for the best for both parties. We now have an innovative team ready to level up, half of which came from other internal areas. So a new group of coworkers could also be a sign that a recent transformation was made and big, exciting things could be in store.",
            "What good would that do? Like don't get me wrong I ask it (mostly as a conversation breaker) but you've signed a contract, started the job finding out people leave often isn't going to help much more other than make you regret your choice and potentially have a negative affect on a job you might have been feeling good about.\n\nAgain, it's not bad to ask it, but don't read to much into it. Imo this is better to try and find out before you get the job.",
            "When I\u2019m interviewing for a new job one of my questions is always, \u201cHow did this position become available?\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s always so telling. Is the company growing? Did someone retire? If they stutter or stall it may mean someone was fired. It always opens up a little conversation.",
            "I would also be asking questions about how they mentor and provide advancement opportunities for new employees. Worked at a place where middle/upper management were all 10/15/20+ year lifers - you were waiting for someone to retire or die in order to move up since no new positions were being created. \n\nIf the high turnover is only for new hires, that can be its own red flag.",
            "Find out before you start the job! I always ask in interviews how long my interviewers have been there, and why the position is open. If it\u2019s a new position it can mean the company\u2019s growing, and if you\u2019re replacing someone you should ask why they didn\u2019t work out.",
            "Don't wait until you start. Ask during the interview. It's better to know ahead of time, and it gives a potential employer an opportunity to explain why turnover is so high (and more importantly, what they're doing to address it).",
            "\"They are always looking to hire new people\" is a red flag, also.",
            "Some potential false flags with this. My company has a very high turnover rate with new staff, yet we have people that have been around 10, 20, even 30 years.\n\nThe problem is my office is very resistant to change. The old guard never, ever wants to change to anything. So what happens is we get new staff come in and get hands on our products, and they are usually like \"WTF is this done in such an archaic and inefficient way?\". We've literally had people (myself included) make offers to make enhancements or improvements and get shot down. You mean this will save me 20min per product, reduce errors, and make it easier to complete? Nah, I'm good. Then those people typically just quit.\n\nAs far as why I'm still there, my field is extremely hard to get into. Even if I were to find a job, it would 99% likely involve another move across at least a couple of states, and I've done that twice already in the past 5-6 years. My life is in a good spot right now where I'm able to put away 20% of my paycheck into retirement savings while still living a lifestyle I enjoy. Plus, my field is in a pretty volatile market; my friend landed a job back when our old office got bought out, and I opted to stay with the company and move. Seemed like a sweet deal and a smart decision on his part, until that entire office got nuked a few months back, whereas I'm still employed. Zero guarantees that the job you take will be around in 1-2 years.",
            "Could someone clarify to me why?",
            "Be cautious though about judging the company. When I was starting my current job it seemed everyone in my position was relatively new and I assumed that people must leave because it sucks, it wasn\u2019t too long after that my company loves to promote within and a lot of people, especially the long timers, have been promoted to higher positions.",
            "This pro tip confirmed to me that I made the right choice in career to retire with. \n\nI'm only 23 but I found a job with an amazing work environment & benefits and the much older employees (50+) started there at my age and are still going strong!",
            "Wish I read this six months ago. A second LPT, don't work for a boss who's younger than 30. Holy fuck.",
            "Ah. Unless they put you in a lock-in period.",
            "Sooo when interviewing for a new job would be a better title",
            "I did this, but ended up stuck in a position for 2 years due to relocation, and I could not afford to pay it back. It was a newish company (3 years old), but 90% of the staff, including management, were 6 months or less. They got a lot of people stuck with relocation packages and sign on bonuses. When that 2 year requirement was up, everyone started leaving. I did.",
            "Opportunities are often hidden in challenges. While it may appear to be a not so good place to work, it may also be the best fit for you to make impactful changes.",
            "Absolutely true! Additionally, the number of employees who have been working in the same position for 10+ years with no movement (vertically or laterally) could serve as another red flag.",
            "Meh. Or they all get catapulted to bigger and better things. Investment banking analysts are never around for more than 2-3 years, but that\u2019s because they move on to private equity where the real money is. But you have to be a slave in banking to get headhunters to give you looks for PE. Gotta know the industry dynamics going in.",
            "On the other hand, if everyone has been there a very long time they might get cliquey and not welcoming to new people and their way of working, esp if you're new to the field and everyone there is very experienced.",
            "Is there a sub similar to relationship advice, but for professional work environments?",
            "When I started my current job 4 years ago, it was really reassuring to find out there were multiple people there with like 5+ years experience. Today, the majority of our staff has been there for at least 2 years and we've got a few people coming up on a decade. Very chill place to work.",
            "My last job had a very high turnover. In the year I was there our district manager changed 3 times. Due to these changes no one in my hiring group got their 90 day raise after probation. We argued for 6 months to get them. I was job hunting the whole time. Finally found a job in my field and left after about 11 months there. My coworkers at my new job spend lunch talking about their retirement plans and one guys in my department has been there 19 years. Totally different atmosphere, it's amazing."

Earplugs generally provide better protection than ear muffs, and when they're inserted correctly you can barely hear a bloody thing, and can't have a conversation without yelling. If that's not your experience, you're probably not using them right.\n\nAnd the threshold for hearing damage is below the threshold of pain.

I could barely get over it in my pickup truck, so there\u2019s no way grandma could get in the driveway in her Buick. \n\nI shoveled all the snow, then I chipped any ice on the driveway with an ice breaker (flat, straight, wide blade with a long handle), and got started on the ice dam. I tried various shovels and my ice breaker, but no luck. So I got out a pickaxe and took a few soft swings. The ice was breaking nicely! I winded up a good swing and paused thinking about safety glasses... I set the pickaxe down and ran back to the garage to don my eye protection. Ran back out, picked up my pickaxe, winded up a good swing, brought it down into a thick hunk of ice, and a thumb-sized chunk of ice hits me right in the lens of my safety glasses.

I told him how cool his pen was and out of nowhere he insisted I take it. He wouldn't take no for an answer so I finally caved. I found out later through my parents' neighbor (who wasn't even there at the time!) that he was upset I took the pen! I ended up giving it back the next time he came over and it led to a HUGE falling out between him and my dad.

I found if I instantly accepted it, some folks labeled me as greedy or were at least put off that I didn't play along with the \"are you sure\" back and forth several times.\n\nNow it is like: step 1) initial offer/gift to me, step 2) me asking if they are sure, step 3) they insist/re-offer, and step 4) accepting while thanking them in a genuine way. This is for everything from accepting unexpected gifts (ie; ones given outside expected reasons such as birthdays, holidays, weddings, baby showers, etc), giving money, offering to cover a meal, giving up a seat, allowing me to go first ir in a certain order, and just anything where the other is giving/allowing something to/for me. \n\nThat whole 50 million back and forth 'just to make sure' is way overkill and stupid.

I felt like people were giving me pity or they thought I needed the help and it made me feel shameful for whatever reason, or 2. I felt like I was being greedy or taking advantage of them (even though THEY were the ones who offered it). I realized that it was my own insecurity that led me to believe these thoughts.\n\nWhat helped me to overcome these feelings was/is to think of the way that I feel when I offer something to someone and they accept it. I truly don't think anything of it at all. It's not a big deal. Just a small gesture that I'm happy to offer. If they accept... alright. If not... hey, they must not want it. No big deal. No judgment on my part... no assumptions. But when someone does accept, I get that small dopamine hit of being helpful/generous/kind to someone.\n\nSo... if I feel that way when I offer something to someone, more than likely they probably have a similar attitude when they're offering something to me. And if it's no big deal either way, then go ahead and accept and make that person feel good.\n\nI really hope this doesn't come across as sounding braggy or self-righteous or anything... it really isn't meant to be like that.

I let it slide and chalked it up to a mistake. Now fast forward to now and he had to have a testicle removed (not life threatening afaik) and is also getting married. We still talked etc like normal up until I found out that he invited everyone in our friend group to his wedding besides me. \n\nI asked who all was going to the wedding and he straight up lied to me and told me it was just family. I thought for a while if it was even worth it to bring up and it was pretty hurtful so I just said, \u201cI guess my invite got lost in the mail huh? I already know everyone\u2019s going.. \u2018just family\u2019 lol.\u201d He completely flipped the fuck out. I assume it was because he felt guilty because it was a shitty thing to do, but the first thing he said was \u201cYou are coming at me like this when I have cancer?!\u201d And then proceeded to completely blow up and used his cancer as some sort of reason for being a shitty friend. \n\nAfter that I was completely okay with not having any of those people in my life. \n\nThat\u2019s absolutely twisted to use such a serious disease to play the victim. He said something like, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask, \u2018How\u2019s the cancer?\u2019 instead of that? You are a bad friend for not asking me how I am and that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t invited.\u201d \n\nFunny thing is I also had the exact same issue with a cancer scare like he did recently. And not only that but also lost my wife. Like life had absolutely sucked lately, but he was so fucking selfish all he could think about was himself and justifying being a terrible human being. I didn\u2019t even bring any of it up.. I just asked him to stop texting me and moved on with my life. \n\nIt\u2019s not worth wasting any extra energy on shitty people, period.

I can't sleep if it's over 68 degrees at night, especially in the winter, I'm from New England and by January, I've got that thick winter blood and anything over 60 degrees is brutally hot\n\nMany hotels will limit the minimum temp to 65 on the box, but they'll also put a +5 degree variance, meaning that the AC won't turn back on until the actual room temp hits 70. I've stayed st multiple AirBnB's in Florida that set the minimum AC temp at 72 because \"no one needs it to be cooler than 72 degrees inside when it's 100 degrees outside\".  One condo in Orlando had the minimum temperature locked at 75, had a motion detector that shut it off if no motion was detected for 20 minutes and demanded you manually shut the AC off if you left the condo for the day. I had to get creative with that one, hand warmers plus a bunch of balloons tied to a few pennies for ballast, the convection currents moved the balloons around the room all night when sleeping keeping the AC on, and the hand warmer tricked the thermostat into believing that it was 90 degrees in the room.\n\nThe only times this won't work is if they program the thermostat to ignore input and disable AC at night (this is a real thing people and hotels do), or if the thermostat in the room is a decoy and they're actually controlling HVAC remotely (also a new thing we're seeing). \n\nSeriously, if I'm paying between $300 and $1200 a night for a hotel room, townhouse, apartment or entire home, I expect you to let me at least keep the room I'm sleeping in at 65 degrees or less.

Anyway, we met at a historic ice cream parlor and ordered ice cream. As we were taking and had our ice cream served. In the back of my mind I always wanted to food spoon someone lol. So I just did. I scoop some ice cream and spoon fed him. I guess that really broke the ice because his reaction to it was soo funny and we laughed about it. We walked around the park and really shared random stories about our lives. See we clicked, I strived to be myself on past dates and in the past dates that never really happened. We didn\u2019t click so instantly and that\u2019s what help me realize there was something more. (Years later my partner told me that act alone is what prompted him date me further. I asked why and he said he loved holding hands and being sentimental. That act showed I was a sentimental person.) We decided to further date and we haven\u2019t been dating anyone else since. We do have our ups and downs but we are both a team. We are open enough to talk about our strengths and weaknesses. We are both working to build each other up and we still feel on the same page.

            "Disclaimer, this is a great tip provided you and your friends and family always stay close to the place you grew up in, but is terrible advice if you moved. I moved to a different country for work around two years ago and all my uni mates are spread across the continent too. Facebook makes life SO much easy, between the amount of people that I hadn't contacted in a while but was able to meet up with because we happened to be in the same city at the same time, and those that were able to reach out to organise a holiday I'd have lost contact with most everyone if it hadn't been for Facebook providing a means.\n\nThat's obviously not to say that it's for everybody, I get I'm more the outlier here than a case study, but for my demographic it really is by a long, long way the easiest and best way to keep contact up.",
            "Or you can just unfriend/follow people that aren't actually part of your life.

            "Facebook is kinda nice for events. I haven't found a better way to discover cool events going on around me other than Facebook. Concerts, festivals, markets, whatever else. And to quickly share them with friends to see if they want to go with you.\nI don't like Facebook either but there are some really useful things about it. You can unfollow all your friends so you don't see updates and don't get sucked in but deleting Facebook isn't for everyone.",

            "(copy and paste of one of my previous comments on this subject)\n\nI'll say the same thing I usually say about Facebook: \n\nIgnoring privacy issues (which is rampant on other things besides Facebook) and you use Facebook the \"right\" way, it's fine. Some tips I've come up with:\n\n1) Unfriend or hide people you don't care about or who are toxic. This is easy peasy. Quite caring about \"collecting\" friends or what your 5th grade crush you haven't seen or talked to since is doing.\n\n2) Follow things you care about. Brands? Gaming groups? Hiking groups? Microbreweries? Bands? Restaurants? Kids' playgroups? Car enthusiast groups? Whatever...make your news feed useful and yours and not a bunch of random crap from people you knew in high school that only post memes you saw on Reddit 4 days ago. In other words, you wouldn't subscribe to a bunch of subreddits on Reddit that you don't care about, so why would you follow a bunch of people/things on Facebook that you don't? It's like using your primary email to sign up for everything then complaining about the amount of SPAM you get. Don't do it.\n\n3) Or just ignore the news feed entirely and use the useful features:\n\n- Marketplace is pretty decent\n\n- Messenger works fine for conversations and sending money (in my findings more people have that than know how to use Google or Apple Pay or Venmo....at least with friends/family, etc)\n\n- Use the Events to find things to do around you (this obviously works better when you're not in quarantine). I've added my Facebook calendar to Google calendar and it's jammed with events I'm interested in going to. It's nice just to look and see 10 things going on this weekend that I might want to go to.\n\n- Use the Events to plan events, like a birthday/Halloween/Christmas/St Patty's Day/New Years party. Or just a get-together. It's a lot easier than email or anything else I've found, and is actually pretty decent\n\n- Create private groups. Like I have one just for our family and extended family to stay in touch. My wife and I have one just to post little quirky love notes to each other to.\n\n- live feeds can be great. I love when a local band I have followed starts broadcasting live (quarantine has been a great time for garage performances). Bernie Sanders broadcasts live quite a bit as well if you're into him. It's nice to get a notification they're live so I can tune in.\n\nFacebook can be okay if you tailor it to yourself (and again, ignoring privacy concerns). So many people just friend anyone and everyone (like it's some big accomplishment to have hundreds of friends) then complain about their news feed. I have mine culled down to 50 people (and about 10 of those I've unfollowed because I want to spare Aunt Karen's feelings but really don't want to see her crap). Then I basically do a quick yearly review to see if there's people in there I haven't talked to or just really don't care about anymore.\n\nFacebook's a tool like anything else. Learn to use it correctly.",
            "Unplug the internet. Your family and friends and those that you are close with, will still keep in touch and you can watch movies, play games and get the news in other media.\n\nYeah, it's that simple.

            "I had a level 10 fart once that cost me 4 grand. I was at home making dinner when a tight painful cramp developed in my abdoman. Within a few minutes I was on the ground sweaty, fetal position, grunting and groaning. My roommate took me to the ER. Doctors ran scans and tests. Couldnt see or find any source of the pain. Im begging for death while they discuss exploratory surgery. They think maybe something ruptured. The doctors left to prep for surgery. Twenty minutes later, nurse by my side. I felt a bjg gurgling and shifting in my guts. Followed by the loudest longest fart I had ever had, heard or thought possible. It was the biggest wave of relief I had ever felt. A warm chill surged through my body and fell limp and relaxed. They held me over night. They determined the slight discoloration in my GI track from CT scans, they suspected was a rupture. Was a massive gas bubble. Thats my 10 on the pain scale 4,000 dollar fart story.",
            "On the top end of the pain scale, if a 10 means death is a superior option, then I\u2019d say my kidney stone experience was a solid 9. I wasn\u2019t suicidal, but that 9 \u201cworst pain of my life\u201d just kept escalating, and the only thing on my mind was drugs, drugs, drugs. When I got that IV, I didn\u2019t feel \u201chigh\u201d but incredibly thankful that the pain went away.",
            "I had the opposite problem. I walked in with kidney stones and kept trying to downplay it because a close family member kept saying I was over reacting. I kept saying like 5, and the nurses were like \"mmmm  you've been lying on the floor of the emergency room crying. You're sure it's a 5??\"\nThey can tell how bad it is. Don't downplay it, don't be dramatic. Think about it, be honest, let them know if its getting better or worse.",
            "Yea I had a kidney stone. I told them 10, and they were like \"yep\" it was very obvious. They did an ultrasound and also found my testicle had gone up into my abdomen. They said the pain was so intense my body basically sucked it up there. They shot me with pain killers after some tests to make sure I didn't need surgery, and the relief was the most intense feeling of relief I've ever felt.",
            "The kidney stones comment at the end is great.\nI developed extremely large kidney stones a week after having a baby. When they asked for my pain rating, I said 8/10. My husband told them \"Just for reference, when she was in labor she never said a number higher than 5.\"\n10/10 would not want kidney stones again.\n\nEdit: Adding more details here that I mentioned in comments below. After I went to the hospital for the kidney stones after having my baby, I actually ended up hospitalized with sepsis for a week because they were so large that they caused an infection to spread very quickly.  In hindsight, definitely was actually a 10/10 pain for me, because I literally felt like I was dying (and probably would have if they hadn't rushed me into surgery immediately).\nI've had other kidney stones and they always have unbelievable pain, but those ones took the cake.",
            "The only time I ever said 10 was when I had kidney stones. Yeah they're no joke. I would take labor pains over kidney stones.",
            "Last surgery I had, the nurses asked my pain level and I said 3 at worst (kind of annoying). But then I went home and the painkillers wore off, and I discovered I had gas bubbles in my right shoulder as a side effect of the procedure. Turned the wrong way, and I felt the pain rocket from my shoulder up my neck and blow off the top of my head. I could barely move or breathe or think until it subsided. I rated that an 8.5.\n\nI figure if I ever get hit with a 10, I won't be conscious for long.",

            "In February of 2020 I threw my back out. I had never experience so much pain in my life. I was 10/10 in pain. I shuffled into the ER after getting stuck trying to get out the car.  Nothing touched my pain in the ER no meds. \n\nI work healthcare too. But I never truly understood 10/10 pain until I experienced it for myself.  Ever since then I have a much more sympathetic understanding of when I see my patients in pain. \n\nI don\u2019t think you can really understand a patients level of pain unless you\u2019ve experienced it yourself. And everyone has different pain thresholds. I have a generally high level of pain but this back pain was just on a completely different level.",
            "On the other side of this though, when someone says 10 don't just brush it off. My mom got her knee replaced and was saying 7-8, then on one check in she said 10 and the nurse got a smart ass attitude about \"I guess we need to race you to the emergency room\" and similar shit. Normally I would just shut up and sit in the corner of the room when the nurses would come in, but this time I got tired of holding my tongue. I informed her that the person laying on the bed is the same person that when to work through multiple kidney stones and knees that sounded like a bag a gravel and she had been in tears for the past hour. \n/rant",

            "Kidney stones fucking suck. I rated mine at an 8 in the ER and felt bad about it, like I was exaggerating. Later I learned that most people rate it higher, I have a friend who\u2019s mom is bedbound due to some chronic issue where she just nonstop produced kidney stones, and my grandma told me she\u2019d rather give birth than have another kidney stone, so that was really validating and made me realize that I wasn\u2019t just being a big baby. \n\nI now use it as my metric for what \u201cthe worst pain I\u2019ve ever felt\u201d is. Though I still won\u2019t consider it a 10, probably a 9 in hindsight, it definitely provides me with a reference point I didn\u2019t previously have.",
            "Totally agree with this, but I seem to run into the problem of underrating my pain and not getting the relief I need.  I try to use the scale as intended, where 10 is being curled up in a ball wishing I was as dead.  \n\nSo, when I say my pain is a 6/10, I'm really hurting.

They were asking me really important stuff and I was a first time mum obviously I'm going to give my absolute all to answer the questions.

If you really are in pain and the staff doesn't believe you, ask for another nurse or doctor. Have your support person help advocate for you.",
            "I tried to tell a doctor and my parents about my abdominal pain when I was 17, I was practically ignored for years or told I was exaggerating about it. My pain was a 7-8/10, pain meds did nothing, I had hot flashes, couldn\u2019t breathe, felt like I needed to vomit but if I did it made the pain worse, had to sit with my knees to my chest or lie in the fetal position for it to even help a little. It would keep me awake for hours a few times a year, every year, just shaking in pain and crying. Still no one believed me. At age 26 I finally broke down and went to an ER after my husband convinced me to during a bad night with it and was told I had gallstones at the ER. (That in itself was a sort of comical find because of how the ER dr told us.) After surgery I talked to my surgeon, I had a gallbladder full of gallstones, one was the size of a GOLFBALL. That one, I was told, had been with me for years to have been that size. They had to widen an incision to get it out and to remove the gallbladder. I wish someone had taken me seriously years earlier.",

            "I went to an ER once due to excruciating chest pain, which I was referred to from an urgent care. A friend dropped me off because I had shitty insurance, so I walked in and tried my best to maintain my composure and talked to the receptionist. They rushed me into a room to do an EKG and kept yelling at me to 'breath normally', but larger breaths caused even more pain. After a few minutes they got the results and saw that I was not having a heart attack, and they basically shrugged and told me to go wait for the doctor. Barely able to speak, I expressed that I was in extreme pain and I would like to see a doctor as soon as possible. There appeared to be 20 people ahead of me in the waiting room, all of which seemed to be calmly reading magazines. My leg kept wanting to writhe out due to pain. I was legitimately terrified. All I could do was intently stare at the floor and try to think of nothing. Sweat was running down my face. After \\~30 minutes (felt like hours) I asked a nurse if someone could help because the pain was getting worse, and she said it would probably \"only\" be another 45 minutes. Another dozen or so minutes passed and it was worse. I felt like I might vomit, or maybe from the other end. No garbage cans in sight, but I remembered seeing a sink in that room I was in earlier, so I attempted to run over to that room and that same nurse I talked to earlier was standing in it, and as she started to say \"I TOLD you it would be another fort-\" I vomited a large volume of neon green liquid all over the floor and partly into the sink. Without missing a beat the nurse said \"The doctor will see you now\". Turned out I had a pretty severe bile duct blockage due to gallstones. Someone later apologized to me, because apparently that hospital had a lot of people come into the ER making similar claims in an attempt to get opiates, and my \"calm\" demeanor did not help.\n\nTL;DR: Can confirm, did not have good nurses; they could not tell how much pain I was in.",

I'd have licked their shoes if they asked for the relief it all gave but I certainly felt like a junkie. They certainly made me feel like one with how they talked to me after I got the meds.",
            "As someone with chronic pain, fuck the 1-10 pain scale. It's good as OP describes in an emergency situation to gauge how bad is it in the moment and is it getting worse and situation that needs to be dealt with asap (but also as a reminder that shock is a total thing and may prevent someone from recognizing their pain at first, or may have a high tolerance of pain anyways).\n\nToo many times in a sit-down consultation environment have I been asked where I'm at for pain, and my pain tolerance has gotten to the point I'll walk off a shoulder dislocation (subluxed too many times) and I'd rate it a 5-6 max, but my heart episode that brings me to my knees a solid 10. But whereas my heart episode might last 20 seconds to a few minutes, it goes away and I'm fine (pain-wise) and will just need rest, whereas my subluxed shoulder is affecting my nerves and may affect my mobility/ ability to cook/ clean and other essential self-sufficient things. \n\nSo the pain scale when it comes to other uses sucks, and if you're in a similar situation of being consulted for a long-term, health thing, redirect/ rephrase their question and explain *how* your pain affects your daily needs and ability to do things. (I like to rephrase it as: x and y incapacitates me and I cannot make or get food, severely affects my mood, cannot focus on simple tasks, etc. // a and b affects my ability to make food, go for walks, etc.)  Also reminder again that chronic pain people have high tolerances for pain and have been conditioned to minimize their pain, so still, take the pain scale with a grain of salt and pay attention to what and how the pain is being explained and externally may show (sweating, glazed look, hunched over, shaking, flushed, etc.)",
            "I always have a hard time answering this.  If it is painful enough I can\u2019t sleep more than an hour after icing it I usually give it a 4.  \n\nIf I am sleeping fine but am uncomfortable when awake I give it a 2.  \n\nIf a kidney stone is making life Intermittently miserable and causing severe nausea, give that a six.  \n\nMigraine also a 6.  \n\nFigure pain can always get a lot worse than I have had.

Finally went to the doctor who asked me to rate my pain from 1-10. Well it was the duration of the pain , but it just didn\u2019t compare to the time I hit my big toe with a ten pound sledgehammer on a full swing. So I guess about a 4.",

Internal bleeding between layers of my duodenum, blocking my intestines. Stomach over doubled in size due to acid buildup, free blood in my abdomen, and a baseball size hematoma. I got sent home, no scan, nothing. Had to come back twice within the next day before they took me seriously, did a CT, and admitted me. Even then the floor nurse the first night refused to ask the doctor for pain meds, and then the doctor refused to give me IV meds. Because y'know, oral meds do so well with a patient who has a blocked duodenum and is throwing up liters of acid and bile per hour. \n\nI've learned that if I want taken seriously I have to tell them the level I'm at *and* tell them I am not looking for pain meds, just for a diagnosis and treatment.",

I\u2019ve never had that happen before. So I suffered until I could get into my chiropractor and had to go daily for a whole week before I could walk.

            "When I've been a 10+ I was screaming, throwing things, throwing up blood, etc... they definitely didn't need to ask me. Expedited me into a CT and then asap into surgery. \n\nI've been into the ER a dozen times, but I've only truly felt pain like that twice. Both times no one needs to be told, it's pretty damn apparent.\n\nEdit: I had a condition called intussusception - which caused a severe bowel obstruction. My small bowel was fully blocked and balloon several times its normal size, on the verge of eruption. Surgery was to remove a polyp that was causing the obstruction and any bowel that died. I've had to have that surgery 3 times unfortunately. \n\nI have a super rare genetic condition that causes the polyp growth, so this shouldn't be a concern for most!",

That's when it's good to ask questions and offer encouragement to keep talking. Another time is when someone is talking about something uncomfortable and you can tell it took them a bit of effort to get it out.

            "One of the few LPTs on here I disagree with. There are 2 main ways people show empathy when someone shares something difficult: (1) by just listening to show priority to the other persons speech, or (2) by sharing something relatable, to show they understand what you are going through. To people who naturally do (1), (2) seems to detract from the person in need. But to people who naturally do (2), they will find (1) to seem shallow and impersonal. Neither is better than the other inherently. However (2) is more common amongst neurodiverse people, which many reckon is the reason its widely considered the inferior one. If someone responds in a way that makes you uncomfortable, the best thing to do is tell them that you'd rather they just listen. But I'm tired of seeing people act like (2) makes you a bad or selfish person. Because its just 2 different kinds of people and the best thing to do is just voice your expectations and discomforts, rather than make assumptions.

There are 2 main ways people show empathy when someone shares something difficult: (1) by just listening to show priority to the other persons speech, or (2) by sharing something relatable, to show they understand what you are going through. To people who naturally do (1), (2) seems to detract from the person in need. But to people who naturally do (2), they will find (1) to seem shallow and impersonal. Neither is better than the other inherently. However (2) is more common amongst neurodiverse people, which many reckon is the reason its widely considered the inferior one. If someone responds in a way that makes you uncomfortable, the best thing to do is tell them that you'd rather they just listen. But I'm tired of seeing people act like (2) makes you a bad or selfish person. Because its just 2 different kinds of people and the best thing to do is just voice your expectations and discomforts, rather than make assumptions. It goes both ways, people who naturally share responses might feel let down if you just quietly listen.",
            "Yea... not everyone believes a related story is trying one up someone, when in fact the other person is just using conversation and stories to keep the conversation going. People who are very self centered tend to be the people who think someone is trying to one up them. Just relax and enjoy the stories together. It also tends to be people who have to be the star of the show. They think if the conversation moves to another person for a brief period, they feel slighted.",

If you think alot when you are trying to sleep, or move alot, the brain knows you're are not asleep. \nIt took some time before it worked good for me, its easy to drift off when you do this, but just keep doing it and it will work for some of you.

She\u2019s half Pyrenees and half Catahoula leopard dog, and though she is trainable, I see a distinct lack of a drive to please *me* and far more of a drive to do whatever she thinks she should do. When I call out a command, you can see her think about it, weigh the options, and then make her choice- it\u2019s very obvious that she believes her obedience to be optional. When it comes to recall, she\u2019s near impossible- a Pyrenees trait, apparently, since they were bred to wander the fields with sheep, and essentially use their own judgement. \n\n\n\nI adore her, but I also know that if I ever get another dog, it\u2019ll probably be a golden retriever or something similarly easy to train. It makes me laugh, though, when people assume she\u2019s a lab, because it would be so much easier if she was \ud83d\ude02"

It is so nice to have those little windows into the way they lived.",
            "I got my first digital camera nearly 20 years ago.  Christmas 2000.  I was 16 years old at the time.  I carried everywhere I went and took pictures of my every day life.  I even carried it in my pocket and took it to school every day.  The few regrets I have are that I did not take more pictures and that I did not use the highest resolution, which even for back then was only maybe 1.2 MP.  But even then, looking back on those photos is great.  And the every day photos that were meaningless at the time are some of my favorites.  Pictures of my old house, the garage that was full of junk, my old pets, my bedroom as a teenager, my friends screwing around.   The next September, I dropped my camera in the river and it was toast.  I was really bothered by that.  I thought my digital camera days were over.  But within a few weeks I managed to buy a better one.  Gear is replaceable.    \n\n\nI was vigilant about keeping everything backed up.  Usually keeping it on my computer and zip drives.  When I got an external hard drive, I kept the photos on that as well.  Now I have my archive backed up on multiple hard drives, the old stuff is kept away on CDs or DVDs, the cloud.  It would be extremely unlikely that an accident would destroy all of it.    \n\n\nWhen you are young everything feels fairly permanent.  Even though your life constantly changing things around you feel the same.   But as you get older things change a lot.  Little things when you were a kid will disappear.  Down the street from my house there was this corner store that was owned by an Asian family.  It was always a staple of my life.  After school we would walk there and get candy.  The store was mostly super junky with old merchandise, they likely made all of their money from selling candy to kids, and then cigarettes and alcohol to people in the neighborhood.  I never bought any sort of groceries there.  It was always just an iconic thing to see, it has always been there.   I remember walking across the street one day back in early 2004.  I had my camera with me.  For whatever reason I decided to stop and take pictures of it.  It had a bike parked on the steps, the owner was outside getting some air and their white van was parked in by the side of the building.  Just as I have seen in thousands of times throughout my life.  A few years later it would be torn down.   We still have it in our memories, but memories fade, and now about 13 or 14 years later people have to think about it to remember it.  But seeing that photo takes people back.   I would make a point to take a lot of photos just every day life in town, a lot of the buildings would be torn down.   Its hard to imagine, once they get replaced and life goes back to normal its hard to remember what was there years prior.    \n\n\nIn early 2004 my brother started hanging out with this girl at science club at our college.  I have a picture of them as some dorky teenagers.  Most of the time it would have been a no big deal picture.  But he has now been married to that woman for over 15 years and they have a 13 year old son together.   I was taking a family photo not realizing it would be a family photo.    \n\n\nThere are also just a lot of quirky things as well.  Like I remember my grandmother had an old 80s wood panel TV.  The kind that sat right on the floor.  Then in the 90s she got a new TV.   The new TV sat on top of the old TV.  I took a picture of this thinking it was funny, but it was seriously part of growing up in the 90s that you will not see in any home today.    \n\n\nAs the years go by, it is the small stuff that really tell a big picture.",

            "This is such good advice! All the photos from my childhood and teenage years are on film, so if I photographed it, I would get a print of it whether I wanted it or not. I'm glad for that now, it's so nice to see random photos of my brother on the couch or my dad lighting a fire or even my Christmas gifts from 1997. Triggers so many everyday memories.\n\nI feel similarly about non-photo stuff. Going through old newspaper clippings, my husband and I were discussing how the articles and photos on the other side of the paper were even more interesting than the content we'd saved the clippings for. The stuff on the back was always long forgotten and very 'time capsule'. Makes me wish I still had my old cassettes of music taped off the radio back before I could afford to buy tapes and CDs. It would be so interesting to listen to the snippets of local 90s radio that would have been captured along with the beginnings and endings of songs.",

            "When our kids were 18 months old we sold a lounge suite to an older couple. They came to pick it up and commented on how adorable the kids were, etc. They told us to make sure we captured video of them, as photos only do so much to evoke memories. So we blew the dust off an old mini-dv camera we had, and started filming just random moments with our kids. Occasionally big events like birthdays, but mostly just them being them.  \n\n\nThey just turned 8 the other day and i still film random parts of their lives. Out the back playing with eachother, or singing to themselves, readying on the lounge, etc. I have gone back and watched those videos  so many times already. We have around 30 tapes now. I'm slowly converting them to digital. It was the best thing we ever did.  \n\n\nSo any new parents out there, go get a cheap camera if you dont have one and start filming. Don't use your phone, it's not the same with hundreds of seperate videos. 1 hour or 90 minute videos of random memories of your kids all filmed continuously makes for an amazing  friday night movie night  :)",

This (1) allows you to share food easier, (2) makes the date feel less like an interview, (3) makes the conversation flow easier, (4) adds the bonus of people watching, (5) adds a little element of fun norm-breaking as you\u2019ll get people looking your way thinking \u201cwhy aren\u2019t they sitting across from one another\u201d, and (6) allows for playful physical contact if wanted, i.e. gentle nudge to get your date\u2019s attention to point out something funny across the restaurant\n\nSimply put, try to avoid situations where sitting directly across a table from somebody 1v1.

            "\nThis is copy pasta from advice for a tornado I made.  \n\nI posted this in another tornado thread so here's a little copy/pasta for those that would like some info on how to prep and weather a tornado strike should it occur.  This is by no means completely comprehensive and I encourage others to add on.  Perhaps it would be worthwhile making a sticky or side link for those that are new to the area and tornadoes.  \n\nETA: To answer OP either location will work.  I have both my stairs closet and half bath right across from each other.  When the tornado hit my house the half bath was best for space for all the pets. \n\n>I have first hand experience with this one. [The tornadoes that ran through Sunnyvale, Garland, and Rowlett Dec 26th](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2015/12/26/seven-confirmed-dead-in-storms-in-garland-and-copeville-50000-without-power-across-north-texas) a few years ago forced a relocation for 6 months while the rebuild of my house occurred.  \n\n1. **Safe Space** - Find the part of the dwelling that is most secure, central, and away from windows is usually advised.  Have a family plan for who is responsible for what steps in getting everyone, to include pets, into the secure area.  Practice your plan.  \n\n2. **Insurance**  -- Homeowners if you own (cover the entire value of your house, even if it's paid off), renters if you rent, automobile and any other riders or special insurance for any other property of value where you reside.  Keep your insurance provider's number in your phone and make it the first call you make after ensuring everyone's safety and health.   Make sure you pick a good, reputable insurance company, this will make all the difference in moving forward.  I had USAA and it was, by far, one of the best in terms of response and moving through the rebuilding and restoration process.  Also, be prepared for there to be hiccups.  Inventory your home with pictures and values assigned to each item.  This will go along way to getting compensated for losses. Also, try to keep your deductible in savings.  I know this is not always possible but it is so important when dealing with insurance.  \n\n3. **Disaster Recovery** -- Items include: comprehensive first aid kit, flashlights, batteries of all flavors, candles, lighters and matches, generator with backup gasoline or propane, non-perishable food and potable water stored in a tornado proofed area or shelter device, blankets and tarps, food and carriers for pets, extra phone chargers. Keep all your important documents and small valuables either in a safety deposit box or a tornado/fireproof container.\n\n4. **Bug Out Bags** Make each family member and pets a bug out bag.  Essentially what each person would require should you have to relocate for a few days while insurance measures kick in.  \n\n5. **Neighbors** -- Get to know your neighbors.  Y'all will be in this together.  Watch each others backs when you can, there will be looters that try to come into the area and take advantage of the disaster.   \n\nIt's important to note that insurance agencies, FEMA, Red Cross, and other entities will begin to setup shop around affected neighborhoods and start working with individuals to help where insurance can't.  \n\nResource links:\nhttps://planforawesome.com/72-hour-emergency-kit-for-beginners-printable-schedule/",

            "Worked in a UK public library for 9 years, till about 3 years ago. We had very few actual librarians even though we had around 15 branches including the main city one. There was a children's librarian, and some of the higher up managers were librarians but no longer did anything actually to do with books, just managing staff. 99% of us were just assistants, with skills in customer service but no formal library training. \n\n\n We were very badly paid and had to deal with all the anti social behaviour and be jack-of-all-trades. One minute we'd be doing kids storytime and singing, the next minute we'd be calling the police because someone was dealing drugs in the toilets, then clearing tables in the caf\u00e9, then teaching a computer lesson, then cataloguing books in the back, then tracing someone's family tree, helping with their planning permission application or shelving books. There was no specialising in one area, you had to do literally everything.\n\n\nBut of course most people who came through the door thought we were actual librarians, with training, and expected us to do / know things we simply couldn't, due to  how massively understaffed and underfunded our library was at all times. We did our best. But we had to manage people's expectations too, as people thought you could literally sit with them helping them at the pc for an hour when you were the only person on that floor of the city centre library that day. \n\n\nAll in all, please do be kind to your library staff. I can't speak for other countries but in the UK, if you are speaking to a member of staff in a library, they likely are not a librarian, are rushed off their feet, and have been shouted at numerous times that day, for pitiful pay.",

            "So, one year for Christmas, my grandma asks me what I'd like. I tell her, \"actually, I'd love a scarf.\" To which she replies, \"ok, that's it?\" And I go, \"well, can you make it 15 feet long?\" She paused, then shook her head side-to-side and walked away. A few weeks go by, and my dad is all, \"you better wear that scarf. Your grandmother is at it every time I stop over!\" Christmas finally comes, and I'll be dammed if she did have a 15-foot-long, navy scarf. I was super excited as it was long enough to wrap around my neck twice and still just about touch the ground. In college, I would roll it up and use it as a pillow inbetween classes. I could wrap a few friends in it and walk to class together on cold days. The practical uses were great. This was all back in 2003. It's my favorite garment. Literally hanging in the corner of my room since the weather is getting colder. I get asked where I got it all the time. One-of-a-kind Grandma line.\n\nFigured this would just get buried in the comments, but I felt it was relevant.. thanks for reading.\n\nTop comment edit: Since everyone seems to love my grandma now, here's another anecdote about the scarf: after a pretty bad breakup with a long-term girlfriend, I thought I'd left the scarf at her place after getting all my stuff out. I was devastated to say the least. Without me saying anything, my sister had let mention I thought I'd lost it and my grandma went right back to work. So, about 8 years after making me the first one, she bangs out this second one no-questions-asked. I ended up actually finding the scarf later, but still. She's 93 now and still cooking Sunday Italian dinner. I know this thread is about scarves and what\u2010not but, thought it was a funny story to add. Cheers.",

One day, I decided to crochet her a little poncho while we hung out. Not too long after, the parents reconciled and the family moved away.\n\nFast forward a decade-ish and I\u2019m at a wedding reception and run in to the parents. The Mom told me how the little girl loved that poncho so much that she wore it until she couldn\u2019t fit her head through the hole anymore - then she put it on her favorite teddy bear.\n\nI asked the parents to take a pic of the poncho on the sly so I could remember the color. I made that young lady a new poncho exactly like the old one so she can wear it again.\n\nIt amazes me how something small I made over the course of an afternoon touched someone\u2019s life for years afterward. You never know how a small kindness can turn in to something big for someone else.\n\nUpdate: Thx so much for all the nice comments and awards! I hope you\u2019re all safe and well.",

I have lost a shit ton of irreplaceable handmade items over the years, and it made me feel really sad, like I\u2019d *extra*-lost the person who made the thing. So I came up with the Shamu Method.\n\nWhat I do is designate a new thing to replace the lost thing. It has to be as like as possible (although if the lost thing had an annoying flaw, I don\u2019t reproduce the flaw), and if I can, I make it myself. If I can\u2019t, I try to find someone else to make it specially. \n\nI do have an amazing ability to lie to myself, which is a help with successfully Shamu-ing an item, but I also think you just have to have a backup plan sometimes, because life doesn\u2019t always work out to be stable or linear, and things get lost. When my dad died, for example, a lot of stuff that had been handed down to me was still stored at his house, and his executor said I had to buy it all back if I wanted it. I was younger, and bereaved, and had no proof the stuff was mine, and at the time I wasn\u2019t assertive enough to fight it or confident enough to navigate getting a lawyer.

But the moral of the story is: \n1. Only order what you're comfortable paying for \n2.

It resolves stock, availability, waiting time, let's you see the ingredients, etc. it lets you order it NOW or after you're done with your starter.  The whole table can order whatever they want, whenever they want, as individuals.  Hungry?  Order a starter while everyone else is still choosing.  Late?  Catch up by having whatever John had.  Special requirements?  Ask the cook direct and put a note on your order.\n\nYou can pay individually.  You can pay in couples.  You can pay as a table.  You can pay as a split.  You can pay immediately.  You can pay after the meal.  You could have had someone pay for you all in advance.  You could have had your company pay the first \u00a310 off each individual's bill and then everything else is on them.\n\nThe closest I've ever seen is McDonald's kiosks, and that's hardly what I'd call a restaurant.\n\nIt's 2020.  I should be able to walk into a restaurant, pick up a tablet, tap what I want just like a shopping cart online.  Press buy and then tap my card on it.  And everyone at the table can do the same.  Imagine how much easier that would make kids-choosing-their-meal.  Even paying for it.  Dad has the card and pays for the bills on tablet 4, 5, and 6.  Done.\n\nHell, literally tap \"I'm vegan\", and only the vegan options show up, just like filtering by type on Amazon.  Hit \"sort by price\" because I'm short this week.  And so on.\n\nIf I was a millionaire tomorrow, I would literally set this up, even at a loss -  because restaurants and the crap around bills (not least that five minutes trying to get the server's attention when you want to have the bill) piss me off.\n\nI bet there are places in Japan or California or somewhere, but it needs to become the norm.  \n\n\nEDIT: I love that half the people are telling me it's already been done, and the other half are telling me it's a terrible idea that would never work.\n\nFor reference, I'm not in the US, so most of your suggestions are not relevant.",

I was livid. For me and my SO, it would have cost a little less than $30. Splitting, I had to pay $80. For the sake of keeping the peace, I didn\u2019t say anything. But Bad Matt hasn\u2019t been invited out to another coworker dinner since. \n\nFuck Bad Matt.\n\nEdit: lmfao these were not my coworkers and I was not about to decide for my SO and 5 other individuals to fight a battle against someone they had to see 5x a week for a minimum of 8 hours a day.

I don\u2019t need an LPT about not letting people walk all over me, thanks.\n\nThe point of this story is - don\u2019t be like Bad Matt.

Of course they ordered a couple bottles of wine and some mixed drinks on top of entrees and dessert. The bill came out to just over $300. I ordered a salad and a soda that came out to like $16, so I toss in $20. One coworker suggested we split it evenly because that would be easiest and we could get out of there. I quickly point out how little I ordered and the dickhead goes, \u201coh come on, it\u2019s just a little extra money\u201d. Which pissed me off. So I did the quick maths. \n\nA $300 bill + 20% tip (we all agreed that our server was awesome) = ~$360. Divided evenly 5 ways is over $70 per person. So I explained that if we split it evenly, I would not be paying, \u201cjust a little extra money\u201d like he said.",
            "Maybe this is just a thing when single people are boozing. We've split someone's b-day tab equally but beyond that everyone in my circles have always just paid for their own check.

Bring crayons, and be consistent. Your kids, even as toddlers, WILL learn to self-soothe.\n\nMy parents were fantastic about instilling manners in us by taking us out to eat and letting us order, which was great for speaking up properly and saying our 'please' and 'thank you'. And the key is consistency. I am the oldest and they started me out pretty young. Each time I started to fuss, one of them would take me outside and stand me on a surface so I was at eye level. They'd wait for me to calm down a bit and ask if I was going to be fussing anymore. Of course, I'd say no. Back in we'd go. If I started up again, back outside we went. EVERY time. Seems exhausting perhaps, but this drill was fairly quickly effective. By the time my siblings came along, my good behavior was apparently enough of an influence to make things that much easier.\n\nI have memories from throughout my childhood of people fairly often coming to our table and complimenting our good behavior. This is a powerful testament to how effective the experiences were.

Don't get them plants or tools, but maybe a nice birdbath/bird feeder/sundial they could enjoy whilst in the garden, or a field guide of local bird species.\n\nInto scrapbooking?  Don't get them paper and stickers and glue dots, maybe get them a subscription to a photo service so they can easily print the photos they'll use, or an ergonomic chair to sit in while they scrapbook so they're not hunched over a coffee table.  \n\n\nGifts that can facilitate their enjoyment of their hobby, or augment it in some new way, without it being something that they would obligatorily use in order to do their hobby can be really great.  I'm really into walking, so I wouldn't really want somebody to buy me new shoes or clothes or a bag for that that I didn't pick out, but if somebody wanted to get me an Audible subscription, or a FitBit or something like that that could be used **to enhance** my enjoyment of my hobby, that would show that they thought about what I would enjoy, without risking getting me something that I would really need to pick out myself to make it be enjoyable.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:  Holy cannoli, I posted this at 3am last night and assumed it'd get buried, and woke up to all this!!!

Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.\n\nIf your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going \"nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback.\" You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain's response to the stimulus around you (emotions). Even if it is an uncomfortable situation, your brain will recognise that it's helping you achieve your goal, so the feedback it gives you (emotions) will be much more positive. It all starts with what you want to achieve and if you don't know, then spend some time figuring that out. Goal clarity is like giving your brain a quest marker.\n\nYou are hardwired for struggle, go forth in courage my comrades!",

            "It seems that my entire life was basically this. Growing up my family was poor, my parents fought a lot, and everything was a struggle, even getting the money to sit for standardized exams and applying to universities was not easy. And being from a disadvantaged background, I had none of the same kind of opportunities or eye catching extracurricular activities that other people had to help propel them into good universities. Still, although I'm naturally more introverted, I put myself out there and did as much as I could, joining various clubs and even creating one of my own. I graduated at the top of my class and got accepted by a top 10 university, by my own sheer will, effort, and intellect. I did fairly well in university too, at least when I focused. But when it came time to get letters of recommendations for medical school I would break out in cold sweat. But still I forced myself to go through the process. I did fairly well on the medical college admissions test (MCAT) with a modicum of studying. Around this time after graduating I was working at a clinic. With no car, I learned to use the bus system and rode my bicycle around the city. Living in a fairly busy city, I had to overcome my fear of sharing the road with other cars, which I did by practicing in the garage, pretending to change lanes after looking behind me, pretending to stop at a light while still on the bicycle, and overcoming the initial fear of first riding onto the road. After I sent out my applications I had several interviews in hand, some even at top tier schools, but ultimately I was rejected, uncertain why. At this point I was dejected, and it was probably one of the lowest points in my life. It was one of those moments where you're just crying by yourself in your room in the middle of the night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I could have given up. Or just apply again in the same year, throwing everything to chance. It was a difficult decision, but I made a resolution, that I would wait, and in two years I would reapply, and in that time prepare my application as best as I could. At this point I moved back home. I studied for the MCAT again, this time blowing my old score out of the water, scoring above the 99th percentile. I worked in a lab and was able to obtain several publications and contributed to research breakthroughs. My professors lauded me and wanted me to stay as a graduate student in their lab. All the volunteer centers I helped out at wanted to hire me to stay on as staff. I did all this while riding the bus everywhere. So once again when the application cycle opened I applied, knowing this was my last chance. Writing the personal statement was pretty difficult, I just wrote honestly. I probably ended up with 20 drafts, forcing myself to write and fighting the urge to procrastinate at every step of the way. Again I got a number of interviews. I prepared for my interviews much more extensively this time, rehearsing and practicing both in my mind and out loud, sometimes even by myself on the roof. I quietly wondered what kind of interview training my wealthier peers got. Finally, I got the letter, with an acceptance at a prestigious medical school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompared to my peers, I did fairly well in medical school too, usually scoring in the top 5-10th percentile of the class on exams. What was demotivating though was seeing the major advantages my classmates had over me both prior to medical school, during the application process, and even during medical school. Most of them came from fairly wealthy backgrounds with good family environments and had major connections. They talked about the private schools they went to and trips to exotic islands I've never even heard of. Their parents bought them nice cars and luxury condominiums or houses. Some of them didn't even have to take on loans for tuition. Meanwhile I drove an almost 20 year old used car that was handed down to me from a relative, one that frequently broke down. I fretted over 100 dollar differences in trying to rent the cheapest apartment I could find. I just couldn't really feel at home with this crowd, though I had a generally pleasant and calm demeanor that fortunately seemed to attract people, which I consider a blessing. Maybe I can blame my upbringing for my tendency to avoid social situations, but acting social in front of my peers, attendings, and patients drained me. I was generally well liked and commended for being hard working and helpful on the wards. Yet again when it came to getting letters I had to go against every grain in my body to ask for them. It wasn't as difficult as the first time, but a part of me felt resentful for still having so much fear when doing these kind of things. Again, it was simply sheer will, knowing that this was something I had to do for survival. And thinking back, I realized that I always felt like my life was always on the line with everything I was doing, as if I was constantly walking on a tight rope. Because if I ever fell down at any point, it was over, nothing, no one to catch me. In the end, I matched into a competitive residency. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in my last year of residency now, and I just think of the suffering I went through to get to this point. My entire 20s and the accompanying life experiences that most people have, just gone. I feel like I missed out on so much. My mind and body are tired, fatigued, and hurt from the cumulative stress and lack of sleep, which has built up over more than a decade. Sometimes my body just feels raw. I dream about how much more I could have done if I had better opportunities or was born into a better home environment, how different my life would be, how much easier it could have been. Depressing to think about sometimes. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd to show for it, I have a negative net worth in my 30s. My parents have essentially no savings. I know that my former classmates who went into tech are living much more comfortably. And now in this environment, I risk exposing myself every day while watching people walk around without masks and going to bars, while in the hospital I'm taking care of people whose lungs are literally being flooded. I try to live responsibly and conscientiously. But even with something as ordinary as driving, when you have nutcases cutting you off the road, tailgating you, and running red lights nearly every day, you ask yourself why even try. Or when people are stomping on their floors and blasting their music while you're just trying to get a few hours of peace and quiet at home, it just feels like people are spitting on your face. And when employees can't even be bothered to greet you when you walk into a store, when you see people treating each other like shit, you wonder, is this world worth even saving anymore? That person you're treating was driving drunk and just ran over and killed a mom and her daughter crossing the road. He's likely to develop alcoholic cirrhosis leading to liver cancer, requiring multiple hospital visits and lifelong treatment/monitoring. You want to tell people that they need to take responsibility for their own health, but no one listens or cares. The government is relentlessly trying to cut down on reimbursement for medical care, essentially demotivating everyone in the field and dissuading the best and the brightest of future generations from ever entering. It's disheartening to think about, and while I've personally helped thousands and thousands of people to date both in and outside of the hospital, I sometimes I question what I'm doing with my life.",

So, Doordash claims to provide auto insurance for their drivers, they make this a big selling point when you sign up to drive for them, they boast this amazing 1 million dollar coverage bullshit, saying you're covered while on the job. Go to the FINE print, and it says they only cover you while the \"goods are in the vehicle\". \n\nFast forward to me getting a new auto insurance plan and talking to my agent about the fact that I was also Doordashing. I learned that the moment I open up that app, my personal auto insurance does not cover me.

            "Believe it or not, when I order food from a takeaway fast-food convenience restaurant, the price is not the prime determining factor.\n\nSpeed, yes.\n\nGood food, yes.\n\nLack of effort involved on my part (i.e. convenience), yes.\n\nAnd in the latter is the real killer... pressing a button on an app on my phone and thereby ordering my usual, paying and giving my details in one hit is far superior to having to have a telephone conversation with a random person at the other end and reading out my order.\n\nI'm sure they don't get as much of the money as they would if I phoned up, but there's a reason I'm happy to pay it, and go through an app... because when that shop is closed or not delivering or I have a complaint... not my problem, it's theirs and I can reorder from somewhere else in seconds.  I don't have to worry about what's open, how far away it is, whether they deliver, what their minimum order for delivery is, etc.\n\nIn many ways, those apps are the only reason I order takeaway for delivery any more.  And if they weren't bringing you enough business to justify their \"discount\", then you wouldn't be using them.",

Grubhub handles the transaction with the restaurant. If I order directly from restaurants, I have to enter/give my credit or debit card number to multiple vendors. This exponentially increases the chances the credit card will be stolen/compromised. \n\n2. Coupons: Grubhub frequently has coupons and offers that can help people that are flexible with what they eat save a lot of money. \n\n3. Convenience: My address, CC info, order history, favorite restaurants etc. are already stored with Grubhub. I don't have to go through the hassle of doing that every time. \n\n4.

            "At schools, we teach the difference between \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d secrets. It\u2019s important for kids to know that a safe secret feels exciting, is good news for somebody, and eventually will no longer be a secret (a surprise party where the person will know the truth once the time comes). We go through lots of explicit examples of safe secrets though because there\u2019s so few (present giving etc) and so many unsafe ones. I also try hard to teach my students that safe adults don\u2019t need children\u2019s help. If anybody ever asks them for help with directions or getting something into their car etc, then they should have asked an adult.\n\nEDIT: Obviously the lessons we run are more nuanced than a Reddit comment allows, such that children know to save grandma when she\u2019s having a heart attack. I should have specified *strangers* don\u2019t need help and if they do, you get your adult to help them :) During class we make it clear that we are not talking about Dad sneaking you an ice-cream or falling over at the skatepark. And yes, it is really sad that these lessons must be run. Statistics make it clear that there will be some children in essentially every classroom that will experience an \u201cunsafe secret\u201d at some point, and many do not have the knowledge or language to access the support they need. If you can, please consider donating funds to your local youth crisis support groups to aid the children who experience trauma.",

            "I struggle a lot with this. \n\nMy ex-husband was abusive in his control and is a total narcissist. He's still trying to get information out of our daughter about me and frequently tries to interject himself into my life in controlling ways even though we've been divorced for two years. \n\nHe uses ANY weakness of mine that he can find to try to make me feel like a horrible human being and a terrible mother. I mean ANY excuse. Example: Recently, my daughter and I decided to do our mother/daughter mall trip on a different day than what had previously been planned because it would fit our schedule better. He berated me and told me I was prioritizing unimportant things over our daughter's desire to go to the mall and that he was going to advocate for her no matter what.  The kid and I both decided the new day was a better day for the mall, but he could not let it go. \n\nAnyway.... I struggle with this whole \"keeping secrets is bad all the time\" thing because there are times where things happen at my house (I have to change plans, I'm tired/sick, etc) that her father doesn't need to know about because he will blow that shit way the fuck out of proportion.  Sometimes I do tell her that it would be best if she didn't tell her dad this or that because if she did, it would turn a mole hill into a dramatic mountain. \n\nI never ask her to keep big things a secret though. \n\nAnyway, it's hard co-parenting with a controlling narcissist because things that are generally good ideas (don't keep secrets from your other parent) can get muddied up when you're genuinely trying to distance yourself from more abuse from your past abuser.",

            "Having kids participate in cooking gives them interest in making sure it tastes good and since they made it, they're more likely to eat it. It also helps them understand that sometimes food doesn't come out perfect, but we're going to eat it anyway.\n\nThis doesn't always lead to good eaters since they can still choose to cook the same foods or choose not to eat what they made. What has worked for us is building food familiarity. While we often choose food that is \"good,\" the heuristic we use to determine that is familiarity. If we at it before, it was probably good. From a survival standpoint, this makes sense. I ate this before and am not dead, so this food must be okay. So whenever we put new food on our kids' plates, we'd only give them a little (2-3 bites) and as long as they tried it, we didn't push it. Then, and this is key, we'd serve it again in 2-3 weeks; still small portions. \n\nWe're a small sample size, but we have no picky eaters. They're big fans of brussels sprouts, broccoli, okra, and abnormally fond of octopus. Our big failure is eggplant, but I'm chalking that up to our cooking.",
            "When I was younger I was an incredibly picky eater, I had to construct a burger over a series of visits to McDonald's starting with \"a burger without the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, or meat....\" Yeah I ordered a bun a few times... What I didn't realize at the time was I was worried about what was in what I was eating, since I didn't know, especially with more complicated stuff like sauces, I just stayed away and was unwilling to try it. Getting in the kitchen and actually cooking things up from scratch started to show me that there wasn't much to worry about. This is great advice. I'm now playing catch up and trying everything though I still usually like to know what goes into my food, Google has helped to make that a lot easier without having to jump in the kitchen with a full blown recipe and make it from scratch before I try it.",

And my mother ignoring when I said *why* I didn't wanna eat that particular food (sweet fruits like watermelon shouldn't burn your mouth like biting into a hot pepper. And lettuce shouldn't make it hard to breath). Leading me repeatedly to the emergency room for allergies. Allergies are rated on a 1-4 scale.

My reactions to other things were so severe they used me as a test case to teach the new nurses that week.\n\nHelping to prepare things DOES help, but talking and a lack of pressure is key.

I just want the juice, I don't do it all the time...sometimes I will eat all the beans or other times I will just take out like 10. My mother didn't let me cook anything until I was like 13 or 14 and it was only like fried eggs or ham. My father would take out onions and any vegetables in the food that I didn't like when I was very small. Super unhealthy so I ended up not eating vegetables for majority of my life. None and barely any fruits either. It was just white rice and a fried protein, EVERY SINGLE DAY. I ended up developing chronic gastritis. \n\nI couldn't afford a nutritionist nor therapist and neither could my parents at the age of 18, so I had to reprogram my mind based on the information I decided to pursue online. I can eat almost anything now, but sometimes my habits come back and I have to remind myself \"you are disgusted by the texture, the flavor is the same flavor you had not too long ago and liked it, if you eat slowly and take your time, you can grow to like it\" and eventually I grew to like carrots, lettuce, strawberries, apples, and so forth. I became vegetarian for 6 months and then vegan for 2 months and then went back to eating normal but wholesome food on the plus side I no longer have chronic gastritis. Just lactose intolerant now but still eat cheese lol but never drink milk.  \n\nIt's important to help your children be self-reliant in general, instead of struggling to eat like everyone else normally does.

I came across this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G3kQyqMFpQ) where he is brutally honest, but got the point across. I'm in the tech field, but I believe this will apply to many people.\n\nYou need to see the company's perspective. Why is this job posting up?\n\nUsually this is how it goes:\n\n* Manager needs a position filled and tell HR \"fill this position\"\n* HR has no idea what is needed for that role\n* Manager has no time to tell HR what he needs in the role and only gives a 3 minute list of things they work with\n\n\"all our clients are astronauts\" and HR writes \"must have astronaut experience\" but... they're just hiring a mechanic\n\nYes. An exaggeration, but there will be miscommunications, either because they don't care, or they're very busy. As long as you fit 80% of their description, apply. There's no harm in giving them your resume when you're under qualified. With indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. it takes up 1 minute of your time to give your resume out. The worst is a rejection email and you'd be in the same spot. But there are other not-so-rare scenarios:\n\n* omg I should have found a qualified person last month, but I still can't find anyone. Next person I see which has half a brain will be hired\n* This guy applied for something he's not qualified for, but I do have this other position that I think he'd be a good fit in\n* this is the only guy that applied... he's basically the best we got. ok let's hire him and I guess we'll teach him\n\nI took the advice in the youtube video and applied to everything I felt I was half qualified for. I'm looking for an internship, but I applied to junior level jobs, intermediate jobs, and even senior positions if I met all the requirements. No I did not get many responses, but I did get some. It's a number game. I got an interview at a company today because I applied to be a \"full stack php developer with 5 years experience\" and got a reply saying \"oh you seem more fit for our internship position, this wasn't posted on our website, would you like to apply for this instead?\"\n\nJust remember: you are looking for ONE job, and the HR might be looking to fill 10. If you apply for 10 jobs, you basically applied for 100 openings.\n\nTL;DR\nJob postings are just an ad. They don't tell you what's really behind the scene (i.e. What the company really wants). Just apply to things you're half qualified for and they'll mend the cracks in your resume if they like you.",

You'll never see that title on anyone's business card.\n\nBut aside from that, OP is correct. An entry level position is SUPPOSED to be one that, although it may demand a certain level of training and familiarity, requires little to no practical experience. Companies often ask for 1 to 2 years of experience... but that is not really an Entry Level position.\n\nBear in mind as well that, although everything is negotiable, **demanding an increase creates risk of losing the job**. if the 'entry level position' has a lot of candidates and you demand more money, you're not going to get your demand... and very likely not going to get the position either. So if it's a company you really want to work for, suck it up buttercup. It's not just about the money.\n\nAlso, **ensure your salary demands are reasonable**. I've refrained from hiring people that had the qualifications because they clearly had no idea as to what the local industry was actually paying for their position and asked for a ridiculous wage. The odds that they'd stay with our company rather than just vault to a higher paying job in a different geography were microscopic.",

Yes, if Amazon doesn't take care of security well, things can go wrong, but its actually a really cool service to be had and has a lot of upsides with little risk to internet security.

            "INFO\n\nReferring to some previous comments to OP's post on this discussion thread in which some cat owners have described that their cat has figured out the laser dot's origin...\n\nAre the cats who figure out the laser toy things predominantly cats who are polydactly (i.e.: cat with extra toes)?  I ask because cats with extra toes on their front paws have somewhat functional thumbs, and are (in my experience) generally \"Torties, and so have \"Tortitude\".  It occurs to me that teaching them to chase laser dots, and them figuring out that thing in your pocket is the source of the laser dot, you may be inadvertently forcing their evolution and soon we will have, as our overlords, cats with thumbs.\n\nNote that, for cat \"owners\", your cat(s) are already your overlord(s). \n\nWhile some may take this as a sarcastic comment (and this comment is offered with gentle humor); a serious question lies within.  Namely: are Polydactyl cats, especially those with \"thumbs\" smarter than cats without \"thumbs\" -- just because they have \"thumbs\" -- and perhaps think to themselves something like \"Hey, I've got thumbs; I can do extra stuff with these!\" ?",

            "I had to learn this lesson the hard way with my dog a few months after adoption.  He's a wire hair dachshund and when he's after something he has a one track mind.  We discovered that he liked to chase the laser pointer around the yard in the evenings and it was a great way to tire him out.  The problem was even when we turned it off he'd keep looking for it.  We solved that problem by using it to lead him back in the house.  The next morning, however, he went straight back to where he last saw it in the yard and it was daytime so we couldn't use it as a lure.  Being stubborn, and fast, he'd just dodge any attempts to catch him.  My fiancee and I were late to work several days in a row.\n\nAnyway, in desperation I tried doing the usual, letting him chase it around the yard, up the fence, etc., and then I had him chase it into his water bowl, turning it off as soon as he shoved his nose in after it.  He drank most of the water, we congratulated him and gave him much praise, and that did the trick.  He went inside with no problem and the next morning he had no fixation on looking for it.  Apparently he was satisfied that he finally killed the laser pointer, and that was good enough for him.",

Honestly if somebody asked me this I would know they are too far into a winning mentality so would abandon the conversation myself.  \n\n\nI prefer to think of it this way.\n\n1. Know what you believe.    \nThis is actually a big one because people make broad generalizations sometimes, or maybe they've never thought about something past a specific point.  We have all done this.  So stop and define what you believe.  \n\n2. Know why you believe it.    \nWhen you think through something you will have a reason to believe what you believe.  That is your evidence.  Maybe it's totally irrational, but it's still your reasoning.\n\n3. Present that in your conversation to the other person.  I believe this, this is why.  At the very least now they can understand your position.  They might not agree with you and that's ok.    \nVice versa, ask them what they believe and then why.  Listen to them and understand.  You might not agree with them and that's ok, but you can see they have reasons.  \n\nIf anything in point 3 is off, you can have discussion points.  Maybe they didn't think about your points. Maybe you didn't think about theirs.  Maybe somebody didn't think about it and take it fully down the road to application.  Whatever.  It allows you and them to have open minds and consider things.  You/They can marinate on the ideas and maybe it'll make more sense as you go through life.    \n\n4. Don't expect change.  \nMaybe somebody will change their mind in that conversation, but I doubt it. I think change comes later as I said.    \nAlso consider that maybe you need to agree to disagree and there is no cut and dry right answer.

            "One of my online hobbies for a few years was gently talking around Holocaust Deniers. Being very right wing, religious and not Jewish gave me a certain advantage as many Deniers are far right or islamists. I was not immediately treated with hostility or suspicion, shall we say. \n\nHonestly, the \u201cDenial community\u201d surprised me. Most of them were not particularly ideological and there wasn\u2019t even much open antisemitism. They tended to be intelligent young men with inquiring minds, genuinely curious about history, who thought they\u2019d stumbled upon something unique and transgressive but had got themselves caught up in erroneous thought. It\u2019s been said that Flat Earthers would make excellent scientists. I think many Deniers would make excellent historians. Reasonable people can be convinced, and they were *nearly all reasonable people*. This is why I don\u2019t believe in marginalising and censoring such people. Their ideas fall on their own merits if we let them. \n\nMy tactics depended on the flavour of Denier. Sometimes the discussions were detailed (deconstructing the finer points of the Leuchter Report, for example) and sometimes basic thought experiments or logical inference worked. \n\nMost of them simply wanted *proof*. Explaining that the historical method works on the balance of probabilities derived from imperfect sources was sometimes enough (my favourite examples were that, by their standards of evidence, we have no \u201cproof\u201d that Alexander the Great existed or that the Battle of Agincourt took place), but some persisted in this demand. Therefore:\n\n\u201cWhat proof would convince you?\u201d\n\n(Usually) \u201cA written order from Hitler ordering the mass murder of the Jews by gassing and/or an autopsy report on a Jewish victim that confirms he died that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve dismissed every single existing document as forged, biased or misinterpreted, and you consider every historian except David Irving to be in on the act. Why would your suggested evidence convince you and who would you trust to authenticate it?\u201d\n\nThis was a startlingly effective response that worked several times. When it worked, the conversation usually went into DMs, and the conversation became a series of lightbulb moments for the Denier, triggering a thirst for proper knowledge. One of them became a drinking buddy of mine in real life. It was awesome. \n\nMaybe I wasn\u2019t a very efficient propagandist - I must have written millions of words on this topic over several years and maybe \u201cconverted\u201d 20-25 people - but I enjoyed myself and I like to think it was time well spent.

(I recommend the extra pair of socks because they can take longer to get dry.)\n\nAnother tip:  Make your carry-on a \"squishable\" bag, like a backpack or duffle instead of  a \"non-squishable\" suitcase.  If the overhead bins are out of room, generally the flight attendants will remove things that can't be compressed or squished to fit the bin first, because they waste extra space.

I remember clearly my thought processes: \"can't swallow, can't cough, can't breathe, can't talk - I have 4 and a half minutes until brain death unless someone in this restaurant knows the Heimlich. There are about 40 people here, I bet the odds are pretty good...and you know, my date's a handy guy, bet he might be one of them!\" I stood up and started waving my hands around, forgot the \"international sign for choking\" (hands around the throat) but mimed the Heimlich and pointed at my mouth. My date figured it out, thankfully, did the Heimlich on me in front of 40 shocked onlookers, and saved my life! I found out 2 weeks later though that an acquaintance of mine had DIED in exactly the same circumstances because she had gone to the bathroom alone to try to clear her airway in private, and that this is a very common thing to happen. She literally died of embarrassment, of being too polite to make a fuss. Don't let this be you! **If you're choking, get attention!**\n\nOh and FWIW that rather nice guy and I have been married 16 years now :)\n\nEDIT: IF YOU ARE ALONE AND CHOKING you can do the Heimlich maneuver on yourself!

            "First Aid courses cover this.  They tell you to follow your dinner mates if they get up from the table and hurry away.  I did it once with a work colleague I didn't know well.  He was sputtering and got up and was walking away and I was calling after him Don't go into the bathroom I am coming with you and he went outside instead.   I told him I'm just going to stay with you while you try to work that out and I won't touch you unless you go silent but if you go silent I am jumping in and I know how to help from First Aid.  And he coughed and spluttered and gagged and eventually spat it out himself.  Which is exactly what he was supposed to be doing.  It was SO awkward just standing there watching him kind of belching but you have to do it and encourage them while their body does its work.   He thanked me.  But he is a very open guy.  Some people might have minded me chasing them while they tried to find a private place to expire but he was grateful.",
            "I've choked (like emergency-status choked) once in my life. Was at a restaurant with my friends and inhaled an ice chip. 100% couldn't breathe.\n\nMy immediate reaction was to run to the bathroom and try to cough into the sink. It didn't work. Started losing consciousness. Was pretty sure I was about to die.\n\nLuckily, it was an ice chip, so eventually it melted a bit and my airway cleared enough for me to get some air. But, it took a long time and was scary as hell. If it was food, I likely would've passed out alone in the bathroom and very likely died.\n\nIn hindsight, it's so obvious that I should've told my friends and gotten them to perform the Heimlich maneuver, but your brain does crazy things when you're scared. It was like a fight-or-flight reaction, and my brain chose flight.\n\nSo, I support this PSA. You might think \"well of course I'll ask for help if I'm choking,\" but you might be surprised what you might do under duress.",

            "One night we were all sat down for dinner. Suddenly my wife coughs and runs to the kitchen, and I'm joking and talking with the kids so I don't realise anything is amiss. Then she comes back in and is pointing frantically at her throat and waving at her face, and I realise she's choking.\n\nI did some first aid training many years ago and she's got a current first aid cert, so I know the Heimlich but I know newer advice is to bend over and have someone hammer between the shoulder blades, so I'm basically punching her between her shoulder blades, she's bending over and pointing to where I should be hitting, shaking her head no no no, indicating I should hit harder and upwards with the palm of my hand, nodding when I find the sweet spot. \n\nShe finally coughed up a bit of steak that was attached to another piece with a bit of gristle. I was seconds away to saying fuck it and doing the Heimlich even though it risks breaking some ribs because she hadn't been breathing for over a minute and was starting to get weak.\n\nI hate to think if I'd had a few drinks or wasn't in the room or wasn't paying attention or if she had panicked and gone to the bathroom I'd be alone with a dead wife by now. Every second I was trying to dislodge the food I was scared shitless and felt utterly powerless and there was no guarantee that we'd be successful at all. If we had no training (however outdated) I doubt we'd have done the right moves to have any hope of clearing the blockage.\n\nSteak was off the menu for quite a while, it was a genuine brush with death and it definitely had an impact on how we both view mortality, as ridiculous as it might sound to someone who's never been in that situation.\n\nIt's scary how thin the line between life and death is, **everyone should get basic first aid training** because for many people **it's the basic everyday shit that will kill you**...",

            "This post should be shared and advertised all over to raise awareness. You can't imagine the horror of choking until you actually experience it.\n\nMy own experience happened in a small takeaway shop where I was eating a shawarma. A piece of lamb got stuck in my throat and I was sat with one of my best friends and his cousin. At first I didn't know why I couldn't swallow the piece and I kept trying to swallow it only to realise it was just not happening. This terror coupled with the inability to breathe in or out started to get to me and I thought this was going to be the end of the line. At this point I started to \"accept\" it instead of seeking help as I had no experience or information to work with. From what I could tell, I was going to die before an ambulance could arrive so there was no hope for me. Tears began to stream down my face and at this point my instincts to survive started to kick in and any sense of \"embarrassment\" flew out the window as I looked up at my friend as a last resort, hoping and praying that he'd understand from one look. Thankfully, he did and he asked me if I'm alright. I couldn't respond so I gestured to my throat and his cousin gave me a quick and sudden hit on the back which forced the piece to dislodge onto the tissue in front of me. I'm very grateful that I was saved and I don't want anyone else to have to experience the sheer dread that comes with facing death.\n\nToday I can laugh about it with him but that sensation has stuck with me, roughly 6 or 7 years after the incident. Please do not hesitate to seek help. Anyone would be willing to save your life if you go to them. You are precious and if you think the opposite, stop thinking.",

        "selftext": "The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.\n\nIf, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.\n\n**To high school juniors and seniors:** \n\nYour parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.\n\n**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**\n\nThese jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. \n\n**Is there any money in it?**\n\nThere definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. \n\nThat's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.\n\n**What are my options?**\n\nThere are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.\n\n**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. \n\nA recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)\n\nThe federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.\n\n**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. \n\nTraining doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, \"boot camp\" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.\n\n**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. \n\nRegarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.\n\nRegarding training, if you win the \"job lottery\" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.\n\nRegarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.\n\nI know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIf you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.\n\n\n\n\n**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an \"open\" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. \"No thanks\" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist \"open general\", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. \n\nAlso about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying \"DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!\" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.\n\nRegarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.\n\nStill relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but \"Go to college if you want a good life!\" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",

There are a lot of companies - across ALL industries - that won't even interview you without a college degree... but there are just as many that WILL.

Interpersonal skills, professionalism, work ethic, the ABILITY to learn and more.

They pretend to show \"the facts\" but only ever talk about how these things are \"getting attention\" or \"could be good\". \n\nHere are some actual facts:\n\n- The unemployment rate for college graduates is 2.5%. It is 5.3% for people who did not attend college. Despite the popular narrative, you're more likely to be employed if you go to college. [Source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/unemployment-rate-2-point-5-percent-for-college-grads-7-point-7-percent-for-high-school-dropouts-january-2017.htm)\n\n-  College graduates earn about $1 million dollars more over the course of their lives than people who didn't go to college. Despite the popular narrative of being \"saddled with debt\", unless you took out a million dollars in loans you will probably **make a profit** from your investment in college, not lose it. Average student loan debt is about $30k. Making $1m from $30k is the best investment you'll ever make (except bitcoin, but then you're likely to lose that much the next day). [Source](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf)\n\n- A college degree lasts forever. Even if you want to become a plumber or electrician later, you'll always get credit for your degree if you change careers. A trade skill lasts only as long as you remain uninjured and able to physically function in an efficient way. \n\n- College graduates are happier, healthier, usually work less physically intensive and less exhausting jobs, better job safety and security, etc. [Source](https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf) \n\nNow, this is NOT in ANY WAY against the trades. If you love plumbing, or wiring houses, or welding and see yourself doing that day-in day-out for the next 30+ years, by all means do it. Of course, do keep in mind that huge economic swings will impact where you can live and how much you'll earn a lot more (college grads can often move between many white-collar jobs, whereas a welder has to go where welding is needed and doesn't have many options if welding is not needed right now). \n\nBut, if you think the trades are some kind of lifehack to get you to prosperity. Or if you think that college is going to leave you with debt and no options. You are just flat out factually incorrect. \n\nEDIT: Just to answer a point that a few people had, which is valid: \"Some of these stats compare college grads to all non-college grads, not just tradesmen\". While true, it is also true that \"college grads\" encompasses a highly diverse set of people with widely different pay as well. But, let's just take a few trades\n\n- Plumbers and electricians have a 4.4% unemployment rate. Better than all non-college people, but still much higher than college grads. Also note that most of the non-college ones are pretty similar to the average unemployment rate. \n- There is no lifetime earning data (that I could find) for plumbers and electricians, probably in part due to the point I made about it being difficult to sustain a physically-intensive career for your entire lifetime. However, we could extrapolate. Median pay for both is about $51k per year, times 40 years (the timeframe used for my other source) = $2.04m. This is $228,000 LESS than college grads, not even factoring unemployment, and so still a net profit for a college degree even factoring in debt and interest (not to mention the variety of other benefits I listed above).\n\nEDIT 2: Just a quick note on statistics. An average or median is going to encompass a general trend, not catch every single case. Your major, geographic location, family support, and a million other things will impact your lifetime earnings. Also, just blind luck plays a huge factor. An electrician might invent a new screwdriver and become a millionaire. An art history major might get hit by a bus walking home from graduation. Literally anything *could* happen, these statistics show what is *most likely* to happen.",

The apprenticeship program absolutely changed my life and gave me a career I'm proud of. \n\nAs an apprentice you're working 40 hrs a week under a journeyman electrician who is teaching you on the job what it takes to be successful. Then 2 nights a week you go to class (taught by instructors who are also working 40 hrs a week as an electrician) where you learn the theory, math, and code implementation that you don't have the ability to focus on at the job site.\n\nThe apprenticeship program is tuition free.  In our local (Denver) we start at like $14.50 an hour and get raises every 6-12 months throughout the apprenticeship as you complete exams.  When you get your license you are guaranteed a base salary of $33.85 an hour.\n\nWhere else can you go to school two nights a week for 8 semesters and are guaranteed that kind of money with no college debt?  Electricians are always in demand and if you like to travel you can take your union card and get to work at the same scale as the local guys.

Jumping out of airplanes, blowing stuff up, and shooting bad guys in the face sounds like fun; but those skills are hard to apply in the civilian job market.

Well, the student loan debt can only be 10.000 \u20ac max, so there's nothing to worry about like in the US, but the apprenticeship + masterschool will be more profitable in the long run.

While they may not necessarily all pay the wages that a particularly amazing sales and marketing manager might be able to demand, you also don't have to sell your soul to make a living. \n\nIf you're okay with the risk of being placed on active duty, the military is a phenomenal place to receive excellent training in a vast number of fields and it also comes with the potential for higher education after certain conditions are met.

So your printer will use all four colours ibstead of just black, what results in more ink use. When you set that RGB and print it out as Black/and white, it will use less ink yes, but only if you set it to black and white in print options, otherwise you will use more than before (depends on your document).\n\nSo to get sure you dont waste ink, set your document to CMYK and replace the colours with 100% black.

For example I stayed at a hotel and as I was laying in bed playing on my phone a bedbug runs across next to my hand. I immediately call the front desk who then tells me I am lying and they have never had bedbugs. I explain that I just saw it and I am stripping the bed as we speak. Talking to the manager over the phone for about 15 minutes gets me nowhere so at this point I\u2019m fed up so I go down to the lobby to talk face to face. There are people In the lobby so I try my best not to make a scene since this really isn\u2019t their fault. I explain that I used to be a housekeeper at a hotel and I have had to handle bedbugs before so I know what they look like and I was not mistaken. The manager still refuses to accept what I am telling her. So after a little under an hour of getting nowhere I say fuck it and I raise my voice, not to intimidate her or anything but to be loud enough for the rest of the people in the lobby to hear. Once people start paying attention to what I\u2019m saying they start asking questions about bedbugs in their rooms as well. She very quickly realized what was about to happen and swapped our room and had all of our stuff cleaned (which is what hotels are supposed to do if you have bedbugs in your room).

She responded I\u2019m sorry but we only upgrade Platinum members.\n\nI said well Diamond is higher than platinum. Then responded with well we don\u2019t have any available. Then she said the pet fee will be $60. I said I thought the website stated that $40 was the maximum per stay. She said no it doesn\u2019t. Manager was not there that day. I knew I wouldn\u2019t get far with her and it was very late and I would deal with the pet fee tomorrow.\n\nNext day in morning I talk to the person at the desk and told her what happened. She said the manager is out but will give you a call today. No call.\n\nNext morning same person as yesterday I told her the manager did not get in touch with me and she said well you can call her when she gets back after you complete your stay. I was leaving Saturday the manager was not in till Sunday.\n\nSunday I called the manager and told her the situation and she said there is nothing she can do as I already paid the pet fee.  I only wanted $20 refunded. I wanted to pay the pet fee but only what I was liable for from the website. She didn\u2019t budge.\n\nSo I called Diamond service line and told them my situation and she said you shouldn\u2019t been charged a pet fee.

            "So I have personally experienced a weird variant of this kind of review scam. There's apparently a login backdoor involving Amazon accounts connected to an older model Kindle, where authentication can be faked. They don't need a password to gain access by using the Kindle API. The attacker then uses your account to buy scammy products using a stolen card, then deletes the card and archives the purchase. Then they write themselves a great 5 star review with your confirmed purchase. \n\nAmazon's customer service will forward you to the fraud team, who will listen to you, say they'll file it, and then... nothing. Could it be because Amazon got their cut? As a \"customer\" I lost nothing because it wasn't my card used, but surely someone, somewhere cares. But not Amazon.",

            "The website OP mentions has lots of flaws as well. If you run fakespot for niche products it will always give a F grade because naturally the reviews will be written with fairly repetitive keywords. I found fakespot as unreliable as reviews on Amazon. \n\nHere are my suggestions: \n\n**For high value items**, I search for review videos done by regular people. Avoid the \u201ctop 10\u201d sites as well as popular review sites. They are extremely unreliable & they are only on the first page of your search engine because they know how to play the SEO game. Watch review videos done by regular people to gauge trustworthiness of the product you are looking to purchase. If you cannot find review videos done by regular people, you need to do some research on the company. I look for their warranty policy, their eCommerce presence, and customer support process. \n\n-\twarranty policy should look similar to warranty policy by major brands such as Apple, Samsung etc. \n-\tTheir product should be listed on various eCommerce platforms. Be sure to check who the sellers are as well. You can safely assume that the warranty policy will be hard to claim if a product is sold across many eCommerce platforms but from various sellers. \n-\tIf they have an online ticketing system, I normally submit a ticket to see how fast they respond. 24-48 hours is acceptable duration for me. \n\n\n**For low value items**, I simply look at the lowly rated reviews on Amazon. I normally give the product a try if the lowly rated reviews haven\u2019t convinced me completely away from the product by the time I finished reading them. If the product ends up being terrible, I make sure to leave reviews on Amazon and create a post on several popular platforms in hopes to help other shoppers. I also make sure that my negative review is thorough and convincing so that no one else has to waste their time on a crappy product.",
            "One time I bought a product and didn\u2019t like it. I returned it and gave the item 3 stars explaining why. The company told me to take it down and they would pay me $25. I agreed and got paid, when I looked back at the reviews I said to myself no wonder they have all 5 stars and the one star review was recent...... smh cannot trust shit online or anywhere for that matter.",
            "Fakespot  is terrible now.  It used to be good.  Now, everything is a C or less. I will rarely even get a B.  For products I know for a fact to be reliable from big name, reputable companies, still D's.  They changed it recently so that their algorithm is even less transparent.

Get rid of the star system and keep it to a factual yes/no as described\n2. Allow buyers to comment on specific aspects of the product  description or comment on details not in the description  (verifiable facts only)\n3.

            "I once worked with a waitress, \u201cMary\u201d who was caught in that situation. Her husband did all the driving and took her tips and check. Once a week he\u2019d remind her that if she tried to leave him he\u2019d kill her. One of our regulars was a therapist who got through to her.  Mary brought some legal documents hidden in the lining of her purse and asked our manager to make copies. He did, and put the originals in the safe. He also stashed a few dollars of her tips here and there in the safe.  Meanwhile the therapist had her lunch in our breakroom with Mary twice a week. After a few months Mary got out of her husband\u2019s car, walked in the front door, said goodbye to her gathered friends, walked out the back door, and got into the therapist\u2019s car to drive to a shelter in a city 2 hours away.  Every few months she\u2019d send an American Flag post card, unsigned, so we knew she was okay.  That was 40 years ago, but if she\u2019s still out there\u2026 I love you, Mary!\n\nEdit: Several prople have asked what Mary\u2019s husband did.  Let\u2019s call him John. At 2:55pm John parked in a front parking slot reserved for disabled people, as always. (He wasn\u2019t disabled.)  Most of the first shift employees left as usual.  When Mary hadn\u2019t come out by 3:10 John came inside, building up steam. Employees and Manager swarmed him, demanding to know where Mary was. (It wasn\u2019t difficult to go ballistic and hysterical on that bastard. Manager and head cook (also male) did most of the talking. Mary hadn\u2019t shown up that day. We didn\u2019t call her at home because of John\u2019s rule against it. What bullshit game was he playing, pretending he dropped her off? We had a hundred witnesses to say he didn\u2019t!  Maybe he was keeping her chained in the basement. Maybe he had killed her! If Mary didn\u2019t show up safe and sound the manager was going to file a missing person\u2019s report and ask the police to do a well-check and bring Luminol. John was not-so-subtly reminded that Mary\u2019s bloodstains were all over his property. John said he\u2019d file a report, but of course he never did. My uncle was a newly retired police detective, and he boldly questioned John at his favorite bar about a week later without claiming he was on official police business. John stalked some of us, but it did him no good.  I moved away but I heard John died of a drug overdose down by some railroad tracks a few years later. Good riddance.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards, but I don\u2019t deserve them just for telling the story.

            "If you're married, be cautious about emptying out EVERYTHING of value. Abuse or not, it is considered mutual property and you're not allowed to just lay claim to everything and ghost. Doing so can be used against you later.\n\nIf you can prove abuse in an at-fault divorce, you'll probably be fine, but it is EXTREMELY difficult and a lengthy process to prove an at-fault divorce without something like a police report or active charges backing you up. And, of course, filing charges is both difficult to prove and emotionally/physically taxing, not to mention terrifying and potentially dangerous. And if you just go empty the accounts and take all the jewelry, it *can* come back to haunt you.\n\nCollect what you need for your safety, not everything in the house. Talk to a divorce lawyer and make an accounting of the stuff you both have, the stuff you *want*, and what you've taken as a necessity. If your spouse goes and breaks it, you have a list of shit you told your lawyer about ahead of time to reference in the divorce, and your spouse can get hit back in the proceedings if they went and destroyed shit in spite.\n\nTalk to a divorce lawyer before you do anything substantial. Even in an abusive situation, getting the lawyer is *the* single most important thing you'll do and should be Step 1 unless you literally have to get out immediately. If they're any good, they can help you formulate an exit strategy and help you find safe housing/accommodation. They will also be helpful in getting a restraining order and working to get the police to actually listen to you if you intend to press charges.",

            "Good LPT.  One of the most important skills I've learned as an adult is to be comfortable doing things I enjoy by myself.  At the end of the day, thats the only person you can truly count on.  \n\nEdit:  I've honestly have had more fun sometimes going out to do things by myself instead of with friends.  It FORCES me to make friends with other people and work on my social skills.  These are skills that have served me well in trying to pick up girls, or get the job when I'm in an interview.  Sometimes, I dont make friends with strangers, for whatever reason, when I'm out by myself.  In those cases, it forces me to be just comfortable with myself.  We underestimate the amount of times we're forced to be out in public by ourselves.  Grocery shopping.  Riding public transportation.  Sitting in a class in which we don't know anybody.  We need to know how to exude a level of confidence in these situations or else, worse case scenario, we can actually be taken advantage of.  \n\nThis advice is especially useful for other introverts like myself.",

            "This also includes traveling. I was scared crapless to travel alone, even as an adult, because I thought I'd do something wrong or there'd be some disaster. Turns out, traveling alone is the bees' knees. When I road tripped I could go as long as I wanted without stopping for pit stops, etc. and alternated between music and silence. It meant I got home WAY faster.\n\nAnd when I traveled across the country it was great because I didn't have to wait on anyone to get ready to go, and I just checked my bags and wandered around the airport with all the freedom and time in the world. When I was done, I went and sat at the gate and read a book. I slept the entire flight, and making my connection was so easy because I was just looking out for myself instead of me + whoever else who wants to argue about how to get to the right terminal. Or who has to go to the bathroom 8 times. Or who wants to run to the McDonalds. etc.\n\nIt also helps that I really value silence. I like being social, but in situations that can be stressful, like traveling, I prefer to just be quietly reflective so I can mentally prep myself and go over what I need to do/what to do in an emergency, etc.\n\nI'd never turn down a vacation traveling with a friend, but taking a vacation/traveling alone is absolutely something I'm down to do whenever I can too. So much less stressful.",

Eventually I ended up not having lots of friends but still wanting to do things and go to stuff. Now some of my favourite hobbies are going to movies and concerts alone. Of course it's nice to have someone else there sometimes but it's not necessary. \n\nI find that a lot of people don't know how to just be alone and enjoy their own company. I think this is something crucial to learn as an adult in general, but when it comes to experiences even more so. You can't miss out and put life on hold until you find someone to do stuff with you. If you want to do something just do it even if there's no one to do it with, otherwise you'll miss out on a lot of stuff. ",

            "I had a similar experience happen to me when I was in the market for a used 4Runner a few years ago. The car posted online midday. While at work, I saw the posting and drove 4 counties over after work to go see it. When I finally got there, I told the dealership what I was looking for, the salesman was surprise to find the model in stocked.\n\nHe then proceeded to tell me the car wasn't in stock anymore because *he* was going to buy it and proceeded to fill out his paperwork in front of me.",

            "If you\u2019re in a big city, this is when you phone up their competitor. We had a dealership try to upcharge us $10k on a new release hybrid. We immediately walked out and called the other dealer in town. They had the highest trim for less money. Deal done within an hour.\n\nEdit: FYI-it was for the first CRV Hybrids being sold.\n\nEdit2: since some have been asking: CRV Hybrid review\n\nIt\u2019s not bad. Pickup is good, handling is good, awd is good. It struggles a little on long inclines (namely because the tiny engine running the generator at high revs), but other than that it beats the pants off Ford EcoSport (which isn\u2019t saying much, to be honest). The entertainment system differs from the Pilot and Odyssey, and can be a bit clunky. Wireless CarPlay and Bluetooth tend to fight. The adaptive cruise is great, and the fit and finish is great (Elite model). I\u2019d say one disappointment is the bottom of the doors is a plastic panel that can get caught on things. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s to save weight. And the best part is, when you\u2019re fully charged people hear a choir before you come around the corner. Good driver visibility and great gas mileage.",

Filled in all the paperwork, and I was outside waiting for the sales guy as he was getting the keys. However during this time another customer pulls up in the older model of this car. He's also come in to look at this one as an upgrade, and turns out he's really good mates with the sales guy. They talk for a few mins before my test drive starts.\n\nTest drives goes great, loved the car, immediately wanted to put down a deposit and get my car valued as a part ex. Sales man tells me they won't have time to value it today as it's close to closing time, so he won't take a deposit, but will call me in the morning to arrange it.\n\nOf course I get no call. I call them later in the afternoon and the car has been sold. No doubt to his buddy. Only time I've been baited like that. Never been back to that dealer since.",
            "Had a salesman do that to me after driving over an hour to the dealership with my money in hand. The car was listed online at a great price but was removed shortly after i called to confirm it was there. I guess he knew he could get more from someone else. He gave me the \u201cI just sold that car but I have something else you\u2019ll like\u201d. Of course, \u201csomething else\u201d was completely out of my budget. \n\nI walked and caught another salesman on the way out the door. Told him about the car I saw online and he pulled the car right up for me. Immediately bought it at the original price it was advertised for online. Guess the joke was on the first guy.

            "Something similar happened to us a few years back. My wife wanted a specific make and model, something they didn't make anymore. We scoured used car websites until we found a dealership that had one. Called them to ask was it still on their lot, they said yep, come on down! We said great, it'll be about two hours.\n\nWe got there, said, we're here about the [specific car]. They said great, and ran my credit. Only after they'd done this did they say, oops, we can't let you test drive it, because it's in the shop. Then tried to sell us a much more expensive car, very aggressively. When we told them we were leaving, they tried to threaten us by saying it would be hard to buy a car anywhere else due to my credit being dinged when they ran in (talk about a bullshit claim; I make good money and have a stellar credit rating).\n\nAnyway, we went home. The following weekend, we found another one advertised elsewhere, and went to see it. It turned out to be awful to drive, but since that dealership handed us the key with no fuss, we took a look around. My wife found something else on their lot she loved, and is still driving it today.\n\nETA: their sales department also kept calling us for YEARS afterward. They literally only stopped when we changed phone providers and I got a new number...",

She got pissed, they tried to talk her down, and she basically said \"Fuck that, I'll just go out to Gilroy\". Gilroy is a little more than an hour away from where we live, but it was worth it. She was able to get the exact car she wanted for a better price than the first dealership offered.",
            "My parents were looking at a car a couple days ago. The salesman was dragging it out a lot longer than they had anticipated and had taken the keys to their truck while they were test driving the one they were going to potentially buy. \n\nThey weren't terribly impressed with the guy and had to get going but said they'd be coming back later. The salesman was pissed and refused to give them their keys back. They fought over them for a while. The salesman finally tossed their keys and said something along the lines of \"Thanks for dicking me around\" and \"I guess your daughter is more important\". Uh... yes? You're surprised that picking up their child is more important than buying a fucking truck? \n\nThe owner of the dealership called later and apologized when he heard what happened. My mom tore into him pretty good and said they'd never buy from his dealership now.",
            "Called the dealership one day to ask about a car. Called the next day to see if it was there. \u201cOk. Please confirm it\u2019s there because you\u2019re 60 miles away from me so before I drive all the way down there I want to know it\u2019s still there\u201d. An hour later, \u201cI\u2019m stuck in traffic. It\u2019s pouring rain, is the car still there?\u201d  \n\n\u201cYes\u201d they tell me. \n\n15 minutes later I get there. \n\nSpoiler alert: the car wasn\u2019t fucking there.",
            "This *almost* happened to me.  I called and said I wanted the car, would be in two hours because I had to take two buses and a train to get there.  I walked in and the salesman took me over to his desk.  I asked about the car and he said it was out being test drove and would probably be sold.  I was furious.  He offered to let me test drive another car which I complied with since I needed a car that day.  I was prepared to leave for another dealership.  When we got back a gentleman came up to me and said Mr. X?  I said that's me.  He said, Sorry for the misunderstanding, we were holding that car for you.  I'll take care of you from here.

So I went back to my home state and we got car in December 2020. They told my father that if he paid extra 1k, I\u2019ll have free oil change warranty for a while. Today I finally had my oil changed and they charged me $108 instead free based on warranty. I was so confused and I got home and looked at my paperwork and saw them writing that service only applied if I go to my home state where I got my car from. They knew I don\u2019t live in my home state bc my father told them and that I needed a good car to drive up in mountains. They tricked my father into paying for service that I wouldn\u2019t have it done in Maryland. My father is going to try to get bottom of this crap.

I can think of very few areas that have little to offer in the way of hard skills. \n\nBut...when I got into the workforce, I found each thing had something that helped me get to a good career and six figure income (and I entered in the 2008 recession). Theater taught me how to connect with people and hear them (interpersonal skills). Sociology taught me critical thinking skills, and how to look for the nuance of a situation (problem solving). M&R studies taught me good writing technique and the discipline required to read and retain information (communication and an attention to detail). \n\nMore than that, employers see a degree as something that shows you have the ability to commit to a goal and finish it, even over a long time. If you\u2019re inclined to STEM tracks, more power to ya, but don\u2019t discount the liberal arts off the bat.",

Their childhood should still be bright and wondrous, and they can slowly come to terms with adulthood as they grow. Mary Poppins said it best: \"A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.\"\n\nI'll clear up one more thing since some people might not see the martial arts world the same as I do: it's not all serious, at least where I train/teach. I arrange games, obstacle courses, and prizes for the kiddos, and try to keep them smiling, sweating, and learning. It's just that when it comes to talking, they're humans too.

Absolutely essential to look after your hearing, especially in an environment where there\u2019s no relief from continuous noise for hours at a time. It doesn\u2019t even have to be *loud*; long term exposure to noise above 70dB can harm hearing, anything above 120dB can cause immediate harm to hearing - the volume of having someone shout in your ear.

Last year, I got caught at a loud event with inadequate hearing protection and developed Hyperacusis. I have not been, nor plan on going to any concert ever again unfortunately. I can barely have conversations with a group of people without having intense pain in my right ear, and on the right side of my face.\n\nIf you are at a club with loud music, I highly suggest upping the ear protection to anything with a 25db+ reduction. I only had in 11db reduction ear plugs, and my right ear has been in pain and T has worsened twice from normal noise exposure since then.",

I love that while I don't want to stay in this specific position forever, I feel a certain degree of satisfaction knowing that I have no desire/ urge to retire. I want to \"work\" on building a community for people/ making our shared community better until the day that I die. My \"work\" is a hobby, career and spiritual passion rolled all into one. Probably the only reason that I have this view is because of my Liberal Arts Education. \n\nI'd be lying if I said everyone that has gone through a Liberal Arts Education leaves with this point of view, but I did. \n\nMy father didn't. He went to the school that -interestingly enough- I now work at. He studied Airframe & Powerplant Mechanics (Aviation Mechanics) and he worked for a number of years making $30 + dollars an hour in the 80's and 90's in the midwest. He built and worked on F-18 SuperHornets. He had terrible financial management skills. He had terrible discipline. He was and still is one of the hardest working men that I know, but it isn't an independent motivation. Eventually, he was laid off and ended up taking whatever job he could find. \n\nHe's 150+ pounds over-weight. Has COPD from smoking his entire life (He has since quit, thank the gods). He's probably affected by some kind of depression or mood disorder. And all he lives for is retirement. I 100% think that the earlier my dad retires, the earlier he's going to die. \n\nMoney's great. Trade programs are great. Living for retirement because you hate your job isn't great. The chronic pain you may find yourself in from the years of microtrauma's you've experienced certainly isn't great. Definitely consider pursuing a skilled trade, but also pay attention in your \"Gen Eds.\" Develop a love for learning everything you can about as much as you can. \n\nMake conscious efforts to improve your critical thinking and empathy. 1.) This will put you in a good place to advance above in your trade if that's something that you want to do. 2.) It will provide you with connections with other people that will allow you to stay in your trade (if that really is what you love to do) despite any wear and tear that it might have on your body. \n\nYour job is a job. You're selling a service to your employer. Know your value. But make sure that you also find what you're doing satisfying and fulfilling. Don't fall into complacency from that, just make sure that you recognize it. ",

            "As a person who comes from a blue collar family, I hate this advice. \n\nHeavy labor trades only apply to men and or extremely strong, tall, amazon style women. Mostly just men. Also, if you hurt yourself just once, you can lose everything. **Everything**. \n\nTrades are important. They're not some magical solution though. They most certainly have many issues no one seems to be aware of or attempts to ignore/minimize. \n\nIf you want to go into a trade, do your research. Look into injury rates. What's your plan B if you ruin your back or your wrist or break a leg? Part of the reason many trade jobs pay well is because the physical risk is high and can strike at random.  ",

It was at that point that all the mundane bullshit clicked and I realized that I had the tools to at least approximate reality on my own without someone planting a biased opinion in my mind first. \n\nIf you want to just make good money but not really advance beyond work for someone else, then trade school is the way to go.

All facts that we \"know\" are actually facts that just have not yet been falsified. \n\n\n\"Clinically proven\" is just more like statistical slang. It's not a strict term (it can't be as science never proves anything). A hypothesis may be said to be clinically proven in medical research if the results of a study have a p-value less than .001. If the results are p<.001 then there is about a one a thousand chance that the study would produce those results by chance alone (that is, if the null hypothesis were true). \n\n\nWhy p<.001? It's largely arbitrary. That's just a common standard in medical research. In many of the social sciences the p-value used is p<.05 to declare statistical significance.\n\n\nTL;DR: \"Scientifically proven\" = nonsense buzzword. \"Clinically proven\" = shorthand for statistically significant results in a medical study (p<.001)\n\n\n\nSource: Remembering what I can from grad school",

Standard procedure is for the company to pay a university to conduct the study for them, in order to make sure the results are not tainted. The company usually is allowed to review any publications prior to their submission, but can not prevent the University from publishing, even if the results are bad. The FDA review process also obviously helps with this, but its important to note that a company *has* to be the one submitting to the FDA, Universities don't. even if they conducted the study, the sponsor submits the application.\n\nEnd of the day: no matter what a company or an ad claims, try to research it yourself as best you can.

People love the guy. He'll walk into a room with such a commanding presence that draws people in and invites them to approach him. He's also not a very good listener, but it doesn't matter because he's an engaging story teller with strong interpersonal skills and he bleeds confidence (not arrogance).

He asked why and I just said \"Bullet fairy. You can never know with 100% certainty that a round hasn't magically made its way back into the gun.\" \n>\n>So we went through the process of stripping them down and cleaning them and putting them back together. After putting the slide back on his, he released it and set the gun down on the table with the barrel towards me. I quickly reached over it and spun it to a safe direction. He laughed and said \"but it's empty! You KNOW it's empty! You checked it yourself before handing it to me and I just took it completely apart and put it back together again. There's no way it could have a round in it!\"\n>\n>\"Oh really? You're 100% sure it's impossible there is a round in there? Then you'll feel perfectly safe picking up that gun, pointing it at your own foot and pulling the trigger.\"  \nHe laughed like he was going to call my bluff, picked up the gun, and started to point it at his foot, then stopped.\n>\n>\"What? Not so confident, now? If you're not willing to bet your foot on it, don't bet my life on it, either.\"\n>\n>He set it back down on the table and I picked it up, racked the slide with my hand covering the ejection port, then set down a live round. He went white as a sheet and said \"But... but how?!\"\n>\n>\"Bullet fairy.\"\n>\n>Eventually, I told him that the gun *had* been empty and that I'd just palmed a loose round before I racked the slide to make him think it wasn't, but he never forgot that feeling of uncertainty and is now as OCD as I am about gun safety.\n\n(Originally found via /u/jhmacair's [post to /r/bestof](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3dfxy7/ukeenedge422_teaches_his_friend_a_lesson_about/).)",

            "> Keeping a good work/life balance is your own responsibility\n\nThis couldn't be any further from reality. And instead of advocating for individualistic approaches to cope with burnout, we need to talking about eliminating the conditions that lead to burnout in the first place and that can only be achieved through organizing. Keeping a good work/life balance requires solidarity with your coworkers and collective action to fight for your rights in the workplace. Employers don't give a shit about your work/life balance and would work you 15 hours a day if they could (which historically they did and continue to do elsewhere in the world). \n\nFor anyone looking to get started with organizing, I highly recommend reaching out to and volunteering with the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee](https://workerorganizing.org) and reading Labor Note's [Secrets of a Successful Organizer](https://www.labornotes.org/secrets).",

It is your own responsibility to *report* when you are not achieving work/life balance, but ultimately, I think some (I would actually argue, most) of the responsibility is on your manager to get you the support you need to maintain a good work/life balance. I've had a couple of managers who would regularly ask me about bandwidth, workload, etc and if I need help with anything. That *should* be the norm, but definitely is not.",

Everyones health is a team effort, nobody can live in society *alone*, that's just not how it works. Take care of yourself and others and surround yourself with those who do the same. \n\nYou have a lot of agency when it comes to getting out of toxic relationships (with an employer or otherwise), but only if you have the capacity, insight and will to do so. That's a whole lot to take on entirely solo.\n\nStop going against human nature, stop hyper-individualism.",

I always used to think, \"Why do my bosses allow me to get to my wits end like this?\" I was seen as hardworking, a go getter, team player, etc. But guess what, I started taking more PTO, prioritizing sleep and exercise by not coming in super early and leaving late. I'm still seen as a hard worker and team player, but I don't hate myself or resent management. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't times to turn up work as a priority or have a late night at the job occasionally, but thats why it's called balancing. In general, I come first.",
            "It is also important to not foster an environment of overworking. \n\nI came from an industry where 60-100 hour weeks were pretty common. The culture had a lot of \"flexing\" about who had the most OT on a project or who had the most on a year, etc. When I was young it wasn't too bad but getting older and watching people in their 40s still doing it I realized how rough it could be. It eats up soo much of your life and usually without much to show for it.\n\nI finally realized I couldn't do that forever and moved to something more normal. It took some time to get used to it and fight the urge to just work crazy hours and get stuff done that could wait. What really helped was being in an environment where time off and non-work hours were respected. \n\nI almost laughed being in a meeting where they discussed concern with having people work a weekend or two, or do a good bit of OT for a whle with concerns of burnout. It took me a minute to realize just how crazy my old job had been and I was glad there were conversations like that going on. \n\nSo absolutely push back on maintaining that balance and if you are management make sure you foster an environment of respecting work/life balance.

They begged me to go home that I was overdoing it but the more they said that to me the more I produced just because they noticed.\n\nCue to 13 years later of burning the candle at both ends and beyond, I basically broke. I had nothing to give.\n\nTo this day, I'm still struggling with just getting a project started. Let me be clear, if it's a project that will benefit or help another, I will drag myself through the mud to complete it for you but I cannot get anything done for myself on any level.\n\nIf I were to give anyone advice, I would say, Slowdown and breathe. If it doesn't get done, either the company will have to hire someone that can help or you should look for another job where you do not feel a level of stress caused by overworking yourself to please others.\n\nGood luck out there",

While he was laying there staring at the ceiling he made a decision. He told me: \"If I would work this hard to make lots of money for someone else, why shouldn't I work this hard to make lots of money for myself?\" He decided to become self-employed, and never looked back. \n\nThat made a huge impact on me, and I decided to start my own business as well.

            "I'd like to respond from the viewpoint of a retiree (a Boomer).\n\nI found a job in 1981, that I actually enjoyed, working in maintenance for a larger school district. Think HVAC (Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning).\n\nI was fortunate that I worked for a supervisor, who became my mentor. He was highly thought of in his respective field. (heat pumps and installations). He being a supervisor, was at the low end tier of administrators, with approximately 12 mechanics that answered to him. Myself and two or three other were apprentices at that time. \n\nMy supervisor/mentor, were what may be considered outcast because of positive outlook on work and being conscientious when it came to getting the job done. He showed me the ropes of written and unwritten rules and regulations within our work environment. \n\nI picked up on what and how my job performance would affect my advancement, mainly to become a mechanic and work in a quadrant of our area of responsibility. Mainly for the money, but also the chances for advancement within our department. Raises followed with advancements.\n\nI took on work that most people refused, which is an entirely different post. Taking extra workload worked in my favor, as I became trusted to work alone or when needed worked within a group. This lead to me being assigned minor and major projects, with and without assigned help. At times working with contractors on renovations and new buildings. I was rarely questioned in the acquisitions of tools, equipment or parts, to complete assigned tasks. No one is indispensable, but doing projects most people balked at or refused, gave me trust and credence as a worker and manager.\n\nI did move from that department to another in 1984 that dealt with building controls (pneumatics) then into PLC (Programable Logic Controls) and digital controls, beginning of computers and digital related controls.\n\nWe went through series of supervisors, which I eventually became one in 1991. This in turn,  with raises and overtime, I worked 60-80+ hours per week, increasing my income and setting up annuity(401b), saving one third of my income per pay period. \n\nI was on-call 24/7 for this period of time. (Approximately 10 years give or take)\n\nThe work and benefits enabled me to retire at 58 in 2011, comfortably and receiving three fourths of my base pay per month. \n\nI came across people from all walks of life. Many I met were miserable working at their jobs they \"hated\". I on the other hand found a craft that was challenging and rewarding, if only me being happy with my own work performance.\n\nIn process of my work life, I was able to buy a home and used many skills learned to renovate my home to my needs. It is home and easily maintained and cleaned.\n\nTimes have changed and so has the world, I feel fortunate to have found a (monetarily) rewarding occupation, in which I feel I contributed to society.\n\nMy time is my own now.\n\nAnd let the haters come out.",

            "This is so true... You might be sitting there waiting for others to notice that you're running at 110% constantly, thinking that eventually someone will notice, step in and offload / help remediate the issue. They won't... Your peers won't step in because they don't want more workload, your management won't step in because you're likely producing more work product that their average employee, why would they want to stop that? \n\nKnow who will step in? Your family... After all of their repeated comments you ignored, missed plays and soccer games, help that you couldn't give on those school reports, except you might not notice until they're on their way out the door, sick of your shit. Remember, those of us with families say we work to provide for them, but they're not going to see your 80hr a week as a requirement, they'll see it as a choice, a choice where you chose work over them.

            "Probably gonna get buried, but I worked for one of the big US phone service companies. I even became a trainer pretty quickly. One lady called in and I could see she had a ton of interactions and problems in the past few days. Right from the 1 she was rude and talking down to me, etc. I don\u2019t do disrespect. I stopped her and said verbatim \u201cma\u2019am stop. I know you want to feel heard and get your problem fixed, but nobody is able to help you when you act this way.If you can give me some patience and work with me we can fix this.\u201d\n\n20 minutes later we fixed all her issues.

            "Customer service agents are very often a poorly-paid firewall between companies and the customers to whom they should be accountable.  Getting treated like shit because customers are frustrated and angry is a necessary market force.  It means you'll hate your job and the company will have to pay employees more for retention.  That additional overhead might encourage them to improve their practices and policies.\n\nEvery time a customer service agent gets a frustrated customer to shut up and smile and accept standard practice, the company wins.  They love the fact that we (the customers) feel guilty because it's not the agent's fault.  But the agent is not acting as a private citizen; they are an agent of the company.\n\nYou're a faceless storm trooper asking for politeness while your starship rains hellfire down on the village.

If a customer is reasonable and polite, I might find an extra coupon, expedite shipping, suggest an alternate solution to a problem. If they treat me like shit, I will do exactly my job and nothing else. Being shit on is not in the job description and y'all who say that we should be sugary sweet towards people yelling at us have clearly never worked in customer service and it shows.\n\nThe way I like to phrase it is there is a **huge** gap between what they are *required* to do, and what they are *able* to do.\n\nWhen I was in the technical trenches, if someone was nice, I'd go the extra mile to try to get them working again.

            "Tons of people are reading this completely wrong. It's not suggesting anyone needs to bend over and kiss customer services ass. It literally only takes you being polite and respectful,  you know a decent human being.

Sometimes we can't even keep up with orders cause we just sell THAT much. I'll be frying back to back batches. It's gone as soon as we pull it out of the fryer. I'll be on the fryer for 4 hours straight. If you're screaming at me about it, then I'm not going to give you maybe a couple extra pieces for the wait as I would for other customers being patient.\n\nIt's as simple as, you get more bees with honey.\n\nBeing in customer service myself I do my best to approach other customer service people with just generally being polite.

If having a chill boss and a lot of freedom are important to you, that's fine. But higher paying jobs often require dealing with more difficult people and a tighter work schedule.\n\nAlso consider where you are in your career before you start raising your expectations of what's fair and what's \"toxic\". Have you worked long enough to have PTO, or are you asking to miss a work day? Do you work independently or as part of a team and will your absence cause more work for others? Consider HOW you're asking as well... do you walk at the start of your shift and say \"I need this day off\" or are you waiting until your boss has time (or scheduling time to talk) and asking? How flexible are YOU with your own desires, and is that reflected back on how your boss deals with you.\n\nDon't take career advice from someone unless they have a career you want to emulate. For all you know OP waits tables or works retail... which are both FINE. But if you goal is executive management, or a highly skilled position... maybe get a career coach or mentor.   /rant",

I\u2019m taking a class on community health and learned a few things that I\u2019ve found have worked. \n\nI\u2019ve found that just sitting with someone and just talking to them over coffee or a meal or whatever helps. The initial activity can help remove feeling awkward, as sharing a meal with someone, conversations just sorta naturally occur. When someone sits with me to just talk and eat, I feel as though they genuinely want to hang out, and I feel more at ease to talk honestly. Or even just asking \u201chey, real talk, are you okay?\u201d \n\nAnd if they just say \u201cNo\u201d but don\u2019t talk about it, that\u2019s fine too. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to explain why I\u2019m upset. I just want someone to carry the emotions with me for a little while. I probably can\u2019t explain in detail why my chemistry class is so frustrating, but feeling stressed out by a class is universal.   \n\nAnd during conversations, it helps me to repeat what the other person is saying. This is something I\u2019ve learned from my fianc\u00e9. When I\u2019m having trouble verbalizing exactly what I feel, he\u2019ll say something like \u201cYou sound a little stressed about school. You said chemistry has been a little frustrating?\u201d Helps me (or the other person) feel that you\u2019re actively listening. Especially helps in text conversations since so much of communication is nonverbal \n\nThat\u2019s just been my personal experience though. Everyone is different. But sometimes just someone genuinely asking \u201chey man, you ok? We don\u2019t have to talk, but I\u2019d be happy to just sit with you\u201d can make a world of difference.",
            "Even though I know it\u2019s not true, I just struggle asking for help because I don\u2019t want to be a burden on someone and for some reason I just always felt like asking for help as a sign of \u201cweakness\u201d. So I\u2019d rather sit there in silence struggling than ask for a helping hand because I don\u2019t want to come off as stupid.",
            "Oh man this made me tear up a lil bit. Thanks for posting this OP. I HATE venting to people, it also makes me feel vulnerable because i was always \u201cthe helper\u201d to my mom. She always wanted to vent to me as a kid and actually took my advice sometimes, but never listened when I vented. It was incredibly unbalanced. Thanks again OP, hope you\u2019re having a good day!",
            "No one\u2019s gonna check on me and I\u2019ve kinda just accepted it. It\u2019s cool though. Feels better to help others, anyway.",
            "Ffs this is me right now. Buying first house. It took me an hour of waffling on a particular form before I reached out to my realtor for his opinion, apologyzing to bother him. Dude was like \"it is LITERALY my job to help you through this, ask me anything at any time\"",
            "For some people don\u2019t ask if they need help, offer something specific. \n\nIf you know someone is struggling with something don\u2019t call and ask if they need help, call ask say hey I know you have x issues going on, I\u2019m pretty good with it how about I come help you out.",
            "Don\u2019t give away our secrets! How else am I supposed to give all my energy to others and loved ones so I don\u2019t have any left to wallow in my own dark thoughts. \n\nDoubles down for those who are helpers with trust issues. I actively don\u2019t want help out of continual thoughts that I will be judged for needing or even accepting help.",
            "This is me. Grew up with an emotionally abusive mom. Anything given was eventually put over my head. I had a hard time fitting in which also contributed to me being a people pleaser to hopefully make friends. Other family wasn't fully supportive of helping me with my mom's behavior so I relied on myself and the few friends I had. Felt I had too much emotional baggage so I bottle things up. There's literally been times where I've been starving on my own but hid the truth because I didn't want to feel indebted to anyone/judged. People say I'm really nice, I try to be, but a big portion of it has to do with the fear of coming across as unappreciative or selfish.",

            "Keep in mind to the helpers, ask this simple question.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel when you help someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t deny people who want to help you from feeling good about it.\u201d",
            "When I was in therapy my therapist told me about the enneagram test. I am Type 2, the Helper. Summed me up perfectly, I couldn't believe it. I advocate everyone should take the test. It's much more than a \"personality\" test.",
            "Wow, this is 100% me as a person. And ya know the shitty thing is I completely recognize and am aware of that, but still have lots of trouble with it. I try being more conscious of it, but I\u2019m still much more apt to just try and handle things myself than drag someone else into it.",
            "As someone who is a \u201chelper\u201d thank you for this. I hope you\u2019re doing ok",
            "The type 2 enneagram is literally called \"the helper\" and it's exactly what I am. It sucks sometimes for this exact reason",
            "And it can destroy your mental health very quickly.\n\nIf you want to take care of others you have to put yourself first. You cant help others if you dont have your own shit in order",
            "..yeah. Sometimes I wish I knew how to ask for help, and not instantly feel like a burden in my head.",
            "At my job people ask me to help with their tasks all of the time and I gladly do it to help ease their workload. The few times I become overwhelmed I refuse to ask for help because I don't want to inconvenience anyone else. If some occasionally notices I need help and they lend a hand I feel indebted to them until I can return the favor. Even if I helped them a dozen times over in the same week. I am extremely bad at asking help for myself but love helping others when asked.\n\nSide Story (Seeing some people talk about googling things for people in this thread): Years ago when I was taking an SAT class I put myself out there and asked a question to my teacher, \"I'm sorry, can you explain to my what a prepositional phrase is?\" My teacher responded, \"I don't know why don't you google it?!\" ... Sorry for asking a question pertaining to our topic I will now withdraw into my anxiety shell and never ask another question for the remainder of the class and everyone here now thinks I'm stupid, thanks.",

            "I once picked up a double mattress from IKEA and took it home on a tram and up the stairs of my Apartment all by myself because I hate asking for help. I also moved apartments by doing about 4 trips on a tram with all my belongings. I really need to get better at this help thing. I think my mentality is that if I ask someone for help I then \u2018owe\u2019 them and I hate owning someone.",
            "Hey that's me. I never ask for help. I help everyone. I believe if people really want to help me, they will, wthout my asking. Otherwise I will try to do it myself because I hate asking for help and I am bad at accepting it if offered.",
            "As a social worker in psychiatry, it's true. Hell, I even declined help when I was in such pain I couldnt even walk due to  lumbar disc herniation.\n\n'No, it's fine, Ill see myself to the ER'\n\n\ud83d\ude05",
            "This entire thread gets me. When I\u2019m stressed I actually get energy from helping people. I get high on adrenaline and anxiety and I turn into this uncharacteristically hyped up person who can do! It! All! I legit transform from April Ludgate to Leslie Knope overnight. I\u2019m better in a crisis than I am when it\u2019s calm. \n\nI would sooner die than ask someone to do my dishes or my laundry or something because in my experience USUALLY when people help me all they do is complain about it, and it\u2019s actually so weird to me when they don\u2019t that I almost can\u2019t stand it. But sometimes that\u2019s all I want. I want to come home to dinner and fluffy towels and a movie that\u2019s already been picked out for me. I want someone to shove a glass of wine in my hand when I walk in the door and tell me they took my car for an oil change. This has literally never happened to me, and men I\u2019ve dated have said this is unrealistic and people don\u2019t do this. But you know what? They\u2019ve said that while knowing that I\u2019ve done all that shit for them, so what does THAT say?\n\nWe all deserve that. Don\u2019t get stuck in the \u201cdon\u2019t help me\u201d loop. (And yes I do need to take my own advice because I\u2019m a \u201cdon\u2019t do nice things for me\u201d person ALL the time, even when I\u2019m really super happy about having things done for me, because I feel like an annoying burden.)",
            "Definitely me. I always help people and I hate opening up. I used to try opening up, or at least was better at it, but there were times when I was in a vulnerable place and got shot at during it so I've built up my walls even taller and thicker now.\n\nIf not face-to-face, I will give implications that I'm upset, like a lack of punctuation/sounding happy or spelling things the correct way (\"I'm guud, u?\" vs \"Good, you?\" || \"I said I'm fine!\" vs \"I said I'm fine\"). So at least the person knows I'm upset. Yes I'm going to decline your help, but if you pester enough or asl the correct questions I may be forced to open up anyway. \n\nIf I am face-to-face, I tend to hide it pretty well, unless the emotion is serious. I may awkwardly rub my eyes and look away.\n\nHell, I'm opening up right now to a bunch of strangers. Wait... Fuck"
