She really appreciated it, as she was coming from across the country and wanted to keep her mask on until she left every public space.\n\nTo those asking why you'd be hungry after a flight, in the U.S., you don't get food on domestic flights, unless you want to purchase the world's most expensive cup of instant noodles or something similar, and that would require you to remove your mask to eat it, of course.  Between the flight time, airport wait time, and time to get to the airport, it could easily be eight hours since they last had a proper meal, even with a direct flight.\n\nTo those that are hostile towards the idea that you might consider doing an additional nice thing for someone on top of an initial nice thing: You don't have to do it, and the person isn't obligated to eat it. Sometimes it just makes me feel good to do nice things for people I care about to make them happy, especially when they've had a tough day/week/year. And aren't most people having a tough year?\n\nEdit #2: I love all the comments from people remembering times they appreciated unexpectedly having a snack upon being picked up from the airport!\n\nAlso, despite the first edit, I still woke up to hundreds of hateful comments. To those, I add: I hope you someday experience the feeling of being excited to pick up someone you love from the airport. I hope you someday feel joy yourself when you make someone else feel happy and loved and cared for with a small gesture rather than being filled with scorn and disdain for them. It's amazing!",

            "This is a very good LPT. I have a cognitive impairment where I can become overwhelmed with large, vague tasks. For example, I work as a lawyer and for my first jury trial I was completely freaked out because it's this massive task which I'd never before done. But, I employed the technique my mother taught me, which I internalized starting in elementary school, make a list.\n\nTaking a big, scary task and breaking it down into its composite steps is extremely helpful, even when the list is long. It also helps you to visualize the work needed to be done and more accurately estimate the amount of time it will take. So, in my jury trial example, it looked like this:\n\n1. Write opening statement\n2. Meet with witness one and prepare folder for witness one direct examination.\n3. Meet with Witness two and prepare folder for witness one direct examination.\n4. Research motion to strike issues\n5. Prepare cross-examination points for the defendant. \n\nEtc, etc\n\nNow, even though I'd never before prepared for a jury, I had done all of those composite steps many, many times. Now, my big, vague, scary task is manageable because it's a list of things that I feel confident I have the required skills to accomplish. \n\nAs far as I can tell, this technique is applicable in essentially any field, with pretty much any task. Additionally, by making the list, as you work you cross out what you have accomplished. Crossing out the items allows you to see yours progress, visualize the end of the task, and stay motivated since you know when the task will be complete.",

            "Another tip (especially if you are neurodivergent) - if you find yourself in analysis paralysis/executive dysfunction, you can break the task down into however many small achievable parts you need to. For example, if I need to make coffee, but can't mentally even get out of bed, I think \"I need to sit up, swing my legs over the bed, stand up, get dressed, fill the kettle, etc. This may not work for everyone, but I've heard from other people on the spectrum or with ADHD that it can helpful.",

            "Like others have said, it isn't as easy to \"just start working\" and \"figure things out along the way\". For those of us with ADHD, every single day can be a struggle against our own minds; the severity of the struggle depends greatly on the individual and a whole host of other factors that I just don't have time to get into. \n\nFor example, let's say the \"very basic plan\" involves setting an alarm on your phone for each task you need to get done that day. So you go about your day, doing whatever it is you're doing, and the first alarm goes off. Only you're in the middle of something you *can't* stop right away or you just want to get to a certain point before stopping for whatever reason [maybe you're crocheting and you have a mental block that doesn't allow you to stop on an odd-numbered row]. So you tell yourself \"Okay, as soon as I can stop, I'll go do that thing. Shouldn't take more than a few minutes.\"\n\nOnly \"a few minutes\" never stops. You get distracted, back into the rhythm of whatever you were meant to stop in \"a few minutes\", and suddenly you've done twenty more rows on that blanket instead of one. And your next alarm goes off. And the cycle repeats until you're either able to break it or it's time to go to bed.\n\nSo, like another person said, this has *huge* \"Just don't be sad/anxious/etc anymore\" energy.",

This was a commission job so if you exclude everyone making base pay, the average went up to $15/hour.  \n\nAll facts were skewed to make the company sound better, but all of the lies were construed in a way to make the person think that they just misunderstood these promises.",

I'm super proud of it, and also relieved college is over for a while. They were going to psyche me out of a great job that had the hours I needed, knowing there was a plan in place to fire me after their audit of the clinic was over. \n\nMy other coworker got dropped near the end of the lock downs, and he made it, but they let him crawl and suffer through that. He cared if they liked him / valued him a lot more than I did, too. Gave him a heads up 2 days prior, and blamed it on something they watched him do wrong for all 4 months I worked there.\n\nThey couldn't give me any details when I asked either, and picking up on that literally allowed me to eat three meals a day through all the bs we were fated to face, collectively.",

One day during lunch a coworker mentioned that she was hoping to snag the FT position.

They had a few flimsy \u201creasons\u201d for letting me go and never admitted to it but after all was said and done it was very clear. I wish there was a way for me to have seen it ahead of time like this.",
            "This happened to me. Was given a 6 months contract to hire position. Luckily I was very suspicious and began looking for permanent positions elsewhere. 6 months passed and I finally found a good position that paid more and was permanent.

            "A temp job is a temp job. Never expect more than that.",
            "This wasn't even a secret with my last employer. They had \"temp\" workers for 10 years. They would lay you off for a couple of months a year so as to maintain your temp status and not provide benefits. Then the ACA was passed and they hired full time the current temps and never called up the ones that were off.",
            "I work in IT and my team is never fully staffed - we're currently down 3 people including a manager - nobody wants to work this job which is odd - I have been here over 5 years, never worked a holiday or weekend and the latest we have had to work is 8pm. Sitting at a desk all day making $20+/hr with benefits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe issue is that they always try to hire people in as \"temp to hire\" -- they are just trying to avoid paying for benefits for 6 months. I wouldn't want that either. Every person we hired as a temp ended up staying for at least a year or more, and they had to ask to be made FT, HR never offered it without being asked.",
            "It's a tricky situation but being hired for a temp position is exactly that, it sucks that they say there is a potential for full time but honestly that is nearly always the case. If a company see's someone they like, even if they didn't have a position available they will probably open something up. But more often than not, they never intended to take anyone on full time. Your expectation should be... Do this job, gain experience add to cv. If there is a hint of a position going they should.. And I emphasise 'should' advertise it for all of the temps to apply for (some won't though and will take someone if they fit). A a side note, the Companies that offer these temp positions are not normally in places where careers are made, there is most likely a high turnover off staff so if you like it there, put your best work in and be direct, ask the question 'I like it here, could I be considered for a permanent role', if they say no, ask for feedback that you can take into the next place.",
            "As someone who does position management at a large organization - this \u201cpotential\u201d line is not inherently a lie - they say potential because if they had the full time / permanent position available now, they would likely give it to you now. They say potential because they are only making their best guess. We will have someone off on long-term disability for years, so can only fill their position temporarily, over and over and over.\nEventually their benefits run out and they turn to the government benefits and we can finally release their position to a candidate permanently. Usually we know this is coming so in that case, telling the temporary candidate this is a good way to help them feel comfortable taking the position.\nHowever, sometimes things dont work out how we expect, and there isnt a permanent position at the end of the temp. In my experience, at the orgs I\u2019ve worked at - this has never been a lie, we dont tell candidates this if we dont feel pretty sure that there will be a position come up. But again, sometimes that person on long term disability suddenly makes a miraculous recovery (or they werent that bad in the first place but waited til the last possible second to reveal it)..... anyway. Sometimes it happens, but I dont think hiring managers are actively lying to get you in the door. They say potential because there\u2019s a good chance. But with leaves and temporary positions, especially involving insured leaves, the unfortunate truth is sometimes the organization gets like a weeks\u2019 notice of a status change and it can come as a total shock.\n\nI say this from a currently temporary position myself, which I realistically expect will become permanent. I know the background and I understand why the manager beleives this, but of course, nothing is an absolute guarantee and there\u2019s always the possibility that the position owner returns. Now, does that mean I\u2019m not still watching job postings for something permanent now? Nope. I\u2019m still keeping my eye out because until I have a permanent offer letter, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nSo if you hear this don\u2019t assume the manager is lying, but dont count on it being a sure thing either. Keep you eye out for other opportunities as you go, and ask your manager for status updates every few months so you know if anything has changed. They cant guarantee you anything until they know the position is freed up, but they can at least tell you if they\u2019ve received any updates on the situation that may imply where its headed.",

            "I went to a job interview once where we were offered a commission position with the potential for a full time job. I walked into the interview and there are like ten people in the lobby, I knew it was going to be a shit show but I rode it out. we all had a brief interview with the office manager and broke off for \"peer interviews.\" the guy I was with seemed so depressed. He didn't ask me shit, just spit a script of how much money we were going to make. Wrote a bunch of numbers in a notebook about potential earnings, was completely condescending like I couldn't do basic unit analysis but I let him talk. when he got to the end he asked if I had questions and I said \"yeah. what do you make?\" he gestures at the notebook and says he's laid out the earning potential. \"I know, but that's just imaginary numbers on a piece of paper. what do you make?\" He just kind of deflated. But he recommended me for the next round of interviews and I agreed because it was literally right after that(any job that's trying to hustle you in is shit) and I'd already blocked out the day, might as well have some fun. The office manager had liked me so I got interviewed first. pretty much asked the same thing as my initial \"interview\", but also asked about baseline pay. \"it's all com. there isn't baseline pay\". I pointed out that that is illegal in our state and he goes: \"look, you're going to be promoted to management. You're clearly a smart guy(what they tell everyone). but if you don't think you have the skills to make it through the trenches than I just don't know what to tell you. Baseline pay would be minimum wage, you don't think you can make that? I'm offering you the chance to make a lot of money, but if you don't think you have what it takes to earn a lot in this position that's fine\". I told him I was currently driving the nicest car in the employee parking lot, and I didn't think anyone had \"what it takes\" to make good money there, and I walked out. announced to the lobby that they are applying for a job that is breaking state law and these people are shady AF, and left. I was getting into my car and saw one guy leaving, the oldest dude at the interview. He thanked me for saving him some time. The rest stayed. Stick up for your rights, normalize asking hard questions."

In turn the IRS would not market it to the public because these companies should in theory be doing it for them.\n\nSo the companies got around this by using confusing names and putting the Free File on pages that were purposefully hidden by search engines. IE: you search IRS free file and get a result for \"TurboTax Free\" it does the most basic tax form and when you realize your situation is more complex than it covers you pay for the upgrade because the result \"TurboTax Free File\" didn't show in search results.\n\nBecause of this bad faith show of the companies commitment to the agreement the IRS decides to say fuck 'em and has now posted on online resources to link you their free file product you can use from all the providers so you can stick with the same company you like and not pay them for a service they shouldn't be charging you for.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free",

If you have to stop searching at night you should leave your coat or a blanket that smells like you/your home/your dog at the place you were last together. If the dog retraces its steps at night and finds a familiar item they will often just lie down on top of it. If you make sure you are back at first light in the morning you might find them there waiting for you.",

            "Speaking from experience: it works!\n\n\n*Edit: Here is the story:\nA buddy and I went woodcutting. We always left the dog in the truck (for her safety) when felling a tree. She never had any issues before with the sound of the chainsaw or the thump of a tree falling, and I have no idea what spooked her, but she squeezed through the half-open window and took off. We called and looked for her for about an hour, then continued to cut and load the wood, hoping she would follow the noise back to us. 4 hours later...no dog. We left a coat and her water bowl at the spot where the truck was parked and drove around for 2 hours, hoping we would spot her. No luck. Eventually, with heavy hearts, we went home. The next morning, just before dawn, we went back to the spot where we left the coat...and there she was, happy, healthy, and mighty hungry, but no worse for the wear.",

We called and called for him, but he didn\u2019t come back. My dad had to go back home (40 miles or so) and said to us,  I\u2019ll leave something that smells like me, so he knows to come back.  Dad goes in the house and comes back with his tissue paper thin boxer shorts, and leaves them on the steps to the house.  I am mortified and my husband to be is now wondering what kind of family he\u2019s marrying into.  We go to bed, I wake up early, check the front of the house, and there is the dog, sleeping with his head on my dads underwear.  I never doubted my dads wisdom again",

            "It works.\n\nWe fostered a Belgian Malinois. He was extremely skittish. We have him for 2 days at our house and then he escaped from his collar while on a walk one afternoon. We tried to catch him but he bolted and was extremely afraid of people. He went missing for 3 days as we looked all over for him.  My wife decided to leave our gate open and put a dog crate in the backyard. She also put some of our clothing and one of his blankets inside the crate.  On the 4th morning of him missing, our yellow lab went outside and we to the crate. He was on alert and we decided to just look inside the crate. The Belgian Malinois had found his way back to our house and was cuddled up inside the crate. \n\nWe couldn\u2019t believe he found his way back to our house after only knowing us for just a few days. We decided then that he chose us and we would not be a foster, we would be his forever home.",

            "The thought of a lost dog running around the forest all scared and panicking is so heartbreaking. Especially imagining him finding his owner's jacket on the ground and falling asleep on it because it's as close as he can get to being beside them. But then, in the morning, he hears familiar footsteps in the distance. Then he hears his owner's voice and knows everything will be okay.",

            "My dog ran away from its sitter while I was I. California. We knew he was walking the train tracks from reported sightings so when we got back(6 days later!), we went searching on the tracks. I saw him once the after noon after I arrived but he was pretty confused. Later that night there was another sighting and I saw him but he disappeared before he could recognize me. Well after searching all day, I worked up the need to pee and I ended up peeing near the tracks. My dog showed up at my house the next day. An officer called my husband he said he\u2019s at the church across the street so we were throwing our clothes on we get another call that said \u201che\u2019s in your front yard, open the door!\u201d And he just ran right in. Ran all the way from the sitters house to our house (about a mile and a half with lots of detours along the way. The day he got home it started snowing too. We are so lucky we found him (or he found us). We still credit me for peeing on the tracks. Also I was licking dog treats and throwing them on the ground. Don\u2019t worry they were the beef jerky style ones.",
            "Whoa, whoa whoa, Ms. Lippy! The part of the story I don't like is that the little boy gave up looking for his puppy after an hour. He didn't put posters up or anything, he just sat on the porch like a goon and waited. That little boy's gotta think 'You got a pet. You got a responsibility.' If your dog is lost you don't look for an hour then call it quits? You get your ass out there, and you find that fucking dog!",
            "Maybe also some food? For it to be able to camp by  your coat, until you get back.\n\nEDIT: Bad idea.",
            "This is the same for a cat, if your inside cat happens to get out, leave something of yours sitting outside and maybe sprinkle some cat nip around your yard.

            "This is a bit odd of an LPT. Whatever you need to do to be there for someone and empathize is the right thing. Not making their problem versus yours a competition is key, but relating to someone in a non competitive way is a very important mechanism to being there for someone and relating.\n\n\nIn a way I think this is more about be an ACTIVE listener, and not a passive one, but it's absolutely ok if the conversation includes a relatable incident as long as you've truly heard the person.",

            "Depends on the person my man. I personally find it relieving to know I\u2019m not alone in an experience. \n\nIt\u2019s awkward to share deep emotional pain with someone who just sits there quietly staring at you waiting for you to finish. \n\nThen again, I\u2019ve lived through so much loss I\u2019m literally (not figuratively) numb to most things now. Your heart can only shatter so many times before there\u2019s nothing left other than the metaphorical duct-tape you\u2019ve used to patch the fractures over and over and over again. \n\nI absolutely agree that people should focus on listening instead of sharing, but I also think it\u2019s important to share and express that the person suffering is not alone and that experiences can be shared as conversation as a way to help both parties deal with their trauma in every stage of grief. \n\nYou\u2019ve clearly suffered a heart breaking loss. You are angry and hurt and sad and tired of hearing people say \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d or things like \u201cit Always gets worse before it gets better when I was a\u201d........\n\nI get it. But eventually and without even realizing it? You yourself will one day be the exact offender you are referring to now. Someone is going to come to you needing a good cry. You\u2019ll listen quietly and then there will be an awkward pause. In your concern for the other person you will attempt to comfort them only to realize the comfort you are trying to convey sounds shallow. \n\nHow can I let this person know they are not alone in their suffering? How can I possibly commiserate? Your brain asks itself in the background without you knowing. \n\nThe next words out of your mouth and almost without control will be. \u201cYou know, when I was going through this _________ really helped me and maybe\u201d......\n\nBeing human is about sharing the experience of being human. This includes our pain and suffering. Even trained professionals sometimes offer personal anecdotes. My point is, even though it feels like it? No one is trying to one up anyone else and even is we don\u2019t feel like hearing it? We still walk away from those conversations with a new perspective that ultimately helps us heal and move on from whatever tragedy we endured in the first place. \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that suffering is universal and not at all unique.",
            "Depends. Some people like to have advice or know they aren\u2019t alone with the feelings/experience. If in doubt, just ask what they\u2019ll like you to do",
            "This is a tough one because I feel like it's a personal preference thing. Everyone feels comforted in different ways. I definitley agree that some people just want to feel heard and validated, but I personally love when people share their own stories when I'm dealing with something difficult because it makes me feel less alone. It also helps to hear how other people deal with it.\n\nI remember I had a difficult time with counceling because I was expected to just share my deepest feelings without hearing someone's else's in return. I craved that balance of equal exchanges of feelings. Group therapy worked much better for me for that reason, because it wasn't as one sided which made me feel more comfortable being open.",

That is rude and something I hope I don't do.",
            "People do this because they're not equipped to handle grief just like you're not as well, so they rebound back to you by sharing a similar experience to show that they understand what you're going through, and is indicative that you're confiding in them information that they're uncomfortable receiving. If you're having trouble with emotional pain, the worst thing you can do is confide them in others and expecting them to actually listen and handle the matter properly.

            "I disagree. Partially. It\u2019s alright to share as long as you put it in a way that can help the other person learn from your experience or just to give them some hope so they can cope with the situation better.

It\u2019s important to listen to people and really hear out their experience as everyone\u2019s is very unique and processes it differently, but sharing your own experience is so important in order to validate the other persons feelings. I feel like if I were to tell someone about a tragedy in my life, if they just sit there and listen without contributing their own perspective, it\u2019ll make me feel like I\u2019m going through it alone. It\u2019s good to know the world hasn\u2019t ended and someone with similar pain has made it out ok. Not to mention, it\u2019s just simply how you carry a conversation; listen intently and provide your input.

            "That's awesome, OP. Your suggestion is definitely necessary for today's situation. I'd like to add when someone is sharing their difficulties with you, it's a major sign of trust, which can be difficult for a lot of people. When people share their difficulties with me, I like to begin with thanking them for trusting me and ensuring them that I won't share their private sufferings with other people. I then add something along these lines,\n\n\"Dude, that seriously sucks\"\n\n\"I can't even begin to imagine how awful your situation is. [Add a follow-up question]\"\n\n\"Holy crap that sucks, dude. You've got some serious strength to persevere through that and even more so to be able to talk about it\"\n\nAs long as your validating the person's feelings and acknowledging the difficult situation, you're on the right track. \n\nMoreover, a lot of people have commented that they think it's okay for people to share their similar experiences. That's fine; everyone has their own preferences. But I want to note that this ISN'T EMPATHY because it is still YOUR experience. When you share your experience, you're not acknowledging that this is a different person, with different experiences, and a different positionality. Telling your story to relate may work for some, but most of the time when people are talking about their difficult situations, they're trying to vent, not look for advice. \n\nHave a good day, y'all!",

Which is generally why people hide vulnerability, they fear being perceived as weak. Sitting in silence as someone spills their guts to you make me think either you A. Dont care or B.

As someone who is very anal about doing things 'precisely' and gravitates towards round numbers, I always have to remember to not let my life be controlled by fake rules. \n\nI personally define fake rules as any imaginary restriction which isn't actually based on any difference in outcome. If you're supposed to do something at 3 PM and it's 3:07, that's ok. If it's only a commitment to yourself, that deadline is a fake rule. Start at 3:08. Start at 3:21. \n\nRoutines don't need to be stuck to precisely. If I don't feel like, say, playing piano, I can still go sit down and just play something comfortable and easy. The need to  warm up is a fake rule. Practicing with a metronome is a fake rule too. Yes, those things help and will make you better, but not playing at all will make you worse than just spending 10 minutes going over something you already know.\n\nThe idea of doing things 'right' is very appealing to a certain kind of logic-loving brain, but the truth is that if you want to make progress the only way to do something wrong is to not do it at all. \n\nMotivation comes and goes, and on days when it's short on supply, it's okay to just do what you can.

            "Numbers are easy to communicate but they mask the real goal. Sometimes I can do 100 push ups. Sometimes I can do 150. But sometimes I can only do 50. Instead of hanging your success on an arbitrary number and setting yourself up for failure, make your goal a mindset.\n\nWhat is your goal? Better health? That's vague but a great place to start. Break it down. Here's where people focus on numbers. I'm only going to eat x calories and do x pushups. I plan to lose x pounds by x date. Even if you did everything perfectly, doesn't mean you will make your goal and it likely means you will struggle with maintaining it because you're forcing yourself to meet arbitrary numbers when your body is trying to tell you not today.\n\nInstead make your goals specific to mentality. I will try to make one healthy choice each meal. I will try to do as many pushups as I can each day. I will listen to my body, not over exert myself, and hold myself accountable to maintain these habits.\n\nInitially it's harder. We aren't used to achieving goals this way. We are used to pushing ourselves or bsing ourselves. Getting there through the power of self hate alone and then losing it all as we spiral back down. But as you practice the approach of doing what you can as you can, you see progress that didn't hurt to achieve. It was exactly at your pace that you set.",

With partial credit for only walking the dogs partway around the block. \n\nThere are also low point days though. 2/15 happens.

            "Former PT here. \n\nA sensible fitness YouTuber introduced me to what he called \u2018Incremental Commitment\u2019, which is an approach I used with all my clients after I watched that video. The idea is basically this: If you\u2019re new to running, for example, don\u2019t start with an arbitrary overall distance or time you\u2019re aiming for. Commit to small goals, achieve, evaluate, set a new small goal and repeat. So for running, it would be \u2018I\u2019m going to run up to that broken tree\u2019 and once you get there and you still have more in the tank, you go \u2018ok, I\u2019m going run to where the road curves\u2019 and so on. If you set a goal of \u2018I\u2019m going to run 5k\u2019 and you begin to feel out of breath at 1k, it\u2019s disheartening and makes you give up when you could possibly have made it to 2k if you had kept going. Incremental commitment makes you do the most you can and feel good instead of fail at something unrealistic and feel bad. \n\nSame dude also dropped this line which stuck in my head ever since - \u2018Any workout you do is better than the best workout you don\u2019t do.\u2019 If your normal workout takes an hour and you only have a half-hour to spare, do a condensed half-hour workout rather than skip the workout. You get your exercise in, you maintain even if you don\u2019t improve, and you don\u2019t get that nagging in your own brain that says \u2018Yup, that\u2019s how it starts, bud \u2026\u2019\n\nBoth these concepts can be extended to your life in general, not just workouts :)",

            "SMART Goals are almost a cliched topic at this point because it\u2019s effective because when you make something measurable you know if you succeeded or not. Something like \u201cget in shape\u201d is nebulous and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going fast enough, what you\u2019re measuring in shape by, etc.\n\nBut Id recommend approaching this very differently and I think it takes care of the problem itself. More effective then the incomplete thing, is the idea of setting an easy habit that you know you can succeed at but really makes a world of difference.\n\nEvery month I choose something new to work on that needs improving. With your gym example the fact that you say \u201cwhen I haven\u2019t been in a while\u201d means it\u2019s not really habitual for you so it\u2019s going to seem daunting. But if you make even a really small habit for this month and say I\u2019m going to go to the gym for 15 minutes three times a week, it\u2019s very easy for you, it\u2019ll make the habit less scary, etc. because if you haven\u2019t went and now can\u2019t hit your goals it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re trying to sprint when you haven\u2019t even been walking regularly.\n\nAnd I let that be a habit and maybe in six months from now I\u2019ll add on to the 15 minutes. I view life holistically and all the stats say to really only do one new habit at a time, so if you\u2019re only trying to improve working out then you can do it quicker but for me I might do January 15 minute work out three times a week February lower my daily calories to a 500 calorie deficit, March make a budget where i track spending and save $75 a week, April do big house projects I\u2019ve put off, etc. it\u2019s all how you prioritize it but it\u2019s all positive so there\u2019s no wrong way. And many of these you can take with you forever or alter when you need to or drop after a year, etc.\n\nAnd with all that comes off days. When trying to form a habit I like to give myself a 75% completion rate throughout the year as I track my progress. You\u2019re going to get sick sometimes, going to feel super burnt out, or super busy, so make it so if you have to miss a day it\u2019s no big deal. And you adjust your yearly goals to account for the fact that you\u2019ll miss up to 25% of the time you\u2019ve scheduled.",

Almost all of them. This is something that was totally invisible to me before. I didn't date men, and I would have assumed that kind of scary asshole would be much more rare and less likely among the kind of guys my friends would go out with in the first place. And not all women necessarily talk about these experience much unless prompted.\n\nBut they were getting threats, insults, stalking from guys who seemed normal until then.

Just manipulative. \"Is it my skin color? Is it that I'm not fluent in english?\" He even offered to take me on a \"business trip\" to Vegas in the height of a pandemic. It just never stopped despite me explaining over and over I'm not interested. I replaced my phone after blocking him for 4 months, and he still was messaging me.\n\nLetting certain people down nicely doesn't work.",

I haven\u2019t done online dating and it\u2019s always been people I had developed a relationship through something or a friend of a friend type of situation so at first this seemed like a nice LPT. But after reading this, it makes me really sad to see that people have to be literally afraid to reject someone. I don\u2019t get why people have to take rejections so personally, my anxiety with dating earlier in life went down dramatically when I learned to stop thinking about going on a date like an interview for some big job that I had to nail. I realized I\u2019m just looking for compatibility, and I never thought less of someone just because we were not a good dating match.

In recent years, he\u2019s been evasive about ever checking out anything I recommend while giving me a dozen very long things to watch with him (all of American Horror Story and Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventures for starters), and it hurts more than anything when he just goes on his phone while watching what I recommend, then not wanting to watch the last 3 episodes of a 25 episode series because he looked up who died in a battle royale setup show.

There are a lot of toxic people that will try to control you by giving you a lot of \"advice\" that is unhelpful at best and can lower your self worth and possibly lead it manipulative behavior at worst. Of course if it fails, instead of drawing you two nearer, the other party will either blame you for not doing it correctly and will deny ever giving you the advice in the first place. This creates a situation where you are always trying to subtly make it up to the other person and where the other person couldn't give a shit about you. \n\nAn example would be if I kept telling you your hair was messy and to do it up a certain way. Once or twice is alright. You may even agree with me but if I kept saying the same thing everyday and you didn't retaliate or show any boundaries, you could start getting insecure about your hair. I could then use this to my advantage and tell you how to feel. For instance, \"You're not unhappy because of your hair, your upset because you don't want to come to the concert with me\" or \"I don't think you're really upset, I think your having a bad day. We should go shopping to celebrate\". In that example, I am redirecting your emotions to manipulate you into buying something for me. I mean it's more complex than that but you get the gist.\n\nHere is some free advice, 90% of advice you hear is complete bullshit. No one knows you better than yourself so don't be afraid to assert yourself and set boundaries. Don't be afraid to contest other people if they try to give you bad or harmful advice and most importantly, do not value your relationship with them more than yourself. By all means, unless they are crossing a boundary, listen to what they have to say but know that you owe nothing to them no matter what and you can walk away from that conversation at no penalty. You'll find people will respect you a lot more when you respect yourself first and foremost.\n\nIt's like they say:-\nIf everyone hates you, you're doing something wrong but if everyone likes you, you're doing something really wrong.",

            "Most top comments seem to talk about how constantly recommending things isn't good either and while I agree, that is not the point. I have a roommate that I naturally recommend things too. You know - music, tv shows, things like that. She does the same. The difference, however, is that I actually take time to check her stuff out. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. My favourite tv show came from her recommendation and we've watches it together. It brought as closer than almost anything else we've done.\n\nBut one thing I can't get past is how she keeps turning me down every time I recommend something. I don't even get to finish the sentence before she tells me she's not interested. And it hurts. I know that it shouldn't, because that's what she's like with everyone. But it feels bad. I've watched whole tv shows and countless movies with her or because of her and sure, most I've enjoyed anyway, but the lack of her response in the same situation just makes me sad. So to the people commenting that constantly recommending stuff is bad - that is not what this post is about. It's a wake up call to people who keep disregarding their friends attempts to bring a common interest into the relationship. You think it's nothing, but it hurts.\n\nEdit: And the people talking about liking or disliking other people's recommendations - I'm not talking about watching whole tv shows or reading full books. A friend recommends a tv show? Watch a trailer, do five minutes of research and form some sort of first impression and then get back to that friend. Tell then your opinion, ask for theirs, ask why they like it. You'll learn more about them and deepen the relationship. You don't have to watch it, you don't have to like it, just show interest.",

No stopping until I am under $25,000.\n\nEdit for the questions:I was hit by a car by a lady on her phone, she was 100% at fault and was even ticketed on the scene.  My spine was crushed and they rebuilt me a new fancy one.  Thankfully the cord was not severed.  I was kicked out 7 days after the accident because the hospital was being turned into an overflow COVID wing.  The other driver had insurance, but it was the state minimum of 30k.  Welcome to the USA where you can only get the max of their insurance OR sue them personally.  If you sue them personally you can only get anything that is left after taking away their house, car, and a year salary.  That leaves nothing in this case.  I at most will get what is left over from the 30k. $30,000-My insurance cut (mandatory 10,000), my lawyer cut (1/3 of settlement mandatory), and court/filing fees (hoping to be less than a thousand).  Which leaves about $9,000 on a good day.

            "Just an FYI:  That doesn't always work, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  I had an emergency surgery last year that took less than 2 hours, got billed $65,000.  Insurance covered $54,000, leaving me with $11,000.  The bills were coming in from all directions, randomly, and some double-dipped.  I had to put together an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of them all, which was a major pain.  The hospital system started consolidating the bills, incorrectly.  I called them, tried to negotiate, they refused.  I started a payment plan for all of them (9 bills for different departments, each wanted $100-200 a month).  They sent it to collections after 3 months despite the fact that I was paying *more* than the minimum amount.  The collections agency said that this particular medical group was having an abysmal time with book-keeping due to a large merger, so they were offloading book-keeping to collections and that it wouldn't affect my credit.  I tried to negotiate again.  They said that my bills were flagged as such that I couldn't negotiate at all.  It was frustrating, especially since the medical system in the US punishes people who work for a living, follow the rules, and pay taxes.\n\nA few months later, my wife needed to go to the hospital for a simple procedure.

            "Another tip that sort of branches off from OP's idea:\n\nWhen you apply for the hospital's financial assistance program, you will still get a separate bill from the physician. The hospital will tell you that their financial assistance policy does not cover the physician's portion. In my experience, this is WRONG. A big fat lie. \n\nI am uninsured and without an income, (it's beyond my control, leave me alone). So when the above happened to me, the physician's portion went to collections. There was nothing I could do, despite calling and explaining my situation multiple times. When the charge appeared on my credit recently, a weeks-long battle began.\n\nSo, because of my situation, the hospital gave me a full write-off when I applied for financial assistance. I had to get a zero-balance letter from the hospital bill, then send that to the agency that generated the physician's bill. That in turn gave me a new zero-balance letter from that second agency. I gave THAT to the collections agency, and boom, $790 off my credit. \n\nSo if you end up stuck with that stupid physician's bill, call the number on that bill and ask for the name of the agency that generated the bill. Speak with this agency and send the hospital's zero -balance letter, and I would assume that should get the job done.",

            "On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may have the appearance of increasing Reddit's traffic and revenue... but in the long term, it will undermine the site as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep its platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to populate its numerous communities with content. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools (which Reddit has frequently promised and then failed to deliver), moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either, and without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit \u2013 the foundations that draw its audience \u2013 will be eliminated, reducing the site to another dead cog in the Ennui Engine.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not posture for your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. Focus on addressing Reddit's real problems \u2013 the rampant bigotry, the ever-increasing amounts of spam, the advantage given to low-effort content, and the widespread misinformation \u2013 instead of on a strategy that will alienate the people keeping this platform alive.\n\nIf Steve Huffman's statement \u2013 \"I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users\" \u2013 is to be taken seriously, then consider this our vote:\n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive."

They did stop, but I lost a close childhood friend because of it, and I definitely did NOT want to interact with the opposite sex for a long time because of comments my family made.

So I said no to that way too far into life. Also partly lead to me not telling my family anything about my personal life, and always keeping family/friends/work relationships separated, and not telling them about a relationship until basically I'm forced to.

I grew up lonely and frustrated and feeling unlovable and unattractive because I felt embarrassed to have crushes or to express interest. That awkwardness really did make me less attractive too. \n\nOP is dead on.

I stopped seeing him as much because we were usually at her house when we were all hanging out together. \n\nJust remembered that she also once teased me about my dad being my mum's 'toyboy' (my dad is about 8 years younger than my mum). I had no idea what it meant, only that it sounded a bit rude/sexual, and I was really embarrassed and confused.",

I do, however, have a few really good female friends I talk about all the time and since I *gasp* haven't had a boyfriend in a while whenever I mention my female friends they jokingly (and nervously) imply I'm together with one of them.  Why does any platonic relationship I have have to have some kind of romantic ulterior motive to my family??  Is it so hard to believe I'm more concerned with finishing my degree strong and establishing a career?

            "Same here. I have always got along better with girls (am a man), most of my best friends have been girls.

My parents and brother especially would tease me about having \"girlfriends\" and my brother and his friends would pick on my friends and me enough that they eventually just stopped coming around.\n\nOf course there were also the people when I got a little older who would take it as a sign of homosexuality, kept calling me gay etc. because I liked being friends with girls.

            "Another Life Pro Tip: a *lot* of open source software is shite, and some of it may require that you know what you're doing to get the right installable. \n\nFor example, GIMP is so hard to use compared to Photoshop, it's depressing. \"Gimp\" is an appropriate name for it indeed.\n\nA lot of the open source astro imaging software I use is truly, horrendously poorly designed and extremely quirky and buggy. \n\nFor example, one program I use has sliders to adjust values. The way it's been programmed, it cannot handle adjustments using a trackpad. The input rate is too high, and it chokes out. You have to use a mouse. When you click into a text input field, it auto-highlights the existing value. Convention dictates that when a value in a text input field is highlighted, it will be replaced with what you start typing. Not so in this piece of software - it prepends the value you started typing to the existing value, while keeping it highlighted. This means changing a simple numeric value in this program is *obnoxious*. Can't really use a mouse out in the field, so you have to use the trackpad, and the text inputs don't behave properly. So you're basically just fighting simple value adjustments all night.\n\nAnother piece of astro imaging software I use also has value sliders. Except the nature of the program means the difference between a value of 1.005 and 1.008 is substantial. Yet moving the slider just a couple of pixels translates to increments in the tens place, rather than the thousands place. So the slider is patently useless since it's hyper-sensitive and poorly scaled. Also, you can't actually click and drag to slide it. You have to click along the slide bar where you want the pointer to be, and THEN the value will change. So it's not even really a slider at all...\n\nThat's the kind of wonky shit you deal with when you start using open source software. So just set your expectations accordingly.",

Steam, water and the gunk will flow out.\n\nOnce all the water is gone, let the iron sit, on high heat, until it cycles off. Once completely cool, start it up like normal and do the towel trick. ",

Believe me mate, limescale is the fucking least of my worries when ironing....\n\nI wear expensive dress shirts.  Not bespoke but usually 200 thread count.  They cost around $300 USD each, some cost more, some cost less. \n\nThe real problem hotel hotel irons is not mineral deposits which can be brushed off, but MELTED CARPET!   Yes, hotel irons are forever being dropped on the fucking carpet by clumsy idiots.   Well, not necessarily their fault as the irons usually suck and the ironing boards wobbly. \n\nWhat you DO NOT want to do is iron a $300 shirt or even a $30 shirt using an iron with melted carpet on the hotplate.  \n\nSo my pro tip:  before you iron check the hotplate.  If it is clean, no problems.   If it has melted carpet do the following: take the hand towel from the bathroom and wet it.  Turn the iron to max heat and let it heat up.   Once hot put the wet towel on the edge of the ironing board and scrape the iron on the wet towel in attempt to remove as much of the melted carpet as possible.  A good amount of it should transfer to the wet towel.  Do not feel guilty about wrecking the hotel\u2019s hand towel as these fuckers wanted you to ear melted carpet on your expensive shirts. \n\nOnce you can no longer remove any more melted carpet from the iron it will be safe to iron your shirt. \n",

Take it out of water and use a nail file or popsicle stick and gently pry the nail upward for several minutes. This magic trick somehow helps get the nail to start growing in the right direction and the toe is instantly relieved. It works every time for me.\n\nEdited to add note: I do this prying thing when I start to feel my toenail growing in the wrong direction. Do this at the first signs of slight discomfort and it will hopefully prevent the toenail from becoming ingrown and infected. If you\u2019re already at that point, I would be cautious about this method and consult your doc if it\u2019s serious. I think OP was also referring to this initial discomfort stage as well.

Anyway - I used to get ingrown toenails on both big toes all the time. Dr would tell me to always cut your toenails straight across - no matter how weird or ugly it looked, then just clip the corners off so they weren\u2019t sharp. I did it and it helps a lot. I\u2019ve done the cotton under the nail, I\u2019ve soaked my toes in epsom salt, got in there and dig them out. Nothing really helped. \n\nI would have to go to the Dr about them once a year or so - to have him cut them out. They would just come back. It got to the point where they would get infected and fucking stink and get all inflamed. I can remember just tapping the top of my toe against something and the pain - the pain was like a big, hot ass needle being shoved into the tip of my toes. And it was always both of them, all the time. \n\nFinally during my spring break going into my senior year in HS, my mom made me go back to the Dr. he completely cut out the roots of both big toes. It was nuts - I remember this guy using that liquid freezing stuff and spraying it on my toes so he could inject the needles into the knuckles of my big toes - like a damn dentist does to your teeth - except it\u2019s your suckin ass toes. Then the guy broke out some nail clippers that looked like bone cutters. He cut my nails man - like from the tip, all the down the SIDE to where the second nail under that one is - I don\u2019t know what\u2019s it\u2019s called. Then he stopped and got a scalpel and cut the rest out - down past the ROOTS like he was cutting a steak. I was mortified. The blood, I was trippin out. I\u2019m trippin our about it now thinking about it. Finally he sutured the nail through the nail and into the side of my toe to close it up. Repeat 2nd foot. Both fucking toes man. I was disfigured and it was spring break in Virginia Beach...\n\nI could barely walk for my entire spring break - it hurt so bad I had to wear Birkenstock\u2019s with socks and each toe looked like a wrapped up tennis ball. It sucked. \n\nBut - to this day - like 30 plus years later they haven\u2019t come back lol. And to the day I cut those damn things straight across, keep them super clean and wear shoes the right size or a little larger. \n\nFuck ingrown toenails - they\u2019re the devil.",

THATS WHAT LEADS TO INGROWN NAILS IN THE FIRST PLACE!\n\nI get doctors can be expensive and medicine too, but if you have an ingrown nail make sure to have it medically taken care of before there is an infection and things get worse. \n\nAll I can think of is this solution is like popping a pimple. Sure the white puss is gone but now you have a red open wound. It can heal or it can scar. Take this tip with a grain of salt."

I still hate April Fools because of it, I consider it a day when people who are naturally cruel feel validated in making other people suffer.

We hear her go into the bathroom, and we are wating anxiously, hoping she dries her hair in the morning. Suddenly she scream \"son of a bitch\" as the drier turns on and she comes out with white all over her, and gives R the finger with a little smirk as we are laughing. But she is looking the other way and walks right through the cellophane as she is giving the finger to us laughing at her. We both almost lose it. She rips it off her face and throws it at us.\n\nStill hardly awake, she says, \"There better not be any more\" and walks over to grab a cup of coffee. Take takes a sip, and spits it all over the place, and rushes over to the sink to get a cup of water, and of course it totally sprays her.\n\nR and I are on the floor nearly in stitches. R keeps saying \"I can't believe I got her with so many!\" T is not happy, not happy at all.\n\nThey were all harmless, and in retrospect T laughs about it now.

That means the IRS may not have enough information to issue their payment.\nThe free\u00a0Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\u00a0tool is available in English and Spanish.\n\nPeople who don't normally file a tax return may be eligible for an EIP if they:\n\nAre a U.S. citizen, permanent resident\u00a0or\u00a0qualifying resident alien\n\nHave a work-eligible Social Security number\n\nCannot be claimed as a dependent of another taxpayer\n\nTo use the tool, a person needs:\n\nName, as it appears on Social Security card, for self and spouse, if they are eligible\n\nA work-eligible SSN for self and spouse, if they are eligible\n\nFor each\u00a0qualifying child, name, relationship and SSN or Adoption Tax Identification Number\n\nAn email address to help create an account to use the Non-Filers tool\n\nA mailing address where they can receive the payment and a confirmation letter, which the IRS will mail within 15 days after issuing their payment\n\nBanking information, including routing and account numbers, if they want their payment via direct deposit\n\nAn Identity Protection Personal Identification Number, if the IRS sent one in the past. If a person lost it, they can use the\u00a0Get an IP PIN\u00a0tool at IRS.gov to retrieve their number\n\nThe Non-Filers tool asks for a user's license or state ID number to digitally sign the document. There are other ways to do this, so an ID is optional in the tool.\nIf someone wants their payment by direct deposit but doesn't have a bank account, they can visit the\u00a0FDIC website\u00a0for help. The IRS will mail a payment to anyone who doesn't give direct deposit information.\n\nOther key points about Economic Impact Payments\n\nThe IRS highly recommends the online\u00a0Non-Filers tool\u00a0for the fastest Economic Impact Payment.\n\nPeople who can't access or use the tool should follow the steps in the\u00a0Non-Filers tool section\u00a0of the\u00a0Economic Impact Payment FAQs. Someone who mails a simplified paper tax return to get their Economic Impact Payment, rather than using the Non-Filers tool, must submit it by\u00a0Thursday, October 15, 2020.\n\nIf someone misses the November 21 deadline, they can claim the payment as a credit on a 2020 federal income tax return next year.\n\nThe payment is not taxable income and getting one does not affect eligibility for other benefits, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, unemployment benefits or other benefit programs.\n\nPeople can use the\u00a0Get My Payment\u00a0tool at IRS.gov within two weeks to check their payment status.",

You could help them fill out the 1040s with their personal info, name, SSN, etc. claim the recovery rebate credit on the 1040 to get them their 1800 and that's pretty much it. \n\nThen you could use the organization's mailing address on the 1040 so you can be sure the checks or cash cards are coming to a reliable mailing address and be distributed as the govt pays them out",

And another thing: owners and managers are people too.

Instead, just call the police. Do not exchange insurance info without police present. When the police arrive, allow them to get a statement from the \"victim.\" When they come to you for a statement, show them your dashcam footage. Falsifying a police statement is illegal, and they will not only be caught red handed scamming someone, but their charges will be more severe for falsifying a statement. Plus if they are in a vehicle when they tried to scam you, their insurance premiums will probably go through the roof. Remember, if they tried to scam you, they have tried to scam someone else, and are likely going to continue trying to scam others in the future. Let's stop allowing them to get away with it so easily.\n\nUpdate: Lots of really good discussion. Plenty of people who think my LPT is crap, and that's fine! Happy to see people having good discussions and sharing their own experiences, and how/why this LPT might not be good advice for people in their areas. \n\nAlso, lots of questions on what dashcam to purchase and how they work. I got a $45 dollar dashcam from Amazon. It had pretty good reviews, which is what I look for in a product. They come with a memory card, which stores the video as your drive. When the card gets full, it should automatically delete the oldest video's to fit the new videos. If an accident occurs, your pull the memory card and plug into your computer to save the video you want. The dashcam plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter. As far as I know, no dashcam records multiple viewpoints. You will need to purchase more than one dashcam if you want front, rear, and side facing dashcams. Hopefully this helps to address some of the questions I have seen.\n\nUpdate #2: someone says  dash cams that record multiple angles at once do exist. I didn\u2019t know this, but great info!

It was minimal damage so I said I would be happy to call the non emergent police line and pass along the information. The girl wrote down her name, address and phone number on a paper for me. She said she didn\u2019t have car insurance yet and she was worried. I wrote down her license plate. I told her my dad could fix my bumper. We went about our merry ways. I called police and turns out she gave me all false information other than the first letter of her name. Her stationary had an A on it. The police asked if I wanted to press charges. Initially I wasn\u2019t going to but my car had more damage than anticipated and it was easier to go through insurance. TBH if she didn\u2019t lie to my face I wouldn\u2019t have said shit and just had my dad fix my car. The cops were able to track her down from the plate and give her two tickets. Sorry Abby. I hope you got insurance.",

            "I have a story that made me get a dash cam - but it still ended good. \n\nWoman rear ends me while I\u2019m sitting at a red light. There\u2019s is one car in front me which I was pushed in to. She was going 15mph or so, really got me good though. \nShe gets out and was very sorry and clearly distraught. Takes full blame, we exchange info and move on. I immediately go to my attorney as I recommend every does, and tell him the story. Rear ended at a red light, not many ways to twist this one up. A week or so later, my attorney says that she told her insurance that I hit the car in front of her first, resulting in her hitting me. Which of course, still puts her at some fault since she would have been following me too closely. Regardless, her insurance was fighting tooth and nail to put us at 50/50 fault. I was like hell no. I went to every business on the street within a viewing distance and was finally able to find a place with a street facing surveillance camera. Mind you this is almost 2 weeks post accident now. Sure enough, they had the footage. They were kind enough to email it to me and I sent that off to my attorney. They immediately took full blame after that. \n\nMoral of the story.

When she finally came to a stop, I threw on my hazard lights and went to go and check on her since I wasn't hurt and I was worried something was wrong with her that caused her to hit me, and the first thing that POS said to me was: *\"What the hell?! You didn't see me turning?!\"*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**MADAM, YOU DROVE INTO *MY* CAR THAT WAS AT A FULL STOP!**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI called the cops for documentation, and since there weren't any witnesses, they said it was my burden of proof to show the insurance companies I wasn't at fault. So I sat my happy ass down at the impact site, took videos and pics of the impact site, the debris of my (and her) car in the road, and for good measure took TEN videos of people cutting that turn too closely from the main road to illustrate that with the other evidence, she was at fault.\n\n\n\n\nI'll never forget her being pissed AT ME because she hit MY car. I was involved in 2 more car accidents (which I wasn't at fault for) after that and I can barely stand to drive anymore, I'm so worried about other drivers. I still have yet to buy dash-cams but they can be invaluable for liability claims. \n\n\nAs much as I don't want to have a video of me loudly (and poorly) singing in my car, dash cams would have saved me a lot of headache in the long run",

He got out of his vehicle all yelling and screaming and whatnot.  I told him that it was he that pulled out into traffic and that I had right of way.  This guy was about to lose his shit.  Apparently he was a Marine, so he could not have made a mistake, and he believed that he somehow had powers to get me arrested.  I had my wife and two kids in the car with me, so I didn't want to escalate the situation.  I pointed towards my car and told him that I had a dash cam that had not only recorded him pulling out into traffic and causing the accident, but also of him acting like a buffoon.  I lied, I didn't have a dash cam, but my wife was recording him on her primitive mid 2000's flip phone from the passenger seat.  The blood drained out of his face, and he promptly turned around and jumped back into his car and drove off like a moron.  Well the cops came and took a report.  I had noted his license plate, so they had him.  Turns out he was in a rental, so the rental car company's insurance paid out to repair my car, but also provided the police his information.  Since there is a military base nearby, and he was most likely associated with it, I took all of the information I got from the police and the insurance company and turned it over the military police on base.  I don't know what happened to him after that, but I can assume the military wouldn't like active duty soldiers pulling something like this.",

Over the last 5 years and counting he's become a spiritual guru type of person...you know the type that wears crystyals and bracelets with healing rocks, he meditates under a pyramid, says he can astral project and whatnot. This went from him being really interested in something that I honestly thought was an interesting hobby, to him being an authority on it and basically telling me he could confirm whether or not world events were A) Actually happening and B) How they were happening or how they actually happened. Nothing I say is accepted by him because in his mind everyone who disagrees with him is under a spell of some spiritual dark force/energy vampire. If you have a view different from him he looks down on you. He believes Trump is saving the world behind the scenes, freeing enslaved children from sex rings, and that JFK Jr isn't dead. \n\nThis guy lives in his parent's basement and does not have a job. Hasn't had one in 6-7 years. Besides diving deep into these things he believes, I don't know what he does. \n\nNow, I am a pretty open-minded person and I can entertain other schools of thought and theories about different things from different perspectives. BUT there has to be a line of probability, possibility, and insanity. He's become a bully about his beliefs and he will text me with his doom and gloom forecast for world events. I've resorted to not responding to him about those things with the hopes that he'll get the message that I'm not interested in talking with him about any of that stuff anymore. The only reason I'll talk with him at all is because he is my dear cousin that I grew up with. He's not entitely the same as he used to be and it's because of these far-fetched beliefs he's acquired and sunk his life into. In a way I feel like I've lost him but part of me is willing to try and hold onto some part of it since we grew up so close. \n\nI don't see it ending well unless he stops with that shit and stops bullying people into believing what he believes.",

There is literally almost *nothing* you can do to stop these websites from tracking your actions. I can't believe there haven't been MASSIVE class-action lawsuits against these companies before now. The current private-browsing suit doesn't even scratch the surface.\n\nEven when you delete your Cookies, clear your Cache, and use a VPN or a browser like Brave (effectively telling websites you do NOT want to be tracked), these websites will still track & build every action you take into a robust profile about who you are, what you like, and where you go.\n\nThis goes deeper than just websites. Your Spotify music history is added into this profile, your Alexa searches, your phone's GPS data, any text you have typed into your phone, and more. Companies like Amazon and Google purchase all of this and build it into your profile.\n\nSo when you are 'Fingerprinted' by these websites, it's not just your past website history they are attaching to your session. It's **every single thing about you.**\n\nThis should be illegal; consumers should have the right to private sessions, should they chose. During this time of quarantine, there is no alternative option: we are forced to use many of these sites. As such, this corporate behavior is unethical, immoral, and in legal terms, a contract of adhesion as consumers are forced into wildly inappropriate terms that erase their privacy.\n\n**TL;DR LPT**: You are being fingerprinted and tracked by Google, Amazon, every other major website.

More of a moral failing than a privacy one, but good to know nonetheless. I added brave in post due to people recommending I do so, and now I'm adding this blurb because *other* people recommended I do so.\n\n[Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/) - allows you to see and automatically turn off embedded trackers\n\n[Ublock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) - blocks ads that might have their own trackers.\n\n[Duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - a search engine that does not track and does not profile its users.\n\n[HTTPSEverywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - automatically changes eligible urls to https, preventing eavesdropping and helping encrypt data. Does not block fingerprinting, but can help prevent direct attacks.\n \n# Virtual Private Network(VPN): \n\n[ProtonVpn](https://protonvpn.com/) - shields your traffic, does not log any data, and has plenty of really fast networks around the world. (Also the basic plan is free, but show your support by buying if you can.)\n\n[Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/) - offers better privacy than protonVPN, but is more technically obtuse than protonVPN, and costs 5 Euro monthly.\n\n\n# Sledgehammer Protection (for when you really, REALLY need to stay private):\n\n[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) - long story (incredibly) short, it is a browser with a special kind of private network that provides close to complete network anonymity \n\n[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html) - an operating system run off a usb that literally erases the entire filesystem every time you shut down your computer.\n\n[NoScript](https://noscript.net/) - allows you to disable scripts globally, which can prevent malicious attacks against your system.\n\n\n[Privacy.com](https://privacy.com/) - allows you to create online bank cards to use for purchases. I don't trust it, but some do.\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously every type of security is vulnerable, but taking simple steps to protect your privacy is important. Especially by getting CSec normies to start using firefox/brave/etc. Which is why I provided all these short explanations for everything I listed.\n\nExtra links from other redditors:\n\nhttps://amiunique.org\n\nhttps://panopticlick.eff.org/\n\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ - Keeps all site cookies in separate containers.\n\nhttps://www.privacytools.io/browsers/#about_config\n\nhttps://sereneblue.github.io/chameleon/ - /u/NeonHaggis: It is made specificly to block and prevent fingerprinting by changing your profile eg screen size, language, browser, OS etc.\n\nhttps://nextdns.io/ - /u/triangleman83: I'm using https://nextdns.io/ as my dns servers in my router, it blocks a lot of requests to tracking and ad sites.\n\n\n***Edit***: I'd like to add something since I'm getting a lot of comments that essentially amount to \n\n>Bro that stuff won't fully protect you, install gentoo\n\nI'm making and adding stuff to this guide that regular non Comp Sci nerds can use easily and without hassle that will upgrade their security by miles. It's a CSec junkies hubris to think that a majority of people are willing to put up with not using Amazon or Google services, and that they're willing to troubleshoot the litany of problems that may arise while using more dense solutions.\n\nA lot of people just want things to work, and by making computer privacy less obtuse it helps everyone out.",

Use the vm for a while and dump it after a few weeks, go back to the snapshot.\n\nAll user files are saved on the host.\n\nPasswords are kept in a manager with the file saved in Dropbox and the client available on the guest and host.\n\nHost is connected via VPN.\n\nNot perfect, but better than nothing\n\nEdit:\n\nEli5 + how to:\n\nA vm is a program that simulates a computer. This means, you can run an operating system inside the program, in a window or in full screen.\nThe simulating computer is called host, and the simulated is called guest.\n\nThe program running the simulation is the VM. In my case, VirtualBox (by Oracle). There you can also define the (simulated) hardware, network settings etc. Since the simulation is running inside a software, it is very hard for websites accessed from within the simulation to gather information regarding the simulating system.\nTo enhance security even more, the VM creates a virtual network adapter, so websites only see this artificial MAC address.\nSince the host is connected to a VPN server, the 'gateway' is also obscured.\n\nSnapshots are saved states of this simulation. This means, I could copy the simulated computer to another host and continue where I left, or I could erase the simulated machine and reset it to the saved state.\n\nHow to:\n\nVPN : find a trustworthy provider, pay them and get the service. Each service comes with installation instructions and tools. Personally I've used ExpressVPN for a long time, have beed very happy. This goes on the host computer.\n\nVM: im happy with virtualbox. Easy and free. Follow the instructions on their website. This installs on the host.\n\nGuest: you need an operating system. You can buy a windows, or download your favorite Linux or anything else. I have many Linux machines, elementary is good and so is pop!OS. You will run the vm program and load the downloaded iso file in the virtual CD drive. Once this is done, you can boot up to the guest, set it up and eject the iso from the virtual CD.\n\nI hope you all will enjoy a safe browsing.",

Users of these services agree to the terms of service, privacy policies, etc. so you can't act too surprised when they do the thing you have them permission to do. And second, the class action suit is pretty shortsighted. It seems to me that those involved never bothered to research what it actually does, and are upset that the feature didn't live up to their idealized, exaggerated belief. Incognito mode basically just prevents your own browser from adding what you do to it's own history, cache, etc. I don't recall seeing any claims that it does anything more than that. If you sign into a website, that website obviously knows that you signed in and are using it regardless of any browser settings, and those websites you sign in to will continue to operate within their rights and permissions to share information with third party advertisers etc. I just wish people would actually read the TOS and EULA and research how the internet works before getting up in arms about how they were lied to and how this should be illegal. If you feel so strongly about it, just don't use those services and don't explicitly give them permission to do those things.",

            "Hi since there are comments asking for it here is how to put a plug in this fuckery in tiers\n\n(Ranging from very basic trusting the companies to what any average Joe can do to wearing a tinfoil hat).\n\n---Asking third parties to stop tracking ---\n\n\nStep one. Google. Google harvest a lot of data from you phone, especially if you have an android phone. Good news you can get a copy of this data though it will take a few days to come through (this is part of GDPR compliance so I have no idea if this works in the US where regulations are considered bad for some reason)\n\nSee here \n\nhttps://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en\n\nSee also here for then getting Google to delete said data\n\n\nhttps://support.google.com/websearch/answer/465?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0\n\nAnd finally how to ask Google very nicely to stop this nonsense here\n\nhttps://support.google.com/websearch/answer/6139018?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Android\n\n\nFor the iPhone users who is privacy conscious I say to you, why the fuck do you have an iPhone, and then constructively point you at\n\nHttps://privacy.apple.com\n\n\nIf you want to stop Facebook doing all this I'm going to be frank, I don't use Facebook so I don't know and I doubt there are options to turn these features off. Twitter is also a shit for this. Reddit also is ironically enough a bit shit for this. The whys and how's some firms get away with this are the conversation of choice for many boring people. So let's see what we can do about it.\n\n\n---stopping tracking scripts anyway---\n\nA brief explanation about how whatever data is being collected is being collected. There are a few ways, sometimes things like what browser you are using are sent in what's called a HTTP header field. Other times its returned to an analytics API server by a script run on the web page.\n\nThis last part is where most of the interesting data comes from. But how does a script run on a web page? Well it's code like what your browser it's self is made from but instead of a pre-compiled blob in the form of an executable it's just a lump of code rest to be compiled when it needs to be run? What runs it? Your browser!\n\nIf your interested in the technical background on that I suggest reading up on JavaScript and the chrome V8 engine\n\nHow do we stop these sites running tracking code? Blocking plugins! Ones that actually work at that.\n\nUblock origin is a good place to start, it'll block ads on a lot of stuff and lets you control things like turning off JavaScript on a page or disabling remote fonts.\n\nFor more specific anti tracking utilities something like Disconnect for Firefox would be the way to go.\n\n\nThere are of course even if you disable things on services and block things at the browser level details that are tracked. Namely your public IP address and the site you visited. So where you're going and where you've come from.\n\nThis data isn't nearly as valuable in analytics as how long you've spent on something at a certain time of day for example but it's a start. How do we block\n\n----how to over engineer a solution---\n\nWARNING: This is where it stops being easy and beginner friendly and starts assuming a good chunk of technical ability. This isn't something I'd recommend someone who doesn't work in or study the field attempt. On the other hand if you have a good friend who usually you go to for your IT problems asking them to set this up for you will be an absolutely terrible bonding experience\n\nBefore attempting any of the following I recommend you\nA: have a basic understanding of TCP/IP networking\nB:know how to use a Linux or BSD system\nC:Are familiar with acronyms like IaaS, TOR, IKE, TLS, DOH and most importantly RTFM\nD: understand PKI to the point you can make your own and use good crypto standards (Edwards curves, SHAKE all that hot new jazz)\n\n\nAs this already assumes quite a lot of knowledge I'll keep this conceptual and leave the implementation up to you with the following base technologies.\n\nOpenVPN  as your VPN client. This has always just worked for me and is cross platform\n\nAdguards DNS proxy because this worked for me and I have no other reason to suggest it if you know a better DNS proxy software use that.\nhttps://github.com/AdguardTeam/dnsproxy\n\nProxy-chains makes this easier imo \n\nA domain name that supports dynamic update features (Google domains works fine for me)\n\nIaaS provider of your choice.\n\n\nThere are a million and two ways to route this traffic all with different levels of security and different performance impact. I reckon the most bearable is something similar to as follows\n\nSetup the VPS as an openvpn server, tor proxy and DNS proxy. Also Dyn DNS client to update your dynamic entry\n\nVPS should have a dynamic public address that is auto updated in the DNS record\n\nMake sure the proxy servers are only bound to the private IP. The only connections you should allow in are SSH (TCP/22)  and whatever port you want OpenVPN to use. It's probably ok to let any traffic out from the server but it's not best practice. Cloud firewalls can be a ball ache to find out if something is being blocked so usually atleast during set-up I take the silly approach.\n\nHave that IaaS server proxy all TCP traffic into an onion routing node. As your default route on client would be to the OpenVPN server with IP forwarding it would NAT that traffic behind the server and send it to a TOR node for routing obfuscation.\n\nYour DNS requests take the same route after being proxied for TLS encryption, that way even if your end device doesn't support DNS over HTTPS you've encrypted the DNS request as traffic to the proxy is encrypted and then the proxy makes the request over TLS\n \nCongratulations all your traffic looks like it comes from TOR and your ISP can't block stuff on DNS name because they can't do DNS interception\n\nUse your own PKI for the OpenVPN certificates give clients the chain, you are in control of what devices trust you\n\nOh and use TLS 1.3 where you can, cert pinning good.\n\n--Tinfoil hat--\n\nThrow all your electronics away and move to the Seychelles. Make sure you boil all your water before you drink it even if it's bottled. You need to make sure there are no chemicals that turn the frogs gay. Become a carpenter and go to church. God will protect ur privacy\n\n\n--a note on messaging apps--\n\nCreate a Riot server with all the crypto I mentioned for general traffic . Signal needs a phone number (suspecto)",
            "A lot of people here gave many all-or-nothing doomsday solutions. In reality there are a lot of **easy and relatively reliable** ways to stop being tracked and fingerprinted.\n\nFirst of all, **install adblocker** on your browser. Ad this moment, uBlock is the best. Adblockers remove a lot of scripts from websites which means less data to use for fingerprinting.\n\nIt's really recommended to **change your browser to anything that isn't Chrome** (or Edge). Firefox preferably, bc they do a lot to mitigate fingerprinting. No matter what you use, go through your browser settings and look for privacy/security tab. Usually you can change things for better.\n\nNext, **do not log in with facebook or google accounts anywhere**. They don't need fingerprinting if you just tell them what you use and what you do, right? It also helpes with fingerprinting itself if they can match all your devices easily.\n\nMaybe you can **change some apps to more privacy-friendly**? [Here](https://prism-break.org/en/) and [here](https://www.privacytools.io/) you can get some great recommendations.\n\nPrivacy and security is never an all-or-nothing thing.

            "The genie is it of the bottle on this technology.   Rather than make it illegal, we need to regulate it and make it completely transparent in what data is collected and how.

Users must be notified within 24 hours prior to the sale of their data and have the right to opt out of the proposed sale of their data in an easy and automated process.\n- companies that fingerprint or collect data must provide a complete list of all data that are gathered and the frequency at which it is gathered.\n- the origin metadata of all accrued data must be preserved including but not limited to:\n  - device ID or ime number\n  - date and time stamp\n  - application that gathered the data\n- anonymous data may still be gathered that will not be owned by the user so long as it's not used to tie to a specific user or generate user profiles.  This data must also be available for inspection for all users that contribute to the data pool\n\nThat's just the list I can think of off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more that should be included.

            "Software Engineer here. It's unreasonable to say that there should be a way to declare your actions 100% anonymous while on the web. I know this is an unpopular opinion among consumers but there are many more considerations to this than just being tracked. Much of that telemetry comes from what happens on the service side on our machines not yours. Legally, the companies own it and it would be an uphill battle trying to argue otherwise. But some of that data IS actually yours, so let's talk a bit about what a good actor in the industry uses it for and what legislation could better protect us as individuals but still preserve the internet as we know it.\n\nWe use telemetry of usage to detect and solve bugs in the system, determine which features to prioritize, and generally make the experience better for the consumer. We couldn't effectively do those things without the usage data we log.\n\nThen there's a security angle to it. We need auditing to tell us what actions users have done, so that when we come under attack (Which I will tell you happens frequently) we can go back and see what kind of damage was done. As a consumer, if I have to tell you that your data has been breeched, you want to know how it happened, how much was taken, and how to secure yourself moving forward. This is only possible because of my auditing data.\n\nI'm not fond of the way personal data that's collected is sold, but it is in a way the life blood of the internet as we know it. We've all grown accustomed to free services such as YouTube and Facebook that we don't pay for but get great amounts of joy from. As they say, when you don't have to pay for a product, you are the product. I'm actually okay with this exchange so long as it's transparent.\n\nThe EU passed their privacy legislation GDPR which allows their citizens the right to be forgotten. This means that as a EU citizen you can go to any service and use an online form or send an email requesting they delete everything they know about you within 30 days or face stiff penalties (this isn't 'stiff penalties' they are almost draconian). This is a fantastic first step that if adopted by globally would give everyone a significant amount of control over their data. There was a lot of humbug when this legislation first came about from the software industry that it would destroy the internet because the expectations were unrealistic. But hey look at that... we made the changes and are doing it now. Fun fact, most major services will actually treat your forget me request the same regardless of your country  of origin. So if you want to be forgotten, give it a shot.\n\nWhat legislation I believe we should further push is transparency and visibility. Did you know that you can download the entire file Google or Facebook has on you? It's a nifty feature, unfortunately not many users know it exists. These were voluntary measures, I'd love to see legislation making this feature a requirement for any data owner. I'd also like to see the exchange of information brought forward on sites collecting it about you, rather than hiding it deep in their terms of service.\n\nImagine you jump on Youtube and watch a few videos. Google infers that you have an interest in power tools based on the videos. Your browser dispatches a push notification that simply states the question, \"Are you looking for power tools.\" and as a user you can elect to respond to the prompt with Yes, No, or Forget that.",

Rotate the sim card every few months.\n\n - don\u2019t let anyone else use your secure phone/device for anything beyond maybe an emergency phone call.\n\n - don\u2019t use any online service that requires a login. No, not even the Brony fanfiction forum where you are only known as FlyRightSparkle69. And don\u2019t use such services from anyone else\u2019s device either.\n\n - use a trusted secure VPN provider with many rotating servers for everything (Tor is optional here IMO) \u2014 and realize that there\u2019s a decent chance that the VPN provider could be selling you out or in fact be wholly owned by the exact organizations you are trying to evade.\n\n - block ads and tracking cookies at the network request level (not the response level) and make sure this applies to all devices. Block every domain from FB and Google (Amazon optional). Expect that a *lot* of the web will be broken for you.\n\n - use a privacy focused browser that disables cookies and all forms of local storage completely. Make sure it spoofs all device identifiers, such as the User-Agent String, and that it counteracts fingerprinting by disallowing access to things like plugins and installed fonts. Even more of the web will be unusable for you.\n\n - find an ISP that will rotate your IP dynamically and set it to refresh at least once every day; using a 4G hotspot that you reboot daily can be an easy way to do this\n\n - optionally leave your home Wifi unencrypted to get your leeching neighbors\u2019 internet habits lumped in with yours to add noise to the signal\n\n - no smart home devices\n\n Do the above for everyone in your household and teach them to follow the practices mentioned.\n\nPros: could actually work for long periods of time\n\nCons: you can\u2019t really have a normal, modern life\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nPractical:\n\n - set Do Not Track in your browsers\n\n - use as few social media platforms and apps as possible, and configure the privacy settings on the ones you decide to keep\n\n - consider using a different email alias for every online account you have/make. Don\u2019t use social media SSO (like Login with Facebook). Many sites sell your data, so you want to make sure they don\u2019t know who you really are or have anything (like a reused username) that could link their data to an account on another site\n\n - consider using a trusted secure VPN provider for everything\n\n - use a good adblocker (I mention again uBlock Origin) everywhere you can, and learn how to configure it. Disable setting of third party cookies in all browsers (Safari does this by default, which is why ad people hate it)\n\n - clear cookies and local application data on all devices pretty regularly\n\n - don\u2019t answer surveys, don\u2019t take quizzes, just don\u2019t submit your actual info where you don\u2019t have to\n\n - use Wifi on your smartphone as little as possible; use it at home if you must, but try to avoid connecting to other networks if you can, especially places you go a lot, like work, friends & family\n\nPros: it\u2019s pretty low effort and you can still live your life with the wonders of the internet and normal human social interactions etc.\n\nCons: it won\u2019t actually work all that well; you\u2019ll still be tracked pretty effectively by organizations that know what they\u2019re doing, but you\u2019ll be pretty well covered against most common tracking methods",

Most young dogs in shelters 6-18 months old, are there because of a lack of training or behavior issues brought on by careless or inappropriate husbandry. Dogs literally in there due to not being potty trained, because they're insecure messes due to socialization issues (Covid puppies are filling shelters now) and many other things that get MAGNIFIED in shelter environments. \n\nDogs and puppies are cute but there are extremely real consequences to owning one. Dogs that get dumped back into the shelter system have a much smaller chance of making it out alive and if they do their potential has been permanently damaged and there is a high likelihood of lingering echoes of past issues.\n\nLastly, most shelter staff do not know very much about the dogs that are up for adoption. I hate to break it to you but a lot of the times descriptions are a misrepresentation of the dog that you're adopting, as well as downplaying known issues. Every animal in a shelter or rescue is a product, and it is in the best interest of the organization to move them sooner rather than later.

They left her behind!

That being said, they will still notify you via mail and not use phone as the first attempt. Also important (as I\u2019ve read in some comments) the IRS do not use local police as enforcement, and they do not accept pre-paid gift cards (lord the amount of people I\u2019ve heard from \u201cpaying their taxes\u201d with iTunes gift cards). The most important rule of thumb: IF YOU ARE EVER UNSURE, about whoever is calling you on anything, hang up and google the number to call back the headquartered location.

But if you are actively cheating the government, that initial contact will not be a surprise.\n\nAnd the IRS doesn't file preemptive lawsuits. By the time they actually recommend federal charges, you will have been long informed that there is an investigation underway. There are a host of procedures to follow, and almost none of them involve bringing charges without telling you long before that happens.",

        "selftext": "Many people enthusiastically bring home a pretty houseplant for the first time, and proceed to water it every day to keep it happy. While understandable, you're setting yourself for heartbreak and frustration.  It is natural to assume that the one thing we know we have to do to plants should be done often, and the more often the better, but root rot is usually not fixable and will slowly kill your lovely plant. Underwatering, on the other hand, can be fixed very easily. As a rule of a thumb, once a week is perfect for most plants. \n\n\nMissing the outdoors and ending up with about 60 houseplants through a year of lockdown, I have learned that majority of them prefer to be left to their own devices. Here is a rather conclusive guide working for vast majority of widely available plants:\n\n\n\n\n- give them a sunny spot. Seems obvious, but we might be tempted to place them for aesthetics out of sun. There are plants that don't mind (ferns are the best example), but most do. Give them sun or grow light. Remember that more sun makes them dry up more often (so on a sunny window sill, water once every 5 days, in a shadowy corner, once every week)\n\n\n\n- once every 2 weeks, take a soft cloth, slightly wet, and clean the leaves. Dust sets on them as well, and it makes it harder for them to undertake photosynthesis properly. It is also a rather soothing activity. Everyone wins. \n\n\n\n\n- get a plant food. They are usually cheap and you can also make your own, and they can make your plant grow like crazy. Don't overfertilise tho - about once every 3 months enough. Too much fertiliser is a thing, and it can burn them. Don't fertilise in the winter. \n\n\n\n- \u26a0\ufe0f on the topic of eating, many houseplants are toxic to pets if ingested. If you have pets, particularly playful ones, make sure to research ahead to avoid trouble! \n\n\n\n- Don't rush to repot. I know you want to put them in these cute pots you got, but keep them in nursery pots for at least a month. Many plants experience environmental change shock between you taking them from the store and bringing them home, so don't make it harder for them, they will thank you with many happy years in those sweet pots of yours. \n\n\n\n- speaking of pots, always have drainage. Try not to put plants straight into a decorative pot without drainage - get a bigger planter and put it in with nursery pot and tray.\n\n\n\n\n- chop of leaves that go yellow - they won't go green again, and the plant is wasting resources on it. \n\n\n\n\n- if cactuses or succulents, you still have to water them, albeit rarely. Many people recommend cactuses as the most beginner houseplants, but you can absolutely kill both cactuses and succulents, and not only as a beginner (I'll be the first one to admit I've killed a few). But even if they do not die on you, they will not look as lush as when bought in few months unless quite a lot of care is given. If you really want an unkillable plant, get a pothos or peace lily. They both droop when thirsty (so they give you a clear indication as to when to water them), have a lovely chunky foliage, are quite cheap and very sturdy. Another great ones are snake plants. Most cactuses and succulents would go on 4th and 5th place on the \"hardest to kill\" list. \n\n\n\n\n\n- your plant may experience a bit of a shock after about half a year since you bought it, as the fertiliser given in store usually runs out around that time. Don't panic, it is not dying, just give it a little love and plant food and it will be happy again. \n\n\n\nFollow these and you should be just fine for the majority of plants.\n\n\n\nHouseplanrs are awesome decorations that can light up any place, and more than you think are extremely low maintenance. It is a nice hobby for the soul, and don't stress if you kill one, happens to everyone every now and then. Some species are drama queens, and some specimen of no-fuss plants are ungrateful bastards. That being said, most will comply, because they want to be alive just as much as you want them alive. [Here](https://youtu.be/l6huWZZaZek) is a little guide on what to expect from common low maintenance species. Good luck! \ud83d\udc9a",

            "I have been gardening for the last 3 years and I always am amused when something is wrong with my plants and I try to google it. \n\n\"That could be from over watering, under watering, not enough nutrients, too many nutrients, not enough sunlight or too much sunlight.\" \n\nGreat.",
            "Speaking as a person that has 30-40 potted plants, the easiest way I've found to know when to water most plants is to check when the soil is dry at least an inch or so down from the surface of the soil, then soak it.  Wait till the top inch or so is  dry again to water.    \n\n\nThis prevents under and over watering.  The worst way to water is to do it on a schedule.  Depending on the type of plant and pot, they will dry out at different rates.  One plant might be fine being watered every 4 days, but the one right next to it might have root rot from being constantly drowning in water.",
            "If for any reason the leaf is getting brown, wait a few days before cutting that leaf. The plant is moving part of the nutrients like iron, zinc and manganese from the brown leaf to the other leafs. if you cut the ugly leaf too fast you will lose part of those micronutrients.\n\nAlso, plants need nitrogen to grow big and green, phosphorus for the photosypnthesis and potassium to make fruits big. This nutrients or macronutrients are called NPK. Find a good NPK fertiliser. The main micronutrients are Iron, Manganese, Zinc (the three for photosynthesis, auxine production, overall leaf green etc), Calcium (stability and fruit firmness), Molybdenum (flowering) and Magnesium (photosynthesis). If you can find a fertilizer with a proper combination of all, you are set and your plant won't be hungry :)\n\nIf you are curious about plant nutrition, try to find divulgative information about cannabis. They are expert in plant nutrition, but their info is presented in an easy way to understand for all!",

It's florida and it's hot\n\nExcept it got to a point where even if it rained *heavily* that day, I would still be required to water the plants.

The plants were always wilting and dying and I still had to soak them every single day.\n\nI wonder if she's still watering those plants and wondering why her whole garden looks like shit",

            "I have 100 houseplants and these are my tips:\n\n- Know what kind of plant you have and what their needs are. Some like to dry out, some don't. What is their natural environment, do they grow up high in trees or in the understory? Does it depend on water or light for survival? What does the physical form of the plant tell you, does it have thick leaves for water storage? Are the leaves fuzzy to protect against the sun?\n- Know what kind of light you have in your house. What direction is the window facing? (Most to least bright: South, West, East, North when you are in the Northern hemisphere) Do you have a tree or something diffusing the light? \n- Never water on a schedule, just take the time every few days to really look at your plants. Do the leaves feel limp? Is the soil dry? Plants tell you what they need.\n- Shower your plants every once in a while, it cleans them and helps get rid of pests. You could also put them outside during rain if it is warm out.\n- Good soil is key. Different plants require different soil. I like to make my own mix of Coco Coir with stuff like perlite, leca, orchid bark etc.\n- Don't be afraid of using your shears.\n\nGood channels for info are Planterina, Kaylee Ellen, Summer Rayne Oakes, Nick Alexander, Harli G and many more.",

            "Agreed, sunny spot will save many plants. \n\nPlants eat light. Water and nutrients just help with digestion. They have different light needs, too.",
            "I would add for succulents though they kind of have their own rules.\n\n You may want to dust them with a light brush (I use an old large blush brush), but they produce their own sunscreen and it makes them appear \"dusty\". If you wipe that off with a damp towel they'll burn. \n\nAlso, when their leaves turn pink/crispy DONT cut them off! They're reabsorbing that leaf to get some of the energy back. Yellow soggy leaves are more of a sign of over watering though.",

            ">chop of leaves that go yellow - they won't go green again, and the plant is wasting resources on it.\n\nno no. the plant takes back all the useful nutrients from the leaf as it dies off, as well as transporting waste products into it to discard. let the leaf dying process happen naturally. leave the leaf on the plant until it is fully browned and wrinkled. ideally allow it to drop from the plant of its own accord",

            "Something related that first time home owners should know - This is applicable for watering the lawn too. \n\nHome owners tend to get into this rhythm of soaking the lawn for hours on end, daily, to give it the water it 'needs'. \n\nThey get home from work, see a neighbor watering their lawn and think they should too. The next day, another neighbor is water his lawn... and they throw the sprinklers out again. This is a bad practice. \n\nYes, when first planting seed it's good to water (very briefly) 1-2x a day for the first few days to keep the soil moist. But after that, once things have taken to the soil, stop. \n\nYour yard only needs to be watered once or twice a week at most. Twice in the hottest parts of summer if you don't get any rain. 10-15 minutes of coverage is more than enough. Outside of this, it doesn't have to be done. More importantly, it shouldn't be done more than this. \n\nOver watering causes compaction of the soil. A major issue which will destroy your lawn. Not to mention, it washes away nutrients and makes the grass reliant on the watering. It can also lead to root rot of trees, funguses, weed growth, insect attraction, and more. \n\nIf you water your lawn, and your grass is dying/yellowing, don't resort to watering more. It's more than likely not an issue of underwatering. It could be from overwatering. \n\nIf you can't remember whether you watered your lawn during the week? Don't. Wait a few more days and then do it. The grass won't die if it goes 3 more days without a water.",

I\u2019m not looking for recognition, the satisfaction for me is in the fact that I KNOW I\u2019m giving it 110%. However, even when giving it that much, people still have he audacity to complain?

            "I have a similar LPT that I learned recently, and it's helped me out a lot with my relationships with friends, family and coworkers.\n\nOne day, I confided in a coworker about something regarding my salary, and was asking for some advice about how/when to go about negotiating a raise, or if he felt it would be a good idea for me to write up a proposal for a raise. He ran directly to the president of the company and told him I wasn't happy with my salary and was conspiring to demand a raise. I almost lost my job because of it, after getting called into the VP's office and getting my ass reamed badly by the three highest executives in the company.\n\nGenerally I would be very angry that he did this to me after I confided in him. And I did feel very angry and betrayed. I stewed over it for hours that day. I worried that they were already looking for my replacement, and felt sick to my stomach.\n\nDuring the process of calming myself down, I thought \"You know what? It's my fault. My fault for confiding in him, and also my fault for breaking the rules by discussing salary with another employee, so I shouldn't be mad. I'm not going to get mad, I'm not going to get even, I'm not going to treat him differently at all. I just know now that I have to watch what I say within earshot of him because he's a squealer, and there won't be any more problems with him.\" Since then, I've acted like nothing ever happened and we've remained friends, never said anything else to him that I didn't want my bosses to know, and never had a single other issue with him.\n\nTL;DR - If you have a friend, family member or coworker who runs and tells people things that you say to them in confidence, you don't have to forego the relationship or brood about it. Learn that you just need to watch what you say to or around that person, admit that you were the one who made the mistake of trusting them with sensitive info, and let it go.",

It doesn't torpedo your case, or at least not with most judges I know, but this is at the hearing level some months later, not the initial claim level. One of the things we looked at was the frequency of write-ups relative to the length of employment right before termination. If there is a sudden rush for relatively petty things, the employer is clearly stacking. Same goes for the absurdity of the documentation.

In law enforcement, if you did this to get a confession it'd be tossed in a heartbeat, along with your career.  \n\nYou're literally putting the employee into a stress response, known to inhibit higher level thought, asking them to provide you evidence to deny them unemployment, then firing them for taking what you presented as a way out of the crisis.  The psychology of this is precisely why coercion cannot legally be used in criminal cases.  It causes a stress response, and inhibits executive function significantly.

Sent an email to HR late that night that for reasons I\u2019m happy to discuss at a later date, I\u2019m resigning. They want to do my exit interview now and now I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019d try and pull some shit like this? I wouldn\u2019t put ANYTHING past this company tbh. For fucks sake this is a mental health agency with literal countless accusations of egregious ethical violations, sexual harassment that has driven out female colleagues and caused clients to leave (all surrounding the same dude, but of course he\u2019s one of the untouchables so), misappropriation of public funds to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2026they\u2019ve gone through SEVEN people in the position I held in just the past year - so yeah wouldn\u2019t put anything past these fucksticks. \n\nThe final straw was when my supervisor told me to call one of my clients, a man very precariously teetering on the edge of needing to be hospitalized for his own safety, to TELL HIM TO SHOWER. \n\nif anyone reading this also works in MH, Y\u2019all can see the 8373737373763663 problems with that entire scenario right out the gate.

Their interests will rarely align with yours so if the job is worth it, get a lawyer. Their interests will 100% be on your side.  You won\u2019t scare HR with lawyers, so don\u2019t get cocky.  The fact that you have a lawyer will force HR to find their pound of flesh elsewhere... or at the very least take a second look.  If nothing else, it will give you a stronger position to negotiate with."

            "The best advice I've ever gotten was to read (not watch) the news once a week and to use a highly credible and politically neutral source like APnews.com. (Edit: The advice to only read the news once a week was given to me by a professional therapist. The advice about choosing neutrality in news, rather than one that leans toward your political stance, comes from my journalism degree.) Edit 2: Some people seemed to have thought I was implying you should only ever read one source exclusively for some reason. So I guess I have to be more clear for the easily confused. Obviously, as anyone would tell you, you should use multiple sources, particularly if it's a major topic. No one source will be perfect all the time, but neutral, high credibility sources will generally be better choices than those of notable political bends. This was simply some short-hand advice on a casual forum about limiting your intake of circular negativity. Make your own decisions about what's best for your mental health.",
            "Serious question.\n\nIsn't the point of a 4th estate is to shine light on the negative in life?\n\nIt's how we the people know what is going on. By journalists sticking their noses where people don't want them.\n\nIt's how we're informed of corruption and deceit.",

            "All news is bad news. You need a whole lot of bad news in order to sell the good news, which is advertising. -Marshall McLuhan",
            "r/upliftingnews\n\nthere you go",
            "I feel like this LPT is worth some criticism.\n\nNews generally should be just information that you need to digest for your own day-to-day purposes. A good chunk of it is going to be negative. And a number of sources are going to rile you up. Idealistically it's a tool to inform you how your government is spending your resources and how you can take action to be a part of your community and participate in government activities.\n\nWhat changed over the past several decades is that news wasn't a paper you picked up in the morning and read before dinner. It then was on cable. And post 9-11 everyone wanted the news faster. Stories were meant to keep you on. CNN went from boring stories about foreign affairs to constant breaking news. Conservative media grew. Media people would have news wires they'd monitor. Then everyone got Twitter. More \"news\" sources grew, and many of them catered to audiences that could selectively listen to them. Opinions got mixed with facts. The need to profit from people's attention and fear grew. And the news became much worse.\n\nFrom someone who works in media, this is the better way to look at things.\n\nTake in your news for a limited amount of time every day. 15 minutes. Whatever makes sense. Use fairly objective sources. AP. Reuters. NPR. Read your local community papers. Read past the headlines. Understand what's important and relevant. Read the bills or studies or whatever people are talking about yourself, don't just accept their analysis. Don't engage in the comments section. Engage where you choose to make a difference (city hall meetings, charities, etc.). Move on.\n\nAvoid listening to too many political analysis podcasts or having cable news/internet news as your primary source. And definitely avoid getting your news from Facebook or Twitter. Those are tailored to you to increase your emotional engagement and thus click on stuff at the cost of your sanity. Heck, there are so many articles out there with titles similar to this LPT. They'll bait people to click on them with seemingly absurd positions, but a lot of people will agree and find an enemy in something. You don't need to fall into the bait and you don't need this stuff on all the time. Facts, not sentiment.\n\nAnd take stock of what's important. You do need to be aware of what's going on in the world so you can vote accordingly or help important causes. But you don't need to know things about celebrities, stupid things a political leader said, or any filler stuff that doesn't matter. What's going on in your community and how can you affect change at a local level. A lot of the rest will be theater and noise.\n\nBut overall, yes. We don't need instant media all the time. Go in, get your facts, then limit your screen time from that stuff.",
            "I get the sentiment behind this but it just reminds me of my mom... who \"doesn't pay attention\" to things like news or gas prices ... even when gas was brought up just in passing near her she has to say it doesn't matter cause she has to buy it anyway... yeah unless you can compare and get it cheaper somewhere else?\n\nYou don't have to watch every night but paying attention to local, national and world events is part of being a functioning human in this society IMO.\n\nEdit: a lot of the response are saying news doesn't affect them and they can't change anything even if did. That's a lot of privilege speaking.",
            "That\u2019s a really bad advice. \n\nNews are made to check on the government. It is supposed to keep people informed on what is going on, to allow them to make better voting decisions. It is not supposed to be good, it is supposed to be critical - even when showing good things. \n\nOf course sometimes in life it is good to step back and take care of your mental health. But most importantly, people need to learn how to fact check and make sure the news they are receiving is of good quality, as unbiased as possible, and learn how and when they need to be informed.",
            "This is terrible life advice. This is what leads to a society full of clueless citizens too uninformed to call out the system or to even participate effectively in democracy. \n\nThere is negativity in the world.

I pointed out that I was never invited and they told me that \u201ceveryone knew\u201d about the parties, so why didn\u2019t I go!

            "So what can be said about these people who neglect their \"friends\"? Are they oblivious or just assholes?\n\nEdit: I guess what I'm getting at is, how am I supposed to address this situation where I'm the one who's being left in the dark all the time? \n\nAs soon as I confront anyone about leaving me out, I'm going to come off as desperate and lonely. Furthermore, I'm going to be calling them out any way I present it:\n\n* \"Hey, you could've clued me in.\" \n* \"Why didn't you think to tell to me.\" \n* \"You spoke to me earlier but you failed to mention any plans of going out.\" \n* \"Why couldn't you figure it out?\" \n\nAll of these are so incredibly emotionally charged (not to mention that it'll show on my face), that I'd rather just let the issue slide so I can save face. But in the end, these people don't see what they're doing, how they're affecting me and how this is building up over time.

            "I wasn\u2019t bullied but I do have a chronic illness that makes me feel crappy a lot of the time, and I tend not to instigate activities because I\u2019m also a pretty dyed-in-the-wool introvert. But being invited to things, even if I can\u2019t go because I\u2019m ill, still reminds the introvert me that I\u2019m actually somewhat fun to be around, which is a nice feeling and helps me make more of an effort even when I\u2019m feeling poorly. \n\nAnd, oh yeah, I\u2019m also not rich so fun stuff that\u2019s cheap to free will encourage me even more to hang out with the people I care about. <3",

            "I remember in college we went over how different cultures work in terms of invitations. \n\nPeople from cities  tend to be less likely to directly invite, because events in general tend to be more 'whoever comes, comes' events in public areas rather than more strict invitations. Often times it can even be considered pushy to invite someone, as if you're asking them a favor for them to be there, and so they want *you* to say you're gonna go. \n\nExample:\n\n\"hey we're meeting at the plaza to hang out in 20 min\"\n\n\"k ill head over soon\"\n\nYou don't usually 'invite' someone in that sense. If you wanna see them there, you can, that is all their message is. There is no pressure to say 'yes' or 'no' to some kind of invitation, its very casual. \n\n\n\nIn suburbs and rural areas, events tend to be more commonly on private property, and being strict about invitations is more important. You rarely just 'show up' at things that are held on someone's property. This cultural of invitations also seeps into other events, even those not held on private property. Invitations tend to be more regulated and formal.",

            "I'd like to add another perspective to this. If you invite someone who IS quiet and aloof, and they either decline, ignore or otherwise don't show up, don't take that personally either. They're probably an introvert and their bucket may already be running low on that day. Definitely do not pressure them and insist on them going to something they don't want to go to. \n\nIf they do go, but remain quiet and don't interact a lot, don't pressure them to socialise or be more outgoing. It's probably incredibly draining for them to even be there and forcing them to be sociable is just going to drain them even further.",

Edit: And flirting! I cannot for the life of me tell if someone is flirting with me. I just can't understand that someone might be interested in me so it goes over my head.

            "You know that meme about how introverts don't make friends, they just get adopted by extroverts? It's not... entirely... wrong.\n\nI'll add to this (again, keeping in mind that everyone is an individual):\n\n- Some of your friends want to spend time with you *and* they're uncomfortable going to the bar or having you over to their house or visiting you because all of those things are outside of their comfort zone, and those are not mutually exclusive feelings -- they can happen at the same time. \"I'm really enjoying spending time with this person, I'm happy to spend time to them\" and \"wow, I've got a set limit of time before I start to feel trapped at this event and need to get away\" are things that happen simultaneously.\n\n- Sometimes your friends turning you down for events doesn't mean they want you to stop asking. Asking them is both a signal that you do want to spend time with them (which is appreciated), and an opportunity for them to say \"yes\". Their hit rate on saying \"yes\" might be lower, but they'll still appreciate being asked and they will occasionally say \"yes\" as they get more comfortable around you. Your introverted/shy friends don't want to be forced into anything (don't push the issue if they say no), but \"I don't want to go someplace this weekend\" is not necessarily the same thing as \"I never want to go anywhere or do anything with you.\"\n\n- \"I'm thinking about doing X this weekend\" is not an invitation. \"Do you want to do X this weekend?\" is an invitation. That's not an introvert thing, that's just a communication thing, I don't assume you telling me your plans means you want me to be a part of them.\n\n- A lot of people, if they're not 100% sure that you actually like them as a friend, are *not* going to make the first move. Is that reasonable? :shrug: Probably not. But they're not going to intrude on your life unless you ask them to do so. Particularly if they're on the neurodivergent spectrum: I have difficulty reading people, I am not going to pick up on the social queues you're putting out, so I am *very* careful not to accidentally step over boundaries. I'm not going to make my inability to read your facial expressions your problem. I'm not going to force you to deal with my quirks unless I am pretty certain that you actually want to deal with my quirks.\n\n----\n\nOn the flip side of this, if you're anxious or socially awkward or introverted and somebody invites you somewhere and you say \"no\", *please* follow up afterwards with at least, \"but I really appreciate you asking, that means a lot.\"\n\nBecause socially outgoing extroverted friends are also not mind readers and they have no idea if your \"sorry I can't\" means \"I can't\" or \"stop talking to me already.\" You have to make it obvious to them that you appreciate being asked and are interested in going, even if you can't/won't go this specific time.\n\nAlso, introverts, don't know if someone wants to spend time with you or is just being friendly? Giving some small (genuine) compliments is a good way to provide small signals that \"I don't hate you just because I wear headphones around you\" while still leaving the door open for the other person to make (or not make) the first move in the friendship. You are just as difficult to read as they are; it's good for you to provide (non-intrusive) signals that you don't hate everyone in your office just because you enjoy eating lunch alone.",

When we got there last year there was a rotting bath panel, broken extractor fan, human hair stuck to the bathroom wall, in addition to mouldy curtains in my room (which my parents replaced for me, we left them there afterwards as a gesture of goodwill and never charged a penny to the landlord). This was all after a supposed \u2018professional clean\u2019 had been carried out before we got to the property. \n\nTheir feeble justification for charging these fees are that the new tenants are complaining about mould in the walls that we complained about 1 month into our tenancy via emails that never got responded to/sorted out.

            "I'm going to offer up a counter tip that some people in the comments seem to hint at: Talking \"bad\" about your coworkers is fine if you follow two simple rules.\n\n1. The things you say must be objectively true and verifiable. No gossip, or suspicions.\n2. The things you say and attitude about said coworkers should be in alignment with your interactions with them. Meaning, if you constantly point out someone's shortcomings because they're bad for business, you had better not be hiding your thoughts from them directly.\n\nBasically, be honest with everyone, including the person you're talking about.\n\nI do not pull my punches at work, and I expect people to do the same with me, and I make sure they're aware of it. I have had coworkers that I adore as people, but they're bad at their jobs. I've had ones that are excellent at what they do, but I cannot stand them as people. The ability to compartmentalize the two sides of a person you work with is invaluable in being able to interact professionally with them. If you can do that well, then I find that it will not hold you back.\n\nUnless you have supervisors who are especially petty. In those situations though, you'll likely find out about that part of their personality early, and can adjust your methods accordingly. The few people I've had to deal with like that are also too stupid to realize that while you talk honestly about everyone else, and only say nice things about them, it's because you're gaming them and not being honest about them. Plus, generally, everyone else is doing the same with them.\n\nMy company knows I'm there to do my job well first, and make friends second. And because of my position, doing my job well means making sure other people are doing their jobs well. If I were to try and tip-toe around the professional shortcomings of my coworkers I would not be doing my job properly. If someone's slow and inefficient, I will call it out as part of attempting to try and find a way to improve their performance. This can apply to anyone in any position really.\n\nI guess the main thing is, if your intentions are good, and you're not just venting all the time uselessly, people are more accepting of negativity than you may think.",
            "Tell people to their face when they've done something good too, I think work and society in general is very 'what have you done for me today', if you're managing people or even just being a line employee, telling someone that they've done a good job goes a long way toward making a good place to work",
            "This sounds so fake though? \u201cYou come across as genuinely thinking these things\u201d?\n\nI don\u2019t see why you should sacrifice your true thoughts and feelings to be well liked, or fake secret compliments so people mistake you for being a really positive person, in the workplace or elsewhere. I like better when I can tell someone is being honest and genuine whether or not they\u2019re being pleasant. I really hate when I can tell someone is being fake to me, even if they\u2019re just trying to be \u201cnice\u201d.\n\nI say, be yourself, although their isn\u2019t any reason to think positively about people, even if you don\u2019t agree with them all the time.

Why should I tell someone else about your problems? Maybe I should tell you about your problems instead; perhaps then they will not be a problem anymore.",
            "The next step up from this: \n\nIf a coworker is talking shit (warranted or not) about someone behind their back, reply with:\n\n\u201cYeah but they\u2019re good at ______\u201d even if you don\u2019t like the person you\u2019re talking about. \n\nThis signals that A) you\u2019re not about the gossip, which boosts your trustworthiness.  B) professionalism. C) Most cases someone will have a redeeming quality. Recognizing that is being fair to that person, which marks you as a fair-minded person. Again, increases trustworthiness and professionalism. \n\nThese qualities get around and go a long way. Research shows that dicks don\u2019t automatically get ahead in workplaces (usually they\u2019re also working ridiculous hours or sucking up), but respected individuals do get a boost when promotion time comes around. A half-decent boss wants to offer a raise to someone that the office won\u2019t mind working under, especially those who didn\u2019t get the raise.",

Which is why I think it\u2019s important to know what  your potentially walking into and the shit that follows you afterwards. I lost my dad three years ago to lymphoma/complications from it. Ive watched my brother fall into serious addiction issues, my mom never really recover and only in the last year have I finally come to peace with what I saw. I hope that this will encourage anyone whose about to go through this with a loved one to go to therapy and not turn straight to something like drugs or alcohol. \n\nFor context I\u2019ve seen or immediately arrived after my grandfather passed and it was similar to what you kinda expect from pop culture, Breath slip and drift off. However if your about to lose a loved one whose battling a disease like a cancer be prepared for a very jarring and potentially drawn out experience. \n\nWith my dad for the last 12 hours of his life he fought for every breath, and when I say fought I mean like gasp, cough and vomit blood and have to call emergency services. All to be told they can\u2019t do anything except to give him more morphine. In his final few minutes he began to panic as he realized this was it. He looked at my mom, my brother and I and shed tears. Then as he slipped away his body expelled blood from his mouth. The entire experience still haunts me to this day, I remember every moment perfectly clearly and whenever I do I break down a little bit that he had to go through that. My mom will call me and wonder if she did enough, was she strong for him at the end, which is it\u2019s own kind of heartbreaking. My brother couldn\u2019t cope and has since become addicted to drugs. \n\nI\u2019d strongly encourage all to go to grief counseling, I did about 6 months later and was able to settle myself and stop drinking away pain. RIP dad miss ya everyday",

            "Wrapping your head around the possibility that you may die in the coming minutes is absolutely terrifying. I was dealing with some major complications from chemo. I went in one day, feeling like absolute shit, but I expecting everything to be largely normal. Passed out during an exam, floated in-and-out of consciousness. It wasn't what he said, but the way my doctor spoke to one of the nurses made me realize they thought they might lose me, and I freaked the everliving fuck out.\n\nWhen you have cancer, you have to come to terms with dying. But it's one thing to understand \"I may not be long for this world,\" and a whole other to realize you may only have minutes left. Especially when you aren't expecting it to happen so suddenly. \"I'm going to die today? Like *today* today?' is an absolute mindfuck.",
            "Watching my father slowly die was bad in so many ways.\n\n His denial and my own denial made it worse. We just didn't accept it was happening. We never talked about it. He was just sick. Doctors we're working on it. He was fine. We weren't worried.\n\nHe was my best friend and we worked together for 30 years building homes and having fun. We were inseparable.\n\nHe finally took all of the medication for his pain at once and died sleeping.\n\nHe was buried on my birthday. It was a horrible and strange day. People kept mentioning my birthday.",
            "I lost my 6 year old son to a rare form of aggressive bile duct  cancer last week, and I wish I was more prepared for his passing. Very similar, he spent 6 or 7 hours gasping for breath and just wanted me and my wife to hold his hands.  He then vomited bile and the look of terror in his sweet little eyes as he choked is something that still haunts me. I have cried every night since, knowing he trusted me to keep him safe and there was nothing I could do to help him. I have therapy planned for next week after his funeral, and I am grateful to have been there to comfort him, but this is something I wish I had been more prepared for.",
            "This is why I'm so passionate about Hospice care. Death can be peaceful, and symptoms can be managed. I'm so sorry you experienced such traumatizing deaths. I've worked in a hospital setting and seen some terrible deaths. Allowing a hospice nurse to come assess frequently allows them to get meds in board for comfort: shortness of breathing, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, agitation, hallucinations, and pain, are all common symptoms at end of life. There's a lot of pharmacological ways to manage these symptoms in order to promote comfort for a person's transition from this life.",
            "People talk so much about \u201cdying peacefully at home.\u201d And yes, that phrase hides so much, and when people have to go through it with loved ones, they are so surprised what it means. \n\nAnother example is confusion and agitation: many many people experience this a day or so (sometimes a few hours) before they die. And it is really hard on the family. \n\nBut a good hospice or palliative care can make a really big difference. \n\n(I\u2019m a social worker who is tangentially connected to a hospice setting.)",
            "I feel you OP, and my condolences to you. \n\nI have a fairly similar thing, and I haven't really experienced death too much in life. \n\nMy dad passed away a month ago, he had battled cancer and pneumonia, but suddenly things went further south. He spent 3 days waiting to die in palliative care. \n\nI spent those 72 hours by his side, as he slowly died. Similarly, his death throes were something I may never truly get over. This morning I was driving to work and all I could picture was his face in those moments, and it hurts.\n\nDad has always been the strongest person I knew, and here he was absolutely helpless, unable to speak or communicate beside some hand squeezing. When he finally passed, I selfishly felt a great deal of relief that he was finally out of pain, and I do feel guilty for that, but I also know that he wouldn't want to have lived in a vegetative state.\n\nEveryone who can, go give your parents or loved ones a big hug, because one day you will wish you did it more. \n\nI am considering counselling but still on the fence about it.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your kind words, it's certainly helped me today more than you'll ever know",
            "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP. \n\nI\u2019m 29 now but went through something similar when I was 11, when my dad died of brain cancer (after 10 years of fighting). I\u2019m only now (in the last 2 years) coming to terms with how traumatic it was. I accepted that I saw my dad have seizures, go to surgery, change personalities due to meds and operations, chemo and radiation, etc. It all takes a lot out of you, but you don\u2019t realize that at the time, nevertheless when you\u2019re 8 years old. \n\nWhen it came to the final stretch, it was 2 months of really being sick. We brought hiM home and he went from talking and conversing to being totally comatose and fed through a tube. I remember days when my mom told me to go say goodbye to my dad or to bring him \u201cbreakfast\u201d that was just a tube, and I never really wanted to, because it wasn\u2019t \u2026 my dad, you know? \n\nThe last night, it was about 2 hours of really intense things happening. A lot of scary gasping, his eyes bugging out of his head, and saying \u201cgoodbye, I love you\u201d along with my siblings while ignoring the fact he was literally gasping for life and panicking. \n\nI remember acting out the scene to my best friends at his funeral (11 year olds are weird), but aside from that, I\u2019ve never talked to a single person about it. There\u2019s a lot that I\u2019ve had to work through over the last few years with him being gone, but that last day - it\u2019s something else entirely. I wish I had gone to therapy earlier and with my family so that we could have started to work through this trauma. \n\nI\u2019m grateful you were here to share this. Selfishly, typing this out has me sobbing cathartically, so thank you for bringing this up and letting us all share our stories.",
            "I am literally going through this as I type my comment. Sudden diagnosis of Stage IV pancreatic cancer two weeks ago, now I\u2019m sitting next to my grandpa holding his hand as he\u2019s taking a breath every 45 seconds.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever witnessed, but at the same time, it\u2019s super cathartic to be here. I\u2019ve got no doubt these memories will stick with me til I\u2019m in the same boat, however, there\u2019s no where else I\u2019d rather be. Witnessing and experiencing death is so important to valuing this life we share.",
            "Lost my wife to bowel cancer 5 years ago and my best friend  of 55 years to bowel cancer this August. I was  there for both.\nMy two young daughters  8 and 13 were with me for my wife passing and seem to have no long lasting issues. It was  bright sunlight, windows open with a slight breeze and smell of flowers on the air day. At the local hospice so everyone knew what was happening. I think but don't want to know that my wife may have had some medical assistance in passing (some heavy sedatives). I am great full for everything that amazing medical team did and that my daughters were able to see their mum go peacefully and be able to hold her  hand.\n\nMy friend passed with his sons, wife and maybe ten friends in the room with him. He wanted to go and again probably had some pharmaceutical help. I miss him very much.",
            "For real, I helped around the house during the final days of my best friend's dad. His face and abdominal area were swollen with fluid. As soon as he pass, his muscle released letting all that fluid flew out through his holes. Mouth, rectum, eye sockets. But the sight was nothing compared to the smell. To this day that was still the most putrid, vile, foul smell I ever have the misfortune of experience. It was a combination of rotten tissues, bodily waste and mucus that had sit for days inside the body. \n\nI promised myself that day I will not let myself or anyone I know die like that in front of their family. Seriously, as much as I understand how much you want to be there for their last moment, at least keep a professional there so you can get out. You don't want what I witnessed to be the last image you got of your loved one.",
            "I'm very sorry you lost your father in that way. I lost my mother to cancer and was with her at the end as well. Was it pretty? No. Am I grateful to have been there for her? Would she have done the same for me? Yes and yes. Being with her when she died was nothing compared to the hell that had been the year leading up to it.\n\nWouldn't you and your family still be dealing with grief if you hadn't been bedside?\n\nWishing you the best. It's a very difficult thing to go through.",
            "Everyone should check out \u201cHospice Nurse Julie\u201d on TikTok or YouTube. Knowing what to expect can make it much less traumatizing. Some normal stages of death look strange, but it doesn\u2019t always mean that your loved one is in pain or distressed. An example is the strange sound of end of life breathing. It can also help you advocate for your loved one if you know what negative things to look for. An example is terminal agitation. If you know what it looks like, you can ask for medicine to help calm your loved one if it happens. \nSo yes, witnessing a death can be traumatic, but the solution is to move towards death, not away from it. Death is part of life, so learn about it, come to terms with it, before it is staring you in the face.",
            "I'm truly sorry that you had to experience that trauma.\n\nI'm an ICU doctor and I've witnessed hundreds of deaths. I'm shocked by the number of posts here describing traumatic and terrifying deaths in the presence of a healthcare worker.\n\nI agree death isn't always peaceful, but it can be.  We have the antidote for pain, fear, anxiety, and air hunger. Morphine and related drugs take those feelings away. I don't understand how a doctor or nurse can let a dying patient suffer like that when it can be avoided. In that situation, removing suffering is the only thing they can do.\n\nOften, patients who are suffering and terminal would rather focus on treating the suffering instead of living longer. It's acceptable to give enough drugs to take away pain or air hunger. It will shorten a person's life, but that's a side effect of the goal of treating pain or suffering.\n\nIf you or your family is close to death, or have a reasonable chance of dying in the next 6 months, I recommend asking your doc about palliative care or hospice options. You don't have to pursue it, but it helps knowing what options exist. You should also talk to your loved ones about what your wishes would be if you got to a point where you can't speak for yourself. A living will is close to worthless in these situations, as they are designed for scenarios that rarely happen, like a Terry Sciavo-type case. A more realistic scenario is that you get bad pneumonia, sepsis, and now are on life support with multiple organs failing, and the doc is asking about dialysis. Have a conversation while you can about how much you are willing to go through for a given quality of life. For most people, if they can't interact meaningfully with their loved ones, that's not a life worth living. Some might not want to live through chronic pain, or losing their independence. Most people I see in the ICU never have these conversations. It also helps if your entire family is clear. It doesn't help if you tell your husband, but no one else, and then your daughter thinks your husband is going against your wishes.\n\nPalliation can also be done at home in some cases.\n\nIn the US euthanasia is illegal in most states, but it's always legal to pursue comfort care. In some cases, focus on comfort was actually associated with longer life than chemotherapy in an [older study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1000678)",
            "What surprises me most is healthcare seems to be able to tell when people are going. Someone can be around for years, I'll have seen them walking around and acting normal *just a day or two ago* and then suddenly healthcare says \"they've turned, they'll probably be gone by monday\" ...and yeah, they are.\n\nI'm just glad for the people who go quickly and are surrounded by family. OP, even if he struggled a bit at the end I can almost guarantee you he was comforted by you being there. You *helped* him, and even if it was scary to see please take some comfort in the fact that you made it ever so slightly easier on him. Your presence was a blessing for him.",
            "Because you stayed\u2026\n\nYour dad saw how much he meant to you, \n\nYour mum and brother drew strength from you,\n\nYou could warn others how harrowing it can be,\n\nYou touched the hearts of strangers,\n\nAnd you learnt you\u2019re not alone.",

            "I am sorry your dad's passing was not peaceful.  I hope you find comfort in your memories of who he was. \n\nMy dad took his last few breaths in peace and with me holding his hand.  It was quiet and peaceful.  But the two weeks on the ventilator before that was absolutely brutal.  \n\nMy mom died alone in her apartment, face down on the floor having suffered a fatal stroke or aneurysm.  I found her three days later.  It wasn't like you think, but I was traumatized.  By both deaths. \n\nIt has been several years since dad. The trauma is a memory and no longer a factor in my daily life.  I can access every memory about the whole thing but the sadness is not raw like it was.  \n\nI had EMDR for my mom's death.  It helped. I can still picture it but that picture is no longer crowding out all the other pictures. \n\nI think your reaction to the memory is PTSD.  It will fade, but I think you can speed it up with some therapy like EMDR. Also it strikes me you went to grief counseling, but that's not the same thing as trauma counseling. The issue of grief and of the startling memories of the end are intertwined but you can look at that ball of string from a different perspective.  \n\nI hope you find some healing real soon.",
            "Yep.  My 35 year old sister died of liver failure and it took about 8 days.  The yellow was coming off her skin on the sheets.  Pink ooze coming out of her nose.  Groans. Arms spontaneously reaching toward the sky. Oh yes and the random shreaking loud screams.  Only could give oral morphine that didn't work great due to fried liver. When she first transferred to her final room I was helping to wet her mouth with a wet sponge since she no longer had IV.  She asked me for more water, she thought she could still pull out of it drinking more water at that point, still fighting.  I didn't give her the cup, would only prolong.\n\nShe requested her cat come visit her in the hospital.  It was all so heart breaking.  I paced back in forth in the hallways until my calves were sore.\n\n  I broke down and told her I loved her when I was alone with her and she somehow was cognizant enough to ask me to hold her hand.  I could only hold it for ten seconds or so and let go and left the room.  Wish I would've held it for so much longer.  I had such feelings of sadness, intense waves for nearly two years afterwards and still four years later every once in awhile I feel sad.  \n\nThen my mom texted me instead of calling me that she died in middle of that night so my dad and I walked into her hospice room to find it empty. \n\nWhat made it worse is watching how my mom and dad reacted, didn't seem to bother them nearly as much, in fact my mom seemed relieved and my dad was on his laptop looking for dates being not long divorced.\n\n  Then the state social worker kind of snickered and laughed a bit when I was talking with her alone and started to crack up crying a bit, like she was surprised a big guy would do that or something, nice support.  The nurse got snippy with me because I kept begging for more morphine to try ending it faster.\n\nFour years later my narcissistic father still hasn't mentioned her once.  I wonder if he will ever say her name again. A few years later I told my mom on the phone  I think I got PTSD from it and she just said \" woahhh\" like she was surprised it affected me that much.  \nI'd advise possibly visiting early when they are in better shape and maybe skip out on the end days or hours.\n\nIt's because of.religion they can't administer massive doses of morphine or some other pleasant fast ending.  What a circus mess.",
            "I lost my father to cancer in January, and while I wasn\u2019t there for his final moments I am still haunted by things I saw on my last few visits with him (covid protocol, so we could only visit twice). Utter fear, confusion, and helplessness. \n\nTherapy helped me a lot, it never goes away but I don\u2019t feel as completely destroyed as I did right after it happened.",
            "I\u2019m sorry.  I experienced similar issues when my mom died of cancer about 7 years ago.  My little brother went into deep drug abuse and I have no idea how he\u2019s alive. He doesn\u2019t even look like the same person but he\u2019s clean now.  I was completely shitfaced myself.   It was traumatic for everybody. \n\nJust went through the same thing with a close family member of my fianc\u00e9e.  We were all there, same deal.  It\u2019s ugly.  There\u2019s a line in a Jason Isbell song called Elephant \u201cno one dies with dignity\u201d.  I think that\u2019s pretty much true from what I\u2019ve seen.  There\u2019s usually a really uncomfortable agitated panicky moment at the end.\n\nI tell all my family and friends I want somebody to have the price is right losing horn cued up and hit the button the moment I check out.

            "I watched a family member pass a few years back and I would say I think about it most days.\n\nThe worst part is my most vivid memories are the final hours of his life from heart failure.\n\nIn the space of a few weeks he became less and less mobile, confining himself to the bed in his final week.\n\nHe was well aware this was it and never seemed to be all that sad about it. He was himself but with about 10% of his normal effort.\n\nHe eventually fell into a state of semi consciousness, responded to words and touch with a few grunts. Then the death rattle started to present itself.\n\nThe final 12 hours were where the memory is sadly the most vivid.\n\nHis breathing became laboured as the fluid on his lungs started to work up his throat, his heart rate, temperature, skin colour all changed, he gradually moved into a very relaxed death pose.\n\nIt got to the point the fluids in his chest were so far up his throat you could see them pooling in the back of his mouth.\n\nAfter a few hours of this, his breathing got very rapidly until there was no space in his airway.\n\nThen his breathing slowed down, he suddenly woke up, frantically looked around the room at each of us, locked his eyes on his wife and she kissed him on the forehead and then that was it.\n\nIt was like someone flicked a switch and he turned off.\n\nEverything relaxed, he stopped breathing, his jaw dropped and his eyes pretty much rolled back. Fluid and blood poured out of his mouth and nose.\n\nThe sad thing was his heart went absolutely ballistic for a minute or so.\n\nEveryone looking at me to do something about it.\n\nIt wasn't a great experience, I don't like to think about it as it shadows every other good memory of him.\n\nHe had been so long in the bed that his imprint was there permanently, his wife had to sleep in that bed as she did most nights whilst he was dying. He'd been in that bed so long that it seemed to take the mattress days to cool down from where he had been.\n\nEach time I walked past that room and caught a glimpse of that bed. I could only picture him there.\n\nHowever, I would do it again for any other family member. \n\nThose last few hours we talked to each other and him around his bed, when we told funny stories there was an occasional laugh or exhale from him.\n\nThe last few moments, I like to think he wasn't worrying about everyone else as we were sat around him. That he found a bit of closure in seeing his wife of 70 years in front of him for the last moment of his life.\n\n100% going to be buried in these comments. A prolonged death due to illness isn't anything like the movies and it isn't often peaceful (I've experienced non family members die in front of me) non of them were calm or without bad memories.\n\nThough I know, I don't want to die alone.",
            "Cancer is a fucking bitch and I don't wish it on anyone. On TV they make it look like people with cancer fade away from ennui and short hair cuts, but really it's awful and brutal for some people.

            "I accidentally gave my grandfather a very peaceful death. He was already dying due to kidney failure and decided to not extend his life with dialisis. Once he made that call, our whole family was able to come visit him at his house and say goodbye with love. The hospice doctor said he would have 3-5 days to live and gave us a small vial of morphine and an oral syringe (the syringe I was not aware of until well after). They warned us that the end might not be pretty like the OP said. \n\nOn the 4th night, he woke up in extreme discomfort from the catheter and needing to pee. His bag was already filling with blood so he wasn't feeling too good. My grandmother called me and my Dad to come assist him. We tried telling him he could just pee laying down but he was almost panicking at that point. \n\nI grabbed the morphine bottle and told him to take a small sip. He ended up drinking half the bottle and grimaced from how terrible it tasted. He immedietly calmed down and I held his hand and talked to him about my favorite memory with him. He was awake and relaxed for a few minutes enough to acknowledge me and smile. He then fell into a deep sleep and was snoring like crazy. 12 hours later, we checked on him and the snoring stopped. He was gone.\n\nLittle did I know that the doctor had only reccomended a few mL of morphine as a dose and I had probably given him 100x the amount that was recommended. It was an honest mistake, I had no intention of speeding up the process. In retrospect, I'm actually glad I made that mistake. I don't think he felt any pain at the end. \n\nI hate to think how painful it might have otherwise been had he been awake during the last few hours. The hospice doctors warned us of dying groans and gurgling. All we heard was snoring. \n\nTLDR I accidentally overdosed my grandfather with morphine as he was dying from kidney failure. He died in his sleep peacefully 12 hours later.",

            "The moment that haunts me the most is when I went to visit my mom in palliative care toward the end. I think it was my final visit before she died. She was this bloated, balding, shell of the woman I\u2019d known - rarely even conscious enough to carry on a conversation by then because the mets had her in and out of seizures, and she\u2019d devolved into some helpless, intemperate cartoon toad. This puffy, mumbly caricature of my mother began crying like a toddler from deep within her chest as she informed me she\u2019d signed a DNR \u2014 because she didn\u2019t want me to be mad at her. I was 16. I can\u2019t really explain what about the moment was so deeply unsettling. As much as I\u2019m relieved her death was only dragged out for a year, part of me wishes it had been much more swift. She stopped being my mother long before she died, and I wish those moments hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to mar my memory of her.",

            "I watched my mother die from brain cancer four weeks ago. It was about as far from a peaceful death as you can get. I can't really talk to anyone about it. Those who would understand have their own traumatic death story, and I don't want to remind them of it. I'm in my mid-20s and am the first of my friends to lose a parent. \n\nMy siblings and I took turns being her caregiver for two years up until the end. It was hard to watch the small medical wins get outpaced by the overall decline, but I cherish the extra time we had with her. The real trauma came when it was time to stop treatment and move to comfort care. \n\nMy family couldn't afford to pay for full hospice nursing, but we were lucky to get occasional visits. Despite their support, nothing can fully prepare you for the death process. Hallucinations, terror, losing bowel control and body paralysis. Then came the drowning noises and the death rattle. She went 6 days without water before she finally died. All you can do is give the max amount of morphine - utter helplessness. \n\nThose images and sounds are burned into my memory and loop endlessly in my head. Reason tells me this will get better, but I think that's a long way off.",
            "Something else you should do when a loved one is near dying is to ask them if they\u2019re afraid. If they are, it gives them a chance to say the words and hopefully find some comfort through sharing their secret fears with someone they love; if they\u2019re not afraid, you may be able to borrow some of their courage so that facing a world without them won\u2019t seem so scary. Either way, you\u2019ll learn something about what it means to live and die from their answer.\nVery sorry about your dad, OP. My aunt died from cancer last year, so I know how ugly it can be and I empathize. Sending good thoughts",
            "Hey man I lost my dad recently too and it wasn\u2019t bloody but it was similarly heartbreaking and devastating to watch him whither away and only find respite from pain in increased morphine dosages. Something that brought me some semblance of solace and peace is remembering that those moments only represented an incredibly small and short portion of his life and that pain and suffering did not define him. \n\nMy dad was like yours in that he really was fighting until his last breath. He wasn\u2019t ready to go; he was only 69 years old. But that fight he put up at the end is kind of inspiring. People die the way they live. \n\nMuch love dude, you aren\u2019t alone and it seems like you really grew around your grief at this point as opposed to letting it consume you.",
            "This is a good reminder and I thank you for that. Hopefully it helps some people that may be going through this inevitable part of the human condition soon. \n\nI lost my mother in a somewhat traumatic fashion myself back in 2017. She went from having what she thought was a stomach bug, to hospitalization from a bowel obstruction that ended up being cancer that was never diagnosed. She had emergency surgery after 6 or so hours in the ER to being unconscious and never waking up. My sister and I had to watch as they disconnected life support and she took her last labored breaths. She went from healthy to gone in a matter of days. \n\nI'm glad you're taking steps to manage your grief in a healthier way than substance abuse.",
            "I was half asleep when I heard the nurse tell my mom that my dad was just a shell. The only thing keeping my dad alive was the machine.  I jumped out of the chair and pulled the plug without hesitation.  My dad always said that he never wanted to be kept alive on a machine and to just let him go\n  I didn't want my mom to face that choice.  We watched in agony as my dad took his final breaths like a fish out of water, his eyes staring straight at me.  All I could do was keep promising him that I'd take care of mom.  I went to counseling shortly after because in my mind I killed my dad.   And I can never get that awful image of him gasping for air out of my head.  The therapist helped me come to terms saying I honored my dad and his wishes. This was about 13 years ago and It still messes with me from time to time.",

The rest of us said our goodbyes during a peaceful stretch. He slept for the last 2 days completely unconscious. It\u2019s hard to tell how aware he was but I full believe he couldn\u2019t hear us at the very end. Say your goodbyes, they will be drugged for the end if they\u2019re struggling, they won\u2019t be aware, I know my loved one would have wanted peace for his family instead of someone witnessing his last breath.",

            "I agree but I think the medical profession need to do MUCH more to prepare relatives of people who are dying. I assume they are scared to talk about it.  I lost my husband to cancer 10 years ago. He died in a hospital, not a hospice as despite my ongoing pleas for help , they said they never expected him to die so soon. I am in the UK, I slept on the floor under his bed, thankfully he had a private room.  He puked up this brown foul smelling stuff again and again. he was in pain, the night nurse did nothing even though everyone was aware his was in his last hours.   The next morning, his last the day, nurse came in.  She sat on his bed, took his hand and looked at him lovingly and said 'you are not having a good time are you?'. I thought 'an angel has arrived', I knew things would be ok .  A doctor he liked also came on shift, she explained that terminally ill people can be agitated and asked if  it was ok to sedate.  I later looked this up, it is called 'terminal agitation' - I wished I had known sooner.  His last hour or so was peaceful, I was alone with him, the most intimate time of a person's life. I am grateful for that. I told him again and again how loved he was.\n\nAround 2 years later his best friend died of cancer.  I went straight over in the morning, he was at home. He wife was distraught because he had been thrashing around and crying out.  She knew nothing about terminal agitation.  Everyone knew he was dying, none of the health professionals explained that this can happen or help.  I was able to explain. But I though then, someone should write a booklet about this.

            "I wish people had a better understanding of this.  The movies and media really set up a horrible fail on this.\n\n  \nA week after I proposed, my 30yo fianc\u00e9 was diagnosed with cancer. Pretty much a unique form of cancer. It was deemed very aggressive, and her prognosis was less than 3 months. We got her almost 3 years of living life the way she wanted (with very frequent trips to doctors and trial centers), but thankfully my medical background let me do a lot of the care at home.\n\nTo me, it was obvious how she would pass, and it was not going to be pretty.  The tumor occupied a space in her chest that would inevitably start to compress her lungs and he trachea (windpipe). I've worked in emergency medicine my whole life, both in the field and in hospitals. Unfortunately, I've had to watch people die while their lungs slowly fill up with fluid.  The lucky ones pass quickly, the unlucky ones are panicked and trying to draw breath with every inch of their bodies. It's horrible. It's one of the worst things that I've seen.\n\nEveryone was so positive, and wonderful, but the comments that cut me deep were \"You're going to fight this until the end!\", \"Never give up!  You're going to get a miracle\".\n\nShe fought. Holy crap, I can't describe it.  She was like some Valkyrie striding through the cancer battlefield.  She lost her hair, she had fun with it. We had to travel to other cities for experimental care, we made vacations out of it. She worked at her shop (we luckily owned her business), and it just made her stronger.\n\nBut in the end, terminal cancer is a fucking demon. Instead of just being a devil of rapidly dividing cells, it started putting out more and more fluid. It got so bad that it compressed her airway and heart. We went to the hospital (I'll never be able to say enough about her primary physicians, nurses, technicians, even the housekeeping staff... Thank you so much) for an outpatient procedure she'd had before, and we just couldn't get her oxygenation high enough for us to be comfortable taking her home to recover. She had a procedure to open up the sac around her heart, to allow the fluid accumulating there to drain, and we got a stent put in to her chest to allow me to drain the fluid off when we would go home.  But we could never get ahead of the fluid.  That fucking demon didn't want to wait, to grow big enough to take her down, it found a new trick.\n\nHer doctor explained that we were at the end of therapeutic options. Three weeks earlier she was riding horses with her team, practicing search and rescue techniques. That night her doctor told her that we were out of ideas on how to fight this, and she needed to consider what she wanted to do next.  All she wanted was to be home, with her fur babies and her framily.\n\nWe did everything we could to make her happy and comfortable. We quickly decided that the living room was the new bedroom, and visiting hours were whenever, but folks could only come in when she was awake. I slept on the couch next to the hospital bed. Her friends... they worked miracles. The things they did to brighten her day over the next couple of days will always wreck me when I even glance at it, in my mind.\n\nShe was always coughing and struggling to breathe. The stent had clogged almost immediately, the fluid was just too thick with protein. Still, she marshalled her energy for her framily and pets.\n\nHer last night was horrible. Having your wife wake up and tell you about the nightmares she's having, and that she doesn't want to go back to sleep, even though her lids are falling as she says it... More horrifying than watching horror movies.   \nDespite metastasizes to her bones, the obvious pain she was in, she never complained, she never asked \"Why me?\", she was never a victim. She fought until the very end. I wished numerous times that it was me, instead. But I wouldn't have handled it as gracefully as she did.\n\nBut those words, from so many friends, family, and acquaintances, still haunt me. \"You'll fight to the very end\"...  Well, they were right. It was a fight. It was an ugly, horrible fight that she didn't need to do.\n\nI would say I loved her more than life itself, but I'm still here. I can say I love her more than I can understand, and that made it all the worse to watch her go through it. She so deserved that miracle, but as a medical provider, I gotta tell you they're pretty rare (30 years in medicine, and I haven't seen one that would have helped her, except for some of the incredible medications and techniques that are coming out).\n\nI'll always feel guilty because I couldn't do more. It's not supposed to be that way, I know it. But it's difficult when you strive to be good at your job, love your family, do everything right, and still have a bad outcome.\n\nMiss you babe, love you always.",

            "I lost my dad to tongue cancer this July. He was diagnosed earlier this year, a man  already nearing rock bottom only to have life kick him in the stomach. He just gave up and decided to let nature run its course. \n\nHe was completely incoherent when we sent him to the ER. He had been \"subsisting\"; and I use that term loosely, on a liquid diet of mainly Ensure for several weeks at that point and was suffering from excessive calcium buildup and dehydration. Apparently quite painful on its own, but even worse considering he was basically starving to death and had his tongue riddled with tumors. He was just writhing in his hospital bed, occasionally tugging at his smock or the assortment of wires and tubes; starring off seeming intently at nothing at all. It was nearly impossible to tell if he recognized if my brother and I were there; he wouldn't acknowledge anything anyone would say or do... except three times. Once, he nodded to me while being wheeled away to be examined, after I told him we'd see him in ten minutes, that it wouldn't be long. Another time, he seemingly perked up to lucidity after a nurse inserted a shot into his arm, and he repeatedly attempted to say something. Of course, at this point it was nearly impossible to understand anything he said, and I had to ask him several times what it was he was saying. I tried to guess as quickly as I could, as I could tell his lucidity wasn't stable. He was desperately trying to get something out while he could. It dawned on me late that it was very likely simply \"love you\" and when I repeated back \"Love you? We love you, dad\" he nodded and sunk back down unto the pillow, retuning to his previous quiet state. I can't be sure I was correct, or caught it in time before he gave up and slipped off again. The last time I think he reacted was the last time I spoke to him alive. We were about to leave for the night, so we could rest and return the next day. My brother and I silently knew this was going to be one of the last times we would see him alive. We just didn't know how soon that would be the case. I kissed my dad on the head through my mask, and told him again how I loved him. When I drew away I saw he was pursing his lips they way he would when he was internalizing something emotionally painful. A sad \"this hurts me but I don't know what to do about it\" I knew all to well. It could have just been the physical pain at this point, but I'm not sure. \n\nHe died before I returned the next day. I had slept in, exhausted from the past few days and my own medical issues. I got the call only a few minutes before I left. He passed about the same time I was crawling out of bed, late in the afternoon. If I had only gotten up an hour... half an hour...15 minutes earlier... I could have maybe been there with him. I have no idea what his final moments were really like. Was he lucid by that point? Was he still in pain? Was he scared? He always hated hospitals and doctors. Made him uncomfortable. I felt... I *feel*... so guilty that he died without the few people he had left in his life next to him. That I wasn't there to make him feel less scared. To hold his hand. To tell him one last time that he was loved, that his existence mattered to someone, and that he would be remembered. After trying so hard for weeks to try to save him, to help him, I couldn't even give him that small bit of reassurance in the end. I'll never know for sure if what I gave him was enough.\n\nBut I was too stunned to ask the assigned doctor enough clarifying questions. I got a vague \"his heart slowed and he slipped away\" tidbit, but I failed to pry further. Maybe he wasn't lucid. Maybe his death was without turmoil. Maybe he wasn't in the state of mind to truly be scared anymore. And maybe it's best that I don't have to remember him in his final moment. In either case, all I'm left with is memories, and heartache, and a hole in my life.",

            "Similar thing happened to us this year with my mom in her mid 60s. Her case wasn't as visually graphic as you described, but she was dealing with terminal breast cancer. One of the last forms of treatment available suddenly scarred her lungs so she spent the final ten days on a ventilator, and it was clear that she couldn't continue without it once they tried removing it. Not only was her oxygen level way too low, but her mental capacity massively deteriorated from everything that had happened.\n\n\nWe knew we had to \"pull the plug\" the next day after removing the vent, but her mental state was so horrific that we had to shift to doing it immediately. It took a ton of morphine to stop the panicking, and she somehow lasted through the following morning despite her lungs no longer working. That was very on-brand for her since she persevered more health problems then anyone we've ever met, and with a smile no less. Every breath was a struggling wheeze/whine until her heart gave out the following morning.\n\n\nIt's more painful to think about *how* she went more than the fact that she's now gone. A year and a half of intense cancer treatment, six months wheelchair bound and slowly losing her mental acuity, and then the final two weeks in agony in a hospital.\n\n\nEven if she never wound up wheelchair-bound from busting het ankle or if her treatment didn't suddenly destroy her lungs, the cancer was still terminal. She wouldn't have survived past the end of this year anyways. My dad struggles because he ultimately had to make the call to pull the plug (though it was 100% clear that was the only option left). He knows that she may have had a few months left, but we were just about out of treatment options and the cancer was going to fully overtake her lungs or brain soon. And ss much as she suffered at the end, her quality of life was continuing to deteriorate anyways, so was this the lesser of two evils? We can only speculate now\n\n\nThe alternative to watching someone fade away is losing them suddenly and unexpectedly. There aren't any \"good\" options, but it's something we all unfortunately have to go through",

            "Incase anyone ever needs this info, some hospice organizations have a \u201chospice residence\u201d so to speak. It\u2019s typically a place where your loved one can receive 24/7 hospice care from specially trained nurse and staff. I had the opportunity to visit one in New York State, and it was beautiful. It\u2019s an alternative to having your loved one pass at home because as OP explained, death is a brutal thing to witness. My mother passed away while on hospice and actual active death is a brutal thing to witness that many people aren\u2019t prepared for.",
            "The best service that a good healthcare practitioner can give, is a \u201cgood death\u201d - if your loved one still has symptoms and is actively in distress, then supportive care can and should be better optimised. \n\nSo sorry for OPs experience.",
            "My step dad was on home hospice for his recurring cancer. The last couple of weeks he wasn\u2019t very aware of what was going on and the last week he was just out and never woke up. The day before he died he started coughing up a lot of blood. He was on some pretty major painkillers for the majority of his three month hospice and all he really did was sleep, which I think was the best for him because in waking he had a lot of pain.",
            "Remember to always get hospice started for your loved ones who are near the end of life. Your loved one can have their symptoms managed and be comforted by someone who knows how to comfort them. The hospice professionals will also help you, the surviving family, with what you may see and what to expect and what is normal.",
            "Yes.  My grandma died after getting up in the middle of the night, falling (she had advanced stage Parkinson's), and getting stuck in between her bed and the wall.  My aunt called me at work to let me know and I started crying.  I was in a professional conflict with two immature coworkers over my backing of a new manager they didn't like and were lying about to try to get demoted.  They were so immature and angry with me over the disagreement (and management's backing of my position over theirs) that they mocked me for crying and told another coworker they were glad my grandmother died.  Managers in the company found out, sympathized with me, and their careers there were basically over, but I've never had much faith in people after that.  I stopped sharing my life with others outside of my immediate family.  I stopped dating because I didn't trust people with real details of my personal life anymore.  I also stopped believing in marriage because if we die alone and humiliated like my beautiful grandma did, what's the point?\n\nI've since come around, mostly, though I will never share any part of my personal life with coworkers again and will be more proactive about using leverage to avoid working with such adult teenagers in the future.\n\nI was crushed and should have gotten help.  My grandma had a great 60+ year marriage and left an incredible legacy.  It's okay that she died that way.  Parkinson's would have made the remainder of her life worse and worse.  \n\nIt was traumatic, still, though.  Get help when you need it.",
            "Yep, after my first wife died at home from cancer at forty-five, I used to scream at te television, \"it's not like that, why don't you show it as it really is.\"  It was about fifteen years before the trauma hit me.",

One of my other brothers and I had to say goodbye over video call due to flight issues while he was in the ICU when my mom and brothers and I decided that we shouldn't let him suffer any longer with no chance of recovering. So we told the doctor to let him breath naturally till he passed away. \nI would give anything in this world just to be there holding my dad's hand before he passed so he would be surrounded by all of his family that he loved and raised. I would take all those years of therapy just to hold him one last time while he was alive, even if he was in a unresponsive state.",

My grandfather made it to 95; he should've died 20 years before he did. My grandmother made it nearly to 90; all seven of her siblings died before reaching 70. We dreaded the news whenever the ambulance had to come round. To know that they went peacefully after years (decades, really) of hard fighting and quiet suffering gave all of us great relief. After all they endured in life, death became a relief. \n\nI'm sorry you had to see it happen that way, OP. Just know that you're not alone.",

            "Hospice nurse here. Get your loved one on Hospice Services (in the US) as soon as the decision is made to stop treatment. And be aware that treatment can just wear people out physically, emotionally, financially. Sometimes the decision to choose comfort instead of seeking treatment happens too late and people wish they would have gotten on Hospice sooner. It\u2019s not just the comfort medications we provide. The nurse and social worker can help educate families on what a normal death at home will look like and give help, supplies and comfort where needed along the way. Support and education to families is such a huge help when you are helping your loved one live out their last days in whatever way they need to. And many hospices offer grief counseling to all friends/family that need it.\nDeath is rarely how we see it on TV/Movies. We will all go through it.",
            "The trick is to tell the nurse that your loved one seems to be in pain, so you point to something along those lines, and they will up the morphine dose, thus bringing a peaceful end.",

He died at home, in bed with me. How he wanted to go. It was in fact a very peaceful and beautiful moment.   \nI have a very strong support network of friends and family who have been with me on this since the diagnosis. I have shared all my fears, tears and pain with them. Still, many suggested i talk with a professional. \n\nYesterday, I met with a grief counselor. I thought it would be wise to get a head start on processing the experience. Meh.. I didn't feel that i got anything new or insightful from her. Didn't feel \"finally i can talk to someone!\" or \"omg i'd never thought of that\" or anything. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, right?

She had an emergency surgery and was on meds and a breathing tube.  She was aware of what was happening but could not speak.  We talked with her and held her hand as she fought the best she could.  But she was not going to recover.  We finally asked her if she wanted the tube removed, all of us including her knowing what that would mean.  She nodded yes with tears streaming down her face.  The tube removal was jarring and she sputtered and gasped for breath.  It was not peaceful, it was terrifying.  It took me months to remember her before that last day.  I miss her so much.",
            "I stood by my husband's side 7 weeks ago as he died from total organ failure over a 12 hour period. (Covid related... yes, people are still dying from Covid)\n\nIt was a violent and terrible death, full of immense suffering. When he finally coded I turned into what can only be equated as a wild animal - crying, moaning, scratching, thrashing around on the floor. They had to physically carry me away from the room. It's horrifying to think back to that experience."

He was the sweetest, quietest,  most behaved pup I ever owned and I honestly don't think I could ever find a dog with that personality again. Quiet, and chill, and smart, fun and not a box of endless destructive energy",
            "My LPT, spend as much time with the dog as possible, sometimes you get people who lie about the animal, either when they're surrendering it or from the agency. Go on long walks with the dog, get to know them, try and grab a toy from them. I know it seems crazy to say, but I have several friends and family members who've been lied to about their dog, sometimes minor (dog was waaaaay younger then they were told) sometimes major (dog had been returned 2 times for biting men while out and about, ended with the dog being put to sleep, no notice of this problem was given until the dog was with my mom for a year) and spending more and more time with them could have stopped that person from getting that kind of dog that she didn't have the time or the ability to train, thus why she'd gotten an adult dog she was told was pre-trained with no behavioral issues",

            "YES. My family adopted an adult dog when I was in high school, and I adopted 2 senior dogs after I bought my first home. Best experience ever. All three have since passed away and I've switched to cats due to changes in my hours at work, but when my life allows for dogs again, I'll be looking for the old pups who just need a soft pillow to lay on and a kind human to scratch their ears. It breaks my heart to think of all of the animals who were *everything* to some old person who had to give them up, and they don't know what happened or why, and now they're cowering in fear on the concrete floor in a noisy animal shelter when they are used to sleeping in the Big Bed next to Their Person who they loved more than anything. I live in an area with a lot of old people, and the local shelters are full of pets that had to be given up when their humans went into nursing homes or developed dementia/Alzheimer's or went into hospice or died.",
            "Also be prepared to deal with any behavior issues that adult dog may have. It'll be harder to train them out of those behaviors, and there could be a reason they wound up in a shelter.\n\nSource: my partner and I adopted a dog a little over a year ago. He was incredibly sweet but a couple months I to owning him he had bitten my partner twice drawing blood, and a friend of ours badly enough he had to go to the hospital, and we had to pay that $1200 bill. He loves us, but doesn't like anyone else, and because he also has some other issues, we've sent him to an incredibly expensive board and train program because we don't have the time or energy it takes (8-12hrs/day) to train him as well and as quickly as they're training him.",
            "Also, despite sounding morbid, an adult dog has fewer years left. If the commitment of the next 15yrs of your life is hard for your lifestyle, maybe you can give some old hound a good last few years",
            "Just be prepared for some odd behaviours. I strongly suspect that my dog may have suffered some abuse before we adopted her.\n\nInitially she was mortally afraid of the broom and hoover, then would viciously bark and snarl at them. \n\nAfter a few months she calmed right down and wasn't bothered by it much, provided we weren't doing it right next to her.",
            "The downside is you don't truly know what they've been through.  One dog I adopted had clearly been abused by large men, and he'd cower and piss himself.  Just standing up from sitting in a chair would set him off.  Women didn't set him off though.  Took over a year to break him of that fear.\n\nI'd never get a dog from a puppy mill, but damn if I haven't had some emotional rollercoaster rides taking in shelter dogs and seeing obvious signs of abuse.  It's still way more emotionally fulfilling to rescue and rehab a dog than buy a puppy that was bred for profit.",
            "Adopted my first shelter dog 4 months ago. His profile that the previous owner left with the shelter was off the mark.\n\nThey said he escapes a lot. He doesn't - runs about 50 ft then waits for you and runs back if you call his name. They said he is not crate trained. It took him a whole 2 days to settle into the crate. It means they didn't even try to train him. Now he likes to relax in his crate all the time.\n\nThey said he digs out under fences .... well they kept him outside for 16 hours a day. Who the heck wouldn't try to dig out in that case?\n\nHe has NEVER had an accident in the house.\n\nHe doesn't have a specific breed (glorious mutt!) but has a lot of chicken in him. He had been in a little room at the shelter for 3 months.\n\n\nHe is the sweetest thing. Gets incredibly excited if he sees me heading to the couch because he can sit in my lap and get some cuddles.\n\nYour mileage may vary ... but give it a shot. You may find a gem of a friend in a shelter!",

            "Just go to a shelter and see which dog works for you... There are plenty of adult dogs that were taught to be total assholes, or hate children, or are aggressive around other dogs/and/or children. Its about matching the right dog for you. Not about adopting a dog cuz its stuck in a hole. I can't stand this logic that \"every dog deserves to be adopted\" ... Yes, they do, but its about the fit not the sympathy.",
            "In October I adopted a year and half old pitbull and she has been just the greatest thing. She was abused by a previous owner so it took her a while to get used to everyone and she was very shy at first but now her personality is starting to come through and boy, does she have personality. She can be such a sassy little girl, she is just about the biggest goof I've ever seen, she is incredibly sweet and very affectionate, and a bug old cuddle bug. Shes pretty smart to, she knows a few basic commands and tricks. Her favorite thing though is the words \"car ride\" I'll ask her \"do you wanna go car ride?\" And she just goes bananas, zooming all over the house before she comes and sits down so I can put her harness on her. She also knows different places. If I take her to go see her mama (my girlfriend) she knows when we are close to her house, same with our house. She also knows when she is at the park. And again, she gets super excited. I'm sorry for rambling but I really just love her so much and am so glad we adopted her",
            "My SIL just got a Chihuahua mix that the agency assumed to be about 2y. Not sure what they told her before she adopted because this was on a college campus.\n\nAnyway she's sweet but clearly has issues. Obviously neglected and always wants to be around someone. She doesn't take issues with other dogs or people. Her bark sounds like she doesn't know how to bark. It's funny to listen to but if you think about it there's problems behind its sound. Also she's not house trained. I can't tell you the number of accidents she's had because they're almost daily. We take her out and she'll come in to pee on the floor. It's bad. We're working on it.\n\nThe agency had no idea what her life was like before the two weeks before the adoption when she was pulled off the streets of LA somewhere and put in a shelter before taken to this event. She was obviously loved but neglected. Doesn't know any tricks and the house training thing was a big sign.\n\nBe cautious. The more you know about their history the better. Age doesn't equate to knowledge or training.",
            "Yessss!!! My boy Nacho was a rescue that got shipped to Oregon from an out of state kill shelter. He was 2-3 years old and nobody wanted him. It\u2019s crazy because he is the sweetest dog. Also, as someone that was potty training children, an adult dog was the best thing in the world.",
            "Can\u2019t always guarantee a successful adoption.\n\nBrought an adult dog into my home with two other adult dogs.  \n\nEveryone got along well but Floyd would not stop pissing on the furniture.  All over the furniture.",
            "Be careful though. I got one, it was a beauty and well trained but on the 2nd week, it bit one of the household. The trainer told me to give it back because in time it would bite me too. Not the normal case I suppose, but you never know what they\u2019ve been through",
            "Yeah, BUT... Sometimes they come prepackaged with issues that led to them being in the shelter to begin with.\n\nWe adopted a shelter dog, and we love her, don't get me wrong, but she has awful anxiety issues, and is aggressive when we introduce her to a new dog (*never* toward people). She doesn't like being outside unless I'm with her, and even though she insists on my presence, for some reason she won't obey commands at all outside, and barely even responds to her name. Indoors, she is a perfect, obedient dog. She gets a little excited when we have guests over, but other than that she's calm and well-behaved.\n\nPoint being, she came to us with some weird issues pre-installed, and since I have no idea how they were formed, they're difficult to fight. We're beginning to overcome the anxiety about being outside without me, but it's been a process.\n\nSo. YMMV with OP's advice.

Last year his only dog friend got put down because of age and very bad health. He was never inside a house or room, he lived in a kennel outside since he was 5 weeks old. Nobody took him for walks, learned him stuff etc... \nWe know that he would probably be afraid of everything and may not adapt to his new lifestyle completely, but I wanted to give him love for the last years of his life.\nSo we built a big dog house in our small garden and got him to our place from the neighbour country, where he lived.\nHis eyesight is already fading, he has trouble hearing and hip problems. He is too thin and he smelled so bad til we got rid of all the old fur (he has long fur and we brush him everyday and i could already make a sweater out of the fur that comes out)\nHe likes our other dog and she likes him, he learned to walk stairs after a few days and came from the garden into our living room. He still has some problems with our wooden floor but it gets better. \nHe loves to get pet and to go an walks, even if he has hip problems he jumps around and knocks off stuff from tables if someone takes his leash. \nHe is a bit quirky and clearly doesnt know how to drink water without making a huge mess, but we love him and we will take good care of him now. We already got him checked by a vet and bought high quality food which he loves.",

While I love my the dogs my folks currently have (two pure goldens because they were my mom's dream dogs and a pure black lab that kinda just fell into their lap) by far my favorite was a shelter dog we used to have named Annabelle. https://i.imgur.com/Dy220al.jpg\n\nShe had been a huge risk for my parents to take on as someone had used her as not just a breeder but a bait dog (teeth worn to nubs to not beable to fight back, multitude of scars, ect) and on top of that she had still been healing from a gunshot wound from a overzealous farmer. They almost took her back the first night as it didn't seem like she was going to get along with our other dogs at the time (a mixed black lab and a mixed shepard both rescues) but what else would you expect from a dog in pain and in a strange new place? I could count the number of times she'd mean growled on a single hand over the many years she lived with us. Hell she never even made a sound when my parents had to irrigate her wound with the shower head every night to help it heal. After she healed Annabelle was the sweetest and gentlest dog I've ever encountered. She had her quirks (god those room clearing farts) but she was hands down my favorite dog ever. If it wasn't for her eating habits, she'd also eat food on her level much less poop, she would have made the perfect therapy dog. I miss the happy growltalking she'd do instead of barking... Despite her harsh early live Annabelle was a survivor till the very end.",

Think about how lazy people typically are, those are the people who don't train their animals and then put them in the shelter. \n\nSure, sometimes there will be a dog in the shelter that is a wonderful fully trained animal but those are definitely the exception not the rule.",

These animals also are more often less stressed and better trained. \n\nAnyway, don't be scared of getting a \"broken\" pet. A good shelter will never give you an animal that you can't handle. So many of them are well behaved and trained, and will give you just the same love as an expensive pure breed from a breeder.

She wanted nothing to do with anything going on in the shelter. Kennel worker went in and got her and had to drag her out with her tail tucked between her legs. She did not like Boo sniffing her and she did not move the entire time we had her out of the kennel. She wasn't aggressive and snappy or anything but she hid her face and hid behind me holding the cat. She took no interest in Boo or the cat. Once they put her back into the kennel run she went straight back to the corner and stick her face in it and wouldn't have anything to do with anybody. \n\nI told Charlie that he would have a pretty hard time dealing with an aggressive dog but that he could get a shy dog to come out of her shell so he decided he would go ahead and get Chanel.

They were terrific pets and had different personalities. #1 , Boo, was dumb as a bag of hammers but gentle and loving, also a devout coward. #2, Rascal was very smart and feared nothing on God's green earth. A genuine tough guy yet I never saw him hurt another living thing. once caught him holding a young bunny between his paws and licking it - I believe he thought it was a puppy that smelled funny and needed cleaning up (rabbit was fine except for being scared). #3, Bonkers was an amalgam of small hunting breeds (Jack Russell. Schnauzer, Dachshund and who knows?) He had a great fear of any kind of stick, broom handle, etc - we think he'd been beaten. Took him a year or two to learn we'd never hit him.

We didn't want to be rude, so we danced to the whole 10+ minute slowish song and the mood was officially killed.  \n\nNow that the song was over, guests were lined up trying to give the DJ personal requests and the DJ obliged for several songs until my officiant stepped up and told him \"No More\".\n\nLuckily we were able to bring the night back to a great mood, but there was a 30 minute window that we'll never get back.

            "Very good LPT. Got two short stories on my own experiences with DJs.  \n1) The Good: I was at a wedding as the best man. I went up to the DJ to request a song, as multiple people had before me. The DJ looked at me, and said \"Aren't you the best man?\" I said, \"Yes.\" His reply: \"I was told they would stop payment on my check if I allowed any song selections from you.\" That... was probably a good call. I am not known for my taste in music.  \n2) The Bad: Aspiring DJ dated a coworker of mine. He was confused why no one liked him at parties. I did a little digging and found out why (and told him exactly why). He ONLY played what his girlfriend liked to listen to. He refused requests and couldn't read the room. There were multiple parties where his girlfriend was the only one dancing by herself on the floor, and couldn't figure out the problem on his own. Finding out the why did not change his behavior because his girlfriend wouldn't be happy.",

People have no clue what a DJs equipment costs.   Just a decent microphone, not even top of the line is $600!  A good mixer/controller $1200, a great one over 2k.

            "I'm a wedding DJ.\n\nA better tip is to hire a competent DJ. The guy charging \u00a3100 is likely to ditch you at the chance of a better paying gig, or generally not have the music or experience to make your event personal to you. Most couples think nothing of spending hundreds of pounds on a cake, but want to hold back on the person who is going to entertain you and your guests for an entire night. \n\nI always have communication well before an event to gain insight into the bride and groom and their preferences. \n\nI can try understand them and the sort of guests they have coming to an event without the need for a huge playlist. \n\nRegarding unplanned announcements etc.  I make an excuse for the person to come back in 20 minutes, allowing me time to find the bride or groom and discuss with them. Although this is less likely to happen than a fight breaking out in my experience. \n\nOn nights where they have a more alternative music taste. The 1st half hour or so after the 1st dance is kept to their taste. However throughout the buffet and maybe an hour or so afterwards, I recommend letting the DJ have freedom to entertain. Then your auntie and uncles and guests that are likely to leave early have had the opportunity to dance and enjoy what they like. Around 10pm I would revert back into the bride and grooms taste for most of the remainder of the evening. The end of an event is hugely important to to get right. Half an hour of recognisable sing alongs, but keeping to their taste. If I make a mistake in song choices now, it is unlikely I will get the crowd back before the end. Finally I like to finish with a song for the crowd, (whatever feels right) and the very last song is something intended for Just the Bride and Groom. \n\nAll of this is completely just my advice, i'll always go with what the happy couple want, it's their day after all. However I recommend talking to your DJ and perhaps taking a little of their advise in board. We do this every week after all.",

What a company will do is act as a holding company for a bunch of insurance companies that do business in groups of states or sometimes a single state or single line of business.  It's not always because of state laws--a lot of the time it's because of acquisitions or companies that are only admitted in specific states.   \n\nFor example the Allstate Corporation is a holding company for Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company, Castle Key Insurance Company, and dozens more.  I picked on Allstate because I never worked for them.  What's important to note here is that there's a company just for New Jersey for similar reasons the CC company doesn't do business in IA.  They'll have another company for that.  It protects the holding company.  If an insurance company goes under because they wrote a bunch of garbage, the holding company cuts them loose.\n\nSo back to the Credit Card company, they'll do business in Iowa, just under another company name so if the laws turn against them, they don't have the international company's finances on the line.",

You had 1 hour to draw the system from memory, then the EO, Chief Engineer, and two POs would come in and you would explain everything you knew about it. How it worked, pressures, temperatures, and so on. After you've spewed your verbal diarrhea, they'd grill you on it to either point out your fuck ups, to see if there was other things you knew (such as procedures to make the system do various things), and what to do in emergencies. Myself and a couple others were scheduled to do that over several days, I wanted to go first, but they drew names for order and I was placed dead last, which was probably for the best.\n\nI had a bunch of civilian qualifications from before I joined, resulting in me knowing how a bunch of things related to the system I got worked that never really comes up. How various things work, how to bypass them/juryrig them when you don't have the right parts to fix them, and so on. You know, things you learn when you work for a company whose priorities are profits and getting jt back in production with what you have on hand over taking the time to do it right. I still knew how to do it right, but I also knew what ways you could cut corners when it suddenly became time critical.\n\nAfter we were all done, myself and the people who had done it were relaxing when one of the POs came in, looked at me, then looked at all of them and said, \"You're all fucking lucky he went last, because if he had gone first none of you would have passed.\"\n\nSo my advice is your position in the order should depend on 2 things.\n\n1. How confident you are in yourself and what you know about the subject, those who know more should go later as the first person can establish the basics and each subsequent one can build on that, and\n\n2.

            "Nope. Always go second. Nobody makes the first jump. This allows you to get the perks of going first but also see things like the type of audience you are dealing with. Can you lay in a joke or two, are you gonna have to try extra hard to get the audience's attention?",
            "As a teacher who has graded thousands of student presentations, this will also often result in a grade bump. If you aren\u2019t very prepared and wait to go until last, you might come right after an amazing presentation which will highlight your lack of effort/preparation.",

Fortunately, somebody else wanted to go first and he agreed to trade slots with me.\n\nWhen the day finally came, he got up first and he choked so hard that he left the auditorium in the middle of his presentation. I felt so bad for him. I guess nerves got to him. I was super nervous too--I had been dreading the day for months--but somehow I did pretty good.",

However, if you are in a situation like a job or training program where you are in this situation weekly with the same cohort, it can be detrimental to you and the group to share be the one jumping in first. It's easy to become \"that person\" who is always jumping in first, and it is more annoying than helpful.",

Class was Speech, or Speech Making, either way we basically made increasingly longer presentations in front of the class as the year progressed.\n\nOn day 1 of who wants to go first, I happily stood and walked to the front of the class, and gave my speech (I think it was 5 minutes long).  The rest of the week I sat back and relaxed listening to others make theirs.  Some students held out until they had to be told it was their turn.",

Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work very smoothly, because sometimes the literature teacher would rule me out pretty fast while testing the other students (I would answer enough questions other people wouldn\u2019t know to never have to do open presentations).",

            "I always go second. This way I can see an example presentation before mine (as people who go first usually do a good job since they're confident enough in their work to volunteer), and if I somehow misunderstood what needs to be done, I can change something last-second or present it in a different way. However, it's still early enough that I can get it out of the way and not have to stress about it.",

Throw everything together for another hour and be \u201cready\u201d the next day. We\u2019d just goof around the presentation having the class dying of laughter. Teach was usually rolling too but made sure we danced with the actual subject of the project. Would waste nearly the whole period messing around.

I don't know what got into me when the Prof. asked who'd like to go first, I straight up raised my hand.

            "If you're confident or have a shy personality, always be the volunteer. If you're shy and be the volunteer, in their mind maybe you're not the shy guy anymore; or not as much as they thought you were. If you're confident and outgoing and you volunteer, you're chilling. Realistically, you're probably not worrying about it much anyway.\n\nReferring to the presentation example. I'd like to add, people don't really care about how you are portraying yourself, nor how you feel about giving the presentation; unless it's suuuuper awkward etc. They are focused on the information you are giving, though, that depends on the situation, age and  environment. \n\nIf you're nervous about a presentation or something similar, my advice, just fake it. Just pretend you're a confident person, if your audience don't know you, it's a perfect situation to pretend. Eventually you will become confident because of the amount you've faked it; this is how I did it, I call it 'fake confidence'. Maybe there's another word for it amongst the psychology community. If you convince yourself or even partly convince yourself, you'll convince a lot of people, not everyone, but most.",

            "A similar piece of advice I always followed in school: if you are shy or introverted, sit in the front row rather than trying to hide in the back. If you want to contribute to the class discussion or get called on, if you're sitting in the back, others in the class will turn around and look at you. (Not all, of course, but even a few can be very distressing for people with anxiety.) In the front row, you can't see everyone  looking at you and it feels like a much smaller group, or just you and the teacher. Also, the teacher is looking out over the whole group and probably focusing less on the front row. In effect, you are hiding in plain sight. You also appear more confident and engaged just by virtue of sitting upfront.",

It goes, \"there is no pride in love.\" Now this doesn't have to apply strictly to your SO, it applies to friends and if you take the love part out, the same sentiment applies for work too. \n\nEven when you're dealing with otherwise mature and intelligent people, pride often comes up and prevents people from realizing or admitting they're wrong. They can't see that their short-term pride is detrimental to the long-term goal of harmony.\n\nI've made a concerted effort to consider other people's perspectives and think seriously about if I'm wrong in different situations.

He retired the year before but wanted to stay connected to education. Needless to say this 30 year veteran and bull of a man was rather intimidating to a new teacher. We made it to September and he royally screwed the pooch. During a violent outburst from a student with special needs he ignored protocol (the stuff that keeps kids safe AND covers the district's ass in case of a lawsuit) and essentially grappled the kid into a half nelson. This did NOT help the child deescalate. Fast forward to kiddo free from restraint and processing post-freakout and I tell my para I will need to speak with him during his plan. This gives me plenty of time to think of tactful ways to tell him he fucked up and I have to report it. I walk into his office and before I can open my mouth he starts owning everything about the situation, how he knows better and has already called the superintendent and in the future he will back off and let me take charge (per protocol). I spent about an hour freaking out about this confrontation with a man who has more experience and clout than I did and here he was ripping himself a new one on my behalf.

If you aren\u2019t, I would go to public libraries and see if they have access. If neither of those are an option, then I would contact the author. \n\nHonestly though, this LPT doesn\u2019t really scale well. If you\u2019re synthesizing an idea for a paper and need to do a lit review, do you really want to email 30 different authors for access to their papers, only for half of them to actually comply over the span of the next month? The real hierarchy here is database access > journal access > article access. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure why publishers are being thrown under the bus here. Sure, the publishing process can be dogmatic and sometimes a bit arbitrary, but journals essentially curate important research.

My understanding is that, for researchers, there isn't meant to be a 1:1 economic incentive to be paid for the time and effort that goes into research studies, especially those that take a long time to conduct. Rather, the point is that publishing in these journals is required to indirectly profit by attracting grant money and private investment or earning tenure from their institution.

            "If you want the real tip it is to stay in zone 2 cardio. This is how you build an aerobic base and is completely compatible with music/podcast/book on tape.\nMany fitness enthusiasts look down on this kind of steady-state cardio because it seems so easy but pros across all disciplines spend hours training like this. Mat Fraser, for example.",
            "I used to work out with a body builder and his fat burn was 30 minutes walking on the treadmill at max incline at like 2 speed.\n\nI got up to 250 pounds once (the bad kind) and lost 90 pounds in 7 months eating chicken and veggies for all my meals and walking a 3 mile loop every day. Walking kicks ass.\n\nEdit for clarity on some points:\n\nDon't choose between them. When I started walking, flat treadmill, at 1.5 speed for half a mile was getting my heart rate to 180bpm. Exercise was critical, diet was critical. After a few months the incline treadmill at 2.0 for 3 miles was maxing me out at 130 BPM - I was no longer dying. \n\nI've worked out my whole life pretty much (barring that messed up period in my life) and was bench pressing 110lb dumbbells, running 7 minute miles back to back for 7 miles and all that. So Ive been fortunate enough to play around with both levers in my life and see which one does what. \n\nLean muscle mass has a resting calorie burn. A pound of muscle needs calories to maintain and burn, a pound of fat needs nothing. There's the old joke of why do you think all the people doing weights are in shape while everyone on the cardio machines is out of shape? Do you think you like... graduate to the Smith Machine at some point after you've lost all the fat on the treadmill?\n\nI would not recommend considering cardio and resistance training as an optional supplement to your diet. The loss of muscle mass that accompanies many diets tends to make for an unhealthy situation as fat is a survival reserve and tends to go last and often you aren't losing at much fat as you think between water shedding and muscle cannibalism. \n\nYou have to eat when you wake up to start your metabolism and eat 5 small meals a day. You body holds onto fat unless it thinks it has a regular, consistent, intake of food and it can guarantee its next meal. Sumo wrestlers wake up at 4am, work out, eat at 10am, nap... They don't eat because eating turns on your metabolism and they want to get nice and big.\n\nSo, it really is best to look at it as both, because it actually is, and the changes are small enough where both should be simple enough to incorporate into your daily routine if you're planning on changing your lifestyle. \n\nI would spend my lunch at work walking up and down the stairwell for half an hour, slowly but it still kicks your ass. I found ways in my day to get moving again, it's out there somewhere. It was a scary place in my life for a lot of reasons and when I started doing both it really changed.",

Corporation won't let us do it though.\n\nPersonally, I'd much rather have a sign that says to not bring your entire family with you. This should be the one time where it's perfectly fine to act like it's the 80s again and leave your kid in the damn car for 10 minutes while you go get some groceries. I saw a woman today with five kids that had no interest in listening to her. I don't care if they made a mess, I'm there to clean it up anyways. What i cared about was the one that was coughing on everything they touched and the other one that had the sniffles and was getting snot all over everything. \n\nYes, I understand that not everybody can get away from the entire family. But in these times you need to make an effort to try and find a solution. I've said before that I take stuff to my sister to avoid her going out.

No one has been convinced to stay home in Indiana. It was as busy today is any other Friday. When we had Senior day at my store we apparently had a whole bunch of people come in for completely random stuff that you would never buy in an emergency. The guy who came in that just wanted some Cheetos Puffs, the woman who came in and bought a case of wine and a fake orchid. admittedly we had a bunch of senior show up who left or came in and shop for a couple of things and then abandon their carts out of annoyance that we were out of paper products and water.

I know a woman that was brought into the ER, admitted she had tried weed, was released. 2 years later, she gave birth to a premature baby due to preenclampsia. The infant intensive care unit pulled her file, threatened to take her baby, and reported her to DES because they said she had a history of using weed. This Poor woman had to drug test, (which was neg) just to take home her baby, and had to go through case services with DES. Yes, DES is a nightmare for anyone struggling with addiction. Be very careful what you admit to if there are kids in the home. They will remove parental rights permanently just for weed or alcohol. At least in Arizona. They criminalize addiction, and those seeking medical help, by ripping away their children, which IMO, worse than jail.\n\nAlso part of my point is, you don\u2019t even have to have children in the home at the time.

It sucked watching the kind, warm, and generous man I knew become a shell of his former self.   \n\n\nDuring his decline, he showed all the hallmarks of the disease: forgetting family faces and names, telling stories about false memories, and, in the end, a bit of belligerence (the kind you might typically see in a toddler).   \n\n\nThroughout his decline, I saw my family approach it in one of two ways: some would try to correct his mistakes over and over (to no avail), and some would just roll with the punches.   \n\n\nPlaying along with things in the moment always seemed to keep him more centered and grounded. Not only did it help calm him down, it made those painful visits a little less so by knowing he felt comforted by my validating his reality, and not trying to yank him out of whatever timeline/alternate universe he was visiting.   \n\n\nA simple example would be if he asked where his (long dead) mother was, I would just say \"she's visiting with your sister and will be back soon.\" What good would correcting him do? Then he'd have to re-live that trauma of losing his mom all over again, possibly many times a day.   \n\n\nOr when he would say something outlandish like, \"I used to be a senator, you know\" I would just say, \"oh that's right, I forgot all about that, tell me more!\"   \n\n\nI have to give credit to a [TEDMED talk](https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=526821) that I saw describing this whole approach, many years ago. I'm so glad I saw it because it absolutely changed the way I spent time with my dad, and made it easier, richer, and more gratifying in spite of the misery of the disease. Hope it helps you, too.   \n\n\nAnd fuck you, Alzheimer's.\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t keep up with all the replies and awards, but I am so grateful to everyone for your kind words. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to find this useful; it totally changed how I talked with my dad    \n\nBest wishes to all of you.\n\nEdit 2: This is not a magic wand that wipes dementia away. It\u2019s an approach to managing some of the challenges of its effects. I am definitely not a doctor, do not take this as medical advice. YMMV depending on each individual.\n\nEdit 3: For the love of god, the (attempted) political jokes are just not landing, please stop. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself.",

            "Thank you for this. I'm definitely going to listen to that TED talk\n\nUnfortunately my mamaw's delusions weren't so innocuous... they got quite dark sometimes, definitely not the type of thing I would have wanted to validate as reality. She would say there were a bunch of dead bodies in the backyard, or a vicious family of foxes in the fireplace, or the house was about to explode and we all needed to evacuate. Though now I could see the benefit of not necessarily validating but... dampening? Instead of saying \"no, mamaw, the house isn't going to explode\" I could have said \"oh, it's okay, I knew about that and I fixed it this morning, so there's no danger of an explosion anymore\". \n\nThere was one time that she had been going on about the house exploding for a while and my papaw was getting fed up with her. He raised his voice in frustration to reiterate that the house was not going to explode and he wasn't leaving his chair. She responded, \"well, okay then, I guess I'll stay here and die with you,\" sat down next to him, and held his hand. It was a poignantly romantic moment.\n\nDementia is truly terrifying. I can't imagine how it felt to be in her head. It is my worst nightmare to experience that.\n\nEdited to add: something a little less depressing. Throughout my whole life, my mamaw would occasionally grab my hands, look into my eyes, and tell me \"you're so pretty\". She continued doing this even as her dementia developed, but eventually she lost the ability to talk, so she would just grab my hands and look into my eyes for a while and I would tell her she was pretty instead of the other way around. As her dementia advanced, she did it less and less, so I would do it to her instead. And I could swear that I saw something in her eyes that led me to believe that she remembered something when I did that even near the very end. I don't think she remembered who I was, or even why I was grabbing her hands and telling her she was pretty, but I feel like maybe she felt there was something fleetingly familiar about those moments.",

When they zone out, just keep on the conversation with the other person in the room, if you are the only other person, think of it as a monolog, just your voice being cheerful is good.",

            "I work as a cook in a memory care center devoted to dementia and this is 100% correct. When you correct them or tell them they've imagined something they suffer that all over again. It's much gentler instead to roll with it into a redirection. For example, if your loved one is talking about their parents who have passed, instead of correcting them and making them relive that loss all over again, you could say \"Well your dad isn't here right now. Why don't you tell me about him while we wait?\" It validates them, prevents pain, and redirects them to happy memories.",
            "i used to take care of people with alzheimer's and i agree with you 1,000,000%. i saw so many family members trying to force their mom or dad back into the present and into reality, never realizing all they were doing was scaring and confusing them. that's not how you do it. it doesn't *matter* how you feel about it because it's a disease that is literally changing the shape and size of their brain with every passing day. you HAVE to go into their world. no matter how much it may hurt you, it makes their life so much nicer - and they don't have a lot of life left.",
            "This is honestly the best approach for the person with dementia. I work in a dementia care facility and see it all the time. There is still some debate about the ethics of \u201clying\u201d to the person but I find you can go along with things pretty well without lying at all \u2014 usually simply by using reflective listening to respond or asking questions. If something is really itching at them it\u2019s helpful to redirect/distract with something else until they eventually forget about the issue. \n\nFor example it\u2019s common for folks to wander or try to \u201cgo home\u201d (\u201chome\u201d might be where they moved from 6 months ago or even where they grew up 60 years ago); it can be helpful to walk with the person, gently guide them, ask them things like \u201ctell me about home,\u201d and direct the conversation elsewhere if possible, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we have a cup of tea and you can tell me about it?\u201d etc.\n\nYou\u2019re right, often correcting folks with dementia just upsets them and forces them to relive trauma. Does it help anyone to remind Dolores that her mother died 20 years ago? Wouldn\u2019t it be kinder to say \u201ctell me more about your mom, let\u2019s sit and have a chat.\u201d",
            "My dad does this with my grandpa(dementia), he just jokes around with him (obviously not in mean way) while he makes up (or does he?) stories from the past. There's actually so much stuff he repeats that's funny and my dad just plays along.\n\nFor example, he used to say a lot (still does a bit) that he went out with Putin (we're not Russian or anything close) to discuss his taking over the local football club. In another story Putin takes him in a private jet to watch same team play vs Arsenal (idk why he remembers Arsenal). He constantly mentions having a 3rd child (who hes named as himself) that owns a restaurant in Germany (again we're not German). But the best one is when he claims that the town will have a statue built for him and my dad asks him shit like where and why , what material etc. \n\nMy dad asks him if he did weed and shit and he keeps bragging he did a lot. Stuff like this. Dementia sometimes scares me, because he seems to make up stuff on the spot, or have pre thought about it. He may say one thing (prooobably fictional) and maybe you ignore it or not respond much. Then he'll say it again later (and later etc.) and you can ask him very specific details and he'll make them up on the spot. Sometimes also his brain has insane clarity and he remembers insanely small stuff, but then it just \"turns off\" again. Recently I was having an ice cream and he wanted one too so he told me to bring one and my grandma (so she teaches him to not demand stuff, cus thats gonna be obvsly very tiring for her living him alone) told him to let me eat my ice cream. He repeated it like 6 times till I ate mine. But the terrifying part is as soon as he'd spell it out, then he'd instantly realize and be like \"oh ye ye eat yours\".\n\nFuck I really hope this isnt a \"running\" thing (dont think its proven to be?) in the genes, its actually scary af what brain can do.",

At the beginning it used to make me sad. I recognized her dementia way before she was diagnosed. Remotely identified every single health problem ahead of time (at this point I\u2019m a professional patient to be honest) and prepared his kids for everything upcoming before the doctors said anything to them. I was stuck here in States post surgery, when she was in her last days. Extremely frustrated and got severely suicidal. Combining what she was going through and lack of hospice care, remotely fighting the doctors through my aunts uncles and mom to get them to stop giving her life saving measures and extending her agony; that all put a dent into my own health battle and I attempted. Luckily (or not - all how you look at it) I survived. \n\nDon\u2019t make them feel frustrated.

So all the vets there needed frequent nursing and help, most could get around the wing on their own, some out with their families, but all had dementia of some sort.\n\nThis was advice given to us when I started and it was so helpful.\n\nI remember one guy, who was a tail-gunner in a bomber and flew missions over Dresden, would often be very lucid and clear but wake up with wild fantasies about where he'd been.\n\nI walked in one morning and asked how he was doing and he told me he had just gotten back from Vegas, gotten laid, drunk, won a bunch of money and had a great time. We probably talked for half an hour about his 'trip' and it was clear it made him happy - so just roll with it.\n\nThe other best piece of advice given to me by those who worked there was, \"They won't remember your name, what you're doing there, or why you're talking to them - but they'll always remember how you make them feel.\"\n\nBrought home to me one day after a whole summer of spending regular time with the saltiest, most curmudgeonly old guy on the wing who was often nasty, difficult, and the nurses *hated* dealing with. I made him a project and just spent time, listened, talked, and made frequent contact.\n\nOne day I was sitting behind the nurses' station and he pulls himself down the hall in his wheelchair asking every nurse if they had \"seen his buddy\". I couldn't figure out who he meant until he saw me. \n\nMakes such a difference to just spend time with folks that have dementia - even if they're non-verbal and you just sit and talk to them, read to them, sing to them, or be in silence together.",

As his granddaughter. Fully bearded, shirtless, and all, during his moments of clarity he knows who I am. My mom and aunt are my biggest supporters, and when he calls me \"she\" or uses my old name, at first they were quick to correct him- to protect my feelings. Wow, what a great mom and aunt; but I had to have a difficult conversation with them that went something like this- \"thank you so much for respecting my new name and pronouns, and for defending me when I need it most. But please stop correcting grandpa when he calls me by my old name. It is more important to him, and to me, that he gets positive feedback regardless of his declined state. My feelings might be hurt when he kisses me on the beard and calls me a 'fine lass,' but he is so confused and afraid all of the time, so giving him every victory to celebrate matters a whole lot. When he recognizes me as [old name], please either just roll with it or say something like \"[old name] goes by [new name,] now, but good memory!\" He's a very proud old man who works hard at his therapies- those little bits of encouragement go a long way, and I would rather he remember me for who I was than not at all. Also, even when he forgets his own daughters, he ALWAYS remembers my dog. When I have errands to run, I drop my dog off at his house and ask if he doesn't mind watching him for a few hours.

I still have great memories of us holding hands and walking the neighborhood while she told me about people in her past.

Like if a resident says they\u2019re waiting for their mother to pick them up, respond by saying their mother called earlier to say she\u2019s running behind and will be late. There are, of course, times that we cannot affirm the resident. If they begin talking about dark things, such as death of themselves or others, we do what\u2019s called redirecting. This can be anything from providing them an activity, providing some sort of sensory stimulation like a hand massage or a sensory toy, or reminiscing about more positive times. The purpose of this is to redirect their attention away from the negative thoughts or distress.\n\nFun story about a time I couldn\u2019t affirm a resident. Resident saw me and looked very angry, shouting \u201cLet them out! Let them out!\u201d I asked the resident who they were referring to. Resident replied \u201cThere are tiny people trapped in your pants, you\u2019re killing them! Let them out!\u201d. It was my first month working there, so this really threw me off. Provided resident with a snack and they seemed fine after that.\n\nTL;DR This is a great LPT, if there\u2019s a time you can\u2019t do this, change the subject or just redirect their attention elsewhere.",

            "My grandma who is 96 has Alzhiemers. She's honestly the most sweetest, loving and caring person in the world.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is she can be very forgetful about everything, where she is, family faces etc however as soon as I play music from her era she instantly sings along word for word and her face completely lights up with a huge smile.\n\nThe power of music is simply amazing it's even got me into her music of when she was my age now!",
            "Yes! And if I may add, when talking with them treat them as a non-native speaker of your language - they often try to tell you things but lack the vocabulary to express themselves, so their sentences sound weird and out of place (for example my grandma forgot the word for \"fox\" and \"run\" and she told me she just saw \"a red-headed racoon zoom\" which is only gibberish at first glance) - you have to guess what they want to say and help them out a little. I was the closest person to my grandma when she had Alzheimer's because I was the only one actually able to hold a conversation with her and understand what she was trying to communicate. I could see how frustrating it was for her to be left with less and less vocabulary and I would \"translate\" what she was trying to say for as long as I could understand her.\n\nAlso, fuck Alzheimer's and all the people who still think it's okay to joke about having it. Miss you babcia.",
            "Worked at a neurology clinic for a while and can confirm this was the advice given to so many family members of dementia patients. It is easier for both the family members and the patient if you just agree with how they recall and remember things. Gave this advice to an older lady caring for her husband and she came back for a follow up appointment and she looked 10x better. She told us she had always tried to correct him and it seriously took a toll on her. When she started to agree with him, she felt an enormous weight lift off her and she started to tell herself that these stories were his dreams. Instead of avoiding conversations with him and getting frustrated when they occurred she would now listen for hours at his incorrect stories. \u201cHe was never that creative throughout our marriage, but now he\u2019s like an author brainstorming new book ideas each day.\u201d",

He started forgetting names and faces and doing things like walking around the house in the nude.\n\nWhen things started getting really bad he would stand in their yard screaming, in the middle of the night thinking he was back in his home country and crying for his parents who were taken to concentration camps. Very awful for my nana. \n\nAlzheimers is a horrible disease",
            "Absolutely true. Had a family member who had Alzheimer's and the doctors told us to never correct their memories or stories. This confuses them and makes them distressed when they cannot rmbr things properly and thus they freak out sometimes and feel bad. This can cause things to get even worse if done often. We basically played along and kept a happy mood going for the most. Definitely helps because there is nothing you can do to reverse Alzheimer's or dementia when diagnosed, you can only prevent further damage and make it more enjoyable so everyone can live as close to normal",
            "Totally agree.   We spoke with the Alzheimer's society when my mother slipped into dementia and this was a major instruction.   So instead of correcting her, I'd just go along with the flights of fancy - \"There's a group of policemen running along the top of the hospital chasing a bad guy\", \"I saw my husband leading a parade down the corridor in the nursing home with a big brass band following him\".  \"Oh really Mum, that must have been fun!  Dd you all join in?\" etc..   Now my Dad is slipping into it - he told me yesterday from the nursing home living room that he was in a rural railway station, watching a signalman fix the signals.   In all cases, going along with it and asking for further descriptions is best.  My sister corrects hm, and he ends up coming to his senses, then realises his visions were untrue, and then feels appalled and ashamed.   There is nothing to be gained for them by you insisting they are imagining things.",

I know what\u2019s coming and I\u2019m not ready for it. She\u2019s the matriarch of my family on my dads side. Raised three boys by herself while putting herself through nursing school. Worked as an RN for 30 years at the same hospital. I was the first born grandchild of 8 and she was the nurse who helped deliver me. First to hold me and bathe me. She took me to Chicago to see my great aunt every summer growing up. We did all kinds of things together. I feel like an awful grandchild because I live 5 hours away and never have time to go visit.",
            "The different stages may need different approaches. My Dad was 1000 miles away and I hadn't seen him in a few months. When I walked in I waited for him to see me. His eyes traveled up from the floor to my face...and LIT UP! He rose to his feet and said, \"I am SOOO glad to see you!\" But couldn't call my name. That doesn't matter. But what happened next mattered a lot. We walked outside and he hesitantly......ashamed almost....said. I want to ask you something? I should know this but I can't figure it out. I know that there is a woman in my life named Pearl, but I can't figure out if she is my mother? Or my wife?\n\nI was a little upset with my family right then (he hadn't had a visit for 2 weeks) and with perhaps more passion than was warranted, I gave him his entire life history. Names of his 6 children, dates born, where he lived, who he worked for, what he drove, his rank in the Navy, name of his school. How long ago his Mom had died of cancer. And we walked around the corner of the building so I could point up to the house on the hill that his wife Pearl was living in with my sister. \n\nHe cried and said, \"Thank you. Thank you SO MUCH!\"\n\nCrying with him , I said \"Why, for telling you your Mother has been dead for 40 years?\"\n\nAnd his answer will always live in my heart.....\"NO, no I remember....I KNOW WHO I AM! \n\nIt lasted all day....and was the last time I saw him alive. That day was a gift we gave to each other.",
            "My step dad had dementia.  While he was suffering from it my mother died.  He would forget and ask for her or talk about her (they were soulmates so much as anyone can be).  His doctors and caregivers would remind him she died and he\u2019d be inconsolable.  I had to have a talk with them about this.  If in his reality they just went shopping, good for him.  Let him have that.  He\u2019s never getting better so let him find comfort where he can.  God knows I wish I could forget she\u2019s gone sometimes.",

            "This! I worked a lot with people who had Alzheimer's and dementia, and the best thing to do is kinda just go with the flow.

            "My grandfather has dementia, and my grandmother recently passed away due to cancer. I guess the silver lining is that he didn\u2019t have to suffer the pain o f losing her because my grandfather was already starting to forget who she was. He isn\u2019t aware of her passing, but mysteriously he started calling me every single day. We chat about the same life events over and over but he changes a little detail every single time, and sometimes I just don\u2019t know how to correct him, so I just casually build upon whatever narrative he\u2019s coming up with.\n\nThanks for this technique. I\u2019ll be sure to use it tomorrow, as we just got off the phone.",
            "I lost my grandfather to Alzheimer\u2019s when I was a sophomore in college.  He was a professional boxer and would always ask me if I wanted to learn how to box. He would sit in his wheelchair and I would sit in a chair opposite from him. We would drill his \u201cfamous 14 punch combo.\u201d He was always so happy when I would agree to learn. As soon as I could see he was getting winded I would tell him, \u201cGrandpa I\u2019m getting tired, I need a water break.\u201d And he would tell me I need to work on my cardio haha. \nTowards the end stages he couldn\u2019t remember my name and that was tough. But every time would visit him in the hospital and remind him I was his grandson, he would always have the same reaction, \u201cwow! Such a handsome young man I have for a grandson.\u201d He had a stroke a couple days before he died (the 8th one) and when I went to visit him he couldn\u2019t open his eyes. But when I said, \u201chi Grandpa,\u201d he recognized my voice and called me by my name. I held his hand until I had to leave to study for a final the next morning. He passed early the next morning and my parents waited till after my exams to call me and let me know.  I miss you, Grandpa.",
            "I used to work in assisted living. I will never forget the day one of my beloved Alzheimer's residents insisted that I was her granddaughter and I needed to practice my singing for church choir. She pointed at a random book on the shelf (it was an Anna Nicole Smith biography) and had me sit with her all day singing. I sang every hymn/churchy-sounding song I could think of. She was wheelchair bound and this facility did not use any kind of restraints. Luckily for us there were only three residents and the other two required minimal supervision, so I was able to be with her most of the day and redirect her when she would try to hop up and say \"okay it's time to go to church\".

            "I have a good memory of this working for my dad. I took him on a walk one afternoon. As we walked, he would point out things like where his high school was and where he and his friends would hang out. The thing was, we were in a different city from where he grew up... Also, he was 58 and was talking to me like he was 19 or so. He talked shit about my grandma and talked about where his friends would hang out. From what I could tell, he thought I was one of his good friends. It was hard to deal with at the time, but I went along with it and he got to really enjoy a nice relaxing walk and some old memories. It\u2019s one of the best memories I had with him from his dementia diagnosis til the end.\n\nI\u2019ll never my grandma, but hearing my dad at 58 turn to me and say \u201cyeah my mom can be such a bitch sometimes\u201d may be the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever heard him say.",

His doctors told the family not too indulge his fantasies, that we would have less slicks moments with him if we indulged him.

If your loved one believes she is visualizing a deceased relative or perhaps needing to put the chickens up for the night (when you have no chickens), you would simply redirect their thoughts into a discussion about that relative or those chickens. \"How does Aunt Matilda wear her hair?\" or \"How many eggs can we expect in the morning?\"",

So I helped her get her shoes on and took a walk down and back in the hallway to meet the people. \n\nIn another scene she was trying to leave (she was high fall risk so keeping her in bed was a safety priority) and she thought I was her cheating husband and was getting up to leave me because she caught me in a movie theater with \u201cthat woman!\u201d She simultaneously thought I was her drug-addicted son. I then had to show her my arms to prove there were no track marks. I then had to assume the role of her husband to convince her that I was turning a new leaf and had taken her to the hospital to get better and that she needed to let the nurses take good care of her and she bought it! \n\nShe was really sweet except to me. Poor lady had a hard life it seems.",

            "My father\u2019s side of the family seems to get it in their mid to late 70s. I watched my great grandfather forget my father upon meeting. My dad used to spend so much of his childhood with him, running from abuse. I wasn\u2019t told \u2018til I was older that my dad fell into a deep depression. As a young kid I could tell that something scarred him and my dad is still jaded a bit to this day. I like to think he won\u2019t forget me when he\u2019s old but I can\u2019t be sure. I\u2019ll likely fall victim to it too.\n\nI had a strange bug affect my psyche earlier this year. I could remember many things from my past and internalize current details but lose short-term ideas. I couldn\u2019t differentiate between current impulses and impulses that had already been fulfilled. (Ex: Feeling an itch, unsure if I\u2019d itched it already or find myself *still* itching a spot that I was unsure was itchy anymore. Alternatively, considering to say something and blurting it out, or not being able to understand if I\u2019d already said the words I thought. I\u2019d get sooo sucked into my expectations, impulses, and imagination that I couldn\u2019t recall the immediate.) That experience was hellish but I feel more armed to tackle it in the future and strangely am no longer suffering. Just under the affects and then suddenly not. Horribly strange.",

            "Both of my grandmother's had dementia in the end. My maternal grandmother had fallen and hit her head. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but she was not the same afterwards. Up until that point, her mind was still 100%. She had mentally showed no signs of aging. Then suddenly she was like a child in a lot of ways and had to be cared for. My paternal grandmother had a natural descent. It started with a slipping memory that just seemed like she was showing her age. But it kept getting worse. By the time family was able to get her to see a doctor, she wasn't willing to participate because she felt like they were calling her crazy. She literally couldn't remember a conversation by the time the conversation ended. The best thing you could do was kindly answer her question, \"no thanks grandma, I'm not hungry.\" My younger brother didn't understand at the time and would yell at her because he was annoyed (this would have been wrong even without the dementia, but I couldn't get parents to do anything to teach him). He would get so annoyed and snap at her that he had already answered her question 15 times in a row. Snapping at her did no good. To her, every time she asked was the first time she asked. Why carry so much anger over something a person can't control? Don't waste that time trying to correct them. You'll only be disappointed and resentful because they cannot do better. Just enjoy the time you have left. It doesn't last long.",

            "My Grandparents raised me, I would be either dead or in prison if not for their guidance and unconditional love.  Grandpa fell ill, dementia set in, and I was a senior in High School.  Emotionally and physically, Grandma had a difficult time dealing with his mental state, so I took on the role of giving him baths, checking on him in the night when he became confused, and helping him with the day to day.  \n\nAs he slipped further into his confusion, he no longer recognized me, though initially it was painful, I was young and accepted easily.\n\nOften he would confuse me with an old friend of his, from the War.  Grandpa was a WWII vet, and in this stage of his life, he wanted to take up smoking again (at this point, who cares right?).  I would sneak him out onto the back porch, in the middle of the night, allow him to have a few smokes.  \n\nHe would regale me with tales of the War, often times assuming I was there.  He would tell me about the prostitutes in Paris, the adventures he had running a black market shop in Belgium, how terrified he was on the front lines, and how music from \"down home\" made him feel better.  I rolled with his stories, and just smiled.\n\nWhat an amazing man.  I'd not give up those moments for anything.  Thank you Papaw, for everything, I named my son after you.",

Also, more recently, my grand mother was of sound mind but in her final days her lifetime friend who had passed came to visit her, and we aren\u2019t sure if she\u2019d been there for her younger self\u2019s lovers death (he may of came to visit her, too) but she said he said it was supposed to be easy and she was scared, and it was taking too long.

She\u2019d been living with her granddaughter and would just howl her name all day long. Apparently my voice sounded like her granddaughters so she thought I was her granddaughter. We\u2019d sit together and I\u2019d bring her Oreos and hold her hand. I\u2019d take her to sit outside. She\u2019d ask me questions and I\u2019d just make up answers I thought her granddaughter would give. She was just so happy with me in those moments though, smiling and peaceful.",

By the time I was 10 I old enough to understand there was a problem when the adults refused to acknowledge it.\n\nMy grandfather never knew who I was.\n\nHe would call me by his nephew's names, and be surprised to find me in his house, when he didn't know i was coming over.\n\nI ended up just calling him \"sir\" because his nephew calling him \"grampa\" just confused him.\n\nI would just sit and listen.  Mom and Gramma would run in and try to \"fix\" him.\n\nBut just letting him work through it, he usually ended up closer to now than trying to intervene.",
            "My grandfather passed away after fighting Alzheimer\u2019s. I was a teen when my mother and I were bringing him to specialist appointment for his appendix. Every three minutes he would ask where we were going. We would tell him to the doctors for his appendix. Again, where are we going? To the doctors. Finally before he could ask again my mom flipped it and asked him, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d  \n\nHe was quiet and really thinking. \u201cI think to the doctors.\u201d My mom goes, \u201cReally? What for?\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. He looks her dead in the face and says, \u201cI think it\u2019s for my penis because no one uses it anymore. Must be broken.\u201d  \n\nWatching him dwindle to nothing was a terrible experience\u2014especially when I left for college and every time I came back he was just a little farther away.

            "My grandmother suffered from dementia. If something upset her she wouldn\u2019t remember what made her sad only that she was sad. So we did everything we could, like you are suggesting, to keep her happy. There was no point snapping at her and giving her the sad feeling when it wouldn\u2019t matter in a few minutes what the snap was about.\nShe was such a happy person, and encouraging that happiness and playing into it made the time I spent with her full of smiles.",
            "This brought back a wonderful memory for me! My grandfather died shortly after my birthday this year which was unfortunate, but toward the end he was losing touch a bit as the cancer had spread to his brain. He had often talked about how he was in jail but he is trying to break out. We loved hearing about our jailbirds plans to break out of the nursing home, bit it was sad that he felt so trapped. My grandmother told him when it was my birthday. My grandpa used to be a singer and a damn good one at that, but toward the end he wouldn't do it. But on my birthday he was excited to sing happy birthday to me and it made me CRY. But then he decided it was everyone's birthday, so my grandma video called everyone else so he could sing them happy birthday too! Oh it was amazing. Well then, he must have gotten into a festive spirit which made me so happy. He celebrated all kinds of holidays. The day before he died, was \"New Years Eve\" to him. I talked to him on the phone and he wished me a happy new year with so much strength in his voice I could have sworn he was going to beat the cancer. He went to sleep that night and didn't wake up again. He died later the next day. It almost feels like he knew that that was his last day and like...entering a period of change? I don't know. All I know is that man was a real life Mr. Rogers, and I couldn't have been luckier to have him. And letting him live in his delusions was actually quite nice for all parties.",
            "That's great advice! I wish I'd thought of that when my grandpa was still alive.\n\nSomething I had success with though was singing with him. I did it because we used to sing when I was a kid and he knew alot of songs by heart, and then sometimes other people living in his nursing home came and sang with us, so we all ended up having a great time instead of the painful visits other family members had. He even started remembering songs from his childhood, that my grandma had never heard him sing.\n\nI read somewhere after he died that music can temporarily bring back memories of a demented person.",
            "Have you ever heard of \"Everywhere at the End of Time\"? Kind of unrelated but it does relate to alzheimers and dementia, profoundly beautiful yet terrifying piece of music.\n\nMy great grandmother died of alzheimers and listening to this work of art helped me better understand, in a purely abstract way, what it might have been like, for better or worse.",
            "Did you ever wonder if your father would have momentary flashes of reality and wonder if those would be at risk by using this method?  I can't even imagine having to go through what you have.  Just the thought of losing my mom that way terrifies me.  I hope you're doing okay.",

            "My dad had dementia and it was a mixed bag. Some days he'd pack his briefcase for 'work' with things like the tv remote, kitchen utensils, knick knacks etc. (He was a school teacher/musician) and I'd always just say \"its Saturday dad, you had a crazy busy week and got your days mixed up.\" And he'd usually be ammendable to that response. However if he was going to a music gig and I'd try and push back, he'd get mad \"no I'm going to be late\" (he hated being late. A trait which did not rub off on me). So what I'd do then is ask 20 questions about the gig. Who's it for? Where is it at? etc. And he'd come to a realization that he was retired and move on to something else. \n\nThe hardest parts of dementia were the fights my parents had early on when we didn't realize his brain was betraying him and my mom thought that he suddenly just became an 9am heavy drinker. And more so watching him sitting on the floor weeping realizing that he was losing his mind. \n\nI will say though my dad was one of the great people you encounter in life. Everyone loved him and in turn he loved everyone else. He gave us really one of the most amazing gifts. Thru out his disease he never forgot our names/who we were except mine once. And it was only for 1 night. And the 2nd was he never made us change a shitty diaper. He ended up in the hospital for like 3 weeks so he needed to go to rehab to build his muscles back up but he didnt do well there and the decision was made to bring him home on palliative care and ultimately hospice. 2 nights before he came home I went to the rehab after work thus relieving my mom who had been there herself after work. I worked til 9pm at that time so she had been there like 3 hrs. Anyway he was particularly lucid that night and I told him he could leave if he felt like he needed to even though my sister was pregnant and due in 6 weeks time. (My mom would try to motivate him to eat by asking \"dont you want to meet your granddaughter?\" That I'd watch over mom and my sister. He at that point wasnt eating much and was getting nutrients via shakes and IVs. They talked about doing a feeding tube bc my mom was having a hard time coming to grips with it and I had to put the kibosh on that. However when he was coming home the dr. said if he doesnt eat he'll pass in 2 weeks. If he starts eating again (he was eating fine prior to hospital stay) who knows how long he'll be alive. So now my mom became super hopeful that he'll come home and be comfy in his surroundings and eat and just to be sure, she asked me about giving him thc to stimulate his appetite. Anyway, My dad was home for 30hrs before he passed away in the giant living room he loved to show off to visitors bc it has 12ft ceilings and is huge with a grand piano in the house he loved that had been built in 1883. \n\nSo daddy thank you for never making me change a diaper or putting us thru the pain of you not knowing who we were and being scared like so many others with dementia. I love you and I miss you everyday. \n\nMy dad had pride and style and he sure as shit did it 'My Way'",
            "Such a crazy disease. My dad, 83, has been suffering from dementia for the past few years. He is still very laid back and happy, but he is beginning to forget the important stuff - like faces and names of his five kids. I know when he forgets because when he sees me he says \u201cHey Buddy!\u201d - he knows I belong to him, but he can\u2019t quite figure out which of his sons I am at the moment. \n\nThe thing that gives me hope that this disease can be cured is the fact that the memories still exist in his head, he just can\u2019t seem to access them at the right time. For instance, he might forget my name - his son- but I recently showed him a photo of his high school graduating class and he went straight across the photo and identified 90% of the people, first and last name. My mom was in the same class and her mind is sharp as a tack- struggled with the same exercise. \n\nOne day, someone is going to figure it out and find a way to lock those pathways up.

Cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. For example, I have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and I can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.\n\nSimilarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. This goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. Properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",

She will go for the lips of the big dog, nip them, bite at her ham strings and just generally be a bitch. :D\n\nThe big dog is so gentle and views the small dog as  a puppy, she can take some abuse and sure has taught the small dog a ton of things in the year they have been together now. I am so glad the small dog is starting to improve, but still has a long ways to go. We rescued her from a pretty bad home and to top it off no structure, she was a complete disaster when we first got her. But she is a giant part of our family now and we would not give her up for the world. \n\nPoint is, if you are looking into this is the first place, you are already ahead of the game and will more likely raise a mature and properly socialized pupper. Keep learning and understanding dog behavior, it is an art much like bringing up well developed children. \n\n",

If you aren't patient enough to teach your cat how you want it to behave then you shouldn't own a cat.\n\nI adopted a starving, near dead feral cat (my SO and I dont have kids) and it took quite a bit of work to get him not to bite/scratch. When he would draw blood id give him a little bop on the head. When he played nice I gave him treats and encouraged him. Took about 6 months and a lot of scratches but hes super intelligent and a great cat now. If I took him to any shelter they wouldve put him down for sure as he was very defensive. Hes done a total 180. \n\nSo even if you have a problem cat and have just kinda started ignoring them, its not too late! Get a couple good books on cats and put some time in, its well worth it."

And, my experience with a cat that I have just seen 1 time is that I was with the cat and he just showed me his belly, I go for his head, he doesn't attack me, but stand up, next time I just don't do nothing, and I think that's what he wanted, because he just continued that way some time and then go for me (not to attack me). I know some cats will scratch and bit if you are closer to them that 1 meter (My aunt's cat use to be like that till he was like 6 years old), so if the cat doesn't approach to me, I don't, and if the cat approach to me in a violent way, I don't sit down.",

One of the people was especially annoyed by a guy who basically forced him to accept a blanket by throwing it next to him and immediately leaving. Blankets take up a lot of space, and the homeless person already had a blanket in their bag. He also couldn't just leave it there because that would have been waste dumping. The result was that the homeless person was basically forced to find the next public waste disposal and throw the blanket in there.\n\nHe also got six packs of water bottles dropped off next to him by people who didn't bother to ask what he needs and filmed this without his consent. Water bottles are fucking heavy, and he again can't just leave it there.\n\nAnd the granola bars. Man, I know beggars can't be choosers, but did you stop a second and think about how they might have rotten teeth or a nut allergy?\n\nThe bottom line is: Do not throw random shit at homeless people because you want to feel like a good person today. If you really want to BE a good person to them, either give them money or fucking ask them what they need.\n\n\"BuT wHaT iF tHeY bUy DrUgS aND aLcOhOL???\"\n\nThen fucking let them.

Everyone has their own story. \n\nMy father was a wonderful man who held a job, had a large home, and took care of me quite beautifully.\n\nTime was against him. Schizophrenia took away more of his life than he got to sanely enjoy. I didn\u2019t get to see him from about 2nd grade - 18/19 years old. Family tried to get him help but he lost the house and became homeless after \u201ckidnapping\u201d me during my mom\u2019s visitation week because he was \u201csaving me from the bad people\u201d. He never hurt me. He was genuinely trying to protect me.\n\nMy father was a security guard, a car repairman, a kind son, a passionately loving and creative father. \n\nOnce the mental illness started to come out, it eventually took over faster than anyone expected. He laughed at things that weren\u2019t there. He went through a phase of only trusting raw onions for food. Everything else was \u201cpoison\u201d. One day my grandpa found him in front of a 7-11 drinking from a milk carton and talking to himself. \n\nIt isn\u2019t fair how we treat people we don\u2019t know.

You're watching a kid trying to break into a car and your first thought is to phone the school?? Or maybe someone stole something out of your shop and you have footage that can identify them? The problem is I cant tell you the name of that student and I definitely cant give you access to them. You take that footage to the police station, then an officer comes to the school and gets all the contact info. \n\nAs for onsite crime like fighting? We have staff with RTs patrolling breaks. When a fight occurs, students are seperated (which can be challenging) and bought into the office. All involved write a statement. Caregivers are contacted, they come to collect student and speak to deputy principal. Caregivers are advised of the school process and what they can expect over the next couple of days. They are told they can go to make a statement at the police station if they choose. (Sometimes we strongly recommend it)\n\nThe Ministry of Education has procedures that we have to follow, there are different rules for stand down, suspension, expulsion/exclusion. We are limited as to what steps can be taken in relation to disciplinary action. Always go to the police if you are the victim of a crime.",
            "I was robbed at knifepoint at my college. I was asleep while three guys broke into my dorm. They were spooked that someone was actually there (My roommates were out at a bar, I had a test bright and early so I went to bed and all the lights were off). They took the few bucks I had in my wallet and told me I needed to go with them to the ATM down the street to get more cash. They walked out of my bedroom first and I slammed the door and barricaded it as quickly as I could. I called public safety and I couldn\u2019t believe how I was treated. They kept saying my dorm smelled like weed and they found weed residue on multiple surfaces in my dorm. Nobody smoked weed in my dorm. We drank, that was it. Public Safety created the narrative that someone who lived in my dorm was a drug dealer and the people who robbed us knew it and wanted the weed/money. The city police ended up catching one of the guys who later admitted he only robbed our dorm because the door was unlocked. (We put in a work order about a broken doorknob earlier in the school year and it was never taken care of.)The school sent maintenance over that night to fix the lock but they couldn\u2019t fix it.

They were brushing it off thinking she drank too much but she was having a bad reaction to new medication she was given after having oral surgery. \n\nAlso, even if she did drink too much or take recreational drugs she was still in need of help and could have died due to their lack of seriousness.",

            "I work in a public safety department, and respectfully, this is completely not true. It's a federal law that we report every crime that's reported to every staff member, even if the person reporting it doesn't want to report it to the police. It's called the Clery Act. All school employees that have any regular interactions with students have to be trained every year in this. The only time they don't have to report it to police is if the student specifically doesn't want to, but we still have to report that a crime happened. \n\nEvery state employee that works with students is a mandated reporter as well. There are so many laws and things in place because schools are literally wracking their brains trying to figure out how to get more people to report. The reason they want you to report it to us isn't because they want to cover it up, it's because most of the time when a crime happens, no one reports it at all and we are trying to get people to report it more. That's literally our whole entire goa because we have less crime when you report things more.   \n\n\nThat's why  the logic doesn't make any sense.. You can absolutely always report a crime to police first and you ***never*** have to tell us, it's literally no difference to us if you want to or not. Some colleges and universities have their own police departments on campus, so if you decide to report it to the city police they'll only refer it back to the campus police department anyway.   \n\n\nBut we don't get paid more or less based on the number of crimes on campus. In fact, I'd probably have more incentive to have more crimes reported because it would make our board of directors allocate us a bigger budget. We literally have no financial or social incentive to \"cover up crime\". We're state agencies, not private businesses. We don't get paid based on effectiveness.. And students are attracted to schools based on how good they are, almost no one looks at the ASR. I know, I manage ours. I have literally never had anyone request it for the past 8 years.   \n\n\nI get the whole, \"adults don't give a shit about us\" mentality. But believe it or not your smaller college or university has more invested in you, a lot more time for you, and a lot more resources to offer you if you've had something traumatic happen to you, than your local PD.",

            "Same for kittens. The more used they are to being handled as kittens the more they will tolerate it as adults. I have a set of sibling cats that showed up at my house at 5 weeks old and were petted, picked up, and snuggled constantly for the day we found them. Now 7 years later they love being picked up and handled. They don't mind their paws being touched or their bellies rubbed. Another cat we have was gotten from a shelter when she was 8 months old and she will not let anyone touch her unless she's in the mood for it. She's friendly but she doesn't want to be touched.\n\nSome probably just won't ever take to being handled as well as others but if they'll at least tolerate it it will make things like nail trimming, teeth brushing, and medicine-giving easier than a pet that will activity fight to get away from it.",

She lets me extend her toes to trim her claws, although only a few at a time before she starts gently pulling her feet away - but I've only just started to trin her claws and she's 8 already, so I'm sure we can work on it.",

            "Expanded tip to: touch and mess with your puppy all the time.\n\nEating a meal/treat especially- pet them and work up to bothering them, you don\u2019t want a dog that\u2019s overly protective of food. This can lead to food aggression with other dogs and potentially kids. It also helps establish that you\u2019re in charge and that food, rewards and all good things come from you.",
            "Also - when they are puppies and are eating \n\n* Occasionally put your hands near their food and pet them and tell them  \"good boy/girl\".\n* Occasionally lift up their dish. Tell them \"good boy/girl\" and put it back down\n* Call their name and give them a small treat while eating. They will know they can leave their dish and no one will take their food.  \n\nTheir chance of food aggression will be MUCH lower. This is especially good if you have small children.  \n\nMy dad did this with both of our puppies and I did it with my own and they were all very good natured about feeding time. \n\n**Warning:** If you adopt a dog or an older puppy.... DO NOT do this. You need to be cautious !!!",

            "I used to renovate hotel rooms for a living and would live at a hotel for 4 to 6 months usually. Hotels, even 5 Star resorts, put low wattage bulbs in their rooms too lower their electrical bills. I spent my nights usually in my room alone reading or teaching myself to play guitar. Most jobs I and maybe one assistant lived at the hotel and everyone else lived in rented apartments we supplied. I was virtually the only guy who did not party every single night and either have a local girlfriend or frequent prostitutes. I was just there to support my family. The dim lighting depresses me. Even at the Phoenician in Scottsdale where a regular room at $500 a night had 12 lightbulbs the rooms were dimly lit by my eye. So as soon as I checked in the parts of 3years I lived there I immediately put 12 100 watt bulbs in. The first time they changed them the next day, but after I explained that because I worked 24/7 for 6 months straight each time I was there and that of all the people on the job I was the one they least wanted depressed they never did it again and one time when I was moving to a new room because mind was going to be renovated the engineers moved the bulbs for me unfrequented. Nothin\u2019 to do with pillows. But if I were a traveling for work guy now, even just a day at new hotels each night I would find a way to pack a few high wattage bulbs in my luggage.",

Bedsheets, how often are they truly replaced after every guest leaves? The comforters/blankets, they're never changed just fluffed inbetween rotating guests unless it's visibly stained or damaged.",

Why are there no regular lights in the middle of the room you can control with a light switch? Why are the blankets super thin and tucked incredibly tightly under the mattress? Why doesn't the TV have a regular remote with a regular menu? It's just bizarre to me.",

That's the difference between an hourly and a salaried employee's mentality. \n\nStarting out in investment banking for example, analysts work 100 hour weeks, but they have very good salaries. It would be unheard of to ask for overtime and they'd probably never last beyond another few months (if that). As analysts become more senior, their salaries increase significantly and their hours decrease.

Sundays and holidays were also call time and they were calling us until we answered, no matter what, to secure a contract for monday. We had to arrange our week in advance (so meetings the same day were out of the question) also weren't allowed to take the day if we weren't called by 10:00am (with calling supposedly starting at 6:30am) we had to be always available. We were still paid work hours, so whatever happened outside work was still unpaid and our responsibility. If we arrived late at location (likely when client had several locations and was calling to or from the wrong place), that time was unpaid or we had to \"make up for it\" at the end of the day.

It's not that I think badly of people or my life but that I just always have negativity come out, I think nice thoughts but mostly speak when there's an annoyance or something \"wrong.\"\n\nSo how do I stop? It's like breathing, my brain just picks up on and spreads negativity without me thinking.

But it also makes it way easier to open up negative topics (like making a joke about the state of our town/country leading to an actual very depressing conversation about the literal state of our town/country). But lately I've noticed that I don't really STOP there. I have a lot of baggage I'm working on with my therapist which has helped a little, but I still feel like every conversation I bring to the table is either something negative or about my toddler. And even when I try to make a conscious effort not to bring up a negative subject and instead try to let the other person lead the conversation and bounce off whatever they bring up my brain still jumps to negative subjects because that's just where my brain first connects. I don't like being so negative. I WANT to be a positive person! I just don't know how to bust that immediate habit of negativity being the \"go to\" even when I'm consciously trying NOT to. So far I've only been able to bit my tongue and work on small chit chat that leads to little conversation; I'd love to just talk like it's a regular day than have conversation pitter out because I couldn't think of any connection that wasn't negative!\n\nI thankfully don't directly shoot people down or anything, but if they bring up their family my brain jumps to my toxic family- negative connection. If they talk about how their kid is struggling in school my brain jumps to piling on the negativity by talking about how horribly the school system is managed and how awfully teachers and students alike are treated.

I've seen this with my sister, who travelled across the country to visit me, and instead of having a friendly loving visit,  I find her sitting on the couch and just thinking about political issues that she was just outraged about, literally sitting there thinking to herself and shaking her fists in anger.   wtf.

It's emotionally abusive and manipulative. \n\nBeing an asshole isn't a personality to be proud of, it's a general lack of creativity.",

I've worked at our company for a few years, there were issues that I pointed out early on, gathered data, compiled and presented it. Nothing was changed. Multiple stakeholders, including the customers, still suffer because of this. It makes my job more stressful. So whenever I hear management or senior management puking rainbows about how great everything is, I can't help but to balance the mood out by pointing out the negatives that have yet to be addressed after years of feedback.",

It's cool to sneer at something and call it \"basic\" or mindlessly share memes to quietly mock things to show how cool or above it all the poster is. I must admit I fell into this  a few times myself, until I read this blogger who caught herself sneering at a woman who was skipping across the street.  She realized there was nothing wrong with someone just enjoying herself even if it might seem odd to others, but what bothered her was her automatic response to judge her. And there is a point here. It's fun to call people \"Karens\" and feel self satisfied that we are better than the people we put into boxes, but it is really toxic to ourselves more than the targets. Life is hard for all of us, and if people find joy in harmless activities who are we to judge them ?",

            "Had a party house for 3 years with friends. To be honest it was a blast. We had to drill a lock onto the downstairs fridge just so we could have food that people wouldn't eat though, but it worked. The only other problem was occasionally you'd get people that just didn't leave, like it's Tuesday and you've been here 4 days, you need to go home.\n\nHad a rave cave under the house, decked out with DJ decks, 5kw of amps and speakers, smoke machines, lasers, UV lights and more. I sorta miss it.",

            "I'll never forget the time my roommate and I decided to take a night off from parties at our house and walked down the street to a party in our neighborhood. We left one of our friends at our house (they did not live there) On our way back we ran into a group of our friends walking to the party we were leaving. One of them was eating a bag of popcorn and my roommate asked them where they got it from. They said it was from our house! When we made it back there was a full blown party at our house and no one that lives there was present.",
            "My ex owned a lake house and it's the same thing.  A never-ending parade of friends who wanted to swim, barbecue, fish, drink his beer, eat his food, track sand through the house, dirty all the towels, then leave before anything was cleaned up.  We could only enjoy it alone when it rained torrentially.  Then when he sold it everyone was like, \"why?!!\"",
            "Ahh the joy of scraping drunk women off the floor of the kitchen and trying to find someone who knows where they live.\n\nOr the time drunk girl went to bed in my bed and I just let her sleep there because I didn\u2019t know how to haul her out without making it look like I was assaulting her. And then she pissed the bed. \n\n\nAll this and more can be yours.",
            "I lived at the party house. There are pros and cons. \n\nPros, everything comes to you. Food, booze, drugs, new friends, new love interests. All of it just shows up at your door, you don\u2019t have to seek it out. Also, you don\u2019t have to go home after the party. You can stay out drinking as late as you want and then just go to bed. if you enjoy partying, the convenience factor is there. \n\nCons, your house will always be loud, full of strangers, and fucking disgusting. Your neighbors will hate you. You will be too embarrassed to invite your parents inside. You will never EVER bring a date that you actually want to impress back to your house. You will have to spend your every Sunday cleaning while painfully hungover unless you want to live in an actual rat\u2019s nest.\n\nAll in all, I had a ton of fun, and don\u2019t regret it at all. But it\u2019s definitely something you grow out of quickly.",

            "This is so true, we were the party house and it fucking sucked.  You wake up 3-4x a week to an absolute disaster. Empties everywhere, spills on all your floors and furniture. \n\nThat stuff sucked but the worst part is we started the year as 4 great friends and by the end of the year we were fighting all the time, it was like being in a relationship but with 3 other people opposed to 1.  That is the case regardless of being the party house but it just adds something to fight over.\n\nThere was one benefit, I don't believe we bought booze once after the first weekend.  If you left your shit it was ours you weren't coming back to claim it next day, actually nobody ever really tried and we had enough empties to get a case every week or two.",

            "My friends and I had the party house of campus. We were 8 guys. Sunday morning we would clean the shit out of the house. It was annoying and disgusting but then we would have a nice clean all week until Friday. \n\nBut after 5 straight weekends of partying Friday and Saturday with freshmen and non-bar college kids stopping by, we took a weekend off. \n\nFriday night, we are chilling at home playing video games and hanging out. The door bell rings and we all look at each other confused? \n\n\"Is anyone expecting somebody???\" Everyone shakes their head. \n\nI open the door and there are a gaggle of college girls and guys ready to party. \n\n\"Umm...can I help you?\"\n\n\"Uhh...well I guess not. We have been to your parties every weekend because of a friend of a friend and we have just been stopping by for free drinks and good party.\"\n\n\"Oh well that's cool...but no party this weekend...glad you been having fun though lol\" \n\n\"Hahaha sorry guys have a good one.\"\n\nI close the door and we all laughed. \n\nWe go to a big state school so there are at least 100 house/apartment parties every Friday or Saturday. We are a group of random guys no sport house or anything cool. We realized we maybe hosting wayyy to many parties but it was a memory none of us will ever forget.",
            "My grades took a slight hit that year but I don't regret it one bit. Lived in a party house for a year and constantly had people over hanging out and easy access to having \"guests\" stay over after parties so it's definitely a net benefit even considering the constant mess and clutter (ymmv).\n\nI'd always play Despacito to get people out of my room by the end of the night but that would drive in the latinas. \n\nSo I'd play heavy metal to drive them out and that would instead drive in 2-3 metalheads I lived with. \n\nSo I finally had to settle with Mongolian throat singing or drone music to get everyone the hell out so I could sleep.\n\nThankfully did not live with any 13th century mongolians.",
            "Same goes for vacation destinations that are fun to visit but you wouldn\u2019t want to live there.\n\nAnd also, some people are fun but you wouldn\u2019t want to marry them.\n\nEdit: spelling",
            "Reminds of the time just before a maaaaaaajor party,  the toilets failed in the party house so they got some chemical toilet replacements.  \n\nDuring the tidy up operations a few days later the one on the top floor got dropped and emptied all down the stairs.\n\nWhich was nice...",
            "We rented a house, we had the first floor. One summer the second floor was sublet to some partiers...we basically didn't sleep on the weekends. I wasn't a fan.",
            "I never went to college but I always wished I lived at those party houses whenever I attended the bangers there. Seemed as though every day was a great time. Never had to go home at the end. Just kept the party going, except you could retire to your own space to recharge and/or do the drugs required to recharge before the next wave. Now the thought of being trapped there among that perpetual noise, destruction and disrespect makes me want to panic a little bit.",
            "I will say though, living in the party house really is a once in a lifetime experience. Wouldn't recommend it long term, or for everyone, but I got to experience some pretty wild stuff at the \"party house\" I lived in for a few months. Albeit it was an \"older\" party house, at 24ish I was just about the youngest person living there full time, so the folks there had way more connections like some frat boys. There was also a homeless person living out behind the walled fence of that trap mansion, who would sneak in and steal food and clothes, but was sneaky enough about it that we were all at each other's throats for stealing each other's food for like 3 months lmao",
            "I lived in the party house was disgusting but I kept my room immaculate and all the ladies wanted to hangout in there.",
            "As somebody that had the party house here is a Pro tip.\n\nSet the rule - If you crash (stay over) after the party, you help clean up the next day. The good and grateful people will stay and help, the others will leave when it winds down.\n\nI found over time we developed a really solid group who'd always help clean up.",
            "Goes for some things with being an adult too. \n\nYou don't want a boat, you want a friend with a boat.  \nYou don't want a pool, you want a friend with a pool.",
            "Not really, guess the party house we had wasn't like a wild frat house with parties every night and we had rather polite friends that would help clean up after big parties, but we definitely had an open door policy and would have friends in and out daily, we had enough good places for parties in the same neighborhood we'd shuffle houses around every weekend for house shows so as to not become a target for cops like some of our other friends' places and it worked out nicely...",
            "When I was 18 I went to a house party where the parents were away on holiday for 5 days.\n\nNight 1, party 1: Thing get out of hand, garden ruined, study floor covered from corner to corner in dry cat food, multiple expensive spirits stolen, dads range rover taken for a joy ride by some party attendants. \n\nDay 2: Host says it cant get any worse than this, decides to host a round 2\n\nParty 2: Flat screen tv in the upstairs bath, multiple bedframes broken, someone split a full grinder of weed in the parents bedroom (carpet), glasses broken, garden fence destroyed, someone stole 10+ phones from multiple party guests, street fight and neighbours call the police.\n\nDay 3: Host says it definitely cant get any worse now, decides to host a round 3.\n\n3rd and final party: Skirting board ripped off the wall in the kitchen and living room, more alcohol stolen, TVs broken, furniture stained/destroyed/ruined, study and parents room hotboxed and front and back garden literally a mud pit and police are called and shut down the party after 4 hours.\n\nNeedless to say the parents weren't too thrilled and it put me off hosting any parties at mine.",
            "It\u2019s more difficult to live in the party house but it\u2019s also more lucrative. I recall paying more than one month of rent with the proceeds from selling cups at the door for a kegger. Didn\u2019t hurt that the roommates were all women.",
            "And don\u2019t date the dude who lives in the party house.",
            "Can concur. A bunch of my best friends ended up getting a 5 bedroom house together and my roommate and I got an apartment up the road. Holy hell their entire house was disgusting at all times. Kitchen: utterly destroyed. Pots and pans dirty in the sink piled 6 or 8 high, old food always left out somewhere. \n\nTheir living room was trashed constantly, they all had to lock their bedroom doors so that people wouldn't steal shit from their rooms or have sex in their beds. I was just glad I finally got invited to a party and got to go home to my neat-ish apartment every night.",
            "Eh no. Sure there\u2019s cleaning, but having a bed is very useful.",
            "This post is 100% true.\n\nI lived in an apartment building across the street from my frat house. It was so nice to just not have to deal with any of the issues living at the actual house and just go across the street into my clean apartment after a party.",
            "Phew. If there's a single bit of advice about college I can relate to and agree with harder, I can't think of it. \n\nI had friends who had The Big Party House at a party school in Michigan, then I had my own for a few years. It is a ***living nightmare*** to actually be responsible for one, to the extent that medoicre tail and booze do not make up for it. Even to a 22-year-old.\n\nAlso don't party on Sundays, make it to class. An extra crazy story is not worth your career. Nearly cost me mine.",
            "I can attest to this. Fixing broken windows and cleaning up blood and vomit the next morning gets old after a few times.",
            "100% the party house owners definitely had to do a lot of cleaning up from other people throughout the years. They also get to deal with all obnoxious people. \n\nApparently once they found a random junkie with his dick out furiously masturbating in their kitchen whilst one was getting ready for work. When addressed, the guy would just ignore the friend. I dont think I could have dealt with that kind of shit for even a month.",
            "Yeah nothings better than waking up to 3 hours of cleaning, renting a carpet cleaner, making sure there wasnt drugs left around the house, going to buy a couple more 24 packs and doing all again the next day. I mean its like the bastards would get to 1/4 of their beer and just dump it on the kitchen floor. Good times.",
            "While I agree with this generally, there are some cool perks to living in the house that has a good social reputation. Chicks dig guys that have influence in society. When a college campus is your little society, it can be rewarding to be seen as the man sometimes. But agree with OP generally, the mess can get unruly",
            "Completely disagree. We would have one party a month and make enough money for that months rent. If you take precautions, it\u2019s great. Anything that could get stolen was locked away*. Block off staircases so no one can go where you don\u2019t want them. Have your friends know to keep an eye out for trouble and let you know.  Don\u2019t get wasted at your own party because you are WORKING. Before crashing we would clean up any major spills and leave the rest for the AM after a nice big breakfast together. Those were far and away the most fun weekends of college, and we got paid to do it. Highly recommend. \n\nCaveat: we only did one a month. Maybe two. If by \u201cparty house\u201d you mean every weekend, that\u2019s a different beast. \n\n*side story: once we didn\u2019t think to duct tape the basement freezer and caught someone with frozen bagels in his pants. My roommate took them back and then slapped the guy with the bag, not thinking it would really hurt. Turns out frozen bagels feels like a bag of rocks. That was our only fight cuz the bagel bandit was NOT happy about that hit.",
            "So true. In my little college town, my friends had a loft in downtown where all the bars were. Everyone would preparty and hit the bars then go back to their loft. What a shit show.",
            "I lived in a shithole of a house my senior year which was known for the landlord not giving a shit so you could throw whatever parties you wanted. Our basement door had a padlock on it so that whenever the last person actually living in the house went to pass out, we could lock everyone downstairs (there was a separate basement exit) and let them filter out as they pleased.",
            "100%. I can't tell you the number of parties that ended with a couch on the roof. I always went back the next morning to help clean up, but I'm sure those party house guys lost their security deposit.",
            "Ugh. Had the party house in college and now somehow 10 years our house suddenly became one again.\n\nIt\u2019s great in that you don\u2019t have to leave, you are comfortable everywhere, you can do whatever you want, sleep, etc\n\nCons - Cleaning and nights going longer than you want.",
            "Excellent Tip! Ditto for:\n\nKids (better to be an uncle/aunt)\n\nPets (my neighbor has a friendly cat who hangs out on my porch, but I don't have to scoop the litter)\n\nVacation homes (unless you live at your vacation home year-round)",
            "Not just college. As an adult it's much better to be friends with the guy who lives in the city centre than be the guy who lives in the city centre. My friends come in from suburbs and different towns for a night out. I live 2 minutes away from all the best bars in the city and it's easier for them just to stay the night. The bars shut and then the party moves to my house.\nI'm nearly 40 and I still live in the party house.",
            "This is not as easy to control but it is helpful to think about",
            "I\u2019m not sure about this one.  I lived in a party house in college.  We didn\u2019t give a shit.  We would throw massively popular parties with a couple kegs, a DJ.  We would charge $1 at the door and pay our rent for the month.  The next day would be the one time that the place actually got cleaned.  This was the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to my kids, though.",

            "I always liked being the house where pre drinks took place. It allowed you to be in normal clothes drinking right up until the taxi was on the way.",
            "Can confirm. Had the party house with 3 roommates. Only one of them and myself did the cleaning. Surprisingly never really any damage to anything. \n\nWorst bit was puke on my ROOMMATES dishes that he left in the sink that he wouldn't fucking clean. I tried telling him to do it and it never happened. So after a week of smelling that nasty shit sitting there i went in... Fuck roommates.",
            "Oh man. I looooved my house being the party house. I took that shit very seriously. I pulled together a bunch of second hand garbage, a bass guitar speaker cabinet and crappy store brand home theater system into a friggin killer sound system. I had one system inside in the main room and another outside on the deck. They were synced by using shoutcast or something on a lan (this was before Bluetooth) and playing from separate laptops.\n\nStore brand sound system survived being in a metal desk outside for like two years. It now plays music in my garage. Although I did replace a couple of the mosfets over the years. Who would have thought.\n\nAnyway, always made sure we had enough booze, mixers, cups and ice. We had a house drink called the smurf.\n\nMade sure to black out the windows. \n\nSpent time putting together a good mix.\n\nYou can drink as much as you want, you don't have to drive anywhere, you can escape to your own room for lots of different reasons. \n\nCan't imagine it another way.",

            "Depends.. you'll always be at the mercy of other people inviting you. If you host, you get to choose everything from music to drinks games and guests.\n\nAlso it's nice if people take turns on hosting and if you have the kind of friends that help clean up before they leave or the next day, that's priceless.. so you can sort the selfish people out easily.",
            "tbh thats true after too. having to clean up or stay sober to watch your shit is a great idea.",
            "I remember back in college going over to the \u201cparty house\u201d during the day. Walking in the floor was absolutely disgusting, bottles everywhere, trash, cigarette butts lying on the floor, on and on. In the midst of a party you don\u2019t notice, I remember realizing this house looks like this all the time. The people who lived there didn\u2019t care. I can\u2019t imagine when they moved out how expensive it was to get it back to somewhat decent. That poor landlord. In a college town I guess that\u2019s a chance you take.

She did have a part-time job and I convinced her to join the local gym ($15 per month) where she can not only work out but shower, use wifi, use a clean bathroom, and study while on the bikes. I also hooked her up with the college pantry as well as other pantries in the area. She graduated top of her class and to this day I still get letters of the utmost appreciation from her. Luckily her homelessness only lasted 3 months.\n\nEDIT- Thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for all the wonderful comments and awards. I also need to add that I didn't want to overstep my boundaries with the student-professor relationship so I bought the student a cart full of groceries, all non perishable, and toiletries. I had a friend of mine deliver it to her at the college. It was such a wonderful feeling to just help her get started.",

He knew he would have his own apartment soon. However, when I suggested that he join a 24-hour gym, he said it transformed his life. \n\nWorking out helped him get out of his depression, but...having a hot shower was an instant life improvement.

            "This probably doesn't make as much sense in a lot of the parts of the United states or other countries. But in Southern California not only does this make sense, but its a commonly used tactic. Homelessness is different in the LA area. There are varying degrees of homeless. We have a significant number of homeless people that live out of their cars or move around occasionally staying in motels or on different people's couches when they can. Realistically all it takes is a building increasing rent, family kicking you out, a disagreement with a roommate, breaking up with a significant other that was covering rent, being laid off from work, or suddenly being fired from a job to put most people on the streets. The cost of living out here is just so crazy high compared to standard wages, its nearly impossible to immediately bounce back from something like that on your own. People without family support just end up drifting around. Also in LA gyms are literally everywhere and very cheap.\n\nA 24 hour gym offers amenities like toilets, showers, safe overnight parking, air conditioning, electricity to charge your phone, television, etc... Sometimes as low as like op said, only $15 a month. Planet fitness even gives out free food to customers occasionally. Many people down on their luck do take advantage of this trick.",
            "Former homeless here. I wish i would've thought of this its an amazing idea. I used to go away for work for a month then be off for 1. Could never afford the \u00a31000 1st month and deposit for a place if i wanted to eat at all.",

            "People are getting upset in the comments, but this is actually a good tip. For around 30-50 cents a day you can get a good shower, use a clean bathroom, and exercise. Especially with how early gyms open, you could spend most of your day in there just to get into some AC.",

            "Gonna go out on a limb here. \n\nAs someone who has previously been homeless, the kind where people fight over claims on benches with a roof or anywhere you can take shelter from precipitation...this is semi-decent advice. \n\nBefore spending money you might need for something else, look for a YMCA. Trial memberships are free if you enroll online and give you all the benefits of a member (pool, shower, lounge, weight room, etc.)\n\n$15 doesn't necessarily seem like a lot, When you're homeless, even for a few days (even just crashing on a friend's couch or sleeping in your car,) every penny matters. There are resources out there that can help, show you to them and help not make it a chronic or systemic homelessness problem.\n\nEdit: There are lots of ways to ethically cut costs to help build yourself back up.

            "This is barely applicable right now during Covid. I live in the northeastern USA. All gym showers are closed/taped off and you're not allowed to use them.  \n  \nI was living in a minivan for several months recently(rock climbing trip) and the only places we found open showers were at a climbing gym in Boise, ID(included with day pass); campground in WY($2 for unlimited warm water--score!); and we bought $5 showers once at a general store outside City of Rocks. We had to \"sneak into\" campground showers in WA state. Everything else was closed and the shower was campers-only, in a totally sold-out campground...we still paid money for them, so ethically, I'm ok with it.  \n  \nIt was really inconvenient to find a shower on the road. It's a lot easier to find a body of water at a tolerable temperature, and dunk yourself. Sometimes I did the baby-wipe thing. As a lady growing out my hair, if it gets greasy and I can't get a shower, I tie it up and wear a bulky headband, and you can hardly tell.

Long story short, I get pulled over booked in jail (cops were overly aggressive that\u2019s a whole other story) I get out, lose my job, that in turn causes me to lose the place I\u2019m living, then it\u2019s back to square one.

People always assume when they see someone homeless, or downtrodden, that it\u2019s all their fault and it must be drug related or mental illness. Sometimes it is, but other times it\u2019s just plain old bad luck, I got nobody to call to come save me lol.",

            "This is really intelligent advice. What a wonderful thing to say that may have helped someone today!!!",
            "problem is that a lot of gyms that were open 24 hours have limited hours now and you have to get an appointment. Many had their showers closed for months too and just now reopened.",
            "The showers are still closed because of Covid where I'm at, but usually a pretty good tip.",
            "Did this entire sub forget that covid is still a thing and most gyms are closed due to them being fucking petri dishes???"
