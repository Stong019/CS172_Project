I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it\u2019s not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you\u2019re in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren\u2019t so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.\n\nBut yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I\u2019ve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation.

We are not connected to the police in anyway.\n\n I\u2019ve probably administered approximately ~2000 anesthetics at this point in my career. \n\nBy and large Patients blend together so much after the actual day of the procedure/ surgery that i couldn\u2019t even tell you what i did last week.

The dosing given to you is always going to be titrated to effect so would automatically compensate even if there is a small difference.\n\nIn summary, anaesthetists want to know about everything you take (herbal remedies included) and definitely don\u2019t care about the legal implications of any of it, but cannabis doesn\u2019t cause all that many problems.",

            "Blood flow comes afterward to replenish the supply of nutrients for the cells. While blood flow does correlate with neural activitity, its important to note that increased blood flow to brain regions is not a direct measure of neural activity. This is why fMRI, which measures blood flow, isn't very good at telling you when brain activity is occurring. There is a delay between brain activity and blood flow. \n\nWe wouldn't want the impressionable minds out there thinking that the brain works by directing blood to different areas. The brain works by way of a complex communication system where cells (neurons) talk to each other using chemical messages. Due to its sophistication, this system requires a lot of resources for both power and general maintenance to keep it running. This is why when you see a spike of neural activity, blood usually follows shortly thereafter to drop off more supplies. Specialized cells called astrocytes absorb the nutrients and then dole them out to neurons as necessary.\n\nSo yes, more blood flow does usually mean more activity. But it would be more accurate to state that \"Engaging more logical portions of the brain helps to reduce emotional experience, which can help you to maintain composure.\" Blood flow to these regions would follow as a consequence of activating the \"logical\" parts. Cerebral bood flow, per se, is not the direct cause of brain activity.\n",

Also important to look for areas where you can see as much of the sky and possible, stargazing in the forest is still incredible, but especially if your goal is meteors get out to the flattest most treeless area you can, that atv spot is on the edge of some salt flats and laying down almost your whole field of view is sky.\n\nAlso look into going to a registered [International Dark Sky Park](https://www.darksky.org/our-work/conservation/idsp/parks/) they are areas that have protections put in about stuff like exterior lighting on buildings to keep them dark and good for stars.

I learned this after I got my first write up some years back as a 911 operator because I muted the mic to argue with another dispatcher about the necessity of sending police to a call.\n\nOur agency doesn't respond to medical calls where there are trained doctors or nurses on staff. As a rule, we transfer those calls to the ambulance service, remain on the phone until EMS clears us and hang up. This call was for a nursing home for patients suffering severe burns, a patient had gone into cardiac arrest and needed an ambulance. The nurses who called it in were laughing their asses off and sounded to me like they were high or intoxicated in some way. They assured the ems dispatcher they were performing cpr, but having heard and performed CPR myself, it didn't sound like it to me.\n\nSo I sent the call to the radio dispatcher, who promptly argued with me that policy wasn't to send on medical calls. I muted the headset and told him \"they're laughing over this guy as he's dying and it sounds like they aren't giving the CPR they said they are, they are some shady motherfuckers, send an officer.\"\n\nDidn't think anything of it for months until I got called back into my supervisor's office, who played a court transcript recording for me. Apparently the family had sued for wrongful death and the 911 calls were subpoenaed. The EMS dispatcher didn't hear me. The staff at the home didn't hear me. An entire courtroom however, heard me call the nursing home staff \"shady motherfuckers.\"\n\nThe defense was unhappy to say the least.

I had my headphones, I had the appointment link ready to go, the webcam was set up, mic working, I was in my office with the door close and my kids were actually obeying my request to keep it down. I had everything set up...so I thought. \n\nSo, I sit down about 10 minutes before the interview and reviewed my answers and questions for the end of the interview. The time came and I joined the meeting. Wouldn't you know, the audio wasn't coming through the headphones. Of course, I did some troubleshooting for a bit and just couldn't get them to work. The two people interviewing my were being most patient and cordial...from what I could see, but, I will admit, it was already looking very unprofessional. \n\nI couldn't the headphones to work, so I get up out of my chair, jet out my door and run to the living room to get my other set of headphones from my daughter. Well, she did something with them and didn't remember what she did them (mind you, this couldn't have been more than 20-25 mins ago). So, I am getting frustrated and I am talking a bit loudly, something about, \"I just gave you this headphones, where can they be? I have an important interview...\" blah blah blah. \n\nI finally get the headphones and, as I sit back down, I realize that I also did the most clich\u00e9 thing in the world by only wearing the top part of my suit. I know I got immediately red, but I try to play it off. I apologize for the delay and after I get finished talking, one of the interviewers said, \"Just to let you know, we could hear everything that was going on in the background and to try to remember to mute your mic...for future reference.\"\n\nI was so embarrassed. I said, \"Well, I guess this concludes the Zoom portion of the interview.\" Of course, they said it was fine and okay and that we could proceed if I wanted to. I did, but, needless to say, I bombed the interview and didn't get a call back. Oh well...\n\nI still don't know if they saw me in half a suit and half in boxers. They never brought it up.

My biggest fear is exactly what you have written, that my friends and family will leave me and I'll have to deal with everything on my own.

In the end, anyone who victimizes him/herself to get away with their obnoxious behaviour will come up with some sort of excuse or reason why people should give them a pass. Has nothing to do with mental disorders or illness. It's just a toxic/hypocrit personality. \n\nThe golden rule I always try to apply to certain people is to consider if they make an effort to solve their own shit. For example; the woman in your post really does need well microwaved food, true. But leaving you with the stench is a choice. If she, for example, brought said vinegar to clear out her self-made stench or looked for the least busy place to microwave, then she would have at least taken some responsibility. In your example however, she chooses to 'just be a victim' (\"I have cancer so the rest of the world just has to deal with my shit\"). So in this case, like you said, you should absolutely save yourself the headache. \n\nSo far, maintaining this \"taking responsibility versus being a victim\" perspective towards social relationships, I was able to weed out the toxic people quite easily and never had any regrets or doubts about making the right choice or not. It's also a well known paradigm in social psychology (guess that's for a reason).",

Then I get to hear \"Oh, you're just using your depression as an excuse.\" The amount of times I've heard that is not even funny. \"You could get better if you want to, you just don't want to get better.\" That's bullshit, nobody **chooses** to suffer from mental illness, and the truth is if you've never had one you really don't know what it feels like. So there are two sides to the coin. If you don't have a certain amount of patience or empathy, please don't be friends with people who have mental illnesses, because you'll end up doing more harm than good.",

            "ED MD here, and unfortunately, some of the most \"helpful\" people in the lives of certain patients with mental health issues are also the most infantilizing and perpetuate the illness/victim role though positive feedback. It is sometimes amazing to see how these patients can change when suddenly no-one is helping to normalize or compensate for their behaviour. Or in some cases see their illness nearly disappear as occasionally seen in borderline parent/child relationships. Or, the BPD couple where one returns to \"normal\" after separation. Unfortunately, the extreme \"helpers\" in some cases  have personality disorders or mental health issues themselves. This can be very hard to address with extreme reactions to being told that the patient must have some autonomy or that they might also have an illness.\n\nSome patients certainly need a LOT of support and would falter without their support systems, but there are those who just need an opportunity to figure themselves out on their own and deal with consequences of their actions in a safe environment where they can learn.\n\nThis does not apply to some mental health disorders or personality disorders where frankly there is a danger to the patient themselves and to others. Even in significant disease however,  restoring some autonomy and personal responsibility can help; watching the 50 year old patient who has lived with their parents their whole life and been through our ED every week suddenly live alone or in a group home and actually improve and grow is always surprising and positive.

            "There is no one way of dealing with people with mental illness. Instead of listening to strangers on the internet who have no idea what your situation is, seek advice in a specialised place. If your loved one has BPD, go to a BPD sub to ask for advice, not LPT. And don't wait until you're thinking of leaving. Do it as soon as you find out about their diagnosis. If you wait until the final straw to ask for advice, you're just as responsible to the relationship going to shit. If you loved one was diagnosed with cancer, you'd be online trading about it right away, so why would you wait in the case of mental illness, some of which are lifelong illness that can't be cured, just managed. It's also not fair to say \"you don't take meds anymore bye\". Psychiatric medication has horrific side effects sometimes, mine literally almost killed me. Sometimes people are taken off their medication by their doctors so they can find something else that works better, because the same meds don't work the same on everyone (so don't say shit like \"but this helped me it should help you\", and this extends to stuff like meditation or other forms of therapy). You should be aware of what your loved ones are taking because they and their doctor will depend on you for feedback on how it works, because often times people with mental illness take months to realise they changed while on medication. This is also important in case they're in an accident and doctors ask you what your loved one is taking, and needless to say, this isn't limited to mental illness. \n\nIf you wait until you're ready to abandon a person to actually figure out how to coexist with them, you can't be out here playing the only victim. Seek advice from others in the same situation, seek advice from their doctors, seek advice from other people with the same illness. You'd do the same for cancer.",

I got lucky in a perfect storm of a period where NOBODY that I usually \u201cturned to\u201d was willing (AKA had the energy anymore) to listen to me or spend their precious time trying to make me feel better, and in that time of \u201cI have nobody, I am all alone\u201d I realized that I do, in fact, have MYSELF, and that it was okay\u2014and WISE\u2014to learn to depend on ME for what I need.

Not only that, but my friends and family no longer need so much time and space away from me; they are always free when I ASK them, \u201cDo you have a moment for me to vent,\u201d or, \u201cCould I get your advice on something?\u201d and they are always more than happy to hear me out and offer words of wisdom and support. I also am able to do this for them. Life is just sweeter when you learn to turn to yourself first and foremost; nobody can know you like you.\n\nLong story long, yes, self reliance and independence with ones problems\u2014emotional, mental, and physical (excluding handicaps in which you literally cannot do something alone)\u2014are not only important, they are freeing and bring so much joy. It sounds scary to go it alone, but sometimes it is truly the best thing that could ever happen to you.\n\nSo while it\u2019s a delicate situation that should definitely be handled with care, it is likely the best thing you could do for your loved one to take a step back and encourage them to find their own way for a while.",

Think of the difference in meaning in *on the floor*, *on the door*, *on a skewer*, *on Monday*, *on your own*, *on time*, *on my mind*, etc.\n\nThese are hard enough to grasp when your first language (L1) uses prepositions similarly to English, but if your L1 has very different grammar, it's really not something you can pick up from day 1.\n\nMost high frequency words are common because they have this kind of diversity in meaning, so getting a basic, meankng-based grounding in the language is important.\n\nEdit: First silver, and gold!

            "I\u2019m not sure this is correct.\n\nYou may know foreign words, but you  will not know how to use them. It takes more than that : if it was so easy, everyone would be able to communicate in several languages, which is far from being the case !",
            "No.\n\nThe most common words are the grammatical ones. Doing this throws you into grammar analysis off the bat. Not a great start for picking up a language intuitively. I love learning about grammar, and it fucks up my learning a language because I try to analyze things too early before I have a general understanding of sentence structure.\n\nE.g. the 10 most common English words:\n\nthe\n\nbe\n\nto\n\nof\n\nand\n\na\n\nin\n\nthat\n\nhave\n\nI\n\nThese are the most difficult words to understand in isolation. Trying to explain the intricate workings of \"the\" to a non-native speaker is just asking for a frustrated learner. Nouns and verbs are much easier to start with, but you don't see the first noun until \"time\" at #55. Even if you do learn all of them, you'll look at a new sentence, and see \"The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ up the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ it to the \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" With all the nouns and verbs missing, you literally understand nothing.\n\nA much better approach is to start learning with simple sentences that you can break down into their components. This way you start to gain an intuitive grasp of the grammar, while seeing how things work out in context, and pick up some common words at the same time.",
            "A useless tip. Notice how the tip says \"*should* be a good basis\". That's because op has no idea what he's talking about and has probably never learned a new language. \n\n50% word recognition alone will get you *nowhere*. You will not understand anything! Even at 95% word recognition most texts will fly you by. There's a reason you need to learn thousands of words to become fluent. \n\nFurthermore, those 100 words will come naturally as you study the language. Since they are so common anyway, they'll be impossible to miss. There's no point in actively seeking them out. \n\nDon't rely on \"pro-tips\" for learning a new language. You wanna learn? Sit down with a textbook and start studying. Just like we did in school. I know, you took Spanish for 3 years but can only say hola! But that's because you didn't actually do the work. Expect to sink years into your studying to become good at the language. Expect to be prepared to embrace the culture. Expect an extremely slow and gradual progression. There's no magic trick. There's only hard work and perseverance. But everyday you learn something you didn't know the day before, and that's what drives you forward. And man does it pay off. It is exactly as rewarding as you might imagine. If not more.",

            "Speaking from many years in many roles in restaurants, that's not at all how it works. \n\nGood restaurants encourage you to actively enhance your guests' dining experience. Special evenings (birthday, anniversary, first night out after recently having kids) are an opportunity to recognize that the guests are spending their time and money with you, and you have to show appreciation: free bubbly, extra apps, extra desserts, etc. Good managers and restaurants know that the restaurant makes money at that time and for the future good will, AND the server makes more money. Everyone wins. \n\nThe most important aspect is that the items are put into the system and then removed from inventory and revenue. If not, then it just is counted as waste because it's not accounted for anywhere. \n\nGood restaurants give servers discretion, particularly when the server informs them of what's going on. Friends or family coming in? Let's show off the restaurant and how cool it is a place to work by hooking your crew up. \n\nIf that doesn't happen and the staff just hands out stuff for free when no one is looking, then that is simple theft. ",
            "TL;DR - restaurants give tour bus drivers, cops and firemen reduced price or free meals, and sometimes a few $$ reward for bringing in business. \n\n  The old USA custom was that a tour bus driver who brought in a bus-load of customers gets free food: lots of free food,  and maybe even an extra few sheckles in the driver's pocket.    I learned this the hard way as a 17 year old fast food worker: Bus driver comes in with a travel sports team and their parents, about 40+ customers. The bus driver is one of the last to order, and orders enough food for 2 people even though it was obvious he was by himself.  I say \"OK, that's $9.21 \" or whatever and he looks at me like I am a slow witted child, and calmly says \"I am the bus driver\".  I am like \"great ! that's $9.21\".    He pauses, and calmly and in a soft voice says \"please get your manager here\".  No anger or malice : in fact he was probably calmer than most customers.  Some background- this was an upscale fast-food place in a solid, wealthy mostly white suburban area. He was a good looking black man in his 40's.  Most of the customers and workers were white as well.  I had been there at least 6 months, and considered myself worldly, but this was puzzling.  So I just went back, poked my head into the managers office and said \"there is some problem: guy seems to not want to pay for his food.  He said he was the bus driver and wants to speak with you\". \n\nKen the manager (who was also African American) was on duty and he was actually the true general manager of the local district of 5 stores, and 2 days a week he sat in for the store manager in various stores in his district.  First time I met him we really hit it off, and I found him very urbain, savvy and an excellent judge of people .  At my summary of the situation,  Ken's eyes pop open, he jumps up and says  \"I will handle this order, keep waiting on the rest of the customers\".   I see him read the order, void it out and tell the bus driver \"We are making it extra fresh: I will bring it out to you\", and he tossed me a subtle wink.     \n\nWhen the food was ready, Ken brought the food out, and I saw him take a $20 from my drawer and palm it, have a chat with the driver, and slip him the 20, and they exchanged business cards, shook hands and Ken went back to work.  He came around the counter and discreetly pointed at me to come to his office and take a seat.  All the other workers thought I was in some sort of trouble, maybe getting fired.\n\nKen asked me \" Do you know about how we are supposed to deal with bus drivers? \".  I said \" No, but I watched you give him free food and some money in a way the passengers did not notice.  I gather that is reward / bonus to him for steering customers to our restaurant ?\"   \"Correct- he just brought at least $500 in sales, so a free meal and $20 is fair commission, don't you agree ?\"   I told him sure, sounds like a good way to attract business.  He says \"so you have been here since the store was built 6 months ago?\"  Again I agree that was true.  He said \"son, your one of the smarter kids around, so when your shift ends come into my office and I am going to teach you how this company treats bus drivers, police and fireman.  Then you are going to teach all the other employees that work the register, followed by the rest of the entire staff. Stuff like    Who gets free food, who gets extra commission , who gets discounts like policemen.  Cops never get 100% free food- they pay for one item like a drink, and the rest of the meal is free.  That way we can attract more cops, and the place gets a reputation of being cop friendly and less of a robbery target.  And the cop stays out of trouble because they have to pay something- its not completely free so they cannot be accused of taking bribes.   Same way with firemen although not quite as generous.  For the cop, they always have to pay something, usually the cheapest item like fries or drink, then everything else is free. \nNow, this was 25 years ago, but would think the custom is still valid.  \n",

Thank you for your honesty and sharing your story to help others.\n\nMy cat Fatty had kidney failure and we gave him meds and subcutaneous fluids for a couple months. He was so skinny and lethargic and our friend who was the director of an animal welfare nonprofit was incredibly supportive and honest. She said that when cats are old and sick and stop doing cat things, like not going in the litter box, that\u2019s a sign they\u2019re really suffering. \n\nSo one evening, Fatty got up and was walking really weird and his bowels were releasing. So I called one of the home euthanasia services our vet had recommended and explained what was happening. The woman was so incredibly kind. She said it sounds like you\u2019re making the right decision, but I was still unsure because Fatty laid down again and seemed fine. And I asked how do you know the right time? She replied, \u201cit sounds like Fatty\u2019s time is close and it is so much better to do it a week too soon than a day too late.\u201d That brought me so much comfort because I knew he wasn\u2019t going to get any better. \n\nThe next day, the vet came and put Fatty to sleep in my arms.

I always do what is best for my pet not what is best for me.  For example, my dogs throughout my life, have always shown me unconditional love ( my cat too) so I refuse to let them keep on suffering. If all they have to look forward to is suffering, that is not what I want for my pet. They deserve unconditional love and at that point in life, I feel I need to let them go. I spend a little time thanking them and reminding them how much they are loved. I take them to the vet and have them euthanized. I stay with them until the end,  petting them and letting them go with feeling loved the whole time. That is how I do it.  Is it painful for me?  Yes, very much so.

            "I had my cat of nearly 20 years of age suffer real bad towards the end. \n\nStarting about a month before he passed he had mild seizures. They only lasted several seconds and didn't occur very often. I honestly couldn't figure out if it was random or if there was a trigger. I was obviously worried but chalked it up to the fact that he was getting pretty old. \n\nFast forwarding a couple more weeks their frequency grew and I discovered that he had FARS, seizures induced by high frequencies. \n\nHis last few days it got to the point where they lasted twice as long as usual. He would wet himself, start drooling, and let out such horrible yowls once he managed to stop seizing. The trigger got worse too, to the point where if I had a bag of chips I would have to go to the other side of the house to open it and pour them in a bowl. The crinkling of the bag was enough to kickstart it instantly. \n\nMy last straw was walking up a flight of wooden stairs and having a floorboard creak. He walked around a corner atop the stairs the same time that sound happened and nearly seized down the stairs. I had to dive to catch him. \n\nI ultimately regret keeping him alive that last month. Those combined 10+ minutes of seizures weren't worth that last bit of time I got to have with him. It's hard to see a lifelong friend go, especially when they aren't having issues seeing how happy and full of life they still showcase.",

            "Some people take this message wrong. This is dangerous advice. \n\nPeople are already too quick to put animals down. It's one thing to not put an old cat through surgeries and discomfort to give them an extra year of pain where they have no joy. It's another to kill an 8 year old cat that is otherwise fine and has more good days than bad because you either don't wanna pay for their bills or have this fucked up notion that you have to put them down the second anything is wrong. \n\nMy cat is a kidney cat. He goes to the vet twice a week for fluid shots. He doesn't like it much. He also vomits often (always has) and has constipation issues. \n\nBut know what? He loves life. He loves being outside in the backyard with me. He loves chicken. He loves cuddles. He makes me play with him in his favorite room every day. He's happy. If I can help him have that joy longer but have to make him take his medicine, that's worth it. \n\nYou know more than they do. All they want is love and food. If those things stop mattering to them and the sickness is terminal, that's one thing.  But if it's terminal and they aren't hiding, or irritable, or starving themselves then they're fine. They're tougher than us and we extend the shit out of our lives so we can see a other day.",

But, it's not always so easy to tell what is just a means of keeping them alive for a short period longer and they are still in discomfort/pain or it's going to add a significantly longer amount of (comfortable) time to their lives.  Especially cats, since they are so bad about showing pain & discomfort unless it's really bad.  \n\n\nWe struggled with this with one of our cats.  He had kidney issues and almost died on us.  Vet got said it was possible that with subcutaneous injections and some meds it was possible he'd get enough kidney function to stay alive and comfortable fore several more years.  After initial recovery he seemed OK other than really not liking the injections.  After a couple months of that routine, he started crashing again.  So we put him to sleep.    \n\n\nWas he in a lot of pain or discomfort those last couple months?  I have no idea really.  He had been getting progressively worse without us knowing in the first place, so who knows how he really felt.  Maybe he felt OK until the very end.  Maybe he didn't. What were the chances of him actually making a long term recovery? That's not clear either.",

They will for instance put them on a so-called [performance improvement plan](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/exreq/pages/details.aspx?erid=586), or start micromanaging them to death, documenting anything that can be perceived as failures or mistakes using brand new standards. It can also be implemented as part of a [vitality curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve), where bottom performers are regularly purged from the organization, regardless of the company's results.\n\nIt's also sometimes implemented in perverse manners when a company is looking to lay off a percentage of their workforce, and managers are instructed to meet a number within their reports. Some employees, identified as financial liabilities because they might work in a support quality but not directly generate revenues, suddenly see their performance reviews peppered with what were in fact minor issues, but that were inflated to turn them into causes for firing.\n\nAnd if the employee is fired for cause, they might not be eligible for unemployment insurance, reducing the unemployment insurance tax the employer will have to pay in the future.\n\nBottomline is this: if an employer suddenly starts playing this trick on you, where you were performing just fine but are now having to jump through hoops, it means your ass has been put on the chopping block. You've been set up to fail, and you will almost certainly be fired soon. Start looking for a job. The good news is that unemployment rates has rarely been this low.\n\nEDIT: Some people in here rightfully pointing that a PIP is not some evil tool and that it can be used to help a struggling employee to succeed. This is not the scenario this LPT is about. This is about the all-too-common toxic workplaces where PIPs and other processes are used to push out employees who were performing well simply because a manager or the company wants to reduce expenses, avoid a lengthy or costly separation, or downright discriminate.",

Instead of facing the truth, they blamed me (who was out for medical leave) and came up with a load of BS against me, which our boss believes. I stuck up for myself to my boss but started looking up new jobs that night. A month later, before my return to work, it happened again, and in a totally unethical \u201cmeeting,\u201d I was given an improvement plan to sign. Me, who at this point was still out on a 2 month medical leave.\n\nKept looking for jobs but I knew my coworker was gunning for me. Not to be fired \u2014 in my field they can\u2019t find new applicants so I knew I\u2019d have a job still \u2014 but I knew something was up.\n\nTwo months ago my boss told me about their plan to switch my role to something I am absolutely not interested in. It\u2019s a role that I have held in the past and to which I have no interest in going back. Ultimately I can see this is the goal my boss was working towards because I\u2019m the only one we have qualified for that particular role. No growth; no thanks.\n\nKept looking for jobs. In the meantime, we\u2019ve had a performance review. I was observed and at my meeting my paperwork marked me as \u201csuperior.\u201d Me, a person who received an \u201cimprovement plan\u201d five months ago.\n\nTwo weeks ago I finally got a new job offer. The pay is better and it\u2019s in an area where my current employer has promised \u201cgrowth\u201d but failed to deliver over the years.\n\nDon\u2019t stay at a place where they are not honestly or accurately evaluating your worth. You can do better.\n\nUpdate: I have officially accepted the job offer. I hope to build new relationships and skills in this new adventure. And I hope that my boss and my coworker figure out how to better handle situations like mine in the future.",
            "Yeah, happened to me. Got a PIP and almost every single \u201cimprovement\u201d they requested was either something my boss never told me needed improvement before, or something I had already been told I\u2019d improved on. \nBoss sort of inherited me and we didn\u2019t get along very well and I made more money than he thought I should. \n\u201cFortunately\u201c a round of layoffs came and I was laid off and got a severance and unemployment. Otherwise, I knew I\u2019d be fired sooner or later. PIPs have a valid purpose, but they also are used nefariously at times.",
            "I was put on a PIP at my last job.  Was there for 4+ years, and had several promotions while there.  I was about 3 levels below in the chain of command, below the President of the company.  I was in Product Management and presented directly to our entire leadership team, and they loved me.  Then our company\u2019s President retired, and they brought in a lady from our sister company.  \n\nI\u2019m 100% confident she said our department as a whole wasn\u2019t up to snuff, and I was used as the scapegoat just a few months after her arrival.  Because my manager and his manager were long time friends.  All of a sudden, I was put on an insane PIP after constant \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d reviews for years.  \n\nIt was BS and I immediately said fuck it and quit.  Even the old President reached out to me when he heard and said it was BS, and something wasn\u2019t right.  He actually gave me a glowing recommendation letter and helped me look for a new job.  \n\nMy favorite part is that last year, maybe 2 years after I left, the company I had work for stopped producing all new products and was absorbed by the sister company.  So the product management team essentially was dissolved.  I loved hearing that shit.  Serves them all right.",

            "I was working for a company and doing a pretty good job. I liked my coworkers and managed my accounts well, and they kept giving me more and more accounts to manage as the company was doing well and signing new clients left and right. I started out with 2 and ended up working on like 5 by about 8-9 months with the company. I was getting the whole, \"keep it up and you'll maybe get promoted blah blah\" treatment, but I didn't actually give a shit cause I wanted to go to medical school next year anyways. \n\nAnd then I got into medical school, and my roommate who also worked there let it slip and my manager found out. Not even 2 weeks later, I got put on a PIP and they made my life hell for like 5 weeks straight. For the first 2 weeks I actually was able to do all the nonsense they wanted. Basically, I had to do all my normal work, and then I also had to also do random BS tasks that we agreed to scrap months ago because they were useless, and I also had to have daily meetings with my boss about progress. I'm positive the meetings were to waste my time to make it so that I wouldn't be able to get everything done. They finally fired me after 5 weeks, BUT that was like 2 weeks before COVID unemployment benefits went bonkers and my UI claim was approved. So I was basically making my full salary minus like $300 a month to sit on my ass before medical school started. Jokes on them. Greedy fucks lmao",

It turned out to be a mistake, but it still sent my anxiety through the roof).  When I returned, I had an intense performance evaluation and was basically given a sheet of paper that said, \"here are all the things you've been doing wrong.\"   I was put on a close eye, given daily reports to give to show how I was spending my time and a weekly meeting.  My boss basically shamed me by saying she now had to manage me when I was supposed to be helping her.  She straight up admit she was micromanaging.  Of course I was anxious all the time, walking on eggshells every minute of the day, even outside of work.  It eventually became clear that nothing I did would be good enough.  I would start rolling my eyes when I'd get emails from her, thinking \"What did I do wrong now?\"  The writing was on the wall.  Even if I got better, her management approach wouldn't change and I would always be at fault, even if my mental health got better.

            "not a reply to op but advice:   \n\n\n Sometimes, we are our own blind spots. Before you start pointing blame outward and looking for another job in which the cycle will repeat, take stock of  how good you actually are and see if maybe those \"little things\" arent a pile of bad habits that snowballed over your career and you have been ignoring the many warnings that came your way.

            "This is all advice people should know. \n\nAt the same time, as a CEO I would lean into situations where a manager was asking to fire an employee without a PIP (\u201cit\u2019s too late!\u201d) or who had low success rates for PIPs. In these cases it was just as likely that the manager needed a PIP instead of the employee. \n\nFurthermore, if you can create a culture where employees genuinely feel they won\u2019t get surprise fired, and that any conversation will be very clear when performance isn\u2019t where we expected it to be, you get a HUGE bump in the value of their salary to them. Instead of always waiting for the Spanish Inquisition to suddenly appear, they can relax and get on with their job. \n\nTo supplement all this, we (a) fixed severance at US$7000 and (b) offered new staff the same amount to quit in the first 90 days. This leveled the playing field (managers got the same cash to leave as their team would) and encouraged openness if a new hire wasn\u2019t settling. \n\nYou can drive your team or you can lead it. Leading is harder but more productive in the long run. If you\u2019re being driven, OPs advice on PIPs is absolutely invaluable. If you\u2019re at a company where leaders lead and people want to follow them, PIPs can be a valuable tool, but only when skillfully and properly deployed. \n\nLike everything in life, the real world is nuanced and messy. YMMV. Good luck out there!",
            "This has happened to me and you are 100% correct OP. By this stage the company has already decided to let you go, but they want to make you think it's your fault with false metrics, impossible requests and deadlines, and the keys word are \"set up to fail\". In this case it was my old boss himself who was incredibly toxic, only wanting to please higher ups and push his own agenda, and nothing else. The fact that the company let this happen showed me that the company culture was also toxic, and even though I was too young and naive at the time to understand what was going on, it was a good lesson for me that some people are assholes and some companies are assholes and it's never worth it to work for any kind of asshole.",

            "I received a PIP last year and can confirm that this post is accurate. Additionally, I've witnessed others receive them over my career and it's 99% of the time a death sentence. \n\nLast year I was working at a software company and had been there for about 1.25 years at the time. My reviews just two months prior were marked as \"on target\" for every category. Upon my return from an amazing vacation with my fianc\u00e9e, I have my weekly 1 on 1 with my line manager, but moments before the call is set to begin I receive a forward notification - the meeting was forwarded to the head of HR. I knew something bad was about to happen. \n\nThey presented me with a PIP out of nowhere. I had no idea why this was happening or what led to it, and I was speechless that all I said was that I'd do what I can to rectify it. The PIP was poorly written and had vague criteria. It wanted me to complete a project in just 1.5 weeks, which in normal circumstances would take a month of planning and execution to achieve. I spent nearly 40 additional hours on it, and presented it the following week to my manager and my sr. manager. They said I dropped the ball and missed all of the criteria. My colleagues were confused, since they reviewed it with me prior to presenting and they said I nailed every point I was asked to hit. \n\nThey gave me another week to try again. So I did. One more week later, another 40 hours, I am extremely confident this time. I get on the call, both managers join, the head of HR joins, and my Sr. manager says \"we're not going to have the presentation today, there's just no point. We're going to be separating and today is your last day.\" Again, I'm left in utter shock and disbelief. HR gives me the documents, and I'm on my way. \n\nIt doesn't all end poorly, though. 2 months later, I received 5 simultaneous offers, the top one being a 66% raise at a better, larger company, with more than double the time off, and I have insanely more responsibility and latitude to do my job. So, don't think of it as an actual death sentence for your career, but rather a death sentence for that particular company. Bury it in your past and move on.",

If I didn't pass, the PIP, I would be demoted, although due to a loophole in the rules, I would get to keep my salary.\n\n\"Will show that continued employment at his current role is in the best interest of the community, as determined by the Head of Human Resources\"\n\n\"Will show commitment to the Employer's mission statement to the unanimous satisfaction of the PIP committee\"\n\nGuess who was on this \"randomly selected\" PIP committee: Charlie, his friend Bob, and the HR manager.",
            "Hubby was put on a PIP. By his boss, who was underperforming. \n\nLuckily we\u2019d been keeping receipts. Emails, meeting notes, anything spoken backed up in writing. Because I was a lawyer - knew what to do. \n\nWent to the head of HR and laid out his case. Underperforming boss fired the next day (really encouraged to leave) and the HR crony working with the boss reprimanded. \n\nHeh. Same crap happened to me at a law firm. Partners bullying various staff (including me), stealing my hours (ie reducing the hours spent in matters to add to their own hours), mishandling cases (I saved their butts). All because they basically didn\u2019t turn up to work. I kept communications, notes, copies of hours, notes of leave etc. The managing partner was going to put me on a PIP because of their complaints. Pulled out the file of their misdeeds. I got paid out and they had to move on. \n\nIf you feel things are not happening right, keep evidence. \n\nI suggest doing it anyway. So you know where you stand",
            "I do agree that if someone is on a performance plan there is a high chance they will be let go. That being said, the unemployment part is not the reason.\n\nI have had to put a number of people on performance plans and about 25 percent have succeeded. The reason we have the process has nothing to do with unemployment and everything to do with wrongful termination.\n\nThe process requires a significant amount of documentation. I have had people that were just terrible and checked out long ago to the point my team is questioning why nothing is being done. It can take nearly 4 months to go through the entire process and the person is warned through the entire process.\n\nThen they are even  given the option of a severance package or the option to try for another 30 days. Yes, even if you take a severance package you still get unemployment after the benefits run out.\n\nI am blown away by the stories I hear of people being fired at small companies as the process where I work at takes an enormous amount of time along with a significant amount of documentation while you warn the person repeatedly over the period. I work at a very large corporation as well.\n\nIn addition if the company is very large the impact of an unemployment claim to their bottom line is extremely small. Most of that is paid in taxes the company has already paid. If it's a large company the manager is hardly involved at all, if not at all as HR takes care of it all so you can't even argue that the person has a vendetta as it's likely a stranger handling the claim.\n\nSo bottom line is yeah, a performance plan is not a good sign but unless you work for a very small company, it has nothing to do with unemployment. It's because the company doesn't want to get sued for wrongful termination and not have the documentation to back it up. \n\nYes, multiple states this doesn't matter due to right to work laws. However, most large companies try to keep policies on line across the board and would rather be safe than sorry with multiple policies across different states.",
            "I don't think the PIP thing is to get around unemployment, it's just ass covering in case of a lawsuit, so they can claim they fired you for this well documented reason rather than some other more legally questionable one they might get accused of down the line.  Being fired for cause generally needs to involve some kind of actual misconduct, not simply being incompetent at your job.\n\nedit: Though also I am in California so I imagine laws may differ in this regard in different jurisdictions, and I don't put it past some shady companies to try to abuse the system regardless, though I think most larger ones wouldn't consider it worth the hassle.",

Aint nobody likes that, not on either side.",
            "The OP gives some bad advice when it comes to unemployment benefits. Poor performance is not a \u201cfor cause\u201d reason for termination. \u201cFor cause\u201d in most states is limited to willful misconduct or gross negligence.  So if you show up on time, attempt to do your work, but perform terribly and get terminated for it, you should still be able to collect unemployment if you otherwise meet the requirements.  Challenge the determination if you are initially denied.\n\nSome employers will use PIPs and aggressive coaching to attempt to \u201cmanage you out\u201d of a position, hoping you will quit instead of them having to fire you.  If you quit, you are ineligible for UI benefits, and any potential EEOC claims you may have had just got much harder to prove. You also lose any leverage you might have to get a favorable or neutral recommendation when seeking another job.  The best thing you can do is to 1) ask for additional training or resources reasonably linked to improving your job performance; 2) diligently document your efforts to meet performance goals in your PIP; and 3) be on the lookout for another job that you can move to if you want or need to.  Be prepared to discuss with any new employer the circumstances of why you are leaving your old job and why the job you are moving to is a better fit.",

            "Words are, of course, coat hangers for concepts. You're trying to send an idea from one mind to another, that's the utility function of language. To that end, it doesn't particularly matter *which* sounds you make with your mouth, so long as all parties are in agreement about which ideas and sounds are paired together. So I don't have an objection of utility with your differentiation between argument and conversation, because as long as everyone else agrees what they mean by those words, you're effectively communicating.\n\nMy objection is that the word \"conversation\" takes on a parsimonious quality that potentially harbors confusion. Too many coats on that coat hanger. It can lead to unnecessary imprecision that necessitates further clarification. Not all conversations are opposed, where there is some nebulous concept that multiple parties are attempting to elucidate. Some conversations are subjective, and merely communicating preference.\n\n*All* arguments are opposed. But, *not* all arguments are adversarial. It's possible (and preferable) to have *good faith* arguments of constructive intent, where both parties' goals are to determine what is correct for mutual understanding. While some arguments are adversarial, where on some level the opposite position advocate is seen as an enemy in some conscious or subconscious capacity, constructor arguments should be based on good faith and conducted in observance of *Rapoport's Rules to Criticize Someone Constructively*, as well as the *Twelve Virtues of Rationality*.\n\nThere's also the practice of \"Steel-manning\", which is juxtaposed to \"Straw-manning.* In Straw-manning, the weakest possible \u2014 and often least probable \u2014 interpretation of someone's argument is attacked, often to the objection of its advocate, who's claims that \"that isn't what I meant\" are ignored. Steel-manning, on the other hand, is to extend the good faith practice of arguing against the *strongest*, most charitable interpretation of someone's argument. If the argument is being conducted in good faith as a genuine epistemological tooth seeking project, this practice is beneficial to both parties. A position's advocate may not express their position as well as possible, or perhaps they're so familiar with the position, that they have the assumption bias that their position js as obvious to everyone else as it is to them, and overlook articles in articulating their positions that would make understand accessible to others less familiar with it. This is why Sam Harris states, *\"If you actually want to understand somebody's position, then you will always be interested in their efforts to clarify it.\"* This is beneficial in a number of ways. Firstly, it behooves honest truth seekers not to seek advantage in the failings of a position's advocate to properly describe the position, as those failings do not reflect logical or factual error in the position itself. Secondly, honest truth seekers should be as critical of their own position as they are of someone else's, and they do themselves, and the project of truth seeking, a disservice by not testing the merits of their position against the strongest version of a counter-position that may be a match for it. Though this cooperative process, both parties can improve their understanding and sharpen the edges in their epistemological tool kit, while increasing the likelihood of arriving mutually at a more fundamental article of truth that they can both share.\n\nI only mentioned part of Harris' quote. Here is the full version.\n\n\"If you actually want to understand somebody's position, then you will always be interested in their efforts to clarify it. But what we're noticing in our discourse, is people don't really want to understand your position. They want to catch you saying something that can be construed in the worst possible way and then hold you to it, and then they claim to understand what you think better than you do.\" \u2014 Sam Harris\n\nThis is the problem with a lot of online discourse, and an example of arguing in bad faith.",

While telling me all of this he cried, laughed, got excited, and angry at times in this crazy emotional roller coaster he was putting himself through. I sat there listening, having a hard time conceptualizing not only what he had to go though, but also the fact that he lives with this revolving door of emotional cluster-fuck inside of him. All the damn time... I didn't say anything at all. Just listened and agree with his points, even if I really didn't. At the end I learned a lot, we grew a little closer as friend, and he almost seemed relived although momentarily I suspect.",
            "This is a good LPT but let me add a little more\nClarity. \n\nMy background is I was in Iraq in the wrong end of an IED attack and far ambush, plus about 5 additional direct fire engagements. So, I\u2019ve seen enough to know I don\u2019t really want to see any more, but there are a lot of posters in this thread who\u2019ve seen a hell of a lot more than I have and have a lot more bad and graphic memories. \n\nThe reason I don\u2019t want to talk about it with you - civilian or  non combatant - isn\u2019t so much that i am afraid of the images or the memories coming back. Those are never going to leave. Until the day I die, I will tense up slightly whenever I drive over a fixed pothole or past a dead animal on the road, or even over some trash. 12 years later and it\u2019s just an indelible part of my make up. There are graphic images I can see now just as well as I could then\n\nNor am I really afraid to talk about the things I did, such shooting my weapon at a person, or calling in fire into a location where some insurgents were firing mortars , and having the rounds fire about 150 meters long and destroy two or three houses in a residential neighborhood. Again, that\u2019s stuff that happened to me and I\u2019m pretty open about who I am and what I\u2019ve done. \n\nBut the reason I don\u2019t talk about, and the reason I know some other vets don\u2019t talk about that stuff, is because you\u2019ll just never understand, and I can\u2019t make you understand. I can\u2019t explain to you my experiences well enough to allow you to get something beyond your curiosity partially satisfied. So it becomes a very frustrating conversation and emotional experience. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my perspective. I\u2019d be interested in hearing the take from those with more experience than I did.

            "My dad was in the Vietnam War.  He never really talked about it.  All I ever saw was pictures of him next to a helicopter. My brother's best friend who I grew up with was sent to Iraq 2-3 years ago.  He always had a special connection with my dad because he was a Veteran.  The two of them would talk in the computer room. \n\nI was excited to see Bill, and of course my first question to him was \"Hey, have you killed anyone yet?\" Bill gets quiet and says no.  My dad chided me, \"Rusgirl55, you never ask that!\"\nAbout a half hour later after Bill left, my dad sat down on the couch next to me, and in the only time he ever talked to me about the War, he told me how he was in control of the gun mounted on the side of the helicopter, and all you did was mow people down with it as you dropped your load of troops off.  He said \"you had to protect them, your guys... some of them were my friends...\" But he said the most haunting thing he ever saw was he swung the gun over at a guy standing on a hill, (he bit his lip as he said this) and thought *oh yeah I got you* and just as he was about to hit the trigger the guy stepped on a mine and evaporated... to him he couldn't believe one second there was a guy there and the next second nothing, the guy was just nothing.\"  The way he told the story, he wasn't proud, he knew he had killed many people, it was his job, and he wasn't happy about it...\n\nI suddenly understood. I never asked anyone that again, and I never heard him bring up anything about the war again. ",

Everyone takes cover, and shots were exchanged between the two groups.\n\nMy cousin was an avid hunter in his youth.  His marksmanship was top-notch.  He peeks out from behind his cover and sees 3 heads poking up from behind a fallen tree.  3 shots later, 3 guys were dead and the fourth was running.\n\nHe spent time in a psych ward and was never the same.  He lost his wife because of the PTSD and living with the guilt of having taken 3 lives.  He never held a job for more than a few months after he came home.

If it's someone older who thinks they're morally superior and wants to jump on you for killing someone, then those types you can tell to go fuck off, it's none of their business.",
            "I remember asking my dad if he killed anyone in Vietnam when I was young.  He was a K9 handler who guarded MSAs and lost a couple dogs and was wounded himself, so I knew he had seen some combat. He never really gave me a straight answer, only would say that he assumed he killed a few.  \n\nThe guy had a heart of gold, and today, I look back and can't even imagine how it made him feel.  Sure, it was kill or be killed, but when he came home, he convinced his parents to take in 4 refugees and they are still family to this day.  To me, that was his penance for the wrongs he thought he had committed there.\n\nI'll never ask a veteran that question again.",
            "When  I was younger I interviewed both my grandfather and great father in their time in WW2. I asked if I could even ask if they had killed anyone. My great grandfather said I could ask him so I did. His answer was this: \"directly? No, indirectly absolutely\" he was a mechanic who worked on bombers, his work help them fly, he patched them up when they got shot so they can go out again. He may not have pulled the trigger but in his mind he definitely is assisted in the deaths of others. My grandfather on the other hand, he isn't sure if he's killed anybody. He only had a submachine gun and only ever spray and prayed, he told me he's not sure if he's hit anybody and if he did he's not sure if they died.",

Lots of homeless vets have mental issues that we didn't kow how to treat (and we still do a shit job of).  One of the more difficult things is dealing with having taken someone's life.  \n\nAnd people ask veterans if they've killed anyone the same way they as if you were asking what car they drove.  \"Hey, for me this is a throwaway question but did you do anything overly traumatic that you'd randomly like to share?\"\n\nNever ask this question.\n\nAdditionally, and while not 100% - I'm sure other vets will back it up - people who did shit overseas keep it to themselves.  People who got fat on bases and got scared by the occasional mortar attack that was nowhere near them tell stories about being deployed when no one asks.",

It's a rare thing and in America we glorify violence. For me I may or may not answer. Age how it was asked can also vary my response. Personally I think the focus is wrong. \n\nWhy did I serve?\n\nHow did I feel when I was first deployed?\n\nHow do/did I feel about enlisting?\n\nWhat positives or negatives did I take away from service? \n\nIf you are solely interested in what's it like to kill another human being. Ok.\n\nIt's different each time depending on a lot of things. Now I only speak for me. \n\nUnder fire? You don't think or feel shit. Just react and get ahead. Might get a lil Yay if the guy was hard to get an it opened up route of attack or escape.\n\nSuicide fuckers? Lol fuck that asshole. \n\nMass like calling in support or a grenade? Relief.\n\nIn all these scenarios it's a us vs them.  You will pick yourself everytime.\n\nNot trying to sound scary. Up close was my \"favorite\" not because I enjoyed it just because I feel and always have that you should truly understand the act.  No pleasure. It's not like shit in movies, no angry rage oh you bested me, no fearful I fucked with the wrong person, it's shocked disbelief. They literally can't understand what's happening. So there is no way to prepare. I mean ya only fucking do it once* on average. \n\nNow that. That I felt something. The slightest twinge of regret and pity. Not for them. For us. As human beings. For the fucked up shit that got me and this stranger to this shared moment. That made me angry in a selfish way. I like to think I am a good person. I'm polite to everyone from the boss to junkies and hookers on my block. I treat everyone the same. I volunteer, I bake cookies and give them away to to see people be happy. I make people laugh. I'm not doing penance. It is who I am I just think that is how you should be. But that doesn't explain away my past. \n\nI'm here. They aren't.  They couldn't be here so I could be. I chose myself everytime. I always will. Objectively in my eyes that makes me a bad person.\n\nHope that helps a few people. ",

            "My brother did 2 tours in Iraq between 2003-2007 and when he got out of the marine corps I got him a job with me at a local pizzeria, just something to supplement his income while he went to school. One day our boss, who is among the least intelligent people I've ever met, asked my brother how many people he killed. Our boss was in his late 30's-early 40's and he thought that this was an appropriate question. I was standing next to them when he asked my brother that and I snapped on him telling him that is not an appropriate question to ask anyone ever. I was more pissed off about it than my brother probably because it wasn't the first time he had been asked that, although the people that asked him that before were our 10 year old cousins. ",

My teacher told my class not to ask that question. However, I think other teachers missed that one because the first question asked in the first other classroom was \u201cDid you kill any bad guys?!\u201d \n\nHe replied with \u201cI didn\u2019t kill any good guys.\u201d Which I still think is a perfect response.

To people outside those businesses, they may seem like the same thing. But a translator handles written documents while interpreter handles spoken languages. Some people who are good at one suck at the other or simply don't like it. \n\nFor top-level work in either field, the outlook is good.\n\n\u2022 But for low-cost and intermediate level translators, computers are taking over. Your job might be to revise a machine translation rather than produce it from scratch. It pays less and is much less enjoyable for most of us.\n\n\u2022 In some languages, particularly Spanish, interpreting is being offered remotely by low-cost competitors in South and Central America. \n\n\u2022 Not every field of translating or interpreting pays the same. High value legal work, technical work, contracts, medical (as in doctors and researchers), scientific, business pay well. Healthcare (between patients and providers) and community interpreting (schools, local governments), offer much less.\n\n\u2022 If you want to be a literary translator, most of the time it's a labor of love. Doesn't pay well, unless you work on a few international blockbusters, for example \"The Name of the Rose\" or some Dan Brown novels.\n\n\u2022 As a friend put it, the \"languages of terrorism\" are in demand (Arabic, Pashtun, Farsi, etc.)",

            "This is absolutely a great resource.  I've worked for my state's workforce development system for 7 years.  We use BLS data every day. We also use data collected by local and state agencies, and third-party sources to get a better picture of local trends and conditions.  In most cases, state workforce agencies are required to make this information readily available and they'll review/explain the info for anyone who asks.\n\nTo the point that others have made, about the accuracy of the current data and the projections, it's important to recognize that data collection and reporting will always be incomplete and will have certain discrepancies baked in.  \n\nEmployers and UI claimants are often the ones identifying the occupation of the worker.  They don't always use the correct one, and sometimes the correct one doesn't exist yet.\n\nCommuters may have an impact on the calculated averages and medians for regions because people are willing to commute longer distances for better wages.  When the workers wages are reported by their residential zip code instead of where they work, it can make it look like pay is really good in a certain area but it's actually people commuting into a better market each day.\n\nProjections are made through a complex statistical modeling process.  They do their best with the data that they have, but for reasons already mentioned and many, many other, the models are never 100% accurate.  They are, often, way off because the data just isn't complete enough for a great model, but it's even harder with how quickly things change in industries, global pandemics, natural disasters, unexpected labor market hiccups, etc.\n\nAll this to say that the resources are many, and the information is very valuable. A good supplemental resource is https://www.onetonline.org. This website provides a lot of information about occupations and industries.

Sometimes it works great, but sometimes you really do need to use regular oil because using butter would add too much water to your recipe. \n\nI've gotten good results by taking the water content of butter into account, and reducing the amount of milk/water to compensate. Of course, reducing the amount of water/milk lowers the ratio of wet:dry ingredients, which means you then need to add more butter than you would oil...\n\nTldr: Baking is a complicated science that requires precise measurements.

            "This is silly, for a lot of reasons. \n\nFirst off, baking is a science, not an art. By disregarding the instructions on the box, you're basically hoping that your substitutions maintain the same ratios as the box's ingredients were formulated for. It might turn out fine, most box mixes have a large margin of error built in b/c let's face it, if you're using a box mix, you're probably not baking regularly...but these subs could easily throw off the moisture content of the recipe, the pH balance, or the flavor profile and make it not really good. For instance, using butter in a Chiffon style cake would RUIN it, b/c that cake style specifically uses the properties of vegetable oil to achieve its airiness. \n\nSecond, if you really want a better cake, make it from scratch using a good recipe from a reliable source. It's not any more expensive, and you know exactly what's going into your cake. I recommend any of Bravetart's (Stella Parks) recipes on seriouseats.com- they're all rigorously tested and accompanied by detailed step by step instructions.",

A pinch of salt and extra yolk will have better results than the butter, save it for cookies and more dense items.

            "Honestly the most important thing with cakes is ensuring even heating. Good, thick, professional cake pans are a must. Also soaking little strips of rags (or get the aluminum coated cloth strips meant for this) in water, freezing them, and then pinning them to the outsides of your pans makes the difference between an amateur and a professional cake. If you have cheap pans, you can try a water bath but I dont reccomend it.\n\nGood cakes taste bad because the crust burns before the center gets done. That $2 box mix is the most reliable and best tasting cake out there. Seriously, I can't tell you how few professionals make their own cake. It is just stupid business practices to make inconsistently tasting cakes that take longer to make. All of them, and I really mean your favorite bakery ever, just buy 25 lb. sacks of cake mix. It is the pans, and rags and proper mixing that does it.\n\nA couple more tips:\n\nCoat the pan with a thin layer of crisco with your fingers, then add flour to the pan and shake it around. Dump out what doesn't stick, and you have a bakers non-stick pan. \n\nMix the batter on medium high for 2 minutes (or whatever the instructions). Set a dang timer. Stand mixer is best. \n\nAfter pouring the batter into the cake pan, pick it up and slam it down in the counter to get the bubbles out. This sounds crazy, and you have to use talent to keep it from making a miss, but it works. \n\nBut seriously, cheap pans (any pan from Wilton is overpriced crap) make bad cakes. By cheap, I mean thin metal. If you can cut things with the edge (every single shaped pan out there) throw it away!",

I sell mattresses and pilliows, you can fit for both like they are a good pair of shoes.\n \nFor Side Sleepers:\n you want your pillow to fill in the space in between where your shoulder presses the mattress and your head/neck. \n\nThe reason that matters is because you want your spine to stay as straight as possible. Having a pillow that is too thick or too thin will cause neck and shoulder pain. \n\nIf you have a all foam or hybrid mattress(half foam half coil)  You will need to go just a tad bit thinner on the pillow thickness because your shoulder sinks into the bed there for lessening the space between the mattress and your head. \n\nIf you have a coil mattress you still need to fill the same space between the mattress and your head. \n\nFor Back Sleepers \nA thin pillow is better for back sleeps since the spin is already straight, a slight elevation in the head will help with breathing. \nIf a back sleeper is snoring, pull the pillow towards them till is  butting against the neck.\n\nFor Side to Back Sleepers \nGo a bit on the thinner side compared to what space in between to your neck. \n\nFor Stomach Sleepers \nIf you use a pillow at all there are only two pillows I suggest: a very thin pillow or \"The Always By My Side Pillow\" it is the shape of boomerang.

No amount of disassembling and fluffing could bring them back.  Not sure they are worth the $.\n\nFirst round of new ones was too hard.  Second round too soft.\n\nWasn\u2019t sold on shredded memory foam due to TV guy and lots of instructions.  \n\nLanded on microgel fiber whatever that is.\n\nIt\u2019s the most excellent middle of the road Goldilocks thing I\u2019ve used.

            " When ever I decide to buy big expensive items I think about how everytime I use it lowers the cost/use. And that's basically how I justify if it's worth the buy.\n\nLike my last truck was bought for about $4000 and I put maybe 100,000 - 200,000 miles on it. Basically I got it was worth less than 10\u00a2/mile. I bought about a little over $1000 of home gym equipment and 2 or 3 months would have made it cheaper than what I would have spent on gas going to the gym.\n\nSo like you said, you use it every single night.

Also have a white noise machine and a fan set to low. I lower the heat to 65 at night.

He said (and im paraphrasing here) \"Buy the cheapest tools you can and when the tools you use the most break, buy the best of those tools so you'll have the best tools of ones you use most\"     \n\n\nthe way I see it, that should be what you do with just about anything you use a lot. Kitchen utilities are some the highest on the list cuz no matter who you are or what your hobbies are you always gotta eat and unless you're always eating out (which is never really a great idea) or your so wealthy you have your own cooks, you gotta make food eventually. a good pot, pan, spatula, and knife will get you really far.

We started together for the easier bit and then as we got to the rougher portion everyone went ahead. \n\nBy the time I got to the top they had all been there at least 45 minutes. They all had time to take pictures, smoke a few bowls and relax. I was there maybe five minutes before they all started back down.

I hadn\u2019t even really had a moment to take in the view from the top. \n\nIf you invite someone hiking be clear about the difficulty or have the decency to work within their limitations.

Ive found hiking with people who don\u2019t care about having to be near each other who or don\u2019t have such fragile egos far easier. You can always just wait for them or vice versa.

The very first hike I went to happened to be planned on a super easy, relatively flat trail. When we arrived it turned out it was the first day of hunting season and we were strongly encouraged not to take this hike. The group decided to do a nearby, much more difficult hike. Rather than say something, I decided to tough it out. Wrong choice, I ended up having an asthma attack and practically passing out. I was so embarrassed and never signed up for another hike. I eventually got back into it, but I was just humiliated and defeated that day. It didn\u2019t help that I didn\u2019t know anyone, they were all people I had just met that day.

If anything getting the unfit person to push themselves is beneficial--it's how weak riders become a better cyclists in group rides by trying to keep pace with the full knowledge that they won't be able to keep pace and will drop from the pack and meet up at the end.\n\nThe best solution seems to be to let everyone hike at the pace they enjoy and have a meet up place at the end. Everyone will enjoy it without anyone having to worry about their pace ruining someone else's experience, slow hikers will be invited more often (and not out of a condescending act of charity/pity).

If you need to pick a different verb that\u2019s one thing but trying to distance yourself from your own opinion is kind of obnoxious. If you really want to help someone with advice, reflect and build. For example:\n\nII hear you saying that you\u2019re hurt by what he said. I\u2019m wondering if he knows that he hurt you. What do you think? Could it be that he didn\u2019t realize he hurt your feelings?\n\nOr\n\nI see what you mean. You\u2019re feeling [emotion] about [event]. It\u2019s not the same but I had [a similar experience] and I [did x or realized x]. Maybe you could try [thing I just mentioned]?\n\nIf you\u2019re really interested in this look up motivational interviewing, mirroring, and practice communicating empathy. Also remember that not everyone is looking for advice when they talk to you about something bothering them. Sometimes they just want empathy. Rely on your senses and just describe and think over what you hear, see, feel, sense from the other person and reflect it back to them.\n\nTry these to get started:\n\nI hear/see/feel you(r) (saying/thinking/feeling/doing) \n\nWould you like to talk? Would you like advice or would you prefer to just vent?\n\n\nBottom line. Be honest, open, and direct and DONT obfuscate what you mean by trying to disguise your opinions as random passive thoughts that were pulled from the aether. There is a reason your opinion is *your* opinion and it\u2019s valuable to others in and of itself. We shouldn\u2019t have to obscure that. \n\nI hear",

If I dose 3 drug addicts with a small high and help 1 person suffering in that type of pain even for a bit it\u2019s totally worth it.\n\nThat line of thinking also led me down a path of reflection on my thoughts on drug addicts coming in overdosed. It hit me that they\u2019re probably trying to self medicate a different type of pain and looking down on them isn\u2019t fair at all since the rest of us do the same thing with food, or tv, or video games, or porn, etc. \n\nLong story to say, OP is totally on point.",

I was mistreated and misdiagnosed growing up and, among many things, was frequently belittled about my pains and symptoms. If any doc had actually listened to my mom say that it\u2019s not just growing pains, maybe I\u2019d know sooner. If I had known then I think my health would be a bit more manageable now. I wouldn\u2019t have done irreversible damage to my body in high contact sports. And I think, most importantly, my mental health would be better off. \n\nI struggle to see myself within my limitations, and am currently still learning to deal with those in healthy ways. My husband was really the first person who didn\u2019t ever make me feel like my disability is what defines me. Because of how I was treated growing up by the professionals, I grew a tendency to ignore my symptoms and push myself beyond what my body could handle. I started to believe that it was all in my head, even tho years of therapy never really helped ease the pain or other vascular symptoms. Now as an adult I\u2019m learning to be more kind to myself. Be happy with myself as I am. And I\u2019m learning not to care that I can\u2019t run a block when others run marathons. Not to care how people look at me on days I need to use mobility aids or say \u201cyou\u2019re too young/you don\u2019t look disabled, quit looking for attention.\u201d \n\nThe thing is, I wish I was invisible those days. I just need to go about my life like everyone else.

            "It ain't the pain that gets you, it's the time spent with the pain. Chronic pain is a killer because of this. \n\nI feel like that's a part people have a hard time understanding.\n\nStubbing your toe against a cabinet is painful like a red hot sun but the pain goes away after a minute or two. A brief experience of a pain past level 7 is fine. It's bearable. \n\n\nNow imagine that pain didn't go away. You wake up with it, you take your meds (if meds exist for your condition), it reduces the pain down to a manageable level. Now you have to go throughout your entire day dealing with it. \n\nThere was a spoon comparison from another reply (or hitpoints) but I like to compare it to mana. Mana is what you wake up with. It's the energy to get things done and it randomly can be refilled by things like food, positivity, whatever.\n\nToughing it out and enduring the pain costs mana every second. It's a constant drain on your reserves and mental faculties. Walking up a flight of stairs, opening a book to study, engaging your partner or friends, it all takes mana. Every person's condition is different and each condition has its own unique cost multiplier for different tasks. Depression makes certain acts cost more mana, lupus causes other acts to cost more mana. \n\nSo what happens when you run out? You can't do anything anymore. You might be able to squeeze out some extra mana from active skills with extremely long cool downs like \"Fear\" or \"Desperation\" but when you run out of those, you're dead in water. \n\nWhen you start to run out too many times, you either get better at managing it or it chips away at something deep inside. A big tube of glowing blue goo with a big sign above it that says: \"Desire to live\". This tube gets drained just a bit every time your mana reaches 0. It replenishes slowly too though there are certain quest events that can give you a nice big injection into the tube. \n\nOnce that tube reaches zero, it becomes an RNG fiesta. Anytime your mana reaches zero, there's an unknown percent that it will be the last time it will reach zero. \n\n\nAnyway, that's just my interpretation/analogy of what chronic pain is like. It's also why it's extremely important to get help when possible when dealing with mana draining debuffs that are permanent. \n\nIt's hard to understand this if you don't have permanent mana regen debuffs and spent an entire life with a nice consistent mana regen rate. (This ain't the pain olympics. Not knowing doesn't make you any less of a person nor does it mean you had played life on easy mode. It just means you RNG'd a different character class and a different quest line)\n\nAlso, this isn't the only way for that big blue tube of goo to run out. There are many other ways but I'm just describing it from my  inference and perspective of unbearable chronic pain (which can be both mental or physical!).",

About a year ago I started having problems and eventually they ordered the MRI that exposed the real problem. The spinal specialist told me it's such a severe herniation that he hasn't seen anything like it in the last 6 months, and then mentioned that my ciatic nerve was basically spot welded and can die if I don't do anything about it, I ended up bed ridden barely able to move and getting to a 10 on the pain scale multiple times.

When I have done all that I still cannot exert myself. I cannot drive, cannot cook or anything. My family is understanding and my housemates and friends the same.

I had a pinched nerve in my neck for about 3 months. Way worse of pain than the migraines imo. But that could be because I was used to the migraine pain, and knew how to ease it. The asthma is just annoying not being able to breathe. Especially in covid where you need to cough and breathe and cough and breathe and people think you have covid. \n\nI also when I have neither pain can do everything in it's normal functionality.

            "I'm an ER doctor.  I'd like to provide my perspective on folks with chronic pain conditions.  These are very tough patients.  They feel bad, everything hurts.  It really does.  But as far as the ER goes, here's the problem: they're actually completely fine.  Very rarely are there any actual life threatening abnormalities (MI, stroke, major neuro problems, etc).  Additionally there is a massive psychologic component to this (which is certainly warranted - I wouldn't want to feel this way.)  This can (not always) lead to \"extreme behavior\": crying, anxiety, occasional hysteria, yelling, etc.  The combination of \"not dying + \"psych\" + \"emotional\" leads these patients to get decreased priority by the ED.  (Why dote on the annoying 20 year old when you can help the actually septic grandma or dispo the 5 other people in the waiting room.) \n\nMany chronic pain type conditions (RSD, fibro, chronic back pain, etc.)  have no objective findings.  (I'm not going to check their fibro \"tender points\".)  These patients need medical care.  The ER is not the place to obtain this.  The ER rules out life threatening medical conditions and stabilizes critically ill patients.  If you're not sure, come get checked out.  But it is a **PATIENT'S RESPONSIBILITY** to have plan in place for exacerbations of their chronic medical conditions and not to \"run out of meds\". (The same is true for people with COPD and CHF - those are just easily clinically apparent and testable and don't run the risk of drug abuse/addiction.) \n\n\nMy recommendation to these patients is to come up with a plan with your PCP before you ever need to come to an ER.  Have a letter typed up saying something along the lines of: \"I have XXX.  The relevant history is XXX.  What works for me is XXX.  I will be able to follow up with XXX doctor.\").  This plan should be written up and signed by a doctor.  There's a good chance we will not believe you if you say I need lots of morphine/narcotics.  It is best if the plan specifically asks us NOT to prescribe narcotics or benzos upon discharge. \n\n\nI will and should continue to be skeptical about any person who presents to my ER with a chronic pain type disease in emotional extremis without any acute life threatening abnormalities on vital signs, physical exam, or diagnostic testing. I will also do my best to do a clear history and physical exam, order appropriate testing, and rule out life threatening medical illnesses. Simultaneously, I will administer care/medications to make the patient feel better while weighing the risk and benefits of potentially exacerbating a psychiatric or addiction-based emotional condition.  If I am uncertain, I will give the patient the benefit of the doubt.",

The more it \"triggers\" in an amount of time, the longer the  uncontrollable sensation lasts.  This is all probably because I took a lot of very hard hits to that hip.  \n\nThey still don't know what exactly is wrong - after three years - and I'm starting to feel convinced it's some sort of strange nerve damage.  Yes there's bursitis, yes there's IT Band Syndrome, but this weird \"triggering\" still feels unexplained, and the literal shock down my leg sensation is hard to ignore"

I went to the bathroom to then scream it out. However, bearing the \"miranda\" principle in mind, when I was screaming it out, I made sure not to say anything that could be used against me. Mostly it consist of me screaming \"This is fucking bullshit\" and \"fuck this shit\" repeatedly and kicking the rubbermaid trash bin across the room multiple times. At least I made sure not to say something stupid like \"I'm going to shoot up the school\" or something that for sure would land me in trouble.\n\nAfter I had calmed down, I had noticed that the door to the classroom was locked and a university security officer was coming up. Apparently the acoustics were so bad that EVERYONE heard my tantrum and the whole floor went into a lockdown. It was fucking embarrassing.\n\nEDIT: When I went to the community standards office to talk about the incident, I got off EASY because I didn't say anything threatening or cause a scene in class.\n\nThinking I for sure was going to get expelled, I got off with the following sanctions:\n\n1. Not allowed to attend any more in-person classes for that course. It was a month to go before graduation, so meh.\n2. I had to take my final in the Special Ed department.\n3.

The professor was someone who I didn't talk to outside of class much, but I had several classes taught by them. I went in for the interview and got the job. \n\nAt the end of my senior year, I was still struggling to get interviews (remember, I was pretty average, and now with no internship experience). I somehow got one with a company I considered way out of my league, and the interview went pretty well. However, they wanted a recommendation from someone to prove my technical abilities (because no internships).\n\nLuckily, I had that professor I was TAing under. They now knew me pretty well, and knew I was a hard worker. They were pretty excited to write a recommendation, and almost as happy as I was when the company gave me an offer.\n\nThe company told me that they were on the fence about me, but when they read my professors recommendation, they were convinced that I was someone they wanted.

            "Some of the feedback I've received has prompted me to make a post to clarify a few things, and inform on others. Most phones have this \"Emergency\" feature built into them. They usually can be accessed from a locked phone. On an I-phone for example, when looking at the lock screen number-pad, it says emergency on the bottom left. Tap it. This screen can be used to make emergency 911 calls and also has an option at the bottom left that will allow providers or whoever has your phone, to read medical info (allergies, medications, medical history, special needs, emergency contacts, even to give urgent info like, delete my browser history or that a valid DNR/POLST form potentially exists (For those wondering: No, phone DNRs or tattoos are not valid.) That info can be useful if you are unable to provide it yourself. Providers do NOT go through your phone, they do not get access to anything other than that info, nor do they delay care to do so. From day 1 EMT/Paramedics/RNs/everyone is taught that gathering patient history is very important, but it does not come before treating life threats or performing necessary treatments/assessments. Doing this does not replace medical ID bracelets and is simply an additionally step that can be taken to communicate info at a time of need...\n\nFirstly: It is painfully obvious now that many emergency care providers had no idea this feature existed before now. That is a problem. You SHOULD know about this. In the past few years I have seen this become common practice. The only downside is that many patients don't know that they can fill it out. This is a potential source of patient information that providers are not considering. I am an EMS instructor, at our college, everyone learns this. Because they should know it. However, it takes time for some practices to disseminate throughout, so I can see why some have yet to consider it. \n\nIf an unresponsive patient had all their pertinent medical information easily accessible in their pocket, why on Earth would you not consider looking there when appropriate? Obviously you don't slow care to access it, and of course we always take every piece of information with skepticism. But it is our job to provide the best patient care we can within our scope. You should be trying to get a detailed history when possible. I'm surprised anyone tries to argue against having an additional source for potential patient information. \n\nThere are places recognizing the advantages of this feature. The point of this point is to make people more aware of locations to access patient information. I can't personally see any downsides. All the providers that do know to use it can verify that the only downside is when people don't fill it out, or when providers aren't taught to consider it. In time this will become gradually more common. If you didn't know about it I hope now you can make good use of it should the need ever arise.",
            "IMHO don't bother.  As others have pointed out, there's not much evidence of medical professionals actually using it.\n\nOn top of that, it's also information that anyone who gets your phone can have access to.  If someone steals your phone, you can remotely wipe it, but until you do... they've got whatever you made available.  Maybe SO or parents phone number and/or address?  You really comfortable with that?",

            "Several years ago I got into a little surfing accident in southern Spain. I was alone (without any friends) at the beach and apparently faceplanted the only piece of coral for miles, suffering several lacerations to my face and knocking myself out. Some guys around me carried me out of the water and I woke up on the sand with a bunch of people standing over me dialing 112 on their mobiles. Ambulance came, took me to a public hospital with only some boardshorts on and my wallet in my hand. They stitched up my forehead and below my eye, bandaged my nose, and sent me on my way. They asked if I had any other issues, but I didn't want to get stuck there, so gave them a no.\n\nWas dizzy and slightly stumbling, and had to walk about 2 miles back to my car at the beach. I was going to go home, about 45 minutes away, and stop at the US military hospital and get a second opinion. I knew that was gonna take awhile so I stopped at McD's to tank up before the hike back to the beach. Sat there and people were staring. Put a napkin to my face and there was a bloody faceprint on the paper. Finished my tendies, got going, said thanks to the guys that helped me at the beach (they offered me some beers). Crept back to homebase as my neck started hurting more than it was a couple hours ago.\n\nMade it to the clinic and they told me the Spanish hospital did okay, then \"are you feeling any other pain\", I said my neck kinda hurt. They put me on a spine board and since they didn't specialize in anything beyond cuts and scrapes, back in an ambulance and out in town to a Spanish hospital. Thought it would be one local to the base, but nope, right back to the one which I was initially treated.\n\nSo here's my ER experience, they put me in a room with about 10 other people. I'm laying there in my own sand under a flimsy sheet. Won't see the neorologist til the next day, \"so get some rest.\" It's a public hospital, so evidently you need family there to provide any food, drinks, or blankets during your stay. I would ask the nurse for agua she would refuse, \"no agua\" 'until after you see the doctor.' My kidneys were starting to hurt. I did have a chance to call my girlfriend while I was at the clinic and she had to lie to them (saying she's my wife) just to get in to see me. She yelled at them to give me water, which a sip was provided in a specimen cup, and they did give me some sort of lentil soup while she was there. I asked her to call my bosses. After that, she was kicked out (visiting hours) and I spent the night with even more people in the room, several moaning and crying, including an old simpering abuelita lying on another bed pushed up against my feet, as I kept trying to lift my midsection off the bed because my kidneys were screaming.\n\nI was awake til almost 5 or 6 am, and was woken at 7 by three people in uniform from the base. My supervisor, my division officer, and a corpsman from the clinic.\n\nMy Supervisor: Thebrucewayne! What can I get you?\n\nRaspy me: Water.\n\nHe sprints out and brings me back a couple liters, to the nurse's frown. The corpsman gives me a duty phone to keep in touch with them and my bosses. Nothing else they can do, still waiting on the neurologist, so they leave. A few minutes later, I start dialing the phone and the nurse comes over and says \"no phone\".\n\nThe neurologist shows up, they take some xrays, and luckily nothing is broken. Just a strain. They kick me out. My GF is outside waiting for me and says \"why the fuck did you come here, this is where the poor people go\". I guess people with money go to another hospital a few blocks away. The phone rings, it's my CO: \"Thebrucewayne what can I do for you!?\"\n\nMe: Can you come pick me up?\n\nHe sends his car.\n\nTLDR: In a real emergency, you may end up in the hospital wearing only boardshorts & flip-flops. Even with all the prep you make, you're gonna need backup.",

She told us all if 8t ever came back again to just let her die at home. Thankfully they were able to remove the mass and the cancer has gone into recession, and within the next month or so she won't need the bag anymore. She's the strongest woman I know, especially after losing a granddaughter to suicide and her husband of over 60 years suddenly from unknown complications.

I had gone back to the maternity hospital and packed up her stuff while she was in surgery.\n\nMy wife was out of it completely, but said that her phone was like having a lifeline in the room with her.

The best are Amerex or Ansul brand, which are industrial style and have all metal parts. As for type, get a 5-pound ABC dry chemical, with a hose. You should have at least 1 per floor of your home, with an additional one near the exit to your kitchen, and one in the garage.\n\nAlso: NEVER test a fire extinguisher.

What is the prof trying to get across? By already organizing this information when you take notes, you create structure and meaning, sometimes hierarchy, that helps you remember. \n\nA good lecture has only about 4 points it\u2019s trying to get across - with examples. Writing everything down just completely misses the big picture. \n\nOf course, there are (already noted) exceptions - accommodation issues that might prevent this type of exercise. \n\nI always let my students record, if they promise not to use those recordings for nefarious gains and genuinely to study, see what they missed, get it one more time to understand the issue. \n\nAnd of course the format of the class matters. \n\nBut I would say, check out the Cornell note taking method and write it down if you can.",

I almost failed my undergrad because I am actually incapable of listening to people speak while also writing things down by hand, even if I'm writing down/summarising what they're saying. I either forget to write down what they're saying, or I'm too busy writing to listen to them, or I *think* I manage both, but then my notes make absolutely zero sense.\n\nIf I hadn't been able to get a laptop on a grant from my hometown (the grant was literally awarded to people who applied, were from my hometown, and went to university somewhere), I'd have failed my degree in my second year.

Average human conversational speed (lecturers and presenters speak more quickly) is 150wpm. I did a typing test (typing for 1 min in a word document), and got 78 words out, despite struggling for things to say. So trying to listen to someone speak, I'd have to condense what they were saying by 1/5th when writing by hand, but only 2.5-ish when typing, or still condense everything by a fifth, but do so in half the time.\n\nWith that in mind, why in the world would I write by hand?

Sadly, I dropped out after 1 year at that University for personal reasons. \n\nBut point is- it's much harder to go back to school after growing accustomed to life outside of school. Relearning how to not procrastinate, and have good time management skills when it comes to assignments and deadlines is very hard to do the older you get. And working on top of going to school at a University is stressful as all hell. Sleep was non existent. Once you're in school, stay in school. Don't make the mistake that I did.

Do people think homeless people and drug addicts have \u201cbad times\u201d that are temporary? We need to rethink the way we give people advice about their mental health. It\u2019s not that this isn\u2019t good advice. It is. But it\u2019s the advice we give. We should also be telling people to reach out to people with mental help issues and help them, not just ask are you ok? Or how are you doing but help people get to the root of the problem. I spent long periods of time in my life struggling with long term unemployment and really looking back all I needed was a friend to reach out and help me do things that gave me bad anxiety.

Homeless people need homeless shelters. Severely depressed people need a society that rehabilitates them. Gives them a job. Gives them a community. But we don\u2019t live in a society like that. So, like with charity, the solutions we have are focused on ameliorating the issue somewhat, never getting to the actual root of the issue. Considering that neuroscience shows were roughly 90-95% completely unconsciously driven and that free will is pretty much an illusion, and that rates of depression and suicide increase along with social atomization and extreme wealth inequality, you would think the focus would be on what the root of the problem is.

Beyond straight up fake info, there is bias and quality of data to consider, which can amount to hours of fact checking.

So fact checking is still important to do. \n\nOne way that I am going about this is focusing my attention on fewer topics. For example, I will do a general read of the news in the morning and then pick out a topic of particular interest to read more in depth. \n\nI usually choose something that I have been noticing is reoccuring, that exists at a conceptual level, and that I think I know about, but I don't. (this is a tricky one because it involves recognizing what you don't know - it's not always possible and meeting the first two reqs is still good.)*\n\nTo name such a topic off the top of my head that I have queued to look further into: fascism. Many people of different groups have been throwing around this label towards other groups. I feel like I know what a fascist is because public ed. history class mainly focused on WW2, and now the word comes up so often into he news. \n\nBut what is the ideology of fascism, what makes a fascist? Tbh, I don't know. So to accept, deny or at least understand where the emergence of the arguments making claims to the fascist behaviour of given organizations comes from, I need to start by understanding fascism beyond a level of familiarity with the word itself.\n\nI had an aha! moment yesterday while I was watching a historical doc about the Roman Empire. Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his to-be emperor son Commodus were away on the frontlines of a battlefront when Marcus gets sick. A message about his illness is sent back to his wife Faustina, but gets miscommunicated into a message that he has died.\n\nThe Emperor dying poses a huge threat to his entire family. To ensure safety for her family, Faustina  encourages Aviduis Cassius, an influential Roman General, to take the throne in replacement of her dead husband. Clever plan, except by the time the news travels that Marcus Aurelius is not dead, a revolt within the empire has begun. \n\nA rebellion begins begins because of fake news.\n\nMy aha! moment is that Faustina had no way to fact check her messenger. Information was in such a precarious state that people just had to believe into the integrity of their messengers. There were few alternative ways of knowing things, except by the messages of other ppl. \n\nAll this to say that life has always been a confusing murky reality based on biased, possibly not well researched, possibly not true information.

Thank you for the gold, u/Bilo_Sagdiev. I will happily give you my number if you'd like to hear a proper thank you in my old lady voice. <3",
            "Nah this just isn\u2019t true. I write software dealing with Voip and picking up the phone updates the call state from ringing to connected. Many of these scam call bots call numbers to classify them as residential, commercial, computer, invalid, or no pickup in order to sell them. Answering the call and not saying anything will most definitely label you as a residential number which is the type they want the most. Your best option to not answer at all. If you must answer unknown numbers, starting the call with \u201cthank you for calling xyz...\u201d is better as it labels your number as commercial. Commercial numbers still get sold but to fewer buyers.",

India or Pakistan?\" Usually they say Pakistan, that seems to be the geographical area of the call centers targeting Canada right now.

I couldn't care either way about Kashimir, but it's pretty funny getting some guy who one second was an officer of Tax Canada turn into a \"show bobs and vegana\" guy in 2 seconds",
            "When I was a student many years ago, I worked for a few months at a call center that cold called people for opinion polls and market research.\n\nThere was an option on the software called \"emergency number.\" Basically, if you end up calling a city's emergency dispatcher or something like that, you select this option to remove the number.\n\nAfter I stopped working there, I answered some cold calls with \"911, what's your emergency\" and would tell the caller that this is an emergency line and not to call. The number of market research and telemarketing calls dropped drastically within a few months. In the few months that I worked at that call center, I only once got through to an emergency dispatcher.\n\nHowever, this was about 15 years ago, so I don't know if such a thing would work today.

The tech is designed for legit use-cases like calling all parents at a school to inform them of an intruder, making automated payment reminders, etc. but companies buy our tech, they sign an agreement saying they won\u2019t call people without their consent, and then they do it anyway.\n\nCalling and pressing mute doesn\u2019t do a single thing. There are very few Dialers, in fact none that I know of, (this is what they call automated dialing or robo dialers) out there that track or recognize a lack of sound. The dialers are designed to recognize voice and then quickly route to an agent... THATS IT. In the event of a dialer that is only a robot... \u201cvoice broadcasting,\u201d it reports back to the call center manager whether there was an answer or not. If it\u2019s a disconnected number or fax number that\u2019s a different story.. it can recognize those. \n\nAlso, even if there was one single dialer out there that could behave differently when there was no sound, it would be such a small percentage of call centers using it than this LPT is useless. I sell and compete against dialers every day for work and I\u2019ve never heard of this.\n\nYour best bet is to register on the DNC.org site and wait to press 1 or whatever to opt out of future calls... if they offer that feature.

My boss also didn't have time to go back and forth with excuses and just wanted the work done.

            "I have some disdain for HR in general after years of corporate work.  They are masters of shifting responsibility down to managers leaving everyone to wonder what they do beside benefits coordination.  Having been in situations of formal complaints, this LPT isn't bad. But it really applies to your life in general. Document everything. Every call/interaction you have that requires follow up or follow through with another person should be documented: date/time/action/expected result. If you are being harassed, bullied, dealing with unethical requests, first put it in writing to your manager.  HR has made it their job to deal with it first. If nothing happens, then start escalating.  If your manager is the problem, put it in writing to their boss.  Like OP says, HR is not your friend and is usually the last line in dealing with problems. If it's a serious legal problem endemic in the company, look for the whistleblower hotline.  There are some legal protections for whistleblowers.  Depending on the type of complaint, you might also look to your company's Equal Opportunity Office or maybe even state/federal EO or Labor depts.  HR is usually not the one that take action, it will be Legal, EO, or Risk Mgmt.  \n\nOP is right - HR is not there for you.  You are not the company's best asset despite all the verbal masturbation by the CEO or Chief People Officer.  Ask the CEO where you fall on the balance sheet...it's not under assets.   \n\nIn my experience, I've found HR to be of little value. In fact, they do more harm than good.  One mistake by HR can cost you your benefits or negatively impact your retirement planning (true story). They are self serving and do everything in their power to make your problem someone else's problem. Just look at how hard it is to get an interview or get hired.  Anything you tell someone from HR will be told to someone else. Not in a helpful way but in a \"what's our exposure\" or \"how do we deal with this employee\" way.  In HR's eyes, you don't have problems, you are the problem.\n\nLPT: Manage/interact with HR like a hot microphone and avoid as much as possible.",

Yes, part of my job is to guide leaders in what they can/can't do or say to employees, but if that avoids a lawsuit, that's a consequence; that's not my objective.

I do guide employee and employer through the procedures necessary to resolve a conflict, but if the employee or employer expect me to bend ethics in their favor, I won't do it. I went into HR to help employers take care of their employees, not to be a company's watchdog. If I sense that that is not what they want me to do, I will find a different place to work. Remember that I am also the company's employee, and so is my boss. If stand and do nothing when a company wants to screw you over, who will go to the plate for me when they try to screw me over?

Disclosing that disability essentially lets me have mental-health sick days without fear of company retaliation. The one time I didn't disclose that disability, I was taken advantage of and mocked because of my mental health issues. Since then, I have never had an employer even so much as make a peep when I say I'm going to take a sick day for mental health. I'm in my 20s, generally pretty healthy, and try to stay in good shape, so my actual sick time would almost never be used. I actually get to use my sick time, and I wind up doing more/better work the days I take a Monday or Friday off, so overall it's a win/win. If I didn't file that disclosure, HR would be completely up my ass about why I was missing so many days, and would laugh in my face when I said I need sick time to take care of my mental health.

They are essentially the buffer between the executive/investment side of the business, and the employee side of the business. The executive side could not give two fucks about any employees.

If you have a company phone, they can certainly monitor your messages and texts.\n\nAll of that is thanks to the Electronic Communications Act of 1986.

While strengthening your abs and core is important, your future self will thank you for strengthening your foundation. \n\nI\u2019m about to be graduate from medical school and I can\u2019t even begin to describe how important it is to have a stable spine, hips, and knees. People in their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s, and up all complain of having constant back pain. Most of this isn\u2019t caused by things are degenerative disorders (while that can most certainly be the case) but mostly due to a sedentary lifestyles leading weak muscles which further causes joint instability and increased disc and cartilage stress in those joints. \n\nI\u2019ve seen so many elderly people come in with backs that look like question marks and people in wheelchairs due to severe osteoarthritis in their knees and hips. The best way to prevent this down the road is to strengthen the muscles around joints to give them stability and strengthen the bones themselves through weight lifting.  \n\nThe key is to just stay active and try to incorporate exercises or stretches that strengthen your back, hip, and knees. You don\u2019t have to go out and try to deadlift or squat 350lbs. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will your muscles and joints. Sedentary? Start with a walk and gradually build from there. Kind of active? Hit the gym and train these muscles. Start slow and light and get used to the movement. Then slowly increase weights. FOCUS ON FORM NOT AMOUNT OF WEIGHT.  Don\u2019t have a workout partner to check your form? Ask one of those jacked dudes at the gym. They have been some of the nicest people I\u2019ve met and are always helpful. (I\u2019m scrawny as hell so it was intimidating the first time not going to lie) Just get moving.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure what exercises to do, try to find physical therapist run websites that recommend exercises for certain muscle groups. The goal goal isn\u2019t to  like Hercules. It\u2019s to invest in your future quality of life. \n\nTLDR: Exercise, stretch, and strengthen your back, knees, and hips. Start slow and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Your future self will thank you for it. Remember the goal isn\u2019t to look like Arnold in his prime.

The weight of loss that one feels is proportional to the size of the hole left by their vacancy, and larger holes hurt more and often take longer to \u201cheal\u201d that gap.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable that a pet who plays a significant, personal role in one\u2019s life would leave a larger hole than a relative with whom someone has infrequent interactions. Sure, maybe that seems strange, but there\u2019s no need to feel guilt for such an emotional response.",

First thing we did when we came home or went to eat breakfast was put her on our lap and pet it for some time while feeding it a bit. She died 2 weeks ago and its still such a reflex to look where the cage(it was a multiple story cage and it had aome fencind around it during night or when we werent home since bunnies like to Explore and nibble on things they shouldnt) was.

We were quite close despite living relatively far apart, so at first I thought there was something wrong with me for not feeling the same crippling grief that everyone around me was experiencing. \n\nI was sad about her passing, for sure, but not to the extent of being overly distraught. I was also somewhat relieved that the whole ordeal was over and our family would start healing eventually and could let go of the fear of \"when will she die.\"\n\nTurns out, it was good to have someone around who could keep a level head to help with logistics and all the stuff people really don't want to deal with after the passing of a loved one.

Sudden or slow, something kills them. Pets are often put down by their owners - and while that is usually for very good reasons and the right decision, that doesn't make it any easier on the owners who live in a society where extending (human) life at all costs and never causing death are considered moral.",

My mom was sobbing but I didn\u2019t cry until later than night, when I was all alone. I cradled her blanket she used to sleep on and bawled my eyes out in the basement by myself. I did it for probably two weeks. She was my first dog and it was horrible. I didn\u2019t even get to see her that day.

Anyway, one day she was watching me when I was like 7 and got really mad that I didn\u2019t want to go to church since I was sick. My parents never took me to church, and she was mad, saying I had the devil in me. She made me go anyway and I told my aunt that we met up with after about it.

Flash forward to when I was like 21/22 and we hadn\u2019t ever really talked about it but were cordial, but I had found out she had cancer from my parents. I watched her decline via hospital visits and eventually saw her in the casket. I felt like I had to keep it together for my dad since it was his mom, after all. My mom, dad, and I went to see her in the casket at the funeral and my dad went up alone to pay respects. He\u2019s not a very emotional person, but he instantly started sobbing quietly.

I always believed, you treat your relatives as your own. You don't fight with them or compete against them, you act as a team - a giant family with all relatives caring for each other like they do for their own families. But that never happened in my case.

            "I'm not trying to be rude here, but I wouldn't exactly call this a \"pro tip\". Especially since the last sentence can be pretty dangerous depending on who you're speaking to. People shouldn't *just* blindly trust their emotions, because emotions can be temporary, fleeting, and can lead to people making decisions and comments they might not otherwise make possibly ruining their relationships. Especially when the topic is about pets. \n\nBut I mean logically, *yeah*. It would depend more on who you bonded with more, right? So if your dog who, for example, you grew up with since childhood dies around the same time your Aunt Gertrude (who you haven't seen since your 10th birthday party) dies. It's more natural that you'll feel more sad over the being that was your best friend than a lady you haven't met since you were a kid.\n\nOr a little more complicated, if your dog and your boyfriend/girlfriend/SO died in a freak accident, as rough as it may be for other people to see, *it's okay* to feel a bit more grief for the being that was essentially a child, and probably didn't know what was happening.\n\nThat's not saying that it's a bad statement or something. It's actually pretty refreshing to read. But again, not exactly a *pro tip*, more like general advice.

I'm not super close to my mom and dad, or my brother and I know when they pass it won't be as hard, and I feel guilty about that.

I cried so hard and easily for her, but also laughed and felt happiness. I met her when I was ten, spent more than half of my life with her and we walked through hell together. She was a good dog, a real good dog.",

            "If I saw my dog and some of my relatives drowning I would absolutely save my dog.",
            "I wanted a German Shepherd since I was three. I saved and saved for YEARS to get exactly the right one. Passed on so many because they weren't \"the one\". Nothing clicked. I was going through an extremely rough time mentally and emotionally right out of college, and I got a call from a breeder that he had a 6 week old puppy he was gonna put down because he was \"defective\" - he was too nice and couldn't be used for breeding. He had no interest in the other dogs, just sat on the porch and looked out at the road for hours on end. I decided what the hell, I'll go meet him. I drove four hours, got out of the car, and immediately saw him sitting there. I knew the second that I locked eyes with him that he was mine. He jumped up, tail going insane, and jumped into my arms. This dog literally never left my side for the next six years. He was trained as my service animal. He was a part of my soul that I never knew that I was missing. Three years ago I got married and had a baby, and he went right along with the flow. Unfortunately I was laid off when I left to have my baby (thanks American no-cause laws) and was scrambling to find a job two days after my daughter was born. We were STRAPPED for money to even keep the house, so I missed my first and only month of heartworm preventative with him. He ended up catching heartworms, and despite treatment, was never the same. My husband and I cleared out our life savings and borrowed from everyone to try and fix what had been done in a single month, all because I deemed something more important than him. I let him out to go potty one day while I was on a conference call in my office inside. Ten minutes later I went to grab him, and he had passed away directly under my office window. He was not even six years old yet. This was in February and I still cry every single day. I feel like my soul has been ripped apart. He was the only one that I could count on through multiple mental breaks, stressful jobs, years of self hatred and doubt. I honestly don't think that he ever understood that I am still alive today all because of some asocial puppy that refused to leave a porch until I came along. \n\nI love you so much, Beowulf. You always have been and always will be my heart and soul.",
            "Someone once told me this :\n\nLove = Joy * Trust * Time\n\nSo far it has proven a solid formula.",
            "Sometimes I think my pets are the only proof I'm not a sociopath. I've been around death my whole life. I handle it really well. I'm from a big family and they've never tried to hide it from me. My first funeral was when I was 4ish.  And I've done pet hospice. I've taken in a couple older pets people just couldn't handle anymore, given them loving homes and whatever medical care my vet recommended  till they passed away naturally.  \n\nIn 2017 my dad got diagnosed with terminal cancer. I put a large portion of my life on hold to help take care of him; preparing him a special diet, buying gear to help him get around and keep him comfortable when he couldn't anymore, help my mother care for him, move him, feed him. \n\nOne Thursday morning in 2019, I woke up to my 7 yr old rescue dog having a seizure on the end of my bed. He'd never had one before. At first I was like ok, there's a lot of reasons dogs can have seizures. But several hundreds of dollars and tests later ruled out everything but a brain tumor. Over the course of 1 weekend he went from never having a seizure to them coming 3 hours apart and lasting over 5 minutes each. The vet had prescribed anti-seizure medicine but said they'd take 2 weeks to begin to be effective and there was a limit on what they could do. So we made the decision to euthanize. I was a wreck. \n\nIn June 2020, my dad went into organ failure. We did in home hospice, I helped give him his medications and I was holding his hand when he died.  I notified my family and the hospice people. Called my boss to let her know I'd be out. Went and made the funeral arrangement, helped pick the casket, the flowers, picked and delivered the outfit. I teared up a little at the the funeral, also mostly for seeing how it impacted the rest of my family. \n\nBut I cried 20x more for that dog than my dad. There's no question about it.  But part of it was the surprise. I'd had 2 years to come to terms with my dad dying. Part of it was that with my dog his care was my responsibility, he couldn't make choices for himself. And also yes, for all that I'd been around my dad much longer, my dog was a bigger part of my everyday life minus the last 2 years I was providing him care.",
            "People always told me I would be sad once my relatives start dying. They started dying. Didn't feel anything. Still don't. But the thought of having to give my cat away makes me really anxious. No one was there when I was homeless besides my cat. Even though he doesn't understand me he loves me for no reason. That's more than I could ever feel about my family.",
            "I recently went through this with the sudden passing of my dog. The grief hit me like a truck. I just thought to myself, why am I more affected by my dog passing than my grandfather whom I was very close to as well.\nPets can be like your children and IMO pure joy, pure innocence. I think that's why I felt it more when my dog passed. You never get enough time with your pets.",
            "i love my dad,  i look a lot like him.  i see him in the mirror,  i have his mannerisms, his speech patterns, and many things that remind me of him near hourly. \n\nHe died about 10 years ago and it was brutal for me to experience and it still hurts.  \n\nMy dog of 17 years died on july 10th and it is absolutely not in same planet as when my dad died.  i am beyond repair.  This is such a profound loss to me and with all the intrusive thoughts and the hind sight and it is absolute agony.  i remember how i was after my dad died,  this is so so much worse.",
            "Ugh, this whole thread is heartbreaking. My dog passed away from lymphoma last november, he was only 4 years old. He was the first dog i ever took care of, since he was a puppy and he was basically my dream dog (a corgi!). I felt like he was always close to me, but during the pandemic, we grew even closer, specially because i was alone with him a lot of the time. Losing him was the hardest thing ever, i'm literally holding back the tears as i type this.

A day or two into the trip we received news that Casper had also passed away due to old age. My grand parents lost it. During the funeral and the wake my grandparents were bawling and crying so much.

            "I\u2019m genuinely so terrified of my puppers passing away. We\u2019ve had her since we got married, been through SO much together as a family. She\u2019s a Boykin Spaniel and has SEVERE separation anxiety issues, we\u2019ve brought her to numerous (8-10, lost count) vets, most of them specialized in neurological disorders. She has to be put on sedation meds anytime we leave the house because she will try to chew through doors, and has broken most of all of her front teeth off on her crate (crate is for her safety at this point). We\u2019ve spent thousands on her care, having a house sitter there if we make a trip. We\u2019ve been told numerous times by the vets \u201canyone else would have given up by now and surrendered her to a breed-specific shelter, you are not a bad parent\u2026 this is just unfortunately common to the breed.\u201d Shes 12 now, and due to the stress this has put on her I know her days are numbered. I\u2019m not going to be okay when it happens, it\u2019s hard for me even to type. She\u2019s such a caring, love-FULL dog!!! She genuinely freaks when her owners leave because in her mind it is literally eternity before we return to her\u2026. That makes it so hard. I pray she passes in her sleep because I won\u2019t abandon her to the vets hand alone if she has to be put down\u2026 but it will likely destroy me.

Your $1,000 iPhone 11 most likely has a wholesale cost of at least $100, but don't expect to be entitled to service for your $109 Black and Decker cordless drill.\n\nSecond, it specifies service and repair facilities, so you probably shouldn't expect to be able to call the manufacturer's parts center and order a new part hassle-free. The possibility exists that as an end user, you may not get it regardless.\n\nThird, the text doesn't specify limitations on the repair facilities that may receive parts, so the possibility exists that only repair centers authorized by the manufacture may have access to them.\n\nFourth, the text does not specify limitations on pricing, so even if you can get parts, there does not appear to be anything stopping the manufacture from pricing the part disproportionately to the cost of the device itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the mere existence of Apple's Genius Bar, even with all its problems, might very well satisfy this law",

Edited my point about this being ethical as others have correctly commented that just because something is legal does not mean it's ethical. Also, If you are a lawyer or similar and find a factual errors with any of this, please let me know and I'll update the post with your advice. Particularly curious as to how best to enforce and how much they'd have to refund if they no longer make parts in the case of something like a cell phone or other electronics.\n\n> Descriptive article here: [https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151211-column.html](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151211-column.html)\n\n> Section of the law itself:\n\n>>(b)\u00a0Every manufacturer making an express warranty with respect to an electronic or appliance product described in subdivision (h), (i), (j), or (k) of Section 9801 of the Business and Professions Code, with a wholesale price to the retailer of one hundred dollars ($100) or more, shall make available to service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and functional parts to effect the repair of a product for at least seven years after the date a product model or type was manufactured, regardless of whether the seven-year period exceeds the warranty period for the product [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes\\_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.7.&part=4.&chapter=1.&article=3](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=1.7.&part=4.&chapter=1.&article=3).\n\n> For example, it's highly unlikely that cell phone manufacturers will make original batteries available for purchase 7 years after the last phone of that model was manufactured. Given all their talk about how \"NoN OrIgInAl BaTtErIeS WiLl SeT yOuR hOuSe On FiRe AnD kIlL bAbY sEaLs\", let's turn the tables on 'em. Many high-end smartphones cost several hundred dollars or more: you could get a nice return for a couple of hours of work. This could apply to all sorts of things, including robot vacuums, laptops, TVs, etc.\n\n> This is both legal (it's literally the law) and ethical (we should be repairing products if they are otherwise still useful, not tossing them due to the manufacturer's planned obsolescence).",

When we were finally let out, one of the security guards stood in front of the door (pretty much blocking the exit) and was obviously angry.  He started demanding who called the fire department. According to him, we should not have reached out to 911 because the fire department had better things to do. This one amazing older lady tore him a new one.

            "Hotel Maintenance here, its not that we dont know how to get you out its just that often our contract with the elevator technician company has a hefty fine for opening the elevator doors without emergency personnel or elevator technicians.  This results in us trying to get the elevator to open on its own.  Any good engineer will make contact with the guest inside to make sure everyone is fine and then call the elevator service company and then try to get the doors to open on its own usually reseting the computer.  \n\nI should add that one reason why it may take longer is most building maintenance staff that was worked in that field for any longer than 3 months has been stuck in an elevator. Not saying that elevators are death traps just that we generally use the service elevators which are not always in the best of shape, that combined with the law of averages means they get stuck in elevators with some frequency.  This means that some engineers have a tendency to forget how terrifying it can be to be stuck.\n\nI would also like to point out that if someone is having a panic attack or other emergency then getting them out does take priority and we will do whatever we can to get the guest out.",

I was a total POS for taking too long\n\nThat being said\n\nYou are the most safe in an elevator, statistically anywhere. Other than time. No one in or out under normal circumstances. And the elevator should not move with a safety circuit open. Stay in there. Do not try to escape. The movies are all wrong. You are purposely locked in for your own safety. \n\n\nIf you need to get out call 911 or the emergency services near you. They will break and destroy everything to get you out. \n\nIf you can wait a respectable amount if time, wait for the elevator personnel. \n\nBut do not count on the elevator technician for a timely response.

VERY easily causing 10k+ in damage and an elevator out of service for a week. \n\nAnd in the case of HOAs that have an elevator, the same people calling the fire dept are paying for all the damages. Not some faceless investor/management company.\n\nPanic attacks do look terrible though.",
            "It really depends on how good building management is and how responsive their elevator techs are. Where I worked security  the longest anyone was ever stuck was 22 minutes. Usually it was only around 10 minutes. Once a pregnant lady was stuck and said she had to pee, tech was there in 5. If you're not sure how good your maintenance is ask for an eta, tell them they'd better be honest because you're calling emergency (911/999/000 whatever applies) if that time arrives and the tech hasn't.  \n\nIf everyone stuck in an elevator immediately called emergency in a big city the fire department would be quickly overwhelmed just with elevator issues. They're more common than you think, most of which are just a computer malfunction or small problem with a sensor or switch. Elevator techs are super fast at getting the overrides etc and that is far better to rely on them to do it unless your property management sucks and doesn't keep a good service company on contract. \n\nBonus tips: \n\nNever use your body parts to hold a door for someone. Use a book or bag but be aware those safety systems don't always work and dismemberment is a real possibility. \n\nNever ever pry open the door yourself and try to climb out, if something isn't functioning properly the car could start moving with you half inside. The result is not pretty.",

            "I\u2019m an elevator mechanic / technician. The reason maintenance doesn\u2019t want to call the fire department is because they (the fire department) doesn\u2019t typically use the appropriate tools to open the elevators safely. The fire departments usually break the safety devices which render the elevators out of service for a longer period and require someone like me to come out and fix the broken pieces and inspect it. Elevators are ridiculously expensive to fix but we have contracts paid in full already to come out and rescue people. We don\u2019t mind the overtime pay when the fire fighters break things though. Lol just wanted to explain why maintenance calls us first.",
            "Very true. Most fire departments have people with the appropriate skills and tools to access people stuck in elevators.

Secondly, 95% of our units are programmed to call our call center and not the building management so we can dispatch a technician instantly. Thirdly, our technicians can set you free without breaking anything and 90% of the time fix it on the spot and return to service. The fire department almost always causes thousands of dollars in damage and the unit remains down for much longer. Do the building owners a favor and be patient.",

This will remove all ads from youtube, as well as a vast majority of ads from all other sites that you visit (including promoted posts on reddit).\n\n____\n\n____\n\n____\n\n\nAre you on android? Root your phone, install [AdAway](https://adaway.org/), run it, reboot your phone. This will block all banner ads in apps, and will block youtube video ads. This will not block spotify ads, unfortunately, the workaround to that is illegal (or you gotta pay for spotify premium).\n\n___\n\n___\n\n___\n\n**It is completely legal to do, you're not violating any TOS or modifying proprietary software when you do these things.** Now I know this may seem very involved, especially if you've never done this before. But it's not that hard to do. Take your time to do it, even if it takes you an hour or so. Think about how much time you waste watching ads. Is it not worth setting these things up ONCE to make ads stop permanently? I think it is. That hour will save you multiple hours of ads watched, and even more time being frustrated. Mental burnout is a real thing, and little things like ads can ad to it (pun intended) until it's exacerbated. Take care of yourself, think of person #1, cause s/he's also important some times.",

The proper approach is to stall when you know a scenario such as above will occur but start on time if not. Also, follow up with chronic late attenders and discuss the problem one on one and set expectations and boundaries.

            "If you use WebEx, every meeting starts 10-15 minutes late",
            "This is totally context dependent.\n\nFirst, culture. Having worked with international groups, some are huge. If you're working with Germans and the meeting starts at 10:00, this means everybody is present and ready to go the moment the clock strikes the hour. In fact, most people will be present several minutes before. Not doing so is considered disrespectful. Working with their neighbors in France, and around 10:15 people will start walking in and turning on the teleconference equipment.  This can be dealt with in wording if you know it can happen: *\"The meeting will start promptly at 10:00, please sign in before 9:55 to ensure your system is working.* One of my favorite screen captures on it had an entire German engineering teem with notebooks in their seats, the English filing into their conference room, and the cleaning crew preparing the empty French conference room where they said they're on their way to the office.\n\nAnother context is who is late.  If the meeting is being called on behalf of someone, maybe the client, maybe the potential sales lead, maybe the boss, maybe a student, it is your responsibility to be there early. And if they're late not only do you just wait, but also possibly to contact them through other means to ask if they are having difficulty connecting to the meeting.\n\nThere certainly are many meetings where the presentation starts when the minute strikes, but it isn't universal.",

            "Yeah, no.  As others have stated, always assume a meeting will start around 5 minutes after the scheduled start time.  Many people have back-to-back meetings and their prior meeting may run a tiny bit over.  Or, computer issues may require someone to restart their software.  My personal favorite is when you go to log in to the meeting and there is a forced update and you have to wait until it is done.\n\nIf someone hasn't shown up after 5 minutes, then you can start without them or reschedule.  But everyone I know allows the first 5 minutes to be a buffer time before the actual meeting starts.  Heck, half the time even if everyone shows up on time the first 5 minutes are people just casually talking before starting the actual meeting.",

Any meeting that fills a full block is automatically rejected. Any meeting without an agenda is automatically rejected. Calendly hooks into everyone\u2019s calendar so there\u2019s no guessing or back and forth about when people can meet. Clients don\u2019t send us meeting invites. We generate a link they can use to book a 25 or 50 minute meeting. \n\nAfter getting this in place, everyone is a million times happier, fewer people are late, and overall we have fewer meetings because the lazy assholes who just want meetings for the sake of having a meetings are too lazy to click 3 buttons to generate the link.

            "Agreed. For anything, really. When I had some really terrible medical issues going on, my friends initially asked how they could help. I really had no idea...I said I'm okay. But I wasn't, I was unable to see. Literally...my vision was so bad that I could not even leave my house for weeks. All of a sudden though, I began getting care packages of bottled water, shower items, toilet paper, groceries, food deliveries. They talked amongst each other to really figure out everything I would need. Honestly, I never would have thought of toilet paper. Shower gel. Stuff like that...but I DID need that stuff. I couldn't leave my home. I live alone. My friends were 600+ miles away. It was a blessing.",
            "When we had a crisis like this, everyone seemed to be eager to send over a dozen cupcakes or send flowers, but what I really needed was someone to return some library books/take my kids for two hours so I could nap/pick up milk and bread. Everyone was lovely, and I don't want to diminish that, but the most helpful people were those who suggested tasks so I could say, \"Yes! Thank you!\" or suggest something equivalent. The open-ended \"How can I help?\" made me fearful of asking too much.",
            "I\u2019d also add that you may want to wait 3-4 weeks before making the offer.  There will be lots of people early on offering food or support but that drops off pretty quickly so the same support, just offered later, may have greater value",
            "I think this depends on what is culturally acceptable. When my middle class English dad died, my Mum just wanted to close down and deal with it very quietly. When I arrived with my Irish wife, she wanted to take control and start cooking soup and generally being a busy body (Irish deaths are dealt with in a very different way, a better way IMHO).\n\n It took about 3 hours before I had to ask her to go home.",
            "100% this. Several years ago my dad had a devastating heart attack and for a week we couldn\u2019t get my mom to do anything that wasn\u2019t sitting in the Cardiac ICU waiting room. People were stopping by or calling to ask what they could do to help and none of us were equipped to process what we needed. \n\nOn the third day my grandma and aunts come to the hospital and my grandma says, I\u2019m going to sit here with your mom, give us the house keys and we\u2019ll take care of house work and you get out of here as long as you need so you can take care of other things. \n\nIt was honestly the best thing that could have happened in the circumstances and it was very reassuring to be able to have time just to go through mail and pay bills and check in at work and with my younger sisters teachers and just make sure that normal life things were able to happen.",
            "I would add any major life change to this as well, when I had my second child and was dealing with postpartum/a toddler/a newborn I was completely overwhelmed and really struggled for a a few months. So many people said \"let me know if you need anything!\". Of course I had no idea what I needed, and thus never really got much help. \nCould not agree more. If you're sincere about wanting to help, be specific and make suggestions!",
            "Can I add in to actually keep checking in on them after the first month of the incident? It's much harder later on (in my experience at least) because I had so much to deal with right after the death...but people stopped reaching out shortly after the 3 week mark.",
            "[deleted]",
            "May I also add a personal suggestion? My dad died this year and it infuriated me that people were SO present in the days leading up to the funeral and then disappeared when the 24 hour news cycle moved on... But I was still left without my dad.\n\nCall and offer help, then set an alarm in your phone for 3-5 weeks after the funeral and let the person know they're still in your thoughts and ask if they need to talk. When everyone else has stopped caring, it'll feel really good.",
            "Does anyone know how to do this with someone who isn\u2019t by you? I have a long distance girlfriend who just lost a family member. I\u2019m not sure how to help other than \u201ccall\u201d. That\u2019s an obvious answer but I would like to do more.",
            "I'm sure this will be unpopular. When I go through this, how about just leaving me the fuck alone for a few days and let me process?  Condolences are fine but the more people want to help, the longer the whole thing drags out. I want to get back to a normal routine. I'm older though so maybe there is a difference. I got people dropping left and right around me but it was expected.",
            "Additionally, it might be helpful for the someone in question, to make a list and post it somewhere obvious.\n\nWhen my friends had twins they kept a list on the bulletin board in the kitchen that said something like:\n\n\"We are so glad you came to see the new babies! If you would like to be helpful, here are somethings that you could do!\"\n\n1. A load of dishes\n2. A load of laundry\n3. Wash bottles\n4. Take the 4 year old to the park or for a walk\n5. Vacuum the living room\n6. Offer to pick up groceries\n  \n\nI thought it was genius. Because sometimes when people come over to \"help\" after you have a baby, they really just want to hold the baby.\n\nAfter having my second child, the friend that took my two year old out for some one-on-one time multiple times during my maternity leave, was my favorite visitor! Plus she often brought coffee and, my son thought she (an elementary teacher) was Mary Poppins.",
            "When my best friend\u2019s mother passed, I asked how I could help, but she was in such shock that she couldn\u2019t think of anything, so I brought over breakfast sandwiches and bagels & cream cheese, so they didn\u2019t have to think about breakfast for a few days. I also asked her to let me know which night I could have pizza delivered to her house, because I figured that they\u2019d be casseroled out. I knew if I asked, she\u2019d keep saying she was fine, so I just did things that I knew would help. This is great advice for other important but less thought of ways to help out.",
            "YES. When my boyfriend passed away, one of my friends (after giving me time to just grieve and do nothing but grieve for a while) took it upon herself to let my brain have a rest and to occupy me with something, because it felt like my thoughts were eating me alive. She knew I wanted to hang out but for obvious reasons I had trouble getting out of bed. She went on hikes in the forest with me, we had picnics, we cooked food while singing disney songs, played board games etc. She planned out all of those activities for me and all I had to do was to show up. She saw that I needed to think about something else, if only for a moment, and she made me laugh when I thought I couldn\u2019t. She never really asked what she needed to do, she saw what was necessary and she made it happen.",
            "Bonus LPT: they'll likely try to withdrawl.  This can come in the form of not responding to messages, to ignoring contact with pretty much everybody. Staying in bed and sitting in your own pain is a coping mechanism many people revert to. \n\nIf you know they're not doing anything, and they already denied the \"can I bring you food\", They may not really want the social interaction. Instead try \"I'm in the neighborhood for X, I don't have much time but can drop off Y at your door\"\n\nSource: self",
            "100% agree!\n\nI lost my mom this year and I was blessed with a tremendous amount of support, but I will say that it becomes overwhelming trying to manage that support at times, it is much easier to say yes to a proposal than try to figure out something for someone to do.",
            "I would even take it one step further and instead of saying \u201c*can* I send over a casserole?\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cdon\u2019t worry about dinner tonight, I\u2019m bringing over a casserole at 4:30.\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019m sending you a pizza tomorrow night, what time works best for delivery?\u201d Or \u201cI\u2019d love to watch your kids for a few hours tomorrow afternoon if you need to get anything done, does 1:00 work for dropping them off?\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve been in a few crisis situations where I was so desperate for help but the \u201chow can I help?\u201d question only added to my stress. Even \u201cwhat can I get you from the grocery store?\u201d felt daunting because I didn\u2019t want to ask people for too much. It was easier to just say \u201coh thank you, but we\u2019re fine. I\u2019ve got the grocery shopping covered.\u201d\n\nBy asking how you can help or what you can do, you\u2019re asking a person who is already at the end of their emotional rope to put in *more* emotional effort and do the work of delegation. Obviously it probably depends on the level of your relationship with the person you\u2019re trying to help. But usually, the more legwork you can do on the planning side of things, the more weight you\u2019re lifting for the person who\u2019s struggling. Otherwise, you\u2019re just making an empty gesture of offering help knowing they probably won\u2019t accept just to make yourself feel better for at least \u201ctrying.\u201d",
            "Also sometimes it takes months for the grief to take hold, people are in shock for a while... don\u2019t stop reaching out if this is someone you care about",
            "Given its winter, shovelling someone\u2019s driveway can go a long way too and in many cases can be done as a nice gesture without asking.",
            "there was a similar post to this not too long ago, but i agree either way. asking someone if you can do something is way better than just leaving an open-ended question and also better than just doing it anyways. everyone copes differently! <3",
            "After a major crisis or life event- people get a lot of help in the first week or two. Think of what you can do a couple weeks out. This is when the real loneliness tends to set in.",
            "When someone is already overwhelmed, asking them to do delegation at the same time can just make it worse. It's why hiring on a new person at a workplace can actually make things less efficient in the short term, because until they get the hang of things someone needs to keep giving them stuff to do and show them how to do it.",
            "My grandmother passed away last week, and there have been so many things that were helpful that I never would have thought of. Of course people are bringing/sending food, which has been immensely appreciated. Here are some other maybe not so obvious ways to help:\n\n-toilet paper, paper towels, hand soap, dish soap\n-paper plates, cups, plastic cutlery, napkins\n-cases of water, tea, sodas\n-someone brought a whole coffee set up- coffee, filters, plastic stirrers, canisters of creamer & sugar\n\nThese were all great because we have so many people in and out of the house, and no one is thinking about hosting guests. I also love that a lot of people are just bringing things and not asking. When they ask, I just draw a blank and say we don't need anything.",
            "No, don't even ask, just so it. Odds are they will decline if you ask. Depressed people don't want to feel like a burden to others.",

            "Yes please with the caring of animals! When my brother was hospitalized for weeks I think the biggest help we got was someone coming over to let the dogs out (summer time, we wouldn\u2019t leave them out in that heat!) and check their water in the house. \n\nWe didn\u2019t have to make runs between the house and the hospital constantly to do that.",
            "100% this. \nWe lost triplets in 2017, everyone offered to help but I\u2019ll never forget those that stepped up and took action. They babysat our son, paid for gas to get to the hospital/medical care, brought food over. It makes a huge difference. Thank you for posting this.",
            "Something like asking if they could run through some washing or help tidy a room would be amazing. The amount of times I\u2019ve crashed over is unreal",
            "Lost my mom 2 days before Christmas 3 years ago and was already in a deep depression and had some legal issues going on. Nothing more annoying than people other than your friends , that you haven\u2019t talked to in years telling you they\u2019re there for you and what can they do or you can vent. Like my mom just died how the fuck do you expect I feel. Then we went back to not speaking again.\n\nI agree. Usually during this time, you aren\u2019t up for doing much. Having someone be around and helping keep up with things for you is probably the best thing anyone can do. I got real bad with not cleaning my apartment and dishes and a friend came over and cleaned a couple times. It felt so nice to have my apartment clean",

            "I know it\u2019s not the same as losing a family member, but years ago I managed to escape an abusive relationship and my sweet little dog was the only thing that got me through it.  A few months later, he was killed by an aggressive dog while I was visiting family for Christmas.\nWhen I returned home, my best friend friend pretty much informed me \u201cI\u2019m coming over and cooking you dinner.  I\u2019m bringing an overnight bag and staying for as long as you need me to.\u201d  True to her word, when I pulled in my driveway she was already there with a big bag of groceries and her suitcase.  I only needed her to stay for one night, just not to be alone in the house that first night back.  But if she\u2019d asked, I would have said I was fine and didn\u2019t need anything.\nThe following week a sweet friend from work pulled me aside as I was about to head home, took me to the fridge in the break room, and pulled out a giant bag full of food that she\u2019d made for me.  All she said was \u201cYou need to eat, I made this for you to take home.\u201d\nThey were both different levels of friend closeness, but they both pretty much just informed me of what they were going to do for me instead of asking - they both knew I was too distraught to even know what I needed help with, let alone ask for it.  \nIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve always remembered when other people are going through a bad time and I try to do the same.  \u201cGive me your grocery list, I\u2019m going shopping\u201d or \u201cLet me know when is a good day to come get your kids for the day, I\u2019ve got the latest Disney movie and a new make your own mini pizza recipe to test\u201d gets taken up 99% of the time where \u201clet me know if there\u2019s anything I can do\u201d is meaningless and they never let you know.",
            "This is really good advice, and if you offer meals, make sure you ask about food allergies, intolerances, and dietary restrictions.",
            "Every time this pops up, I am saddened.  I go out of my way to help the people around me.  I spend my days off work running errands for elderly neighbors, or helping disabled people do things.  Whenever people need something, I\u2019m there to help them with it.  I actually had people ask me this year, \u201cOh, you haven\u2019t sent your Christmas card yet. Did I not make your list this year?\u201d  (I was late sending them out and I\u2019m known in my circle for my fun cards)\n\n\n\nI am currently injured from a work incident, and can barely walk up and down the steps to my second floor flat.  I have washed three loads of laundry in the past six weeks, because the washer is downstairs.  I have walked my dogs around the block exactly twice (the rest of the time it\u2019s me limping up/down the steps and letting them relieve themselves in the driveway). I\u2019m struggling to do my own activities of daily living like cleaning my house, yet, when I try to take a step back and not do things for others, I\u2019m just asked, \u201cWell, when are you going to feel up to . . . \u201c \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m so tired of nobody helping me.  Even when I ask, I don\u2019t get help.  I\u2019d hate to see what happens if I experience a true tragedy.",
            "This is great advice. My father passed away in early November. So many people said \u201cplease let me know if I can do anything for you.\u201d I never knew what to ask for, and didn\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. But anyone that reached out with concrete ideas made things much easier",
            "When my husband died, so many people would ask me how they could help. \n\nAnd, honestly, I had no idea. \n\nI spent weeks walking around in a daze. It was so difficult to think; my brain jumped from one thing to another or just settled into a fog of misery that was so deep I could barely remember my own name. I couldnt eat, I could hardly sleep. I had no idea what I needed help with, because all I could think was that I needed my husband back, and there was no way that anyone could help me with that. \n\nOne of my good friends did the best thing for me that anyone could have done; at the funeral, she took me aside, and told me that next Wednesday she was going to be at my house at 10 in the morning. She told me to be dressed, and that she was going to be taking me out of the house.\n\nThat Wednesday I answered the door and told her I didnt want to go. She grabbed my coat, gently, kindly, but firmly made me put it on, and walked me out to the car and took me to lunch. She refused to let me back out of it. And she sat across from the table with me in a restaurant while I bawled like a child, and she glared daggers at anyone who looked at me cross ways, and explained to the waiters who came to see what was wrong with me that I was going through a tough time and needed a minute. She made sure to run interference for me and she kept the world at bay. And she gave me a place to mourn. \n\nFor the next month, she would come over, find out from my mother and brother what needed to be done, and she'd help. She brought moving boxes and hauled away trash and donations and brought us food, and every week or so she would tell me to get dressed and she'd take me out to lunch or breakfast or something. \n\nSome of my other friends would come over too. One of them took me to the movies, and a walk around my neighborhood. One of them came over and spent the day with me and my mama doing art projects. So many people brought food, or packages of water. Someone left me a book and a sympathy card on my porch. Lots of them would invite me over and then just.... let me cry. I cried all the time then. And they didnt mind. They let me cry, and they mourned with me. That's so important. \n\nMy point to all this is, try to look for ways to help, because the person may not know what they need help with while struggling to deal with a tragedy. Sometimes they need people to just jump in and do. \n\nSometimes the biggest help is to know that when you're trying to dig your way out of a pit, there are people who will come by, jump down beside you, and pick up a shovel and help you dig.",

            "Just chiming in to say that for me, I couldn\u2019t even articulate what I needed or get the wherewithal to ask for things. My mom died just a few days before Christmas here and what I appreciated was OP\u2019s tip when people would say \u201chey I am gonna drop off some food\u201d or when they just reached out directly with a word or a gesture (lots of food drop off because of COVID). My brain just wasn\u2019t working for days and days, I\u2019m sure processing the shock of what had just happened. It meant a lot to have people not skirt around or avoid the \u201celephant in the room\u201d of the death with me either. Sometimes shit just sucks, and that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s worse when folks either pretend nothing happened or try to dress it up too much. \n\nAnyway, just chiming in since this is pretty fresh for me to share a thought or two. I\u2019m sure people know their friends and family best, so trust your instincts when it comes to supporting them and reach out proactively. All the best to everyone who has been through this, and to those of you who have been there with your support for friends/family who are grieving.",
            "For sure. Also never underestimate how much the smallest gesture can mean to people. A close friends partner is ill at the moment and we offered help with lifts to the hospital etc and dropped round some chocolates and a hot water bottle as some comfort.  You\u2019d think we\u2019d bought them a car based on their reaction at the time and since.",

            "MealTrain.com is a great organizational resource for exactly this. \nA coworker\u2019s mother recently passed away so we used meal train to organize who was bringing meals and when. We also used it to raise money for groceries/a cleaning service.\n\nThe website also offers other organizational benefits for a small fee.",
            "YES! Ask a yes or no question. They're going thru too much and won't even be thinking about all of the things that need to be done. If you ask a question with a yes/no answer, it takes the burden off of them and they only have to agree to let you do something for them.",
            "Depending on the situation, it\u2019s also a good idea to scope out how the person is feeling before you come in hot with condolences or offering to help. \n\nI lost an estranged parent a few weeks ago, and since we were estranged my life wasn\u2019t altered in any big ways. I was a little sad but not grieving in the traditional sense. \n\nI got a lot of calls and messages from well meaning family members saying \u201cI am so sorry/so sad on your behalf/you must feel so devastated,\u201d etc. I know they meant well but it really just made me feel isolated and like I had to put on an act to be \u201csad enough\u201d for them. When I tried to explain how I was feeling or asked not to talk about it anymore it was just met with more awkwardness.  \n\nAnyway, I guess what I\u2019m getting at is some people get way too pushy with wanting to help. It\u2019s okay for a grieving person to not want to talk or accept any assistance, sometimes doing so can be really stressful. It\u2019s also okay for someone to seem normal after a loss, and if this is the case then don\u2019t push them into talking about their feelings.",

            "That\u2019s a great post. In that situation, I couldn\u2019t see clearly enough to know what help I needed. The people who helped the most were those who gently imposed their help. For example, I\u2019d be saying \u201cI am so tired, I just can\u2019t face taking both kids out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a request for help, it was more a comment on how impossible life felt.

A few years later, I was in a position to help, I would call my grieving friend every time I went to the farmers\u2019 market and ask if she needed this or that. Since I was there, she didn\u2019t feel like she was imposing and it was easier for her to accept the help. So it\u2019s all about listening to the other person\u2019s needs and using your own judgement.

Will you let us do that?\u201d\n\nThe way they asked made it impossible for us to say no. It was direct and specific, and we felt that if we said no we\u2019d hurt their feelings. We had been resigned to McDonald\u2019s on Christmas, but accepted their offer. \n\nThen my sister in law dropped off a fire pit and wood for us; so we wouldn\u2019t be stuck inside all the time. \n\nOur friends went above and beyond. They brought us ham and potatoes and rolls and jello and salad and cookies and pie. It was all homemade and all wonderful. It turned a pretty shitty week into a nice Christmas Day. We ate out back around the fire and enjoyed the first homemade food we had had in a week. \n\nBefore anyone asks, we were lucky ones and we are out of the woods now, but I will tell you that my kids will always remember when we had the best Christmas meal we\u2019ve ever had, and ate it out back around a roaring fire.",

My grandpa on my moms side died unexpectedly this time last year, and we got a few care packages. My moms online friends sent her a giant stuffed animal and some blankets, one had an outback order with a shitton of dessert delivered to our house, she got some flowers and such. Eventually an older couple rang on our doorbell with a casserole in hand, and my mom went out all teary to take it from them and hug them, and it was a few minutes before she realized that we didn't know those people and they were actually looking for a house on our street where someone they knew had recently lost his wife. She did this whole awkward apology then sent them off, shut the door, turned to me mortified, and said \"I almost stole his grief casserole\" \n\n\nWe still kind of crack up at the faces on those poor people. I think they were just gonna get back in their car, relieved of their casserole, had she not realized and given it back",

Many days, even months after my mother passed I didn\u2019t want to get up or do anything, so let me make your day a little easier today and order you all dinner on door dash. My treat.

            "This is solid advice. When my dad passed away during the pandemic, I was shocked and focused on handling all of his arrangements alone, under extremely difficult and devestating circumstances. I struggled to know what help I could use, let alone verbalize it. It  took every ounce of my energy to navigate the aftermath of the most complicated and painful loss of my life, to the point I lost awareness of my own basic needs. I recall friends offering condolences and support, but with quarantine measures nobody could come by and pick up on things I was struggling with. Countless days passed that I forgot to eat etc. \n\nAlso, nowadays people seem to avoid phone calls and text more often... but tbh it makes a difference to hear people's voice. Recieving physical sympathy cards in the mail also feels like such a caring gesture. In immense grief I was too exhausted to keep up with social media, and it was harder to focus on reading a screen of condolence messages and posts as opposed to hearing a friend's voice expressing support.

At times people get upset that we do not come up with things for them to do; but they can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to be in our position. We are often too tired to even know what would help ourselves. We understand the need to want to help, this would make it much easier on the ones needing help. I\u2019d also add if you want to help someone in need do it for the sake of helping with no expectations on how the person receiving should react.

            "I want to say that I tried this with my new neighbors. I had just purchased a house and had never really been all that neighborly in the past so I figured I'd make an effort since I'll likely be living next to these people for quite some time. When I had moved in they had dropped off a bottle of champagne and a note with their numbers. This was toward the beginning of the pandemic and I had kept awkwardly running into them and they had mentioned that we should get together for drinks but I had politely declined due to my significant other being immuno compromised. One day I found out through the wife the husband had been in a pretty bad cycling accident and she was rushing to the hospital. I had offered to help out in any way that I could grab groceries for them, walk their dog etc. and they never mentioned yes or no so after a few weeks I shot another message asking about her husband's health and might have said \"that I don't mind lending a hand while your husband is out of commission\" he had broke ribs and arm or something I can't fully recall what and how many he broke. Anyways I eventually get a really awkward text from her husband like a day later telling me that I'm not to talk to his wife and if I have any thing to discuss going forward that I need to reach out to him, \"oh and I'm not out of commission\" \ud83e\udd37. Which I found pretty fucking rude. I would've made a bigger deal about it but felt like I should be the adult in the situation since I have to live next to these people until they either move or keel over. So I was like well I was trying to be friendly but if I you found something out of line or rude I apologise that wasn't my intent and I'll make sure to reach out to you going forward. They've been fairly cordial since but I guess this was a long winded way of saying maybe you should know them better before offering any sort of help \ud83d\ude2c or maybe my neighbors are just assholes and have soured me on making an effort with any of the other neighbors. Still confused as hell on what I possibly did wrong, would love some clarity on the situation but figured it's best to leave it alone. \n\nTLDR: Only offer help to people you've known for a while or aren't possibly temperamental \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
            "I\u2019ll also add to try make it impossible to say no to, or as though it is absolutely no extra work for you- some people have a hard time asking for help.  I had a friend going through a divorce and doing the full time working single mo, thing to pre schoolers- I\u2019d always ask if she needed anything and she\u2019d say no, until one day I was actually at a store and message saying \u201cI\u2019m at GenericGrocery do you need milk or anything?\u201d And since I was AT a store and even suggested some items, she for the first time accepted, and sent me a few things.  I started just messaging her every time I went to the store, because, why not? Now she\u2019ll legit send me shopping lists and it makes me so happy.  Long story short- when you know someone needs help but isn\u2019t accepting, try to make it easy for them to take you up on the offer- guilt and shame and grief do awful things to people and sometimes they\u2019ll turn down help they need to not \u201cbe a bother\u201d",

Thought it was weird, but let it go. Got a ride to the shop the next day and when I fired my car up, there were 300 extra miles on it and an empty tank (I filled it before I dropped it off). I obviously asked the mechanic about it and his response was, \u201cwell we don\u2019t have a lot of space in our lot and I knew you were out of town, so I just used it to commute to work everyday to save space\u201d. I was obviously upset and expressed my concerns which were ignored.

Anyway, as they were driving up the road, someone came haring down at speed in the opposite direction. The problem was, there were a fair few cars parked up on the road so there was only room for one vehicle. The other driver slammed on the brakes, hit the work\u2019s vehicle, just skimmed past 3 other cars, and one of our buildings in the swerve/skid.

Definitely didn't put 300+kms on it. But drove someone else's car that they left there in good faith that the service station would keep it secure, probably while high on hard drugs.\n\nMy point in telling this story is just... make sure you use a reputable repair shop.

            "(I am *floored* by the sheer number of awards I have received!!! Thank you! Valentine and I feel very loved today!)\n\nI have -no had- the laziest, derpiest cat. Last fall the vet said she was overweight. I felt guilty, because I realized I\u2019d been treating my cat kind of like an accessory- something to give life to my small apartment without me having to do much work. I always thought how lucky I was to have a cat that didn\u2019t walk on counters, or knock things off shelves, or really play much at all. She just wanted to be petted and fed. \n\nBut after hearing that the vet couldn\u2019t even get a proper X-ray for my chonker, I got more invested in making sure she moved around more. I got her a food ball (I put her daily portion in it and she has to chase it around for it to dispense the kibble). I noticed she started finding hair ties and twist ties and drowning them in her water dish. She would announce her victory with a loooooooooong loud meow that I\u2019d never heard before! AND, I didn\u2019t know that feeding my cat at the same time every day would activate a schedule for her that starts every morning: cuddle time 1, play time, zoomies time, litter box time, food ball time, nap time, cuddle time 2, nap time, play time, zoomies all night. \n\nNow we have an actual friendship. If I\u2019m sad and don\u2019t have energy to find her favorite hair tie for her, she figures out we\u2019re off schedule and finds one for me. Makes little chirps until I play. She \u201ctalks back\u201d to me all the time. I swear we have actual conversations. Cutest roommate ever. \n\nTLDR: I used to keep a bread loaf as a pet, until I committed to giving her more attention. Now she\u2019s a cat.\n\nEdit:\n##cat tax: meet Valentine\n\nLast year-\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1KSnBfM.jpg\n\nThis year-\nhttps://i.imgur.com/MMqJxUk.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0Lds3KX.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/372lZts.jpg\n\nI promise I am careful and mindful about the hair ties and twist ties!!!\n\n\nI only put one out at a time, and they are those thicker, kind of flat ones that have the rubber backing that can be used as headbands. I don\u2019t use them myself\u2014 she goes bonkers for those. \n\nI keep any twist ties in a box on a shelf for her. I like to connect a few together so it\u2019s more 3D and can\u2019t easily get lost under the couch or something. When I notice she\u2019s bored with them, I put them back. Maybe it\u2019s odd to have a special box of twist ties?\n\nI can\u2019t get her to play with string, or traditional toys. It\u2019s like she\u2019s immune to catnip. \n\n\nI never worry about her eating her ties or other foreign objects because she only likes *her* food. Not even people food. Could not care less when I open a can of tuna. She only likes the exact same, semi-pricey brand of dry food. She doesn\u2019t even like Temptations or wet food! One time I put fancy feast in a fancy glass goblet like in the commercial and she gave me the most unenthusiastic look, lol, before scratching at the floor. Ruuuude\n\nSo I don\u2019t worry too much about her chewing on her hair ties or twist ties. She just likes to bat them around until finally carrying it over to her water dish and dropping it in. And for this reason, she has two water dishes- one for drinking and one for playing in and drowning her \u201cprey.\u201d",

            "Thanks for this. It\u2019s helped jolt me out of a toxic spiral I was going down, but I\u2019ve been coming out of only recently (through an epiphany related to your post).\nI moved home the week before uk lockdown with my dog, Tintin. I\u2019ve had him since a pup (16 weeks) and for the first three years we lived in my flat, just him and me, in london. He was my shadow and he never left my side, and maybe in hindsight I\u2019d started taking him for granted, even sometimes wishing he\u2019d be a little more independent (\u2018need to come to the toilet with me buddy?\u2019). When we got home, within about a week, he\u2019d got super attached to my mum and tbh she became his preferred person. He\u2019d run to her in the morning as soon as he could (dad said no to him sleeping in their room), he\u2019d go insane as soon as she came back in from anywhere. He now only spends time with her during the day, apart from when I walk him, and his feelings have seemed to lessen towards me (I don\u2019t get that much excitement when I return home, not like I used to). Not gonna lie, I took it quite badly. I\u2019d never be mean to him, that\u2019s just crazy and stupid, but I became a little indifferent to him, like why make the effort with him. I took it personally which I now realise is ridiculous. \nRecently I realised that I need to stop thinking of him like a human, he\u2019s not my partner who\u2019s chosen another family member over me, he\u2019s a dog and his decision making is different to ours.

            "The real LPT is understand how your pet and human relationships were bred to make them happy. Dogs are task driven and have a symbiotic relationship: dogs do (task they were bred for) they receive food. Give tasks to your dogs and they will be happy. Cats dont need people for food, they are more companionship driven. Respect your cats space and independence and respond to their social queues and they will be happy. You should not humanize animals but you can still love them for their species and personalities.",

            "People always tell me that cats are mean by nature, or that you need the right breed or something to have a nice cat. I always respond telling them that it's 100% how you raise them and treat them daily. Everyone who has met my cat absolutely adores how kind and social he is, but it's because of the environment that I create for him that he feels so comfortable.\n\nCat tips:\n\n**1.** Keep water and food far from each other, otherwise they will think the water is contaminated and not drink much.\n\n**2.** Use a wide food bowl. Cats are less likely to enjoy eating when their food bowl pushes their whiskers back, and may not eat proper amounts when doing so.\n\n**3.** Put them on a proper diet. The right food matters just as much as proportions. Adult cats need anywhere from 2/3 of a cup to 1 cup of food a day, depending on their current size and age. Leaving a full food bowl at all times promotes over-eating which leads to obesity.\n\n**4.** Put their litter box somewhere close to a social area/not in the basement. It seems counter-intuitive because no one wants the smell, but even if it's just in the next room, your cat won't feel alienated or feel like it's a hassle to do the do. Walking up or down stairs every time they gotta go adds a small amount of stress to an everyday task, which adds up when talking about quality of life.\n\n**5.** Brush and play. Grooming is the one way animals can physically show their love; it's one of their languages. Removing the excess fur means less hairballs (if ever an issue) and cleaner furniture. Play is, well, play. They need exercise, and it'll help against the pesky 3am flights down the hallway. You don't need expensive cat toys, just cut some string or rope and frill the end. They'll love it.\n\n**TL;DR:** Keep water and food seperate, use a wide food bowl, keep them on a portioned diet, make the litter box easily accessible (no stairs per trip), grab a brush for grooming, and play play play!",

I've had him 10 years, last year he laid on a vets table while 2 nurses & a doctor did an echocardiagram on him for 40 minutes, he was unrestrained, with me sitting at his head patting him & telling him he was a good boy the only restraint.

Instead, tell them one or two of your mother's favorite colors, or tell them to use their own judgment. Chances are they have 100 of some little known but beautiful flower lying around and no chance to use it because people are specifying only roses all the time.\n\n2 - order EARLY! They might still take your order the day before, but it will be cobbled together out of \"what's left\" materials wise - if you order at least 3 days before, they will likely go to the flower market with your design in mind and buy enough flowers to make it happen.\n\n3 - ask to see what else you can bundle with it to make it special, florists often sell little gift items with the flowers, maybe a live potted plant, or a glass terrarium arrangement, or something different and cool that you never would have thought of like personalized handmade jewelry. You might be able to get an extra good deal on this stuff as it's hard to move this time of year because everyone just wants flowers.",

            "Finally a LPT topic I can really chime in on. So my parents ran a local florist for about 5 years. They took orders from all of the major flower wire services. So this is 100% correct. When you order from the big sites, what happens is they will choose a local florist based on a number of factors and then wire that order to the local florist with the name and general requirements of the arrangement (which the local florist then needs to look up). That local florist has to pay a fee to the wire service so it costs them more and they have to thus charge more. And that florist may not have the exact flowers, container, accessories, etc to make the arrangement exactly as pictured. Thus you will see a message in the disclosure that the arrangement might not match perfectly to the image online.  \n\nIf you see something you like, it's better to then go to the local florist and place the order directly. It will often cost somewhat less and you can customize it to your desire. Like an arrangement but don't like the pictured vase or container? Talk to the florist directly, they can make it how you want.",

            "Former florist: this is true, also find the street address for the florist before you call. Sometimes a \u201clocal\u201d florist is an order collector that will still call the order out. \nYour best bet for getting the most bang for your buck, in my experience over several shops, is to give them your price range and tell them \u201cdesigner\u2019s choice.\u201d If you want something big and showy or small and compact, bright or pastel add that. They have the most creative freedom and you often end up with more money in the arrangement that way because there is a stray flower that looks great in your vase. \nThe closer to the holiday, the higher the minimum order is going to be. The shop is already backed up with orders, but if you call and say that you want to spend $100 and it can be delivered any day before Sunday? You will likely have no trouble placing an order. \nThe shops that I have worked at that have needed to substitute flowers in an order always either put more expensive flowers in or used more flowers of an equal price. We know that it is not the same as the picture, but we want the customer to be happy with it! We worked really hard to make sure that the main flowers were always correct (3 purple roses, etc.). Unless specified, the \u201cfeel\u201d of the arrangement should be the same. \nRoses are always counted many times before leaving. By the designer, by the owner of the shop, and by the delivery driver. (In a good shop.)\n",
            "Serious question:  If the local floral shop doesn't have the proper inventory to produce the bouquet requested, why don't they just deny the order?\n\nMy thinking would be that is the better business tactic rather than putting out a sub-par product and then trying to blame it on the national flower service.\n\nI've had a couple friends order a high price bouquet before online, only to be extremely disappointed with completely different flowers that were a day or two away from dead.  When one friend called up the shop that fulfilled the request they basically told him that he should have ordered directly from them because they didn't have the proper flowers and they gave him what they had left.  When he asked why they just didn't deny the order if they couldn't fulfill it, they said that they wouldn't get any money off of it that way.  To me that's just poor customer service on the flower shop's side.  Essentially it seemed they were ok with giving him a shit product because they were mad he didn't order directly from them.  It's not the national flower service's fault that the local company gave him a crap product.  They placed an order, the local flower shop is the one that changed it.",

It's called \"Vacation Rules\" which basically boils down to \"If you have a bad time on vacation, it's your own fault\" or \"no getting bent out of shape over other people's preferences\". While some of our family really like to stay in the same airbnb together, my husband and I like our own space and always get a hotel. No big. Some people consider one place or event the highlight of their trip while others really don't care. Mom and the aunts wanted to go see Pompeii, while our cousin peaced out by the pool all day. We also usually have one or two planned \"together\" days where we go on a day trip or to some specific site. On those days, to avoid having too many chefs in the kitchen, we have one or two designated leaders who have all the info on travel, tickets, etc. This helps the rest of the group relax and not worry about stuff.\n\nWe love being together, but we don't need to be in each other's company all day, every day. We usually meet up for dinner, and everyone is so excited to share what they did that day. They have pictures and funny stories, and perhaps some tips for a group that is about to do the same thing later. It's the best system, and we always have a family meeting before hand to re-enforce vacation rules.\n\nEdit: Silver!?! You folks are crazy!....I like that....",

She was all for it at the time, but once we'd been in the UK for a few days she was extremely cranky about almost everything and was NOT going to sit on a train for a four hour round trip, etc. She and the other girl were actually surprised when I announced I was going to Liverpool anyway (\"All by yourself?!\") and it was probably the second highlight of my trip.

            "This is a skill I had to learn \u2014 the very very hard way \u2014 as a reporter for a radio station. Hearing yourself step on a good quote from an interviewee is agonizing, and renders the audio unusable. When I started consciously waiting for people to finish, and waiting longer than is socially normal, I quickly discovered that people will talk more, and, frequently, start talking more candidly, when I gave them an almost uncomfortable amount of space to fill. It was an incredible lesson for my professional career as a journalist, but also an amazing skill to develop for social interactions that has almost always served me well, and helped me develop more deep connections with people more expeditiously than usual.",
            "Context is key when it comes to this honestly. While generally it is rude to interrupt, it's also rude to talk WAY too much and hog the time, especially without something relevant to say. I'm saying this in a work context, but sometimes your only option is to try and get them to stop by using their name.\n\nLike if Steve just keeps on talking and you know something that changes the direction of conversation entirely (and essentially makes his point meaningless because it's already something that's been solved), then you can try and be like, \"Hey Steve.... Steve...\" And hopefully he stops talking for two seconds so you can address it.\n\nSo when it comes to human conversation and interaction. it all really comes down to context. On a call with a lot of people it's good to keep in mind that you're not the only one there, and it's great if you can ask ONE question and wait for an answer instead of ask 50 and then no one remembers what the first one even was.",

            "One of my favorite qualities in a person is those that can let silence pass without feeling the need to butt in or say something. There\u2019s nothing wrong with letting a silent moment pass while someone gathers their thoughts. It gives that person time and it gives others time to think about what is being said and their response. Many of us use our mouth way too much and our ears too little.",
            "Also, don't interrupt people after you've asked them a question just because they're \"taking too long\" to answer. My boyfriend often takes a while to process things and respond to them. We developed a ritual where if he's taking a bit longer, I just say \"you'll get there.\" I worried it would come off consescending or something but he says it lets him know I'm still listening and that he doesn't have to rush his thought process. He is also easily distracted and fails to listen fully sometimes, so it can serve as an attention grabber to remind him I asked him something. He feels heard and not rushed, and it helps me to be more patient as well.\n\nIt's ok to take time to consider then answer a question. Stop interrupting people before they even get a chance to speak.\n\nOh and stop speaking for people unless they've asked you to or are okay with you doing so. It's not cute.",

Just wait patiently for the thought because it's on its way! \n\nThis has also helped me *tremendously* with my small children. \n\nThis is a good LPT, OP! We all just need to sit back, relax, and listen.",
            "This is really good advice.\n\nLike another commenter said I am super guilty of this because I am trying to show that I\u2019m engaged and understanding, but I can see how it could come off as impatient or rude.  \n\nLearn a little every day :)",

One of them has a stutter that makes it so they sometimes can take several seconds to get through a single word, and the other person is deaf but can read lips so i have to face them to communicate.\n\noften you're tempted to finish someone's sentence for them and that interrupts their train of thought, oftentimes exasperating the stutter. \n\ninstead, you let them finish on their own. dont look away or down at your phone or shift your body weight around like youre impatient. react exactly the same way as you would to someone who is speaking continuously and fluidly.\n\n it can feel weird at first to just keep eye contact like you would in any other conversation, but i promise its not.\n\nas a side note, when speaking to someone who is deaf but able to read lips ive got a couple tips:\n\n1. dont elongate your words, like \"Hellllooooooo, mmmmmyyyy naaaammmee\" it makes it harder to read, because you're not speaking in a normal way\n\n2. DO speak a bit slower and try to enunciate but not in an awkwardly over the top way. just try to not blend your words together or slur too much. speak like you're like at a job interview, neutral tone, neutral accent, clear and concise.\n\n3. and finally, if someone asks you to repeat yourself, rephrase your statement entirely.\n\n\"where do they live?\"\n\n\"im sorry, i didnt catch that, can you repeat yourself?\"\n\n\"what city is john from\"",
            "As someone with ADHD and anxiety, I love this! I often talk too quickly, then get stuck repeating a word when my brain \"lags,\" it's technically a form of stuttering.

I swear it sometimes feels like I'm talking a 3rd grader through how to write a paragraph. But instead it's me, a fully grown adult, just trying to say words.\n\nUnfortunately, I usually panic that whomever I'm speaking to will just try to move on before I can get the words out. I end up talking faster and louder, while communicating less clearly as the seconds keep ticking. With ADHD, sharing a thought that I've already started sharing becomes an impulse, and I will definitely bring it up later on because my brain won't let it go.",

            "This is because different peoples brains work in different ways. Internal processors (typically introverts) think then speak. External processors (normally extroverts) think while talking. The internal processors need the pause, they need the silence, to find the right word. External processors on the other hand keep talking until and correct what they say as the go along. Heres the thing, those external processors find the silent gap really awkward and need to fill the silence - so they talk. This ruins the thought process of the internal processor. Its really hard for an internal processor to interupt to tell the external process to be quiet for a minute so they can think. I find explaining this to people i talk to frequently helps. I also find holding up my hand or saying \"let me finish\" can help too. To me, as an introvert it feels rude but the extrovert on the other hand doesnt mind at all.",

            "LPT for men on receiving compliments:\n\nThank them for the compliment and compliment the compliment (e.g. \"Thank you very much, it is nice of you to notice\" or \"Oh thank you, I appreciate you taking the time to let me know I did a good job\").\n\nPeople often feel uncomfortable when receiving compliments and will either reject the compliment, (e.g. \"Oh, it was nothing\" or \"nah, I look like trash, it's fine\") or will deflect to focus on the negative (e.g. \"Yeah, I normally look like trash, so this is a nice change\"). Both of these options rob the compliment giver of what they were trying to do and ultimately, it discourages future compliments from that person.\n\nPeople often feel uncomfortable just receiving a compliment and acknowledging it - it can feel undeserved or vain or even arrogant. Complimenting the compliment allows you to accept the compliment but also acknowledge their effort so it becomes a shared experience rather than a one-sided one. It let's the person know you appreciated what they said, it validates their comments, and it encourages future compliments be rewarding their pro-social behaviour and removes the awkwardness of just passively accepting the compliment.",

The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.\n\nOnce you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.\n\nHowever \u2013 and this is the important bit \u2013 if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.\n\nTo get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.\n\n(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a \u00a36k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers \u2013 all above the original top end of their budget).\n\nNow the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.\n\nIf the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful \u2013 especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process. Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them.\n\nAnd even if that isn't the case, consider carefully whether you really want to work for a company where there is a culture of lying to you before you've even been hired.",

            "LPT 2.0: always do your research for salary ranges BEFORE you are in an interview. There are plenty of websites out there now that will have salaries (lowest, avg, highest) from the specific company and position that you are applying for. If you are applying for anything other than a minimum wage position, you should already have a number researched and in mind.",
            "I have a question about this, based on my experience. So I\u2019m in a high skill position, $130K+ with specific technical and commercial requirements. I find frequently when I get contacted by recruiters that unless I ask bluntly up front what the salary range is it\u2019s a colossal waste of time. I\u2019ve had numerous people try and head hunt me for a job with my title $50k less than I make in my current job. How do you avoid this and NOT discuss salary until the offer timeframe? That makes no sense to me.",
            "In my experience this would never work, companies usually want to know your figure",
            "I'm sorry OP but there a few areas when it comes to internal decision making where you're misled or give advice based on very high-level stuff.\n\nI'm a Talent Partner / Technical Recruiter / Senior Recruiter whatever you want to call it, who actually sits in the meetings where salary ranges are decided for certain roles. I also negotiate salaries from entry level roles to C-level roles as I'm responsible for hiring entire departments from the top down. From this POV I'd like to point out a few things and shed some light on a few assumptions:\n\n\" As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made \"- That is horrible advice. Both you and the company should make your expectations clear as early as possible. If you're looking for a 6 figure salary but the position is capped at 80k for budget reasons, there is no way you can negotiate your way to 100k+. There are also internal limits due to \"fairness policies\". Most companies will ask you for your salary expectations not to soft lock your salary but to understand if it's worth spending both your time and their time going through the entire process. If you don't know what salary you want and you think the company will screw you over, do your homework. Research the market, ask other people, calculate your expenses and come up with a good number that you're comfortable with. You can ALWAYS negotiate. You can also ask what the range is at the early stages. You don't need to ask in the interview but you can email the recruiter early asking to calibrate expectations.\n\n\" Once you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate. \"- That's fair. But find out this information earlier.\n\n\" company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company. \"- That's not how it works. Employees are called called Human Resources (as opposed to machines or buildings) and it's calculated differently, you don't exactly use ROI to calculate salaries. The **only** \"ROI\" when calculating human resources is based on Program Management and \"the lack of a resource\" can push back the delivery gate which would cost money. It's WAY more up in the air than that, because if salaries really depended on ROIs then the bottom layer of the company would be paid the highest since they're the ones actually generating tangible results, everyone else is just managing resources and can be replaced by a trello board. Salary bands are 90% market rate and 10% competitive strategy. 99.9% companies are not in a position to pay more than the market rate therefore they will try to acquire talent at that price and in exceptional cases pay a little more. Some companies can afford to \"buy out\" people from their jobs and that explains the entire Silicon Valley.\n\n\" If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for. \"- Although this is true on a very high level, often times positions are signed based on levels and not on specific ranges or titles. For example: A department can get 2 junior, 1 staff and 1 senior staff position approved. There are soft caps on these levels and they often depend on market rates based on demand, internal alignments and other policies. There can be hard caps but they differ from company to company. What I'm trying to say is almost nobody sits and goes through the salary range of every single position ahead of time and says: yep, this one is 50-53k / year. More often than not it's something like market starts at 50 and if you find a senior candidate then we can discuss on a case by case basis. If you ask me what the range is I'll tell you that it starts at 50 for a junior candidate and goes up from there. Probably not higher than 60 but it's negotiable.\n\n\" Now the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding.  \"- That is true however there are still some internal benchmarks that need to be respected. Highly specialized positions are not \"uncapped\".\n\n\" Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them. \"- That's an urban myth, I am yet to see a real case scenario of this happening.\n\nOverall, the takeaway should be: Do your homework and calibrate early! Ask around, research the web, there is lots of information out there. Go into the interview knowing your worth in the market and then try to get a little more, if you fail you still got a good deal.\n\nIf you're in software there is a ton of it (for example this archive from Ycombinator: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xIgk7Mw1S5DXTZSbKBgxlsQAn7XGIu7Mfy72lSVHKk/edit#gid=129993618](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xIgk7Mw1S5DXTZSbKBgxlsQAn7XGIu7Mfy72lSVHKk/edit#gid=129993618))",

They are by no means perfect but it removes alot of effort for you and alot of stress.\n\nYour interests do aline far better with them than theirs and the companies and they only get paid if a candidate is successful so they will give advice to improve their own pool of candidates so they are likely to be asked to look again.\n\nOn the flip side anything about the process you tell them will be given to their other candidates so being last is an advantage.\n\nEdit: by recruiters im talking about agency or thrid party recruiters rather than a dedicated in house staff member or team.",

            "I prefer to ask for the range as well, and will often say \"Salary isn't as important to me as culture and fit.\"  That's total bullshit, but it's a good way to frame the conversation because inevitably it will still come back to my expectations for salary.

So all this advice of \"don't tell them how much you expect\" and \"don't tell them how much you were making\" and \"put off talking about salary as late in the process as possible\" and \"ask them what their range is\" never made ANY sense to me. \n\nI'm a geek, I don't have the social skills of an average person, much less someone good at such things, but even I can tell that refusing to answer direct questions about my expectations or trying to force them to tell me things that they don't want to tell me is a conversational *faux pas*, and I'm trying to get these people to hire me. \n\nThe closest I've come to negotiating is settling on a minimum figure that I would accept, and giving them a figure a few percent higher than that. I have always felt that all organizations are trying to pay me as little as I would work for, and were suspicious that I was trying to get all the salary I could manage. But it never felt like a \"negotiation\", as in trading pluses and minuses and settling on a compromise figure in the middle. After asking me what I expected, as most of them did, the next piece of 'negotiation' is the offer letter with the salary figure in it, and that figure might or might not have been mentioned ahead of time.\n\nSo. If someone can provide dialog, actual or typical, of a \"salary negotiation\", I'd be very interested. It's a little late for me to use it myself, but I expect there are others who feel about it as I do. I just have never know how it worked.",

            "As a small Biz owner, we are actively creating new positions for growth - we know what we want in terms of skill set, but we honestly have no clue how much it costs to hire that type of person.

            "My last job in my industry paid my 60k,\n\nI went to an interview for the same job at a competitor, and they paid double what I was earning. Don\u2019t under value yourself because the company you work for will do their best to screw you.",
            "This got me an extra $15,000 when I was hired last year. When a recruiter asks me what I expect, I tell them I don\u2019t give a number on principal, but what is the range and if the number matches up with what I am looking for, we can continue the process.",
            "To be honest this isn't a very useful tip. The last thing any person negottiating a salary should ever do is discuss their range with the other person. That goes for both sides. You never want to tell someone the absolute limit of what you will accept on either side. It undermines our own negotiating power on anything more favorable when they know that you're willing to concede more.\n\nIf they are silly enough to tell you more power to you but I think you'll find most will not answer the question",
            "I don\u2019t think any of this is a good idea for executive positions.  You are never going to get a \u2018range\u2019 because there is always flexibility there.

Then, know what you bring to the table as well as what the company has to offer.. culture, etc.      ideally, they want you as bad as you want them, they pay a lot and everyone feels good about it.

            "As a prior personnel/development/training manager, I can confirm that the OP's statement is essentially true. I would like to add that some companies like to start employees in the \"middle\" of the chosen salary range, as they feel this gives the incoming employee time to grow within the position hired for. If you're being hired near the top of the range, it can suggest you won't be in that position for very long. This can be great IF they have opportunity for upwards mobility, but not so great if they expect you to fill a role for several years+. So, therefore, another question that you should ask is: how are advancement opportunities? How long do you see me in the current role? What other opportunities will be available to me once I've mastered this role (something along those lines)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, knowing where they want to start you is just additional valuable information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this largely depends upon how much the company wants you to be part of their team (as the OP stated).",

Which came in at a lot less than I was currently earning and another reason to say no and meant I'd found out their range.\n\nI thanked them for their time and left.",
            "[deleted]",
            "First, research what your anticipated range should be. If the market range is $50,000-$65,000 they probably will not pay you $85,000.  \n\nAlso, understand your position in the negotiations. They are in the position of power. Unless you are being recruited for a highly demanded field such as engineering or CS, they probably have the upper hand. Knowing that, don\u2019t be belligerent if you really want the job. There are more of you out there wanting this job.",
            "Good information. Here's my own story indicating this works. The last time I was applying for jobs, I was still working, but was not happy with my salary. I found a job I really liked, and asked them the salary range. Apparently the max salary would be 75k. I told them that wouldn't work for me, and due to my qualifications, I wouldn't consider anything less than 95k. The next day they told me they managed to convince upper management to make 95k work, and offered me the job. Depending on the company and how badly they want you, more money can always be found.",
            "I think there are many interesting points that work some of the time, but this is not the \u201crule\u201d by any means.\n\nExample 1: I often have to hire for whole new teams (4-5 positions). While yes I\u2019ve been given a budget for the team (say $500k of total salary), it is my discretion to divvy that out as I see fit. So if I haven\u2019t found my \u201csenior\u201d person yet who will command the highest salary, it would be risky for me to tell every candidate \u201cwe can hire on average $100k per person\u201d. Then they would all want $100k and I wouldn\u2019t have enough budget for my highest person. \n\nExample 2: Ranges are NOT the budget. Ranges is what HR/Recruiting THINK the job profile you are hiring for are worth. While yes finance has to reserve the top side of the range to be cautious, every dollar spent somewhere, takes a dollar from somewhere else. So if a range is $60k-$80k, if I hire someone at $60, I have $20 to spend somewhere else. If I find a candidate who demands 80, and I hire them, I\u2019ve used up anything else I have. \n\n\nBottom line: asking for ranges is silly. Know what you are worth. If that particular job doesn\u2019t offer you that, move on.  If you can\u2019t find any job that matches what you think you are worth, you have overvalued yourself.",
            "In Canada, companies over 50 employees are legally obligated to have salary ranges per position for reason of pay equality. They have to have one. Ask for it!",
            "Threads like these always remind me of how scary Reddit really can be.\n\nLet me start by stating that I am in the business of hiring, I am US based, and I\u2019ve hired internally/externally over 250 people in the past 6 years. I am not claiming to be an expert but I want to shed some light on this topic.\n\nFirst ALWAYS know if you\u2019re talking to an internal recruiter or external recruiter. \n\nInternal Recruiters, individuals who are employed by the company\u2019s HR, have almost no incentive to lowball you. In most states, companies are required to pay you based on what\u2019s fair in the market. I would still ask them for a range.\n\nExternal recruiters you need to know what type of role they are recruiting for.\n\n- If it\u2019s a contract role, MOST external recruiters are incentivized to lowball you. If the bill rate is 80 and they offer you 60, 20 goes to the recruiter\u2019s COMPANY. I think a lot of people get the misconception that Recruiters get that whole 20/hour.... some of that goes to overhead of the company. If the company you\u2019re contracting through provides benefits, you can count on them taking more of the bill rate. Bigger recruiting companies can afford to work with lower margins. Your recruiter taking anywhere from 8-15% of the bill rate is pretty reasonable.\n\n- if it\u2019s a direct placement, your recruiter is incentivized to get you the highest salary possible because the company is likely paying them a percentage based off your salary. There are instances where the external company is retained and they have a flat placement fee. Also, this doesn\u2019t apply to small companies because small companies are the Wild West and do whatever the hell they want.\n\n\nUnderstand the situation. Are you in a new emerging field? Then the market probably isn\u2019t established yet and the company is trying to figure out what the fuck to pay you. Is the company old school? Some bigger companies are just now buying into the idea of DevOps, Data Scientists, Social Media managers etc. They are likely to be basing it off what they think is similar ( like data analysts, marketing professionals, etc). I would recommend being upfront about your salary expectations and DON\u2019T LOWBALL YOURSELF. It\u2019s very, very unlikely a company will hang up on you because your salary expectation is too high. They will likely try to learn more about why you expect that (are other companies offering this?) and likely will try to get you to interview to prove to managers you are worth that money. Before progressing too far in interviews (2nd Round) I would reconfirm with your contact that your salary expectation is doable.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people say research market trends and know what your role is paying. I don\u2019t really have an opinion on this but let me say that the market data for my role in my area is 30% below what I make... and I do not think I\u2019m overpaid at all. Just be careful what market data you\u2019re looking at and understand how that data was compiled.\n\nOverall, I would just say be honest and upfront about what you\u2019re expecting and what you think is fair. Also, for any internal moves for the company, ALWAYS ASK FOR A PAYBUMP unless it\u2019s an obvious downgrade in workload. Even if you have to say \u201cI\u2019m really interested, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a pay increase involved\u201d. ALWAYS ALWAYS, PLEASE ALWAYS ASK FOR THIS UPFRONT BEFORE TAKING ON A NEW ROLE OR MORE RESPONSIBILITY.",
            "The last time I looked for a job, I told them a figure that was 20% more than I thought I should get. They told me that they couldn't afford to pay that, and then I asked them what specific metrics I would have to meet in order to get to my goal. They gave me the metrics, I got them in writing, I met them in three months and then I got the money.\n\n3 months later they made me a team lead, and so in effect I doubled my salary within the first year.\n\n\nSo I would suggest that they ask you for a figure first, give him an unrealistically high number, and then laugh. That lets them know that you're ready to negotiate, it sets the initial \"anchor\" number high, and it also shows you have a sense of humor and realistic expectations.",
            "OTOH, they might just have an HR department stuck in the middle ages.  I was running the hiring committee for a new position on our team at my last job and HR would NOT tell me what the range was.  Claimed they wouldn't know until we picked a candidate and they put that person's info into a \"very complicated formula\".  So goddamn embarrassing.",
            "I always defer discussion to as late as possible.

A better question is to lie back to them, after they tell you're out of range: \"Hey, I'm thinking of moving to eastern bumfuck, where my COL will be lower. Is this a remote opportunity? If so, does the salary range change based on where you live?\" If so, get them to commit to the salary range for East Bumfuck, and then reverse engineer it to know the salary range for your city.\n\nDo market research, contribute real numbers to blind, glassdoor, etc. And always state a salary goal 20% higher than the highest salary you can imagine for your region.",

It'd probably *feel* better to keep my pants on the cleaner side with more frequent laundry days.\n\nAlso, *morning*?  I woke up after noon, today.  Us night folks don't feel better if we wake up in the morning.  8 hours is 8 hours, whether sleep or work, and society is the party that could use some respect for night workers and people with perception issues (daylight and heat cause me extreme discomfort).\n\nAll that being said, this is definitely better advice than not.

In the moment of panic, I went to the bathroom, I realise too it probably wasn\u2019t the best space to go.\n\nI was at Westfield pretty late writing my thesis paper \\~23:00, and after I got up to leave, I noticed the only other guy in the area leave as well. Typically I'm the only left because I stay back past dinner and had thought he would naturally just leave when all the restaurants closed (Westfield closed at midnight, and all shops were closed.) I got some creepy vibes from him so I walked some loops from L3 to L1 and he was still following me. I went to the bathroom to calm myself, spent about 20mins there and called an uber (normally I walk home because it's pretty safe at night, but I felt if I left the centre where there were no cameras it would be safer to catch a ride). When I came out, I thought I must've spent long enough in there, and he had left but he was sitting on a bench obscured by the elevators ahead. I walked past him as discreetly as possible, towards the parking lot but he got up and followed me too. So I went back round to the supermarket, the only place I knew would still be open and walked around aimlessly until I saw a couple walk in for some late-night grocery shopping. I was afraid to inconvenience them but ended up asking if they could accompany me whilst I waited. I explained I'd been followed and didn't feel safe, and if they could walk with me to the car park where my uber would arrive. They agreed, and once it came, I thanked them and yeeted out of there.\n\nIf I had walked home alone maybe something bad could have happened to me, maybe not. All I know is that I didn't feel safe. I don't know who needs to hear this but don't let politeness or fear of inconveniencing someone - it could be stranger, adult, or friend, to stop you from seeking help.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for your awards, advice and sharing your stories, I\u2019m really overwhelmed how many of you have found this useful. Of course, equally amazed and grateful to know how many of you wouldn\u2019t hesitate to help someone out.\n\nAddressing some comments: Some have mentioned they've encountered similar situations and received no help from the person they asked, I understand the embarrassment that may be felt, but it's alright to ask another person. You know you are more likely to be in danger than you are a danger to others.\n\nNot American, so I wouldn't have protective equipment as it's not legal for the general public to carry them; I didn\u2019t confront them because I didn\u2019t know how they would react and could possibly incite them to harm me; no crime happened so I didn\u2019t think of calling the police, but now I know if the police are willing to escort, it\u2019s valid to be escorted.

It keeps you in a brightly lit area and they have places you can wait safely. They can also call the police and provide a physical address, as well as usually have cameras. \n\nIf you are alone and feel unsafe, get on the phone with someone you know if you don\u2019t want to call the cops. If they don\u2019t answer, leave a voicemail with descriptions and locations and times. Getting information to others is important if you are not in a safe location. Then call authorities or someone else.\n\nI have rules with friends; a call after 10 gets picked up like an emergency. If I don\u2019t answer the first one, call again immediately and I will because i know you need my help. Text me details and I will come and get you as soon as I have pants on. \n\nSet up emergency contacts as well.

            "My university actually had a service for this! If you felt uncomfortable walking alone to your vehicle at night (I mean during the day too, but normally campus is crowded enough during the day that the service isn't needed) you can call a number and two people will escort you (a guy and a girl, they work in pairs so no creeps can ever use the system to harm callers) to your dorm or your car.\n\nI never had to use it because I was never on campus for classes late enough that it wasn't still crowded. But it was really nice to know the service was there if I ever needed it! \n\nThere are also blue light boxes all around campus that immediately put you in touch with the campus police; which are actual police, we have our own tiny police department. The reason this was implemented is because police who didn't frequently visit the campus would get lost and it was seriously delaying response times! So we have several county police that are basically confined to patrolling and responding to calls on the campus who know the campus inside and out. You can also call the campus police on your cell phone but it's a special number to make sure you get campus police who can respond instantly as opposed to 911 for typical county police who will probably get lost on campus and show up 45 minutes late.",

            "I have had to do this before and I know other girls who have as well. It sucks to have to have a plan incase you are followed. I was in a grocery store with my 2 year old daughter and I noticed this guy several times while shopping. He looked like a creep so I just thought he stuck out to me because of this. Then I went to check out and I noticed him again. He was standing by the exit like he was waiting for someone. As I was checking out he walked out of the store. When I got outside he was parked in front of the store. He looped around the parking lot and just sat there near my car. I was pretty freaked out at this point. I put my daughter in the car and got my groceries in there as fast as I could. I didn\u2019t even return my cart because I couldn\u2019t walk away from my car with my child in it. He followed me out of the parking lot snd I really started feeling scared. I thought maybe I was being paranoid so I made 3 right turns just to confirm. The grocery store was right by my house but I didn\u2019t want this dude to know where I lived so I went to a gas station that was super busy. I parked next to a car that had 2 guys and a girl in the car and told them right away what was going on. The dude had pulled into the gas station too but he parked at the other end of the parking lot. He got out and just waited by the doors which were near where I parked. At that point I got angry and I was scared for my child so I made a scene. I yelled at him to stop following me. He denied it of course but the 2 men beside me backed me up and told him they weren\u2019t leaving my side until he was gone. He ran back to his car and left. I stayed at the gas station a little longer because he kept driving past. After a little bit I didn\u2019t see him anymore so I left. I lived in gaited apartments at the time so I went home and called the security people to keep an eye out. Thankfully that was the end of it.

Some real sketchy guy came in (carrying a beat-up backpack, disheveled, odor of cigs and liquor in the morning) and immediately asked to use the bathroom. Our bathroom is for employees only, so that's what I told him. He made a grumpy face and walked off to \"browse\".

This customer wasn't a regular but he'd been in the store a few times and I recognized him.   \n\n\nI asked quietly if he could stay in the store another few minutes after he made his purchase until my coworker returned.

            "I got two stories on this topic:\n\nFirst is my mom had a talent for being stalked. Basically, she lived in San Francisco, which has a healthy dose of crazy people. If you didn't know, DON'T STARE AT CRAZY PEOPLE and avoid eye contact. You don't know what they're thinking or how they tick, and when you do this, you're simply calling attention to yourself, so they might fixate on you. Mind you, this isn't to say crazy people are downright dangerous (most tend to be more of a danger to themselves), but yeah, you still don't want someone with an incomprehensible thought process interacting with you, no?\n\nMy mom was really bad about following this rule and would constantly stare. Good job, Mom. Sure enough, she'd end up followed by them. Might also make it worse that she was considered fairly attractive, but no idea on that front or if that played a role, just speculating possible reasons why she was a magnet for crazies.\n\nOne story I remember is some guy she looked at a little too long began following her around with a plastic toy police badge, showing it to her and saying \"Highway Patrol.\" She always told the story like she'd walk through town and just occassionally hear \"highway patrol\" behind her. She finally went to sit in the subway, thought she was finally away from him, then suddenly his hand reached down from above, the badge was in her face and he said \"Highway patrol,\" as if he was sat in the seats behind her.\n\nTwo tall black dudes sitting nearby noticed this and one said \"Lady, I don't think he's playing with a full deck of cards.\" She said she knew and she was being followed and asked for help. When she went to get off the subway train, these two large dudes stood at the doors, pretending to \"unknowingly\" block the guy from getting off. My mom remembers the car pulling away as he jumped around frantically and said \"highway patrol,\" holding the badge up in the air.\n\nSo yeah, these dudes didn't know my mom, barely knew the situation, but the moment they noticed something was off, they were more than willing to help.\n\n\n**Second story** is actually myself. I have noticed, and I can't really explain it, but when a guy seems creepy in the sense like he seems incapable of controlling himself, it's like a flip switches, I'm on the \"defensive\" and I'm just keeping an eye on him, ready to jump him if he tries anything.\n\nBest example of this is I once went grocery shopping with my old roommate and his girlfriend. Some strange guy thought she was the hottest thing ever and couldn't stop staring at her ass. I mean full-on staring, licking his lips and standing behind her staring down when he could. Did NOT seem in control of himself or his urges.\n\n*SOMEHOW* - as if this were some fucking comedy sketch or something - neither of them noticed something was off with this guy. Both of them bumped into him, smiled and apologized at some point during the shopping trip. Yeah guys, you're bumping into him because he's absolutely not keeping his distance from her; his distance to you isn't normal, no shit you turn around and omg sorry you're bumping into him!\n\nI spent that entire grocery store trip just glaring at this guy and watching him the whole time like I was a fucking guard dog or something. I cannot explain this; this wasn't really a conscious decision or anything, it was like some switch flipped and I was in a different \"mode.\" I was ready to shout and scare him off or throw a couple punches if he tried to grab at her or something.\n\nI specifically remember at the end of the trip, she commented I didn't buy much and I'll be sorry later in the week when I have to make another trip. Yeah, I didn't buy much cause I was heavily distracted, and somehow they never noticed. Like wtf.\n\nPoint is though that I doubt I'm the only one that does this when I spot someone acting creepy. I would bet money certain guys will do this \"automatically,\" so on top of the example above with people generally being good samaritans and eager to help when they notice a problem, I *also* think some other people have a friggin' guard dog mode with creeps for some damned reason, and they'll just help by default.",

We had planned to give the boy a tip but the men said our tip wasn\u2019t enough and got menacing. We said we didn\u2019t have any cash, so they said they\u2019d take us to the bank. As we walked, I saw a middle aged couple - definitely tourists, and the husband was over 6 feet tall. I went over to them when the men weren\u2019t looking and told them our situation, luckily they were incredibly nice and basically shepherded us away from the men - the husband actually had to yell at them to go away. \n\nScary situation and definitely a learning experience. I think the fact that the couple was older and physically larger than the men helped a ton. Definitely don\u2019t feel embarrassed or shy  if you\u2019re ever in a situation like this, your safety is so much more important.",
            "\n\nI think that doubling back from unsafe to safe places and asking strangers for help can work and is a great LPT, here are some extras from someone who deals with the worst case scenarios of these professionally.\n\n- Stay calm, stay alert, stay safe\n- Keep looking for large groups of people, preferably \u201cprofessionals\u201d these are more likely to help you.\n- Phone the police if out of earshot, explain you can see someone following you and it\u2019s concerning you.\n- If within earshot you need to be careful that the distance between you isn\u2019t closing in an area that\u2019s unsafe, if it is ring 999 and run! Make noise, draw attention, if their intentions are honest they will stop and stare. If not they will disappear quickly!\n- If you don\u2019t want to phone the police then your options are two fold;\n- 1 phone a friend, as soon as they answer just say hey are you and all the guys still picking me up from and name somewhere real close. Predators know their locations.\n- 2 begin videoing them as you move towards a safe location. Keep in mind the distance between you. Easy way to do this is to pretend to take a Snapchat or video call someone.\n- Don\u2019t go into an enclosed area, use main thoroughfares and keep an eye on CCTV most of these shops are manned 24/7 and someone can see you.\n- Gather details about the person if possible, these can be reported to the police later.\n- Don\u2019t go home straight away if you live alone. Go somewhere busy, doesn\u2019t have to be a police station, somewhere busy - the cops might be all out or otherwise occupied - go somewhere where you can see professionals working.\n\nUsually these situations are just about making it not worthwhile for the predator. Just like animals in the wild will keep running away, the predator goes for the easy prey. It\u2019s not a nice analogy but if it stops one incident like this then I\u2019ll be glad I posted.\n\nI\u2019m based in the UK so these may vary slightly elsewhere in the world.",
            "This reminds me of the Chinese lady who was being followed... she went up to a YouTuber who was streaming and pretended to know them, she acted as if they were waiting for her.  \nThe youtubers girlfriend could tell something was up and went along with it, the streamer thought it was all fun. When the creeper left the random girl started crying.  \nTrust people in times of need, most people mean well.",

            "I've been on the other side of this situation.\n\nI was taking out the trash where the bin was outside my building. It was pretty late in the evening. Maybe 9pm and this couple approached me. A man and a woman. The woman mentioned she didn't have her key and asked if I could let her in. I was hesitant because I didn't recognize them. But tbh, I didn't know any of my neighbors. But they also looked a bit off. I said sure without thinking. \n\nThey followed me back to the front door with the woman closer to me and the guy behind us. Then the woman whispered to me \"I don't know this guy\". At that point I was so confused. She then flashed her keys showing me she had them all along. \n\nAt the door she asked that we go in together and to not let this guy in. All this happened so fast and tbh I didn't trust anyone at this point. She let herself in and closed the door behind her leaving me and the guy alone outside. \n\nAt this point it all clicked for me. That they weren't a couple as I assumed. I started questioning the guy and he made some excuses. But I wouldn't let him in and he eventually just walked away. \n\nI went into the building looking for the woman to ask what was going on. But she disappeared. Probably ran into her apartment when she left us. \n\nWhen I got back into my apartment I looked over my balcony and saw the guy walking around the building. He would leave and come back. Tried to follow a few people into the building unsuccessfully. This went on until 4am when I finally decided to give up and go to sleep.\n\nI called the police maybe 5 times that night explaining the whole situation. Asking them to send someone out. But they wouldn't. Saying this guy hasn't done anything illegal. So messed up. \n\nThis all happened in Sweden where I was living at the time. It was actually my last day in the country as I was flying out and moving to London.\n\nThe reason why I'm saying all this is, if you need help please tell someone that from the beginning. I was so confused and luckily it turned out well.",

We should teach children that if they are ever in a difficult or problematic situation, they should always immediately approach a stranger, (but refuse anyone that approaches them).\n\nSame for adults.  99.99% of all strangers will be helpful.

            "This reminds me of when I was in Barcelona on my way to catch a flight to Italy. I know simple phrases in Spanish like how to order food and ask where the washroom is. So on my flight date I decide to take the metro, got off on a stop close to the airport. Now if you've been to Barcelona you'll notice cabs are everywhere so I thought it'd be easy enough to taxi the rest of the way. I got off the subway and not a single taxi in sight. I panicked. Found a middle aged couple walking and quickly asked \"donde esta la taxi?!\" and \"aeropuerto!\" They noticed how bad my Spanish was instantly and gave me hand signals of 2nd left down that road behind you. I start sprinting and next thing I know I hear them shouting back at me. I turn around to see if I dropped something and they had actually hailed a cab that had just turned onto our street.

            "I devoured books as a kid, but would get pretty bad motion sickness if I tried to read in the car, which I always attempted on road trips anyway, I would read until I would get sick and had to stop.\n\nOne day I read that motion sickness is caused by a disconnect between the messages that your ears and eyes are sending to your brain. Your eyes (looking at the page or car interior) are telling your brain that you\u2019re still, but your ears (either through sound or equilibrium or a mix of the two) are telling your brain that you\u2019re moving. Your brain interprets the disconnect as a side effect of poisoning and makes you feel sick so you\u2019ll vomit it out. (IIRC, this was ~20 years ago in middle school so I apologize if the science is not 100% accurate)\n\nSo I started thinking \u201cI\u2019m moving\u201d to myself every few lines of whatever book I was reading and basically never got motion sick again. \n\nAnother thing that can help you recover from motion sickness more quickly is looking out of the front windshield at the horizon for a few minutes vs the side windows. And definitely don\u2019t close your eyes.\n\nEDIT - obligatory \u201cwow this blew up!\u201d and \u201cthanks for the awards!\u201d \n\nTo the naysayers idk what to tell you other than it works for me. I also learned to put myself to sleep quickly as a kid by repeating \u201cI\u2019m sleeping\u201d in my head over and over, I found out a few weeks ago in a r/todayilearned post that the Navy uses similar methods to help fighter pilots fall asleep in less than 2 minutes. \n\nTo the people saying \u201cclose your eyes and go to sleep\u201d I feel like sleeping is very different than closing your eyes, obviously you can\u2019t get seasick if you\u2019re literally unconscious. Closing my eyes always made me feel more sick, but I sleep like a baby in the car. If closing your eyes works for you, go for it!",

Anyway, the last time I refused they moved me to being a delivery driver. \n\nI had no back brace, no dolly, and no hazard equipment.

            "Had this happen to me a few years ago working retail. I ended up leaving the organization because they were forcing salaried managers to ring register, stock shelves, etc instead of paying normal hourly employees to do those tasks. Then suddenly they were requiring us managers to work 55 hours a week instead of 40 hours.. with no additional compensation, again doing the tasks of hourly associates.. Not of managers. I asked my boss multiple times for things in writing and he would come sit down and talk to me instead. I felt like if being forced out for speaking up. Much to my surprise I found a job very quickly once I started looking that is a much better job.\n\nThis was after they tried to force all employees in the organization to sign an arbitration agreement.. giving up our rights to seek legal action against the company. Instead of we signed the agreement we would be forced to pay $100 out of pocket to have a company chosen by employer to settle the dispute. I opted out myself and all of my employees before leaving the organization.\n\nHowever, about a month ago I got a certified letter in the mail.. from a law firm.. asking me to join a class action lawsuit against my former employer. The class action suit is trying to recover 1 hour of overtime for every shift worked during a 3 years span. Hoping that the case wins because that could be tens of thousands of dollars. This was of course only for people who were smart enough to opt out of the arbitration agreement.\n\nEdit: Since the post has blown up I'll put my former employer on blast: Dick's Sporting Goods\n\nA quick Google search will show you that Dick's Sporting Goods has paid out multiple class action lawsuits for abusing labor laws (I had already been part of one before a few years back totally seperate from this current one).

            "This one is an override:\n\nA different way about it is not to ask them to send it in writing, but you write it yourself asking for clarification. You put the points in an email, and say something like: *per our conversation, my understanding is that this is what you asked. Can you confirm and clarify on the final point, and let me know what timetable you'd like me to be on.*\n\nAnd be sure to add a line expressing your disagreement: *As I said during our conversation, I'm worried that this approach seems counter to the policies and good nature of our organization.*\n\nBecause if you ask them to write it they'll use softer language and leave the nasty bits out. This way you force them to write back and say either \"don't bother with this\" or \"let's talk in person\". If they force the subject to continue and you do end up talking in person again, you write the follow up email again, even if they ask you not to do it in writing anymore. \n\nHopefully putting pressure like this stops the problem, but also, leaving a paper trail like this has you well covered for the disputes and potential lawsuits down the line. You write these emails like you are preparing the documentation to make a judge's job easier next year. Don't embellish, don't pontificate, don't make it long.

Sounds like that person could use my therapy skills XD)\n\nEdit 2: There seems to be a lot of fussing and feuding in the comments, so I'll address that. A university lecturer here in the UK is simply someone who teaches at a university. I know in some other places we are called \"professors\", but that's kind of an inaccurate term, since we are rarely professors in terms of our qualifications. A professorship in terms of the qualification comes after a doctorate. I personally have a doctorate, and thus my title is \"doctor\", but that's entirely different to a MEDICAL doctor (M.D), which I am very much not. At any rate, you don't even need to be a doctor to teach at a university here in the UK, just someone experienced in the field you're teaching in (my doctorate isn't even remotely related to games development, which is what I teach, for example). I wonder whether people are thinking I'm claiming to be a medical doctor or something? My doctorate is in a subject related to medicine, but I am not qualified as a literal MEDICAL DOCTOR, as in someone who can treat you in a hospital and prescribe medication etc. Do I sound that intelligent to you?? Trust me, I'm not XD\n\nMaybe people are confused because a doctorate simply means you've completed a doctorate (often called an \"academic/research degree\") in the UK? Anyone can apply to do one, and universities frequently publish requests for people to apply to undertake them. In my case, I was required to take an MPhil (Master of Philosophy) course before I began the doctorate. That's pretty standard since I didn't have one yet, and someone else was funding my doctorate application.\n\nIf you want more information, shoot me a message and I'll provide proof of this all.

            "If the hinges ARE the same don't get the false sense of security that it has never been flooded though.  That would be a pretty extreme flood to be as high as a lower hinge in the basement.  It's almost as bad if the basement even gets a small amount of moisture.  It's usually easy enough to spot in finished basements from the smell or stains in carpet or drywall.\n\nInstead of looking at hinges, if you suspect the basement has been re-done to hide a previous flood,  go into the furnace room where it's usually left without drywall and typically has no flooring over the concrete floor and you can get a visual of the actual wall studs and concrete condition.  There will be stains on them if it's been flooded.",

It's in your right as a new potential owner and in your best interest.\n\nIf three unrelated, non water blocking (tiles, glossy paint) surfaces indicate moisture, you'll have a problem with that house.\n\nSecondly, observe and ask about the perimeter draining setup (french drains, if there's a well or not). If those are clean, that means it works, if they're new, that means someone fixed it recently and it was a pointy enough problem they did it to sell the place. IF they are clogged, and the moisture meter gives you a dry measurement, you're likely not going that much problem with the place.\n\nMoisture really, really loves to stick around and the usual suspects like the bottom of a door, any wood structural members, concrete walls, will tell the tale, better than hinges.\n\nCAVEAT and disclaimer, this is based on European experience, so there's some places where that crosses over into NA housing, but some where it does not.\n\nFinal tip, if possible, ask or obtain water related information in the area.

Being aware of what these are is useful and being aware of your own values can help identify the towards moves (people going through depression or avoiding things due to anxiety generally start to lose connection with their values and what's important to them).\n\nLearning techniques to practicing unhooking (or cognitive diffusion) can also be a really helpful starting point.",

Combine this with SHIFT as well, and you can e.g. go: CTRL+HOME -> CTRL+SHIFT+END as an alternative to CTRL+A which selects all text.  \n* CTRL+INS is the same as CTRL+C for copying into clipboard and SHIFT+INS does the same as CTRL+V for paste.  \n* Right ALT (ALT GR) + Print Screen button will only take a copy of the current window which is active.  \n\nScroll Lock key is for navigating text editors, before the mouse was really invented/used (imagine a mouse without a scroll wheel, or no mouse at all..!). When scroll lock is on, instead of moving the cursor, you're supposed to be scrolling up and down pages using either the Up and Down arrow keys, or Page Up and Page Down with the cursor being stationary. Turning it off again allows one to move the cursor freely on the current shown amount of lines in the window.  \n\nThere are other command prompt keys which aren't much helpful anymore like the Pause key, meant to pause a running command in the command prompt and CTRL+C will try and terminate the running job (pause isn't necessary for temination though).  \n\nWelp, that about does it for old timer tricks, of those not already mentioned elsewhere in the comments.\n\nEDIT: I feel like num-lock is self explanatory, it toggles whether the numpad writes numbers or [use the alternative keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_keypad#/media/File:Numpad.svg).",

            "My parents did something a little different. School came really naturally to me even though I started a year early. Instead of extra coursework, they put me in speed reading courses, typing classes, improv, sports, music, and art. The a-typical part is that I also learned trade skills. I learned to build with wood, cook, how to fix basic car issues, basic plumbing, yard care, gardening, electrical and other house maintenance. Just a lot of different trade skills, but not to full-skill, just the foundations and basics. You\u2019d be surprised how many free or low-cost intro courses are. If you can\u2019t find any, try talking to local small owned trade businesses: they may take on an apprentice if they don\u2019t have to pay them (volunteer) or if they make a small fee.

I'd quickly get assignments done in between classes that I should have been taking some time at home to do. And the concept of opening a textbook to study was laughable. I didn't even know what cramming for a test was. My first 12 years of school was just play around time.\n\nHigh school did nothing to prepare me for the brick wall that was college. Suddenly I wasn't learning everything I needed to know during classes. I had to devote much more time to getting assignments done. And I struggled until I finally cracked open the expensive books I bought and actually read the materials.\n\nI was cocky and arrogant due to my easy success in high school and university really shot me down and discouraged me.

Would you agree it makes more sense to move them up a grade or to a more advanced class?\n\nMore work in a subject you understand, that isn't used for anything, and doesn't need to be graded since competence has already been demonstrated, is punishment.\n\nFinishing early should be an opportunity for elective activities or more freedom, exactly like it is in the adult world.  Pay for the standard of work performed, and more pay for more work completed, is the way of the adult world.  Since kids don't get paid for extra homework, how exactly does this prepare them for adult life?  Explain how it isn't punishment.\n\nI will tell you what is worse than not knowing how to study: not having been challenged academically.  Wasting a child's gifts and punishing them for having them is the opposite of education and good parenting.",
            "The very best thing you can do for your kid is foster a lovely reading in them. 20 minutes a day; you reading to them, them reading independently, reading together, listening to audiobooks whilst reading along (helpful for dyslexia or kids struggling with literacy) it is literally the best thing you can do. \n\nIf doesn\u2019t have to be fiction or narratives, foster your child\u2019s interests, encourage them to read ANYTHING and ensure you ask them questions about what they are reading too. \n\nThis is perfect study prep and a great routine to get into.",
            "I absolutely disagree with your solution to what is a real problem.\n\nI say this as a teacher and as a gifted student who breezed through high school and developed bad habits in college.\n\nThe solution is teaching them study and time management skills, not pushing work on them.\n\nThere are concrete steps to becoming a good student, things like journaling and scheduling and accountability measures and workspace management and just developing good habits from time spent at it (Seven weeks to make behavior into a habit or something like that?).\n\nIf you as a parent don't know these things, they are available to learn very easily in productivity texts etc.\n\nAnother issue to confront is that many students who have 'bad' study habits have underlying issues like procrastination due to anxiety. They are not simply not doing the work because they have done it fast. They do it fast because they wait til there's only an hour left before the deadline. Or maybe they want to seem cool because of peer pressure and are slacking off work to create an image.\n\nWhatever it is, they need to work through that. If it's a bad enough issue, it might require counseling, like I did.\n\nBut to give students extra work makes them see learning as a punishment and they develop a negative reaction to learning. You also have a situation where they simply stop trying because they feel like there's no way to be 'done' with school work so why try to finish the work?\n\nAnd simply overloading them with work doesn't teach them the study skills they need. They might flounder around and learn them by accident but it's like teaching someone to swim by throwing them into a shark pool. It's not a good idea at all for them to struggle like that without guidance. The instruction in the habits is key.",

There's tons of focus on English and how to construct paragraphs and sentences, which words to use, how to spell, etc. Though most of this ends up teaching kids a very structured way to write that they don'tunderstand. I found both my school-age kids have a lot of difficulty.  They thought that you just write whole paragraphs out of your brain perfectly and were upset when they couldn't accomplish it. \nI pulled out some  of my intro material from college and it's been so helpful.  Teaching them about brainstorming and picking out key words or topics. Then building a correct grammatical sentence around the idea they brainstormed has changed their writing dramatically.   \nIt's been great to see them grow, and learn that they don't suck at writing. They just weren't taught a good way to get ideas into proper writing form.",

Eventually it becomes so challenging to even estimate the exact order of magnitude of an infinitesimally small uncertainty, and increasingly pointless to do so, and it is convenient to just say \"certain.\"\n\nAny challenge to the fact that the earth is round would most likely entail some sort of challenge to fundamental senses in some way, which approaches the maximum possible level of certainty that can be held about reality itself, in any capacity. Your eyes could always be completely misleading you about the world, for example, but we have a high level of justifiable confidence based on experience that generally observations of the world are reliable and not specifically erroneous in that sort of manner. You cannot even be absolutely certain that *you exist* although a challenge to that belief will involve the most fundamental challenge to foundational existence itself- and it is reasonable to suppose that \"I exist\" achieves the absolute highest possible level of certainty that can be assessed merely because there is a thinker to have that thought itself.",

            "Cheers!  I\u2019ve been ruminating on this issue a lot this year, and if interested, I can suggest some things I\u2019ve encountered which gets to the crux of things. A lot of work has been done on the formation of perception and beliefs, why we hold onto them, and how contemporary technology facilitates partisanship over ANY belief or issue.  Here are a couple really accessible sources which discuss various aspects of this situation:\n\nJonathan Haidt\u2019s \u201cThe Righteous Mind\u201d; Daniel Kahneman\u2019s \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d. Both are easy to grasp and inexpensive. \n\nOne of my favorite books is Donald T. Phillips\u2019 \u201cLincoln On Leadership\u201d. Extremely concise, yet immensely informative and easy to understand.  Lincoln said, \u201cIt\u2019s my policy to have no policy.\u201d  He went out and got as much info as he could first hand, which considering the times, might be difficult for many to accomplish.  But, what we could all do more of is validating information instead of assuming it correct. \n\nSearch for the following terms:  echo chambers; belief echoes; endowment effect; anchoring; radicalization; political tribalism. Go down the rabbit holes these terms take you.  Much work has been done here over the last 20 years, but data analysis of networks has shown why beliefs don\u2019t change.  This is really interesting stuff because it shows just how anchored to our worldviews we are, and further, how they can become more extreme in their positions. Remember: no one is born wanting to kill people or exclude others, we radicalize to such positions through social processes. \n\nLastly, there\u2019s a bill sponsored by Rep. Gabbard which seeks to reinstitute the requirement for US media organizations to provide all aspects of an issue when discussing social or political issues; HR 4401. You can view the bill in its entirety at https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4401.

Also look up \"college scholarship <your county>\" for more local results that are likely less popular\n\n- When filling out the FAFSA try to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. It's the most accurate and likely to work. If your parents have divorced/got married within the last 2 years you likely cannot use the tool so make sure to fill it out with your parent and  with the taxes in front of you. You may need to speak with the financial aid office to get advice on the most correct way to complete it when the taxes from 2 years ago are different than your current situation. \n\n- You should include everyone in your household assuming your parents provide at least 50% for them. This includes siblings in college or family members who fit that criteria.\n\n- You are allowed to skip the \"current asset\" questions if you have less than a specific listed amount in your bank. I believe it is $1,500. I recommend skipping this if you are elgibile as putting information could negatively impact your financial aid.\n\n- Schools may have a Professional Judgement process where they can review your information and determine if your financial aid does not match your current situation. For example if your parents both had jobs when filing taxes and one lost their job or the income is vastly different now compared to then, ask the school for help. Not all schools have this in place.",

There are fake companies out there saying you pay them a lump sum, a set number of payments, or a combination of both, that your loans will be forgiven. This is completely false. Not only will your loans not be forgiven, but the money will not go towards even paying your loans off.\n\nAnother scam is companies offering to reduce your payments or consolidate your loans for a fee. Do not deal with these people. All the services they offer for a fee, your student loan servicer will provide at no cost to you. What these companies do is take your money, call in acting like you, and then get you on an income driven repayment plan (IDR). When you think you\u2019re going to get forgiven on these, the Department of Education will look at your financial situation, and they might say that you actually never qualified for an IDR. Then they will tell you that you still owe all this money, but maybe even all right then, since you\u2019ve technically defrauded the government, since you have allowed a third party access to your information and essentially gave them free reign over your account.",

            "Historically, gift giving has been a challenge for me.  I used to hate gifts; giving was stressful and I was often too broke for anything of value, and/or too tired and uninspired for anything of emotional value. Receiving gifts was a lot of attention, and I\u2019m not too materialistic/want for little, and got some emotionally loaded gifts often from family, adding to the \u201cfun\u201d.  And all the expectations and let-down really discouraged me from enjoying it.\n\nAnyway, I started keeping a \u201cgift list\u201d last year on my phone and it\u2019s been *extremely* helpful.  I have ideas for specific people in my life, but also a section for generic (kind of) gifts that are random and cool (like small instruments, slingshot set, comb knifes, knot tying kits).  Sometimes groups I am in discuss good gift ideas and I borrow from those too.  This is a great LPT: I actually feel prepared and enjoy it a bit now.  Eliminating the timing element is a game changer.",

            "The real LPT is when you have that info about a hobby don\u2019t buy them something to do with it without asking first. Although the thought will be there if they are serious about the hobby they will have preferences and if you buy the wrong brand/http of item it may be useless to them. Tell them you would like to get them something for there hobby and discuss what they need, it will be appreciated that you took interest.\n\nFor an example, I match fish. Most life events I get something fishing related. The thing I want currently is hook length line, it costs about \u00a33 but there are hundreds of options for it and I only use a couple of types. I would be much happier with a \u00a33 gift I need than a \u00a320 pack of line that\u2019s the wrong type or diameter and will just sit in my bag for years",

I use Google Keep and it allows shared lists, so I have a gift list for my two sons, which my wife, her family, my sister, and my parents are all on, so that everyone can see the gift ideas for them.  My sister maintains a similar list for her kids, that I can see and add to.",

            "To expand on this: Adopt a habit of looking for gifts for people whenever you go somewhere or see something new. On Reddit alone, one might see a neat gift idea every week depending on where you lurk. Try to purchase items when you see them or as soon as you can, then when they arrive, tag them with a possible recipient and store them away. When done right, by the time Xmas rolls around you can have most of your shopping done already. Best of all, this technique spreads the cost out, making it more affordable, and prevents last minute, desperation gifts, reducing holiday stress.",

            "I already have that turned off and several apps still ask you to rate them.",
            "But still the official reddit app wants me to rate it every couple of days.",
            "It\u2019s really important to me as a small developer to point out that this will only affect apps using the native API Apple provides which limits to asking you three times per year before you can\u2019t be asked, but most apps are not using the API and instead use a custom prompt which bypasses the limit and ability to be turned off in settings. It won\u2019t stop apps asking you to rate them in some obtuse manner and it will block apps trying to do the right thing by you in the hopes of trying to build some kind of rating. The native prompt just requires you to give it a star rating and that\u2019s it, no more and it goes away without taking you out of the app so do please consider this before turning it off.\n\nEdit: Link with details\n\nThe setting will only block prompts that look like the ones in the article https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15768196/apple-ending-annoying-app-store-review-prompts\n\nOther rate prompts you see will NOT be blocked and will keep popping up\n\nEdit 2: Apps are already required to use the native API under section 1.1.7 of the App Store guidelines but they don\u2019t because it\u2019s very easy to beat the rule.",
            "Nothing of that sort on Android? ",

            "There\u2019s gonna be a lot of cringing app developers as this hits the front page.",
            "There\u2019s actually a pretty good reason to leave this on.  This option will only prevent apps from showing you Apple\u2019s new native in-app rating API, which allows developers to open a system pop up that lets you rate 1-5 stars without leaving the app.  If you rate the app, or say \u201cNo thanks\u201d you will *never be asked to rate again*.  \n\nSo, I leave the setting on.  Sometimes I actually do want to rate apps, and if they\u2019re using the native API it\u2019s trivially easy. If I don\u2019t feel like rating, I can easily choose to never see the pop up again, on a per app basis.  Turning the native rating API off all together rewards developers who are using homegrown  spammy solutions. ",

            "Sadly, app review data has become progressively less useful for all parties. As an iOS developer, I get to pick when I want to trigger the app review popup. Because I only want good ratings, I only trigger this when I think the user is engaged and having a positive experience. This is now the norm for most apps, since your rating is effectively a form of marketing. This makes the data too biased to use for either developers or users. Although this LPT may help reduce rating spam, in some situations and with some apps, it feels like this whole system should have a re-think.",
            "Seems pointless, most apps ask the question and you can answer YES, NO, NEVER. You just hit NEVER and you're done. In any case, if you're using an app, especially if it's free, the least you can do is provide constructive feedback.",

Finishing the first round of a game for example. \n\niOS automatically limits the display of the prompt to three occurrences per app within a 365-day period.

All you have to do is land on our website and I can buy your name, email address, mailing address, facebook info, twitter info, if you're married, if you have kids, if you own a home, your approx net worth, your education level, etc. It's done all the time and it's cheap to buy. Totally legit and legal. Your information is already out there.\n\nEdit: To everyone who is asking how this is possible.

Spam Gourmet cuts them off after they send you N emails (you get to set a default N, or you can change it per email, eg. walmart.5.bob@spamgourmet.com).  If you want to keep getting emails from a company (after N of them), you just have to add them to a list on the Spam Gourmet site.\n\nSo basically 95% of the time you just make up a new email like starbucks.bob@spamgourmet.com for each company, they send you your signup confirmation and a few welcome emails, and then Spam Gourmet cuts them off.  But in the 5% of the time where you want to let the email through, it just takes a few seconds to fix at spamgourmet.com.\n\nAnd, as a bonus, if a company sells your email to another company, you know that they did it because you get spam from the second company with the first company's name in the email address (until you get N emails and Spam Gourmet cuts them off).",

            "This doesn't feel like an apt comparison at all.  First of all barrier to entry is a major issue, obviously netflix having like none is a part of it.  Second, there is a clear start middle and end to a netflix series.  Continuing to watch something you aren't into that may improve doesn't stop you from deciding to stop at any point.  \"I'll give this a chance\" is much different contextually when the penalty is 8 hours maximum.\n\nAchieving a goal on the other hand can some with great risks and consequences.  Your goal likely costs you money, has many obstacles you will need to navigate, failure is a piece of the equation.  There isn't a set amount of time a goal takes to achieve, and for some that amount of time could be all the time you have left on earth won't be enough.  \n\nThen there is the issue with linear progress.  Conventional wisdom says if you show up and work hard every day you will get closer to your goal, wrong.  There are other forces that be that are likely influence that goal.  New people come along with new talents that displace others.  That doesn't account for cultural shifts, or any of the other unknown aspects that go along with it.  There will likely be ups and downs, and depending on how stable your situation in, the downs can be devastating.  The stress that comes from navigating such a mine field can be harmful to you.  \n\nThen of course, Netflix and goal aren't mutually exclusive.  Just cause you continue a netflix series doesn't mean you don't also spend the correct amount of time on your goal.  It also suggests that disengaging mentally from your goal can't be productive, or that getting to into your goal can't drive you mad.  Nor does it account from inspiration you get from watching other peoples works get complete.\n\ntldr;  an 8 hour netflix series and an achievable goal aren't really comparable for many reasons, nor are they mutually exclusive.",

If we hadn't gotten him in he probably would have died over the next day.\n\nThe **initial** surgery to clear that was $4000.

We didn\u2019t have insurance yet but the vets wanted to walk us with almost $4,000 in fees and it had to be paid right there or may as well put the dog down?

And since I dont condone the purchasing of \"designer puppies\" under any circumstances, that argument is moot with me.  If you have a love for animals, want a companion, and at have at least some time for the animal, nothing should guilt trip you out of going to the shelter and rescuing.....especially lack of money.",

I guess so - but - the truth is, you're probably better off a poor kid in a solid family than a rich kid in a family that is shit. Absolute statements like yours fail.",

            "Gut instincts can definitely go awry with certain past experiences. Best to know yourself and take both you gut and the more analytical side of your mind into consideration. \n\nReally drawn out example:\n\nI\u2019ve been abused by multiple people who are close to or have narcissistic personality disorder. I get a gut feeling around someone who is abusive, disordered, or low empathy immediately. I used to immediately feel sick, but now it\u2019s just an \u201cick\u201d feeling. This is where my gut is useful. I can protect myself from people who make me feel this way, even if I can\u2019t really protect others. \n\nI was bullied in school and people in groups make all of the alarm bells go off in my head. So do pretty girls being nice to me, because it wasn\u2019t safe when it used to happen. But now, it is safe. My gut screams \u201cNO\u201d but my head has to remember where it\u2019s coming from and that this is a situation where it\u2019s ok to stick around and feel things out, because I\u2019m not in danger.\n\nSo, it gets to a point where it\u2019s pretty hard to determine when the instinct is greater than the experience, learning your triggers (and accuracy) is really important. That, and don\u2019t go into a potentially dangerous situation if your gut feels off. Guy giving you bad vibes? Don\u2019t go home with him, risk is too great.

Basically, you're brain is constantly comparing situations, people, and events to past experiences under the surface, training itself to prepare for the next step and learning.

            "I had a bad feeling about one of the guys in my group of friends in highschool (about a decade ago). We were supposed to be going for a hike with friends. He picked me up from my dad's house, and the dogs went nuts. One of the dogs was so upset we decided to leave all the dogs home because we couldn't settle them down. Next danger sign was he said that our friends had cancelled. I still go on the hike because I was young and stupid. I was a stronger hiker than him, and knew the trail, so I led and kept a good few strides ahead while we chatted. He kept asking me if I was interested in anyone in our friend group. I laughed and said it was too complicated to date friends. It was awkward. Then he took me to a Tim Hortons, but instead of taking me back towards my neighborhood he headed towards his neighborhood which I was unfamiliar with. He went through the drivethru and locked the doors. He paid for my drink and asked me how the date was. I said I wasn't aware it was a date. He basically decided be wasn't going to take me home until I agreed to date him again. He was so angry veins were raised in his forehead. He put his hand on my neck. I kept saying no, and he grabbed my thigh when I tried to get out of the car. He was a lot bigger than me, and was a classic entitled \"nice guy\". I unlocked the car and spilled out of it. Bussed home from a neighborhood I didn't know, took about 2 hours. He was embarrassed when we got back to school. I was afraid. He complained to our friends that I was a tease and owed him gas money and coffee for me not putting out on the date.  \n\nAfter this, a similar thing happened with an older guy from our band. I can't go into detail, but in summary, I got a bad feeling about being left alone with this other guy too. I said no, he said he was dissapointed because he thought I would be easy and he didn't want to go to university without having kissed a girl... \n\nI should have listened to the dogs.

            "It's kind of amazing how often first impressions bear out. Two stories, both from the last few years.\n\nOne of my old bosses was one of those prim people. Always smiling, never laughing--with coworkers. Not even once. (But absolutely with clients.) I think she could do no wrong at the company because she had been there for so long. I realized pretty quickly that she didn't like me, but there wasn't any discernible reason. It took me a year after I'd been fired to figure out the reason she didn't have any meetings with me and my other boss. I don't think they got along, either.\n\nI lived in a run-down duplex apartment with two other guys for about a year before one of them moved out. Within the next week or so, two people came to look at the place, and I (being a sub-letter, not the guy with his name on the lease) just sort of let the main lessor (who was awesome, btw) take the lead. First guy was quiet. Forgettable, to be honest, because I only spoke about two sentences to him. The second guy was the guy who moved in.\n\nThere was something a bit weird about him, but I couldn't put my finger on it. There was a bit of an edge to some of his remarks that just made him seem . . . off. I'd figured it was just meeting-the-potential-housemates awkwardness that would wear off as we got to know each other. He'd gone to a good university and worked with kids. (I also did/do both of those things.) I've always tried to give the people I meet a chance rather than write them off.\n\nWithin a week, I noticed my dishes piling up in the sink. I noticed he was rarely, if ever, awake before noon. I noticed that that awkward edginess was actually just his personality.\n\nI have never met an adult as immature, irresponsible, and utterly self-absorbed as he was. Our lessor had to write a new contract just to explain things like, \"Don't piss all over the floor and leave it there,\" \"Don't have multiple guests over until 5am on multiple consecutive workdays,\" \"Don't shovel all your stuff into communal spaces,\" \"Do the fucking dishes,\" etc.\n\nHe took every possible opportunity to demonstrate his superior expertise when he didn't even come close to competence. Dude lost a chess game to a friend of mine and, within 20 seconds, asked my friend what his SAT score was. Thank the gods that chapter of my life is over. He blew through all his money from his part-time job and had to move home to his parents. This was way before the virus.\n\nLong story short, I agree.",

Worst thing was, my wife and I both had uneasy feelings after talking with them but ignored it because they were friendly.\n\nDue to my experience with these people I have some additional advice with this tip.\n-They will try to implant themselves into every aspect of your life.\n-They will try to make you cut out other people in your life.\n-They will do everything they can to get you to rely solely on them.\n-They will talk bad about you to others and act friendly to your face.\n-They will get you to drop your gaurd and discuss intimate things and then try to use them against you.\n-They will project their flaws on to you.\n-and since they lack any respect for you, the will damage your property.",

Then the 25th comes and he needs help, he has been working full time and he even has this paper printed by the company that they will pay him in full on the 30th instead due to technical problems at the company he works for. He just needs to borrow a little bit of money for only a few days to pay his rent so he doesnt get kicked out of his appartment. I didnt give him anything some other people i knew did and tried to help him, he stays around for 2 more days then he vanishes like he had never existed in the first place with their money.\n\nThen it struck me what had been off with him, he had been evaluating us the whole time, it wasnt overtly it was more carefully looking over our clothes, took great interest in a guys clock and asked about a friends clothes. The majority of it was money related even though he never said that explicitly.\n\nIt was in the way he spoke he talked to us as a group not as individual friends. How he looked at things and the only things he ever cared about was the more expensive stuff. It was never like \"ohh you must have owned those boots for ages they are worn but they fit you really well\" it was more like \"is that a brand new clock, how old is that phone, when did you get that jacket it must have been expensive?\" \n\nIts hard to really pinpoint, because those things were far and few between but rather how those were the questions he was interested in hearing the answer too."

I know\" expression because I feel so cringed/grossed out by the idea of being guilty by association. The vibe is really that palpably *too much*.\n\nRelatedly, he just sort of seems to mistake \"my job is to make you feel welcome, and the tips don't hurt either, so I will act as such\" with \"I'm boys with the bartender.\"\n\nDo you guys know people like this?

I went almost every week, had 2 different groups of friends I went with monthly and then I'd come on off weeks by myself. It was cheap, especially for lunch; $15 not including drink + tip. I'd always order the same thing, so eventually they'd just start bringing out my first order without me even asking (Tempura Udon and a Black Dragon Roll). When it started happening when I went with friends, they'd be like \"uh we didn't even order anything yet\" and I'd just be like \"it's okay, I'll eat it\".\n\nAnother restaurant I was a regular at, a few years later, was a Vietnamese restaurant where I'd always order Pad Thai and springrolls.

One day Joey got hit by a car back hips and legs tore up and out of his body. I called the vet in after hours to have him get put down I brought bear so he could see what happened to Joey. Now bear is a very smart dog working dog he\u2019s been a bird dog since he was 3 months old. Has killed birds and witnessed a lot of it so I\u2019m sure he has his head wrapped around what death is. That theory was confirmed that day when Joey got put down. Bear acted like he got hit physically whining, cowarding  runnning away. Very out of the ordinary for him. Never hated going to the vet before  that incident now he will start to shake if we even drive by that place. Something I wish I could take back.

Neither dog looked to each other to give or receive comfort.

Whenever I see someone with better life; better job,education,relationship,friends,looks etc. I just go down in that rabbit hole.\n\n\nI stumble upon a photo of a person who\u2019s better looking than me and go \u201cgod even in my happiest moment I\u2019ll never look that good in a photo\u201d.

If you saw the photo, you might compare yourself to me and think \"this family never fights, why does mine?\" Or \"this family's house is clean, why isn't mine?\" What you wouldn't see would be the fights that broke out between my boys before and after the photo or the mess that was shoved out of frame of the camera.\n\nYou might also be comparing against someone's public success without seeing their private failures. Say you are trying to write a novel and think you could never write as well as your favorite author who just released a best selling novel. What you don't see are the horrible first drafts he penned, the dreadful novels he started and either didn't finish or finished but couldn't get published, etc. All the work he did to improve his craft gets hidden so all you see is \"he released a best seller.\" Everyone was just starting out at some point.",

This includes areas you are strong in, but with nuance and self reflection you\u2019ll always find potential for progress. It often helps to learn from people who are stronger and more experienced.\n\n2. People are stronger together. Look for weakness in yourself and find people who complement you. This is how you build powerful collaboration.\n\n3. If you find yourself in a situation where you need a pat on the back from yourself (like OP suggests) then you are over-identifying with what you\u2019ve achieved or didn\u2019t achieve instead of what you can achieve.

Please. I'm begging you. \n\nFor example, we at the cat shelter don't want your pillow cases, but a shelter one town over did. We found out about that and brought over a whole lot of pillow cases for them. \nWe also DO NOT want your blanket if it's larger than a twin size. It takes up too much space in the washer, and it's way too hard to fold with one person in a small space. \nWe never want your old comforter. Unless you want to take the time to cut it down and sew it into smaller little pads. \nWe will never want your fitted sheets. They're useless and get thrown out. \n\nWe will however happily take: \n- Small fleece blankets (like twin size at biggest)\n- Small afghans/knitted/crocheted blankets (lap blanket size) \n- Flat sheets, any size\n- Towels, any size, no holes please\n- Like new cat beds and small dog beds\n- Baby blankets\n\nUltimately, whatever you give us, it's going to be washed in hot water with bleach on a rough cycle. We're trying to kill EVERYTHING on it. It's then going to be put in the dryer for at least an hour on the hottest setting. We want that stuff dried and anything left on there super dead. The other day, I pulled a bed out that had melted into 2 other blankets. They all had to be thrown out. \n\nWhile we do thrive off donations, we don't thrive off of sorting through your 4 bags of old bedding to only find 3 items we can actually use. That wastes our time and resources and doesn't help. So call or email ahead. Check local shelter social media pages to see if they're specially requesting anything. \n\nFrom a very tired laundromancer (the art of laundry magic, it's new), thank you in advance for calling in advance",

Lately I've been taking all the sheets home and cutting them up to use as shop rags. I've been restoring some old tools and other hardware, so the free sheets make great rags to wipe off rust remover or paint remover or an oily mess. And I don't feel bad throwing those away and saving my good rags for jobs where I can wash them afterwards.\n\nBy the way, at Dad's clinic, they can't ever have too many bath towels and hand/dish sized towels. Anything that's washcloth size is too small and anything beach towel size is too big. Bed sheets are basically worthless, but could be a last resort if there's no blankets. Any pillows I pick up and take to Goodwill or similar donation place. However, as a nonprofit that is really helped by donations, we won't turn down ANY item that's donated. Even if it goes in the trash as soon as the person who gave it drives off.

In my opinion, this is basically a PR scam for Amazon. I think it's still worth it, but only if you put your money where it does the most good, like the American Red Cross or something large like that where many many many people are contributing en masse. If you're choosing to donate to \"Joes Animal Rescue\" or something they get hardly anything.\n\n[This is a fantastic article that explains the problem.](https://medium.com/@digitalculturenyc/why-nonprofits-need-to-stop-falling-for-the-amazon-smile-scam-f68d389c801c)\n\nCharities get one half of a penny for every dollar spent. Our charity is tiny and in the 2 years that we have been a part of Amazon Smile, users (which is largely our own spending) have spent about $3000 in our name. Which amounts to a total payment of $15 for 2 years.  For some more context: $10,000 in spending would net us $50. When you consider that there is generally about a 2% conversion on asking people to participate in campaigns like this, a charity with 1000 followers would get about 20 followers contributing. Consider that only a fraction of those 20 would be purchasing enough at Amazon to generate significant contribution and you'll see where this ends up.\n\nNow consider that the vast majority of local non-profit charities have followers in the hundreds rather than thousands.   \nAgain, I think the program does good things but you're throwing your money away unless you're directing it at a very largely followed charity.",

            "Reminder that when you use AmazonSmile, *you* are not the person donating the money, *Amazon* is, which contributes to their tax write-offs. Facebook birthday charities work the same way, for example. \n\nIt may be less convenient, but it would be better to simply donate to the charity directly yourself. That way, three things happen: 1) you can be guaranteed the entirety of your donation goes to the charity of your choosing (which can be a local org that is not partnered with Amazon through this program), 2) Amazon doesn't benefit from your kindness, and 3) you could even get the tax write-off yourself if you wanted. Certain employers may even offer donation matching programs to increase the donation amount, though keep in mind that this is a tax write-off for them as well.\n\nMy own LPT is to start an \"Amazon Jar\" that you stick money in every time you purchase something on Amazon; at the end of the year, just donate that. It can even be a virtual wallet if you're so inclined."
