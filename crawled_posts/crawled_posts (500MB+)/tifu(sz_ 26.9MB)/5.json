And then I thought to myself \"business has been good lately, I can afford to treat myself\", so I figured I would indulge by adding the most precious of treats to my broth: a hard boiled egg.\n\nSo I looked up on the Internet if you could hard boil an egg in the microwave. And, as luck would half it, I found a very easy to follow article with instructions on how to do it. I was filled with glee.\n\nSo, popping the egg in some water and in the microwave, I put the timer to 8 minutes, following the instructions to a T. 3 minutes of me salivating for the fruit of my labor, a loud bang ravaged me from my thoughts.\n\nIndeed, the egg had exploded, filling my whole microwave with bloody egg gore. Dumbstruck I checked the article for the source of my mistakes, and that\u2019s when I noticed the article is from April first, 2014.\n\nWell played, internet food journal. I\u2019m gonna clean the microwave now.\n\nTL;DR check the date of articles if you don\u2019t want your kitchen to get nuked\n\nEdit: wow this blew up! Disclaimer for everyone blasting my ass about this, I was high as shit when that happened.\n\nEdit: Also my girlfriend was involved in the cooking of the egg, just so you folks know!",

            "It is possible to hard boil and egg in the microwave (no April Fools)\n\n1. Fill a microwave safe bowl with enough lukewarm water to immerse the egg/eggs fully, filling it till about 1/2 inch over the egg/eggs\n2. THIS IS IMPORTANT...and maybe what was missed, add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt per egg...or lightly pierce the bottom of the shell not enough to actually pierce the egg...if you don't do either is it highly probable your egg will explode.\n3.  Microwave for 4 minutes for 2 eggs, 5 minutes for 4 eggs, 6 minutes for 6 eggs.  \n4.  If you want soft boiled eggs with runny egg yolks, immediately remove the eggs from the water and plunge in ice cold water. \n5.  If you want hard boiled eggs, allow them to stay in the hot water for  2-3 additional minutes.  Two minutes will give you medium boil...three minutes will give you firm egg yolks\n\nI hope this helps",

I've been hard boiling eggs by the dozen in the microwave for like 10 years. I've never had any explosions, catastrophic failures, or even close calls in all that time. Am I just incredibly lucky?  Or is there some combination of water level, egg number,  and cooking time that successfully hard boils them and I just have the formula right? \n\n\n\nOr am i just completely r/woosh right now?",

You put the egg in first, and time it so that you put the noodles in right when you know they're both done at the same time. Once the soup is done, you take out the egg, peel it and pop it back into the soup. Ba da bing, you've got yourself a top notch ramen.\n\nDouble pro tip: throw some kimchi in there too",

            "To make a hard boiled egg\n\n1. Fill pot with water,(enough to completely submerge an egg)  place pot on stovetop, turn onto high heat (level 10).\n\n2. Wait for water to boil (about 7 minutes).\n\n3. Use tongs or a spoon to gently place raw egg into the rapidly boiling water.\n\n4. Set timer 15 minutes, and wait for egg to boil.\n\n5. Remove egg from boiling water with tongs or spoon, caution egg will be hot.\n\n6. Turn off cook top. This is here because you thought you could microwave an egg, and I feel badly for your lack of parenting and guidance.\n\n7. Place egg under cold water to shock the egg, and it will help separate the egg and shell. Don\u2019t eat the shell.\n\n8. On a hard flat surface, place a paper towel, gently hit the egg on the paper towel and roll it with a little pressure. This will help you easily remove the shell.\n\n9. Rinse off and peel all remaining shell bits.\n\n10. I prefer a little paprika on my hard boiled egg, but others like salt, pepper, or scallions. Experiment with spice to taste. \n\n11.

And more accurately it\u2019s more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife \u201cMommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom\u201d and off to the races they go. \n\nObviously this is a game that both parents play and she\u2019ll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it\u2019s cute and we haven\u2019t gotten any feedback on it.\n\nThis brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells \u201cGET MY BOOTY DADDY!\u201d To which I reply nonchalantly \u201cI\u2019m going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom\u201d since her butt was right next to my face. \n\nI immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling \u201cEAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY\u201d and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it\u2019s too late, eat my booty is the new tag. \n\nI took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I\u2019m dreading picking her up.\n\nTL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I\u2019m going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. \n\nEdit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!\n\nThere were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. \n\nThanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. \n\nFor those that got offended, sorry? None of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. Cheers!",

Well the second movie started late, plus it was PG-13 so we made it a cool thing, laid the seat down and set up a fort with blankets, pillows, books, etc. so he could sleep while we watched the second one.\n\nHe thought it was *the greatest* thing in the entire world! So when he went to preK that Monday and teacher asked how his weekend was, he exclaimed: \"Mommy had me sleep in the TRUNK this weekend!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd. Of course. I got questioned.

            "When my son was a little older than that, I was getting him ready for school one morning. I'm a criminal defense attorney and spend quite a bit of time in jails because, well, that's where the clients are. This particular morning, I knew I was going to be in the jail near his school that afternoon so I told him that if I was out of jail in time I would pick him up. If I wasn't there then he should go to aftercare and either his mom or grandmother would get him (this was entirely normal for him).\n\nThe end of his school day rolls around and I finished my visit with my client, so I get into the car line to get him. His school had hang tags that you put on your rear view mirror with the child's last name. I had my hang tag in place and had picked him up several times, but didn't know any of his teachers or anything like that. It was always just a drive up, get my son, leave kind of thing.\n\nSo I get to the front of the line and the teacher monitoring the kids sees me and the hang tag and her eyes get **really big**. I stop where I'm supposed to and my son runs to the back door. The teacher blocked him from opening the door and I asked her what was wrong. \n\n\"I don't know if I can let him go with you. He's been saying all day that he didn't think his daddy was going to pick him up because he was in jail.\" \n\nI had to show her my business card and bar card (that identifies you as a member of the state bar) to convince her that, while some people consider my profession criminal, I was not incarcerated. \n\nAlmost a decade later we still laugh about it.\n\nEdit: I've been silvered. Thank you a-nony-mouse!",

            "Hooo I feel your pain. There have been many such cases in my time as a ~~hostage~~ parent, but one sticks out in my mind. \n \n Near Christmas, I always offer to watch my hatchling's accomplices in packs while parents go shopping, play Santa, day drink their stress away, whatever.  \nOne of these days, the sun did not shine, it was too wet to play, so we sat in the house all that cold, cold wet day.  \nThen the power went out. There goes what was keeping half of them tame.  \nSo I went and bought a Christmas tree.  They can decorate a tree without international incident, right?  \n...right?  \n \nLights were not going to work, so making ornaments and decorations it is, because I hate myself.  \n \nThree hours later, most of the pack was tiring and well over safety scissors, glue, the general destruction of every flat surface in the house, so we started putting hooks on the ornaments. A couple of the kids started pretending the hooks were earrings and putting them in their actual earring holes, pretending to be fish getting \"caught\", other liabilities.    \nMy solution was to assign each beast a task that didn't include tetanus shots.     \nTwo were Scissoring one was gluing, five were glittering and two were sticking cotton balls on their snowmen.  \nThis devolved into one child crying because he couldn't be\n\n The Hooker.     \n\nHe did not want to trade the Ball Sticker, or the Scissor Sisters. \nHe wanted to be The Hooker.\nAfter a display of responsible hook handling, he was allowed to help me be The Hooker.    \nThe cease fire lasted only minutes.  Tired, bored children need mayhem.  \n  I hadn't realized the time, that most parents were headed to get their satellite liabilities, until too late.  \nWithin minutes, all but one (sleeping) Hobbit was doing their best impression of a drunk, sad sorority girl.  \nWhen parents started walking in, they were met with children in various stages of lamentation over who got to scissor, who got to play with sticky  balls, who got to be the hooker, and who was going to cover Snowden the Snowman's balls in glitter.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n",

Well, this meant Steve became an uncle at a very young age. Fast forward a few years and my nephew was going to day care and he starts telling everybody his uncle Steve runs around in his underwear and plays with him. This did not go over well and my sister started receiving very worried calls from the daycare lady.

I told him to go use the other bathroom, and he stomps off...\n\nFor about a week he was telling everyone that he has a small PP because he's four, but Daddy has a big PP because he's old...

        "selftext": "Me and my girlfriend were out on a walk yesterday enjoying the Finnish autumn. We decided to go to a local\u00a0bakery before heading home. The bakery sells great hot chocolate and other treats. We got in and ordered two hot chocolates.\n\nMy girlfriend is lactose intolerant so having milk makes her feel sick but she is able to enjoy it with no problems if she has lactase enzyme capsules before eating anything with milk in it.\n\nThe\u00a0bakery\u00a0was empty apart from us and an older\u00a0lady\u00a0sitting a few tables from us. As we were waiting for our order my girlfriend had to use the restroom so she left for a while. Our drinks arrived in the meanwhile.\n\nMy girlfriend uses lactase enzyme capsules that\u00a0can be\u00a0opened and sprinkled on top of\u00a0the food/drink before eating it or consumed as is. My girlfriend finds that opening them and adding them straight to food works best for her.\n\nI was carrying her stuff in my pockets so I decided to mix the lactase enzyme in her drink before she came back so it could take its time to dissolve properly. I opened the pill, poured the stuff inside her hot chocolate and mixed it in and didn't think much of it.\n\nThe\u00a0lady\u00a0left and I was sitting there alone now. My girlfriend was taking a while and I started wondering if everything was fine. A while later my girlfriend, looking like she was holding in laughter, came back to the table with the old\u00a0lady. The\u00a0lady\u00a0looked at me with a stern\u00a0panicked\u00a0look on her face and asked me what I put in my girlfriends drink. I\u00a0was confused\u00a0and it took me a while to process the question.\u00a0\n\nThen I realized how suspicious I must have looked. A guy out with a girl, taking a pill from his pocket and mixing\u00a0the content of\u00a0it in her drink while she is using the bathroom. And that's exactly what the\u00a0lady\u00a0sitting a few tables from us saw.\n\nI'm an anxious man so I panicked and\u00a0frantically\u00a0started explaining everything to the\u00a0lady\u00a0showing the package for the pills and everything. My girlfriend confirmed what I was saying but the\u00a0lady\u00a0was still having a hard time believing it. She had called the cops so we had to wait for them to show up and explain the situation to them. I felt extremely awkward and\u00a0embarrassed. The old\u00a0lady\u00a0was in a bit of a shock but eventually she believed everything was okay and left.\n\nIn the end we were able to laugh about the situation. I'm really glad that the\u00a0lady\u00a0actually took action and I did thank her for trying to help in a situation like that. It's good to know that people look after each other.\n\nTldr; I ordered hot chocolates with my girlfriend at a\u00a0bakery. She went to the bathroom and I put a lactase enzyme pill in her drink making an old\u00a0lady\u00a0think I was\u00a0roofying\u00a0her. She called the cops\n\nEdit: Some people are confused about why the lady didn't stop when I explained what the pills where. She hadn't heard about those things before and she was scared and confused since she thought a crime was happening right infront of her. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, so it took some time to convince her it was all fine. It wasn't entitlement or anger it was confusion. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay and that I wasn't lying, the old lady was very kind. And she called the police before talking with my girlfriend",

            "I think that old lady is awesome. I got roofied once, and people saw it and did nothing. Luckily, I was out with friends who knew I was way too messed up for what I'd had to drink, so they got rid of the guy who was trying to talk to me and took me to the hospital. This was before camera phones, but they were able to describe the guy well enough to the cops for them to go find him. He was still at the bar, and once cops were there, people were willing to talk. I honestly don't remember much past about 10-15 min after that drink until the next morning except feeling very sick. I'm so glad my friends and I always went together because of things like this, but also sad we had to. We were just trying to blow off steam from a hard week at work.",

            "Sometimes I have a hard time eating. I get nauseous at random times due to hormonal imbalances. If I say I need to eat but can't, my boyfriend will order me to eat or tell me it will make him happy, things that will encourage me to eat. We worked it out, and it works really well. \n\nWe didn't think about what that would look like outside our home.\n\nSo last summer we went to a county fair. I got some lovely veggie tempura and was sitting there unable to bring myself to eat it. So my partner is like, \"eat it. Eat it now, that's an order\". \n\nThe women across from is were... less than amused. We had to explain its totally consensual lol.",

            "Reminds of one time my girlfriend was sitting on top of me in bed and I pulled her down and she hit her face into the wall (we we're both drunk and it was late) so I called \"Sjukv\u00e5rdsupplysningen\" which is a number you can call in Sweden for non-emergency illness trying to confirm that her nose wasn't broken while she was stuffing her nose and conversation went like this:  \n\"Hi, my girlfriend hit her face into the wall and we are worried that her nose might be broken, is there any way to check if it's serious and we should go to the hospital?\"  \n\n\n\"Your girlfriend hit a wall with her face and possibly broke her nose? Is your girlfriend there? Could I speak to her?\"  \n\n\n\"She is stopping her nosebleed so she cant really talk right now, why do you need to speak to her?\"  \n\n\n\"Could you just put her on please?\"\n\nWasn't until the woman on the line asked her if I hit her that it dawned on any of us that, that's exactly what it sounded like.",

            "I once had a shop worker call the police, thinking I was a domestic abuse sufferer.\n\nI had an absolute unit of a cat at the time, and a few nights before, he'd jumped straight on my face from the top of a wardrobe. Two black eyes, scratches all along my cheeks. I looked like I'd been through the rounds. \n\nI was out shopping with my older bro and we started bickering and he *jokingly* said something along the lines of \"shut up, or I'll give you a third black eye.\" I laughed, and forgot about it until we got to the till. \n\nThe woman scanning the items was giving my brother absolute death looks, and seemed to be taking her time, which was weird, but it happens. Right at the end, she casually asks how I got the bruises. \n\nMy cat beat me up is a ridiculous excuse, and let's be honest, noone was gonna buy that. So I say \"I got into a car accident\" right at the same time my bro blurts out it was the cat. I can see the gears start to turn in his head, and then he very calmly says, \"ahh yes. We agreed it was a car accident.\"\n\nThis lady's eyes go *wide* and she starts waving towards the security officer, who in turn calls the police. I kept trying to explain that he'd never hurt me in a million years, and it was just a hilarious misunderstanding, but she was having none of it. \n\nLuckily, the police believed me (after a good few mins of pure confusion), but according to my bro, she still gives him evils like, 6 years later. \n\nI am truly grateful to her, though. She had her heart in the right place, and I appreciate the efforts she went to to make sure I was safe. \n\nStill mortifying though lol",

            "A few years ago I was the old lady in this situation. I was on a flight across the Pacific and the woman next to me got up and went to the bathroom. While she was gone, a random man came from a few rows back and tried to reach into the bag she had stowed under the seat in front of her. He claimed to know her, but I asked him to wait until she came back. \n\nSure enough, he was her husband. Her bag contained their toy maltese, and he was just trying check on the dog. He was very nice and actually thanked me for looking out for his wife, a woman I hadn't shared a single word with up until then. We all had a good laugh about it.",
            "I didn't know such pills exist and that you can just open it and pour it in/on your food etc. I would probably think the same thing as the lady to be fair.",

            "This reminds me of a time when my wife and I went with some friends out for drinks.\n\nMy wife is 5'0\" and I am 5'10\", so the same amount of drinks will mess her up more than me. We all went to a bar and stayed there for a while, just drink after drink and the occasional shots. After a while we decided to go to a club, luckily for us there was one within that same street, and there was a lot of people out. \n\nSo as we are walking to the club our friend's girlfriend has to go to the bathroom, so she asks her man to go with her to make sure she is safe, my wife at this point was already really messed up. So they leave us two alone waiting for them, and my wife tells me she needs to sit down for a bit, so she sits down right next to this lamppost and just puts her head on it and she just looks like she is done for the night.\n\nAs I am waiting, I am talking to her and at one point I try to get her up, so it looks weird of you don't know us, a guy trying to force her up and the girl barely able to walk. So a gang of girls surround me and her and immediately start asking if she is okay and how we know each other, and I start panicking because I don't want the cops called on us, and have to explain the whole thing.\n\nSo I kinda stutter a bit at first and I am explaining that I am her husband and that she drank a lot and she is okay, and they aren't really buying it, some girls are interrogating me while the others try to talk to my wife and ask her if she is okay.\n\nSo I start telling them that we were out with some friends and we are waiting for them to come back and I tell them that I appreciate them coming to check up on her that not a lot of people do that and we should because we are all in this together, they start backing off but don't seem too convinced about it, so then I show them my wallpaper for my phone, it was a picture of us at the beach kissing, and that's when they decided that I was telling the truth and I was indeed her husband.\n\nMoments later our friend's come back and I tell them what happened and we all laughed about it. It actually made me feel good that there are people that are making sure more women are safe.\n\nEdit: bitch to beach",

I got home to my partner at the time, and that\u2019s when it kicked in. It was horrible, was paralysed and couldn\u2019t move, but awake and fully conscious. I had tears in my eyes and was willing my partner to notice my predicament. It took a while, but eventually, when I could speak, I started calling my partners name and explaining I couldn\u2019t move.

A person pouring a pill in a drink is unusual at best, especially if she\u2019d never heard of a legitimate reason for it.\n\nPlus, people tend to latch onto the first bit of evidence they receive about something, so everything else backed up what she was saying - you being anxious, realizing what it looked like, looked, to her, like you\u2019d been caught in the act.\n\nIt just took the police arriving and everyone explaining the situation for the facts to be straightened out, but the lady had to make the best call with the information that she had available, and she did the right thing it seems, even though there was a mistake of fact. \n\nWe just gotta keep that in mind that now that we know the facts, when we look back at this case, we can\u2019t say the lady overreacted, because we know the truth while she didn\u2019t.\n\nGlad you guys had a good laugh over it all!",

Good on her for speaking up in the first place but it really makes me uncomfortable that she felt the need to call the police.",
            "Here in Canada, what we are supposed to do is inform the person who runs the cafe so they can take action.  If a store patron called police about another store patron but didn't say anything to the staff of the store, then the store would be pretty upset.\n\nAlso in my experience a Canadian would be unlikely to confront a(n alleged) perpetrator directly the way that old lady confronted you.  The reasoning is that people who commit crimes can be dangerous and the authorities don't want citizens putting ourselves at personal risk when we're not trained to deal with it.",
            "I'm a bit confused why she needed to still confront you after talking to your girlfriend. Obviously your girlfriend knew it was just the pills and told the old lady that. So now she doesn't believe your girlfriend or something? Good on her for speaking up and reporting it I guess.",
            "All of this is well and good, until YOUR GIRLFRIEND explained that SHE KNEW what the capsules were.  I get not accepting the word of the person she thought was drugging your gf.  But when the supposed target pipes up and says \"Oh no thats medicine he was looking out for me.\"?\n\nOnce that happened, and the old lady persisted in her disbelief, thats where she became an asshole. At the point its plain to see both parties knew about the pill, and she still kept up her attitude, I got the feeling she thought it was drugs that you were doing TOGETHER and wanted to see you get into trouble for it. \n\nI've honestly never been able to stand people who upon receiving clarification, insist on sticking with their misunderstanding.",

From my perspective as a black woman (and oh btw, most black people are lactose intolerant fwiw) this whole scene is terrifying. Most black folks here are afraid of interacting with police because sometimes all it takes is for us to look at them the wrong way or say the wrong thing and then any number of violent and terrorizing things could happen. The poster who said something about becoming a hashtag is right. I don\u2019t want to become a hashtag because some random woman didn\u2019t even talk to me before calling the police.",

As in at least a month and a half. \n\n\nI went to stock up on groceries, and as I left my house, and got on a bus\n(you don\u2019t need a mask on them where I live)\n\nI realised I forgot my mask. \n\n\nI got off and walked home because I\u2019m not about getting the rona. \n\nAs I arrived at my house, I reached for my keys. Nope. There was nothing in my pockets. \n\nI retraced my steps, thinking I must have dropped them on the sidewalk. Nope. I then realised that they must be on the bus.

I reached into my pocket, and then I realised I left it on charge...\n\nSo my big brain does some really smart thinking, and I decide to break in, to my own house...\n\nI tried climbing on to my balcony, because I thought I left the window unlocked.\n\nSo there I am, looking like a ninja climbing on to my balcony. I thought I finessed it and I could get in easy, but that\u2019s where my little hope broke through. \n\nI heard a siren, looked down and saw a police car. I then realised how bad I looked. \n\nI explained what happened, and they looked really confused. I showed them some ID and showed them it was my house. \n\nThat is the story of how I nearly got arrested.\n\nTL;DR I forgot my mask, which led to me losing my keys, which led to me nearly being arrested for breaking and entering, into my own house.",

Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.\n\nAfter a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.\n\nAs it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. They're also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I'd grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. \n\nAnd **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.\n\n\n**\n\nTL;DR: I made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded.

            "> The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously.\n\nBullshit.  There's no way that eight separate packets of chips all happened to explode at once.  One or two, maybe.  Chips are not precision devices filled with exactly the same pressure and having the same point of mechanical failure, even when jolted from anything.\n\n> Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.\n\nChips don't disintegrate from rapid decompression.  Sorry.  There might be a little powder from any flavorings, but the chips themselves won't suddenly lose structural integrity due to decompression.   Besides, the plane interior was still under pressure and didn't decompress.\n\nAnd the most important point of all, anyone buying 8 snacks before a plane trip isn't going to put them away in an overhead bin, when they could put it under their seat to access easily during the flight.\n\nYour story went too far to be believable when you embellished the details, if anything happened at all.

So the other day I was really hungry and wanted some Panda Express Orange chicken. I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like \u201calright sounds good brother see you in a bit\u201d. \nA couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. So naturally I got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, \u201cummm you\u2019re not my girlfriend,\u201d quickly I looked up and realized \u201coh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I\u2019m thinking to myself \u201coh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door. Quickly I apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house. \n\nTL;DR I got in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car thinking that it was my friend.

My soon to be MIL is at complete opposite end of it. I understand that politics has had some really bad repercussions over the last couppe of years for some families, but I am just now beginning to witness it first hand. My mom made a post on FB about condemning the invasion on the U.S. Capitol. Someone commented on it basically saying that Antifa is planting people in there to make the right look crazy. My fianc\u00e8e showed it to me and said she can comment actual substance to disprove these comments and I encouraged her to do so because I honestly think the truth should be shared, especially if someone is passionate about the subject. So she linked her research and my mom thanked her for the backup and the other person didn't have a reply to it and that was the end of that...until it wasn't. My soon to be MIL basically commented that everyone should keep an open mind and that there's a lot of fake news being spewed by the media. She argues that Trump has done a lot of great things that the media doesn't acknowledge and that people shouldn't make rude comments about her president. My mom didn't realize who made this comment, and immediately replied that MIL is one of the idiots who blindly follows Trump and that if she agrees with him, then she's a traitor. She immediately apologized after realizing who it was and tried messaging her and texting her, but shes been unfriended, blocked, and now my fianc\u00e8e is having a pretty heated political discussion with her mom. We've tried apologizing on behalf of my mom, but MIL is airing out aalllll of her political beliefs.

I am a teacher under copious amounts of stress from this lovely school year\n\nThe FU:\n\nToday after a particularly stressful day teaching, I decided I needed to do some self care. I went to ulta and was browsing and I stumbled upon the bath bomb section. In my head I thought \u201cwhy not?? Baths can\u2019t be that bad, I always see people in movies relaxing in a bath. Let\u2019s give it a try!\u201d I carefully selected a pink bath bomb, and that dear reader is key to my fu.\n\nWhen I got home I decided to make a night out of it. I got my book, poured myself a glass of wine, put  on a bubbling face mask, and I turned on some tunes. I was sitting in the tub and I dropped in the bath bomb. It was pretty! And smelled great! In order to soak in the ~relaxation vibes~ I leaned back and gracefully, with my gangly ass elbows flailing about for balance, knocked the wine glass into the tub and the glass shattered instantly.\n\nSo there I was, in a tub with pink water, broken glass floating EVERYWHERE, and bubbles all over my face from the face mask. I tried to wipe my eyes to see but instead rubbed the bubbles in my eyes. I called for my boyfriend who runs in and sees me crying from the soap, surrounded by glass and \u201cbloody\u201d pink water. He then sees the 3 inch long shard of glass JUTTING out of my back. After a mini freak out on his part, he fished out all the glass, yanked that sucker out of my back, and had to flush out my eyes because by that point they were burning and I was hysterical. 0/10 would NOT recommend taking a bath to de-stress.\n\n\nTL:DR baths are overrated unless you are a graceful swan who can control their appendages.\n\nEdit: a lot of people keep saying that glass doesn\u2019t float so this is fake, I used the wrong word guys! I didn\u2019t mean like floating on the top, but rather mixing in with the water/flowing around any time I moved? My movement stirred it around. Sorry for the confusion!",

My ex and I were visiting a friend for the weekend who had an oversized tub that I coveted. To my delight I was able to convince my ex to take a tub with me. Unfortunately, the week following that tub was the *WORST* one of my life! The tub was about 4 times the size of a regular tub so it seemed logical to me to use 4 times as much Calgon, right? Perhaps it *would* have been okay had we not decided to have \u2018sexy time\u2019 while in the tub. Not sure I could have made a worse decision than that one. In retrospect, I\u2019m sure of it. And the result of lots of back and forth friction, on delicate tissue, in copious amounts of bath crystals that I\u2019m pretty sure were not completely dissolved? A solid week with a va-jay-jay that had super painful canker sores - port to starboard, bow to stern, and wall to wall up inside. Think really painful round, open sores that are made considerably worse when hit with a bit of ammonia, and we all know what urine is. For a week. My knees didn\u2019t get closer together than shoulder width the whole time. I peed in 6\u201d of cold water in the tub to try and dilute it somewhat so it didn\u2019t feel quite so much like I was peeing gasoline...that was on fire. I went to the doctor early in the week and he freaked. Said I should probably be in the hospital, on lots of pain meds.

        "selftext": "So lets start off with the fact that my dad has messed up teeth and didn't want his son to have bad teeth, so they paid a good sum of money to get them fixed.\n\nI had 11 years of orthodontic work starting with a gum graft when I was 5.\n\nWe'll come back to this later.\n\nWhen I was growing up and even in early adulthood I could hardly breathe. I would sleep in a sitting position when I got sick, and when I wasn't sick my nose was always clogged and my tonsils were the size of golf balls.\n\nI never really complained that I couldn't breathe with my mouth closed because I assumed that it was normal somehow.\n\nEventually when I was 24 I went to an ENT specialist to get it checked out because one more night of sitting upright unable to sleep because I couldn't breathe was too much.\n\nI went to this German doctor who checked me out and he was very confused how I had lived so long with such a horrible airway. At this point I was about 270lbs and just shy of 5'11. Physical exercise wasn't my forte.\n\nHe asked me if I had ever broken my nose and to my knowledge I never have. He was confused by this so he sent me for some x-rays. Before I left he told me that I likely need a structural rhinoplasty, and I probably also needed my tonsils out.\n\nThe x-ray comes back and he tells me that it makes no sense. I'm not a doctor but when the specialist says your bones are wrong, you get a bit concerned so I went back in.\n\nHe showed me on the x-ray that my jaw was not a straight line, there are sections in it that go up in levels as if I had a ton of work done on my teeth and that the work likely messed up my nose so bad that it wasn't functional.\n\nHe asked me what orthodontic work I had and all clicked for him when I gave him the laundry list of work that they had done. I told him I had gum grafts, headgear, braces, tongue cages, spacers, retainers, and they wanted to break my jaw and move it forward but after 11 years of this I decided enough was enough. I wont have my jaw broken in the name of good teeth.\n\nThe doctor told me to roll back to the spacers. I explained it was a device they installed in my mouth that opened my pallet from a V shape to a U shape and he said that's what did it.\n\nWhen the orthodontist increased the size of my upper jaw it pulled my nose over to the right side of my face permanently blocking that nostril and partially blocking the other.\n\nI had this done when I was 7 years old and coincidentally that's also the time that I turned into a walrus of a young boy.\n\nSo long story short they gave me a structural nose job, removed my tonsils and adenoids and I lost 80 pounds in 6 months and had a lot more energy. I could sleep laying down even when I was sick and even can kind of breathe with my mouth closed.\n\nSo to the German guy who fixed my face, thank you. I would not have lived as good of life if it wasn't for your work.\n\nAnd to the orthodontist... thank you for fixing my teeth even though it cost me 14 years of health.\n\nTL;DR Orthodontists fucked up my nose, I didn't understand the problem completely for 14 years.\n\nEdit: Wow the amount of people responding that they have similar issues is massive. If you do a class action holla at your boy.",

I suffer from a laundry list of nasal breathing issues just as you described, barring the weight gain, with my nose effectively just being purely cosmetic as barely any air can pass through it and I'm wondering if perhaps an injury I had as a kid might have left me in a similar at all boat.\n\nWhen I was twelve I got hit across the face with a metal bar, it left me very bloodied and bruised and since then my nose has been pretty noticeably crooked. I never visted the hospital after it happened but it was sore for months and people always ask how I broke my nose.\n\nIt doesn't look bad in any way, but I know from childhood photos it's quite drastically different and I'm wondering if its worth even just looking into it despite the small chance something is wrong there.",
            "Oh my god. Are you me? I spent 7 years with all kinds of gadgets in my mouth. I also had a spacer! It turns out, the orthodontist was scamming my mom... Every week/month he would find something new, something went wrong, I\u2019m not being compliant blah blah blah. It got to the point where I snapped at him, cursed him out so he refused to treat me. My mom finally agreed that something shady was going on. \n\nOne of the other orthodontists at the practice took my case and freaked out at all the unecessary work that was done on me. He got my braces off in less than 6 months. He realized I had severe trauma on my facial structure and lower jaw bone, it had receded to the point where I looked like an earthworm and braces were not going to help anymore. \n\nHe assisted us in suing the asshole orthodontist for malpractice (he was fired as well) and they kept saying that I needed that jaw breaking surgery, maxilofacial something. Recovery was going to be 9+ months and I had to bulk up (at least 80lbs) since my jaw would be wired shut and I would be on a liquid diet. I had just started law school and there was no way I would go another year dealing with my mouth and miss out on university. \n\nI got a chin implant instead and I was warned that my jaw bone will continue receding and my lower teeth will continue crowding... They never told me that he ruined my nose as well. My septum became crooked, closing off one nostril and causing horrible chronic sinus issues. Now, 13 years later I finally have the courage to fix it but I feel like I will have lifelong issues. \n\nIt it ain\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it pls.",

She said I was 100% blocked on one side and 90% on the other requiring semi urgent surgery after more antibiotics. \n\nI had the surgery. Afterward the surgeon asked again, I\u2019m certain I never broke my nose? Nope. Never. Never punched too hard in the face.\n\nRecovery was longer and harder than promised but I finally healed and immediately took up a 30 km / week running habit. I got promoted at work. I was able to father a baby girl after being ptsd impotent for years before. It was unbelievable how things changed after that. I went from 235 lbs to 170.

It was non stop she's got this, this, that, and that's odd. They sent me for a cat scan to check the glands and they were fine, which stumped the doctor more. But I go back next month to check out the long list of things he mentioned. I'm pretty sure my struggle to breathe is also from dental work, though lack there of in my case. I was a thumb sucker for too long and it pushed my jaw forward. I've been told that I'd need to have it broken and pushed back into place in order to fix my teeth.

I see that the elderly woman has several big bags of green marshmallows and I comment on the nice mint smell coming from them, which I could smell through the mask.

I actually spit it out and thought man, I mush have gotten the real cheap Jewish candy, because that\u2019s awful. Trying to figure out what could be in it, I flipped the box over and there it was, fish gelatin. Never thought that was a thing.\n\nThat sent me down a rabbit hole and I learned that a large commercial source of gelatin around the turn of the century was from fish. They never could figure out how to best get rid of all the fish flavors, and as a result gelatin wasn\u2019t very popular as an ingredient. \n\nI think it\u2019s once they figured it out that everyone started having weird gelatin recipes (now that they didn\u2019t all taste like fish) and that\u2019s how we wound up having every food in the 50\u2019s embedded in Jello.",

I sent her a bunch of vids and she was so impressed by my seductive stripper skills that she asked if I could surprise her friends by posing as the Uber Eats guy and stripping for them.  Fuck yeah!  I\u2019ve always fantasized about this, i\u2019m an exhibitionist, what a dream.  We decide I\u2019ll deliver the food, and she\u2019ll make a joke like how much to take it all off...\n\nWe set up the plan, the time, etc and I go and pick up the food and come to deliver it.  I\u2019m wearing a man thong under my jeans, i\u2019m freshly groomed, I\u2019m rock fucking hard and I\u2019m nervous but excited.  I give myself a little fluff in the hallway and knock on the door.... which is answered by MY EX.  Like, not a kind of dated ex, but like lived with.  She is apparently friends of my friends friend (that makes sense, I read it back).  I\u2019ve always held a good job, and she looks at me with so much sympathy. Like shocked my life has come to this.  She asks why I\u2019m doing Uber Eats and I just say l need the extra money and she is like \u201cthat\u2019s so sad do you want to come in\u201d\n\nI hesitate, but come in and see my sexting friend. She\u2019s drunk and says \u201cheyyyyy uber eats,  how much to show me that cock!\u201d  Her friends laugh, but my ex is like, \u201cchill, this is my ex.  i feel so bad he\u2019s delivering food!\u201d or something along those lines.  Me and sexting girl share a weird look, she is confused as fuck.  I say I have to go, and race out of there.

I\u2019ll leave it at that\n\n- nothing wrong with uber eats, and surprised it\u2019s so well paying!  i have just had a \u201ccareer\u201d type job since college, so seeing this change of path seemed like I had fallen on hard times to my ex i\u2019m guessing, understandably \n\n- no i don\u2019t have an onlyfans lol.  but feel free to dm me i\u2019m happy to share",

This was my first fuck up. Unknowingly to me fibre causes MAD GAS. the kind noise that is only found by a heard of elephants running though a concrete desert. \n\nMonths have gone by and I started to sleep better than I ever had before due to the pills and diet change , forgetting all about the app. But one concerning thing was that my boyfriend was starting to feel distant. I would wake up in the morning and he would have made his way down to the couch until I got up and came down . No arguments nothing of the obvious I could wrap my pea brain around at the time but as anyone would I started to get suspicious there was someone else. \n\nAbout an hour ago , I remembered the app records noise and decided if I checked the app I should be able to tell what time he is getting up and leaving the bedroom and maybe see if his phone rings or anything of that sort to try to piece together why my lovely caveman was leaving me to go sleep downstairs. \n\nWELL LET ME TELL YOU. \nI Found out why.\nAnd I am about to reveal my sad embarrassing truth to you. \n\nI have been indiscriminately but vigorously farting the most thunderous claps from the depths of hell you can imagine. I mean there was 124 recordings from last night alone , as soon as I fall asleep I start letting them RIP unknowingly because of the strength of the sleepers. 124 times my sphincter deceived me . And to make it worse , I sleep on my side shimmied into him with my butt and back. So I\u2019ve been hitting him with the devils breath directly ON HIM. and after about 10 of these clappers you hear Rustling and footsteps and low mumbling of cursing the whole way until the door slams. \n\nSo my friends , do not take too much fibre and sleeping pills if you don\u2019t want your significant other to mildly dislike you and be distant \n\nTL;DR changed my diet to more fibre , took sleeping pills to knock me out , recorded myself blowing gas as strong as a whale coming up to breathe.\n\nEdit: since you guys are wondering I did bring it up to him when he first started to go to the couch and he just shrugged it off saying he\u2019s having a hard time sleeping in the bed  and I was not buying it lol\n\nEDIT: Okay so he is out for the evening , but I will text him now to confront him because you guys are making feel funny about it instead of embarrassed and I will come back with an update\n\nEdit ok it took me forever to figure out how to post photos to Reddit but I think I got it :\n\n[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/jZmwtLD?r) \n\n[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/74Z4yLI)\n\nEdit : I sent him this post and we are now having a great laugh about it. Thank you for all the stories I enjoyed every single one lol\n\nEdit Ok I\u2019m sorry for all the edits but the app is - sleep booster : auto tracker\nEdit: I recommend getting a different one for this one costs a fair bit to use the basic features while some are free for the same feats\n\nEdit : okay guys I will post the recordings when I go on break I\u2019m heading to work now\n\nEdit : still going to post the recordings on break but just wanted to address this because it\u2019s in every few comments -  I am a paramedic so my shifts are very long leaning from 12-16 hours and usually disable me from eating the last 4 hours ish of my shift for that is the busiest time .. Once I\u2019m off I eat and go straight to bed so I will be trying to prevent myself from doing that or packing extra lunch to snack on at work. Thank you all lol. \n\nEdit : okay last edit .. A lot of you have asked for the recording and a lot of you are asking for me not to post it. To safe my face and peoples ears, and If it\u2019s allowed I will just get you to inbox me if you want to hear it and I will send it when I can lol ( hopefully this is allowed and works )\n\nEdit: can anyone explain to me how to send a file through inbox lol\n\nOkay y\u2019all win I can\u2019t send them via inbox so here we go.

A microscope for only 5 bucks.\n\nIt was in great condition and still had all the little extras since it was made for kids. As soon as I got home, i needed to examine everything. So I grabbed a thin slice of cucumber, and than a leaf. I was astonished how well it worked given that it was for kids. I then used a drop of blood, and you could see the red blood cells in all their glory.\n\nSo I thought what every guy probably would have done. I know it's no nut November, but i was eager to look at my future children while they were still inside my balls. So I pulled up a nice video from my girlfriend and started to masturbate. I managed it to catch all of my cum in a petri dish, and used a pipette to add a bit to the microscope slide. I was so excited. \n\nAs I slowly upped the magnification, i needed to adjust the focus. And there I saw my sperm. But it wasn't moving. Not one bit. I was shocked and didn't knew what to do. So I made an appointment at my urologist to make an infertility test. And now k know it officially that I'm indeed infertile. Sorry mom and dad, as an only child, it seems like out family genes end here.\n\n\nTL;DR used a microscope to look at my semen, only to realize I'm infertile",

His exact words, we had about a 1/10,000,000 shot of ever having kids.  A 1/30,000,000 chance of having them healthy.

But it looked really bad: no fetus on ultrasound, blood chemistry was batshit crazy.  We were told that there was a 99.9% chance that this was a miscarriage.  Well, our son is 16 months old now.  Both completely healthy in every way, both scoring as extremely mentally advanced in their checks.

Alternate account because I don't want my family reading this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my wife and I were trying to get in the mood tonight. It's been a rough couple of weeks as I am sure it has been for everyone. I'm a physician dealing with coronavirus at work while experiencing a massive paycut, meanwhile my wife's been working from home while managing the kids who have been home from school. Needless to say we've had a lot of anxiety and stress on our plate but we're committed to making time for each other. \n\nSo we are getting in bed and she wants me to tie her up and tickle her. I get her in position and give her a little slap to get things started, and I mean a little slap. Suddenly, she starts crying. Initially, I thought it was a joke but she just kept going. Within a few seconds she's sobbing, tears are everywhere. I undo her knots and try to comfort her with little success. The floodgates open and she starts pouring out about her worries with the mortgage, my health, and on and on. After what felt like an eternity, she begins to calm down. \n\nObviously, I'm no longer in the mood and I didn't think she was either, so I suggest we just go to bed. She feels guilty and insists we can still have sex. I tell her it's ok let's just go to bed. We go back and forth about this for a bit. Then I start to roll away but I guess in her guilt she grabs my pants and frantically starts to pull them down. Before I can stop her she accidentally grabs my penis and yanks it like a lawnmower starter. I drop to the floor in agony and she suddenly realizes what she just did... so seconds later we're now both rolling on the bed crying. I ended up with a rug-burn in a very sensitive spot and after another eternity of crying, my wife's face is beet-red and puffy. \n\ntldr: I slapped my wife during foreplay and she cried, in her guilt for killing the mood, she tried to take my pants off and yanked on my dick giving me a rug-burn.",

        "selftext": "This happened in February of last year, but my friends have been telling me I need to post this story online \u2026 so here goes nothing:\n\nMy wife and I (both 31 years old, at the time) moved into a new three-unit apartment building in San Francisco.  One of our neighbors is a 70-something year old retired veteran, we\u2019ll call him Joe.  For context, Joe is a white American guy and he\u2019s also a devout Hindu priest.  One day I run into Joe in my hallway, and he tells me about this charity he manages for a community in Bangladesh.  I wanted to support my neighbor and the charity, so I ask Joe to send me the GoFundMe link.\n\nThe next day at work, I go on the GoFundMe page and donate $150.  Or so I thought.  Moments later, I get a text on my phone warning me of an unusually large transaction on my credit card.  I\u2019m confused and swipe to open the text message. It says I have made a payment of $15,041 to GoFundMe.  Immediately I\u2019m sweating.  How could I have donated FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS?  I spend the next 10-15 minutes retracing my steps, and finally I realize my credit card starts with the numbers 4 and 1.  It seems I had accidentally started typing my credit card information while my cursor was still in the donation box, and just like that 150 became 15041.  Yikes.\n\nI call GoFundMe\u2019s support line in a panic, and when I finally connect with a human I explain what happened.  \u201cNo need to worry\u201d, he tells me, they will initiate a refund of the transaction which should process in 3-7 business days.  That\u2019s a huge relief.  But then I ask the agent if the charity will be able to see the donation on the GoFundMe page until it is refunded.  \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the agent asks me.  \u201cWhat do YOU mean what do I mean?\u201d was my response.  \u201cWill they be able to see the $15,041 donation?!\u201d  Unfortunately, yes, the agent tells me.  They will be able to see it until the refund process is complete.  I tell him that\u2019s a big problem, as the entire GoFundMe had hardly raised that much at that point.  Surely they will notice their fundraiser doubling overnight?\n\nMy plan was to knock on Joe\u2019s door the following morning to give him the full story, so that he could pass it along to his contacts in Bangladesh.  But when I woke up the next morning, I looked at my phone and saw I had 40+ notifications on Facebook.  Someone had sent me a friend request, had liked many of my old posts, and had sent me many messages. Immediately I was concerned when I saw that the individual messaging me had a Hindu name, but I never could have imagined what I saw when I opened his first message\u2026\n\nThe man had sent me a video of himself from Bangladesh, surrounded by dozens of impoverished and hungry people holding bags of food, thanking me BY NAME (Michael) for my generous donation.  A big round of applause for Michael.  At this point, I\u2019ve leapt out of my bed and I\u2019m pacing.  Part of me wants to scream, part of me wants to crack up laughing.  I start swiping through the man\u2019s messages, and it is picture after picture after picture of poor Bangladeshis thanking me for my kind donation.  Literally hundreds of photos of frail, elderly, disabled, and malnourished individuals holding signs with my name.  Thank you, Michael.  Thank you, Michael.  I've uploaded a portion of the video, and a few photos, for you guys to see here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/tROXniV](https://imgur.com/gallery/tROXniV)\n\nNeedless to say, I couldn\u2019t live with myself just donating $150 after seeing how the community responded to the $15,041.  I decided the least I could do was to add a zero, and so I donated $1,500 once the original donation was refunded.  The charity\u2019s host was incredibly gracious and understanding, and he explained to me that $1,500 goes very far in Bangladesh for urgent food relief.  Here is the charity\u2019s new GoFundMe link if you want to check it out: [https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-food-relief-assistance-in-bangladesh](https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-food-relief-assistance-in-bangladesh)\n\nUltimately I think the whole experience was a win-win.  I helped a great cause, and I got a funny story out of it.\n\nTL;DR: Some impoverished folks in Bangladesh thought I had sent them $15,041 but it was an accident and I had to request a refund for most of it.\n\nEDIT:  Many are asking why there is no $1,500 donation listed in the fund\u2019s donation history.  I donated to an old campaign link for the same charity.  It is readily findable online, if you feel compelled to search for it.",

I spent the amount of the fund raiser buying supplies for different schools and doing things like funding a lunch program for a year and supporting an after school program that keeps kids safe and a home for girls saved from human trafficking and organ harvesting. Seriously amazing to have the ability to help so many people. (your dollar is worth about 10X what it is here--meaning your $1500 donation has the buying power of $15,000).\n\nI also spent a pretty decent amount of my own money. When the month ended, I decided to pay for my own hotel (a non profit was paying to bring me over to Bangladesh). This meant they had more money to spend on students and I was so honored by the whole experience that I was happy to make such a donation.\n\nI have to mention that during this time I was being bombarded by messages from all over the world. Seriously, the media attention had gone a little nuts and my inbox was often full of hundred of messages.\n\nI returned from the trip and my husband was kind of horrified how much I spent. But, he and I kind of tightened our belts and caught up.\n\nAbout three years later I turn on Go Fund Me for something and find that I never had the money transferred in to my bank account. They had emailed me over and over but I never responded  and it was all returned to the people who made the donation. No wonder my husband freaked out about how much I spent. The entire amount on go fund me was never put in the account. It was all out of pocket. I never looked at how much I spent (to save myself the shock--so I never caught that it hadn't been deposited. (Husband does all the finances).\n\nStill, we both knew great good was done with the money and we've never been sorry we spent the money. Just sorry I'm such an idiot.",

However, once I, or the machine, failed and the customer put in their 4 number pin, adding 4(!) Digits to their total. Since it didn't go through the first time they gave the pin again resulting in them paying about 80k $ for a cod filet. My boss laughed but refunded the money, off course.",

This is a very small school, grades 9 to 12 with only about 150 people, so most people know each other.\n\n\nOne day, during lunch, sitting with my friends, one of them asks if I have a boyfriend.  I was a bit confused, then it dawned on me.  I immediately joined in with the lgbt \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 crowd, and they all thought I was gay.

        "selftext": "I've been laughing at myself for the whole of today so I thought I would share this with you, it's probably not as funny as I think it is, but alas. \n\nFor context, I've just finished school and I'm looking for temporary jobs over the summer so I can get a bit of money for when university starts. I have been looking at a number of job sites and I have applied for three jobs. I have the setting to search for temporary jobs near me when I saw another advert. \n\nThis was for a job at a well-known shoe company that has two separate stores in my city. On the job advert, it didn't say which one the vacancy was for, it just said in Edinburgh. This is where I'm from. So I started the application process and put in my details and CV. Now it was all going well until there was a slightly confusing question asking if I had the right to work in the USA. \n\nNow, this definitely confused me but I ticked no and opened the job advert again. I searched it from my computer and it still said the job was in Edinburgh and that it was within 5 miles of me.  I thought huh, strange but I'll tick no and if they don't want me I won't hear from them, no big deal. \n\nAnyway later on I received an email saying they had checked my CV and they wanted to conduct a virtual interview. I was very surprised because it was less than a day after I had applied but I was happy that I thought I might have a job there. So I selected the time for 1 pm the next day (today) thinking nothing more of it. I'm good at interviews so I didn't feel the need to prep. \n\nAnyway, I got a very polite email shortly before the interview from a very confused manager of the store who had looked at my details. \n\nHe asked me why I was applying for a job in Edinburgh Indiana when I was based in Scotland. When I read the email my jaw absolutely dropped because the job wasn't \"In Edinburgh\" it was IN Edinburgh, Edinburgh Indiana USA. \n\nI'm not from the USA so it never dawned on me that it could be a state code and not just in Edinburgh Scotland. I sent him a very apologetic email but I'm just glad he noticed before what I imagine would be an incredibly awkward job interview, although that definitely would have been a good laugh. \n\nIf this does well I'm sure I can link the job interview and his email in case anyone wants to make sure this actually happened but I can't be bothered right now. \n\nTLDR: Accidentally applied for a job in a town with the exact same name as mine 6000 km away and didn't notice until a store manager sent me a polite email asking why I was applying there.\n\nEdit [IN-Edinburgh rather than Edinburgh, IN. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/7Lkoy06)\n\n[The rather confused manager's email (with names and emails omitted.)](https://imgur.com/gallery/o0izb66)\n\n[My reply to the manager](https://imgur.com/gallery/BdMqWZj)\n\nEdit: I'm so happy to read though all your comments and to have made so many people laugh. I'm trying to get through and reply to as many comments as I can but I'm really happy to have made some people day better!\n\nEdit: Also thanks for making me feel less stupid with all your amazing stories about messing up and booking places in opposite parts of the USA, States and whole different continents!\n\nEdit: I've been trying to work my way through all of your comments but I'm going to bed now and I don't know if I will do that tomorrow as well. Thanks so much though.",

When we were in Indiana we were travelling along the interstate only to have our sat nav divert us onto local roads due to an accident. Unfortunately I was unfamiliar with the speed limit and was keeping pace with two other vehicles, thinking I was okay. This caught the attention of two patrol cars that pulled the three of us over.\n\nSheriff/trooper/officer (had a tan hat, why so many forces?) comes to my vehicle and asks for registration and licence. Before looking at my documents he asks me where I am from and where I am headed. Flustered as I am, I respond with Edinburgh and Chicago. \n\nI proceed to get a mild tongue lashing for not following the posted limits in my hometown. Manage to interrupt and say I'm not from here but Scotland. He takes a moment to now look at my documents, see I'm not from Edinburgh Indiana, but Edinburgh Scotland and tells me he'll be right back.\n\nSo I wait and see the other officer appears to be writing tickets for the cars I was keeping up with. Figure my road trips going to be getting a bit more expensive and I'll not be able to visit Indiana again (weekend so guessing courts closed for paying fines and I'm not sticking around). \n\nSo I wait and the officer comes back, gives me my documents and sends me on my way promising I'll not speed again.

On Wednesday\u2019s our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it\u2019s a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we\u2019ll call her Sarah (changed). She\u2019s quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here\u2019s where the first fuck up happens.\n   While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah\u2019s right knocker my words start to trail off. \u201cDamn I hope everyone is oka.....\u201d that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said \u201cthat\u2019s funny I haven\u2019t had that much action in a while\u201d which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying \u201cahh well we all have our dry spells.\u201d Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. \n   We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what\u2019s up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn\u2019t care about that and that it was fine it\u2019s just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.\n\nTLDR: I yanked a widows titty\n\nedit:*formatting* p.s. - damn I didn't check this for hours until I got home, thanks for all the kind words and your internet points, I never thought I'd be given gold for stopping short thanks!",

She was sensible to the topic. You didn't know.\n\nThe thing to do -> Show concern about her reaction. \"I'm terribly sorry, I had no idea.\"\n\nShe says it's okay. \n\nYou're empathetic in the moment and find a way to cheer her up later.

I ask how many kids she has and she doesn\u2019t answer.  I look over at her and she is barely keeping herself together.  Eventually she she whispers that she had three but lost her youngest in an auto accident. Oh man I felt like shit for bringing this up.  I give her my condolences and ask when this happened.

I go white and probably look like the most guilty person in the world, I\u2019m not really good at being accused of shit I always look guilty even if I did nothing. Now I truly have no idea where this mascara came from, I was in a pretty new house with several roommates and hadn\u2019t had any girls prior to her in my room. Luckily we were early in the relationship, but it still took two days of talking about it and me getting my roommates to vouch for the fact I hadn\u2019t had anyone over. She got over it and we\u2019ve been together almost 20 years married for ten, but every now and then I still hear about it. \n\nI still have no idea where that damn mascara came from, but I have some theories. First theory is my roommates girlfriend was scandalous and would\u2019ve been totally capable of trying to sabotage me just to see some drama (a theory confirmed as possible by said roommate). My second theory is it was just a test by my girlfriend just to see what I\u2019d do.

            "Honestly, this is a shining example of one of those relationship \"issues\" that present themselves that don't really have one perfect solution. Just comes down to the quality of communication between the two of you and how much you trust each other. It is totally normal, as well as understandable, for her to have doubts; however, if you and her truly have strong communication methods, you won't have to worry about this in the long term. As someone who can both relate to, and appreciate her side of this story, just know that she will let it go in time. Just keep on being you and she will know you can always be trusted.

Thus, our family (dad, mom, daughter, son, daughter - I'm one of the kids) are all familiar with 99% of each other's non-dryclean wardrobe.  One day dad strolls in and spots an underwear pile.  He grabs a black thong from the top and says to my mother in a booming voice \"Ooh la la, why don't you wear these for me more often?\" Mom promptly responds \"Because they're your daughters.\" Dad quickly tosses them back with an eew and ugh sound matched with a spinal shiver as he hastened his retreat.

She went nuts claiming they weren't hers and they were some other womans etc etc.\n\nLong story short, we end up getting back together, I threw away most of the clothes that she claimed weren't hers except for a jacket and something else (they were in a different spot in the house so missed tossing them).\n\nOne day, she asks if she had left a jacket at my place recently, I pull out the old jacket (not the one she is looking for), she is shocked and had no idea she had left that at my place. I then pull out the other piece of clothing (like a shirt or something) and she had no idea she had left that either.

In that time I tried to figure out ANY explanation as to who\u2019s they could legit be. Then I remembered. About a week prior, I had pulled out the washer and dryer and cleaned out the mess under them. Dirt, lint, trash, and a few clothes. I remembered there were for sure several socks, and I think a pair a panties as well. Then I remembered that she had a girl friend from outta state stay with us for a week like 8 months earlier as well. They HAD to be hers. Once she finally answered my call, I told her my thoughts. She was still VERY angry, but chose to give me a chance. She took a pic of the panties and sent it to her friend asking if they were hers. Her friend had replied back that they were indeed hers. She actually apologized I guess as well, because she surmised that once she realized she didn\u2019t have them after returning home, she had to have left them at our place.

Anyways, the day comes for us to pack up and leave; my wife had to leave for work so I was giving every room a once over, and find another pair of my wife's underwear under the bed we were using, although this time the dog hadn't eaten them. So I call my wife and tell her I found another pair of hers that were thankfully unscathed, to which she replies that she already packed all of hers. I protest, describing them to her: a pink thong with yellow flowers on it. She busts out laughing. Why? She owns no such thong. My stomach drops into my lower intestine as the realization sets in that I am holding in my bare hands a thong belonging to either the mother or one of her teenage daughters.

This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.\n\nLate last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.\n\nThough I\u2019ve always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn\u2019t. In the meantime a cardiologist said \u201cTough shit\u201d and bumped up the meds.\n\nDuring the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.\n\nFlash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must\u2019ve been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled \u201cmetoprolol doping\u201d, there it was. I still haven\u2019t told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?\n\nTL:DR Started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",

            "Metoprolol keeps your heart rate lower but it really doesn't have all that much effect on your nerves. It's a selective beta-blocker for receptors on the heart. Propanolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that works on the brain as well as the heart and has more of the calming side effects (which is why it's prescribed for essential tremor). Also 25mg twice a day is a really low dose. I doubt the beta-blocker is doing much for you, it is all your skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: am a cardiologist",

            ".Chances are the competition is regulated by a body under the US Anti-Doping Agency. If you want to do this by the book, you should likely [seek a Therapeutic Use Exemption](https://www.usada.org/substances/tue/determine/). That process permits athletes to use drugs that are normally prohibited if they need them for medical purposes..\n\nProfessional athletes and their coaches and medical staff will be more familiar with this process. To my knowledge, amateur athletes probably don't use it much. They are much more rarely tested, and they probably just don't connect the dots sometimes, and anyway the perceived stakes are lower.\n\nNormally, beta blockers in shooting sports would be a huge no-no, but I don't know how many professional athletes in those sports have documented arrhythmia. I also don't know how receptive USADA would be to giving you a TUE for metoprolol. My impression, based on [this document](https://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/TUE_guidance-cardiovascular-conditions.pdf), is that there should be no reasonable therapeutic alternative (I haven't read the statute referenced in the flow diagram), and that there should be a significant impairment to your health if the medication is withheld, and that the medication in question should not confer any advantages beyond a return to normal health. That last one could be a sticking point in your case.\n\nYou might want to seek professional help on this one. If the club has a coach, ask that person. I know this sounds like a strict process, but many people would abuse these drugs. Heck, many **amateur athletes** have abused drugs like testosterone and EPO. For example, low testosterone is something that I bet a lot of aging clinics could push the limits on a diagnosis for, so that stuff is probably much more easily abused, and hence USADA would regulate it a lot more strictly.\n\nThat said, you do have documented cardiac arrhythmia. That is something that I assume would wreck your heart if left untreated. I don't think you have done anything substantively wrong, provided your account above is truthful.\n\nLast, I don't know what the competition landscape for shooting sports is like, and what sort of potential you have. I am not sure I would choose this option, but if you get advice that TUEs for metoprolol aren't possible to get, and that you also wouldn't be that competitive (e.g. you don't have the potential to rise to a high level amateur competitor, e.g. cat 2 or cat 1 in cycling), you could just keep competing for fun and not disclose. You **do this at your own risk**, and you have to judge how much advantage beta blockers might confer. Unfortunately, they sound quite considerable.\n\nDisclosure: I have ADHD, and I do take amphetamines. I should seek a TUE for those. Currently, I compete on occasion in low level amateur races, and I don't take my meds on race day (usually I just take a break on the weekends anyway). I should technically get a TUE. However, I do also consider that low-dose amphetamines would confer a pretty minimal advantage compared to testosterone or EPO, so I think this is not clearly ethically wrong. That said, this post reminds me that maybe I should just suck it up and do it.",

        "selftext": "\n\nOkay so this literally just happened. Im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. \n\nOn Snapchat we have a work group chat that I post on pretty frequently. Well tonight my SO asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. I always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. So apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. \n\nI realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. Since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. It wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. Its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow \n\n\nTL;DR Dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat\n\n\nUpdate: So im not getting fired luckily. Im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. Ive heard so many Michael Jackson just beat it references its unreal. The group chat is mostly comprised of people I go to college with. Even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. My boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  Also holy fuck this blew up! Thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.\n\nEdit 2: People think im lying so group chat image for proof added https://imgur.com/cUKvx5w.jpg\n\n\nEdit 3: just got off work, and apparently people still dont believe thus happened  so heres me and my SO conversation after it happened.  With the time on  the SS cause I sent it to the group chat so they knew what was going on\n https://imgur.com/H8eJnLg.jpg",

Usually I see a lot of colors, fly through space tunnels, that kind of thing. It\u2019s very relaxing. Not today. Today I saw dicks. Dicks everywhere. I flew through a tunnel of dicks. I twirled through a field of dicks. I looked through a kaleidoscope of dicks.

I\u2019m only interested in my husband\u2019s dick, which I\u2019m sure was in there somewhere.

I\u2019ve been able to reduce my other medications which had side effects I didn\u2019t like, and I\u2019ve been able to go off of anti-anxiety medications completely. (3) I don\u2019t do recreational drugs and have never tried anything like that\u2014not even weed. I also only have maybe ten drinks per year. (4) My doctor is the one who said I don\u2019t get a recreational dose. He was really clear about that. Maybe he was downplaying things so I wouldn\u2019t seek out illegal ketamine. I\u2019m very creative, and my doctor has told me I\u2019m \u201chighly suggestible\u201d and that I have the most vivid ketamine dreams of any of his patients. Not sure if that makes a difference. I would most definitely not try anything recreationally. (5) I\u2019m not a doctor and not in the medical field. I don\u2019t know if ketamine treatments will help you. They help me, but YMMV. I felt relief within 72 hours of my first infusion.",

            "Ketamine is one hell of a drug.  A few years back I got to experience what a compound fracture of the wrist felt like.  After a 6 hour ride on morphine and other painkillers that barely did their job, the docs came to the conclusion that they had to put me out, snap my wrist back in place, and wrap it up.  Administered Ketamine.  One of the Thor movies was playing, and the scene playing before I dropped was in the Bifrost (Rainbow teleporty magic beam in space, for those not familiar).\n\nMy next 4 hours consisted of me being sent and received by doctors through Bifrosts between hundreds of parallel realities and dimensions.  Every single time, they said \u201cSee you on the other side!\u201d Then I would fling through the Bifrost at what in my Ketamine world felt like 300mph, followed be an abrupt stop and a kind but sinister sounding \u201cYou ready?\u201d\n\nI woke up at about midnight.  I was unbelievably out of it, could barely talk or move because my body felt like it was made of molten lead.  I looked over to my mom, eyelid still hung almost entirely over my eyes, and with the most squeaky, confused,  slurred voice, asked a very simple question.\n\n\u201cAm... am I... fuhhh... fuckin\u2019 high?\u201d\n*through laughter* \u201cYes, Southpaw, you are high.\u201d\n\u201cOh.

Exactly the same as recreationally putting yourself in a k-hole. Where do I sign up?\n\n\nedit: guys you can stop explaining what ketamine is like to me.

            "I had ketamine once, they gave it to me for a broken arm so they could realign it or something.  This was before the actual surgery I believe.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m allergic to it because when I was experiencing the effects it was probably one of the worst things ever. I literally just get a sense of dread from seeing the word. I have still never forgotten what I saw.\n\nI remember it all and it seemed to last forever, the edge of my vision was red and bloodshot and the faces of nurses and doctor\u2019s were horrifying. They had no eyes just empty pits. Super pale skin and Blood all over their clothing and pouring from their mouths. Their mouths, when opened were just black holes as well. The whole world was shaking too, not too crazy but just shifting slowly. It was nauseating. Kinda like being on a boat I guess.\n\nSuffice to say, it was like I was in actual hell. I could see them holding me down and from my point of view (the Jedi are evil) it was like being restrained by zombies or demons.. I remember fighting a lot to try and break free but I couldn\u2019t. At the same time it just seemed to me like they were laughing like lunatics and about to eat me alive.. which made it even worse.\n\nIn the end I did finally wake up and was so goddamn relieved. This was when I was like 15 so like 9 years ago. I remember my mom telling me how all the staff were so confused and had never seen anything like it. Apparently I\u2019d attacked a few doctors and nurses and it took a lot to get me to stop.  They had to have multiple people hold me down in the bed all the while my fuckin arm is snapped like a twig. I felt like such an asshole but I honestly thought I was never going to wake up and just wanted out. \n\nSo ever since I\u2019ve made it a point for whenever I go under any kind of sedation to DEFINITELY not go under ketamine haha",

We were all sitting in their living room and I had got some DMT before coming to the city as many of us wanted to try it. Theres like 10-15 of us all good friends so we figured we do it in kinda shifts, 4 would sit on the \"cuddle puddle\" just a pile of softness and take their hits while the rest would do the prep, music, visuals and stuff. \n\nI'm in the first round of people to go and I take my puffs and start blasting off when our other friends who had not returned yet crash through the door with some crazy story how they just saw someone eating ass in the middle of the show.\n\nCue them talking about ass eating and me spending the next 15 minutes but what felt like forever drifting through a universe if purple-blue liquid energy that was dancing to the breathe of the universe. It would breathe in and the liquid would become a puddle in the dark universe being drawn to the breather, on exhale the puddle would expand shining wonderous colors across the darkness all taking shape, the shape of... things eating ass, liquid energy humanoid ass-eating. I drifted through the flashes of cosmic nothing and chromatic rim jobs until reaching the end where the breather was inhaling and exhaling all that is.\n\n I got close enough and was sucked up during an inhalation and fell down this trans dimensional esophagus like tube of color before falling into a giant pool of liquid that looked like the cosmos, if all the distant bodies of universe, like the colorful clouds of galaxies were all intergalactic ass eating champions going to town on eachother.

As we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead I could feel something was terribly wrong. \n\nI heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror.

I was fairly busy making several drinks with my back to my service window. Next to my machine I have several drink carriers with handles. The lady sees them and asks if she can have the carrier with handles for her drinks, I tell her I\u2019m sorry but those carriers are only for the Whites. \n\nAs soon as the words left my mouth I could have died. I dropped the smoothie I was working on and did an about face so fast the truck rocked. \n\nI looked at the lady, the black lady, and just started apologizing, trying to explain. \n\nThe Whites are a family of 7. The father comes by twice a week gets drinks for the family and at some point he bought and gave me X amount of carriers for him to use to make his trips easier. Turns out she knows the Whites, she goes to church with them. Thank you, Jesus. \n\nShe couldn\u2019t have been nicer over the ordeal and I still feel horrible about the whole thing. \n\nI have since put the carriers out of view.\n\nTL;DR I told a black lady the drink carriers are only for the White family, but made it sound like they were only for the white families.",

            "I had a South African biology teacher and she told us a story of  a P.E. teacher who had come from the UK to teach at her school. \n\nAs most secondary school gym classes go, kids are usually split into teams and for convenience sake it's(in Europe at least) based on what you're wearing. Due to Europes 'lack' of....I'm not sure what I'm looking for but the type of attitude towards racism is very different for us here. \n\nSo when it came to seperating the teams in gym class the British teacher asks the children to seperate between 'coloured' and 'whites'. While he was sorting out some stuff, the children differentiated themselves based on what they understood to be 'coloured' and 'whites', which to them was a racial thing. So when the teacher saw that they had stopped moving, he looked up and with visible confusion asked why they weren't seperated into coloured and whites? To which the kids said they were. After a moment of observation the teacher had realised his mistake and had to explain that he was referring to their clothing, not the colour of their skin, but being South Africa that's what the children understood.",

The woman working the counter took it as a personal offense and had to be pulled away by her manager to have it hastily explained that yes, the station was once owned by a family whose last name could be misunderstood...\n\nShe said to me when she got home, \"I really should have found a better way to say it than, 'Hey, do the Dikes still own this place?'\"",

        "selftext": "This actually did happen within the last 24 hours, I'm still lying in bed trying to recover. \n\nSo, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.\n\nI figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.\n\nWe cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn't feel a damn thing.\n\nWe started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn't feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.\n\nTurns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this \"big deal\" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!\n\nWe were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might've been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. \n\nWe threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.\n\nTLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.\n\nEdit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?\n\nEdit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. \n\nEdit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn't do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You're **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.\n\nEdit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn't much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.\n\n**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We're enjoying them! \n1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.\n2. There's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.\n3. There's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind. ",

            "Reminds me of my first experience with edibles. I was a huge stoner at the time, I'd been smoking daily for years so I figured it couldn't be that intense. Before it was legalized not many people had edibles unless they were a grower or knew one. So weed is finally legal in Oregon so I grow 3 plants, one of them was a fucking hermaphrodite so I had to chop it almost a month early so it wouldn't pollinate my other two girls. It was harsh and tasted awful since it was harvested early, but it still yielded an ounce of sticky bud that was absolutely loaded with trichomes, I couldn't just throw it out. Took the whole ounce and made weed butter in a slow cooker, baked a batch of brownies and I think we cut them into 12. I ate one brownie, no idea how much THC was in it but about 30 minutes in I was baked as fuck. It was fun at first I was laughing and having a good time, but I kept getting higher and higher until eventually I was feeling sick and starting to panic. I laid awake in bed freaking out for about an hour and then passed out for 12 hours, when I woke up I was still high as fuck, not freaking out anymore, but I felt like I'd just smoked a few bowls. In total I'd say I was stoned for about 20 hours. That shit was ridiculous, never again.  ",

It was meant to be broken into quarters and advertised it was made from 7g of Cannabis (which seems like a ridiculous amount to me, so maybe I remember that incorrectly).\n\nI ducked into a bathroom stall and ate the entire thing in one go, hopping into the security line still munching. I surveyed the room and realised there's at least 300 people in the line and my flight is in about 60 minutes, I think I've missed my flight home to Sydney. 5 min into the line I get bomb checked and come up positive. Twice.\n\nI get escorted to a small room, bypassing the massive line that is security and get watched closely as some TSA dude goes through my bag and swabs everything. By now the brownie is kicking in because I've had nothing to eat in about 20 hours but coffee. Nothing comes up positive again and they take a few things off me (deodorant, mouth wash etc) then just straight up leave the room with me, my bag and the confiscated things.\n\nI put all my confiscated stuff back in my bag and make it to my gate and I'm one of the last to board, I'm pretty fucking high by now. A guy with a French accent took another bag which was apparently too big and said 'I promise I'll get your bags to you', which I thought was a very strange thing to say and side note: my bag turned up 3 days later.\n\nBy the time I get on the plane, I'm nearly falling asleep while walking, like literally fighting myself to stay awake. Some how I managed to stay awake for my meal (maybe was drifting in and out of sleep). I ate my whole meal ASAP and promptly fall asleep.\n\nI wake up to a flight attendant shaking me gently saying 'sir, we need you to put your chair upright, we are beginning to descend for our landing'.\n\nI slept 14 hours on a direct flight LAX to Sydney and woke up high. I struggle a lot to sleep on planes at all, so this was a miracle.\n\n10/10 would do again."

        "selftext": "This happened last month.\n\nI have a wonderful wife, and even though we are in our late thirties and have three kids, we still like to copulate on a recreational level. \n\nNow, my wife can be hard to please. She\u2019s a slow starter, and has a hard time reaching an orgasm from intercourse, which means that once I\u2019m finished I\u2019m dedicated to helping her reach the finish line too. This can take an additional 90 minutes from any previous coital activities. Frankly, it\u2019s the hardest workout of my life, and often leaves me with a tennis elbow and inability to pronounce words for 30 minutes after. On the plus side I often don\u2019t have time to do the dishes after.\n\nNow, I\u2019d say I\u2019m more of an attentive lover than a good one. I tend to think of the female orgasm as a beat \u2018em up on Playstation \u2014 if I just push all the buttons something special has to happen sooner or later. Over the years I\u2019ve come to identify which buttons my wife likes to have pressed, and I\u2019ve realized part of her being a slow starter stems from her being able to orgasm multiple times until she reaches a huge finale with a standing ovation, fireworks etc.\n\nThis means that any amorous activities need to fit into our packed time schedule. It had been a while since we were able to put the little monsters asleep at a reasonable time, which had probably led to a loss of form on my behalf.\n\nLast month we were able to git \u2018er done, as our local priest likes to put it.\n\nThis time, like an amateur, I tried to match her and make her reach climax first. So I\u2019m mixing intense lovemaking with pulling out and going to town on her to help her reach her destination.\n\nThrough no fault of my own, my wife seems to enjoy it. She is having multiple of the minor orgasms, and I\u2019m clinging on for dear life, hoping that she will reach the big one already, and also trying very hard to remember not to say that out loud. I\u2019m a sweaty mess, the room is really warm, and I\u2019d like to take a break for a sip of water and turning a fan on. Or to send in a replacement. Also, we will probably have to buy a new sofa.\n\nWe keep going at it, my pelvis is thrusting like a jackhammer on the fritz, and my tummy is making weird sounds.\n\nSuddenly, my entire stomach decides that if I\u2019m dumb enough to keep going despite its many warnings, it will take matters into its own hands. \n\nThe worst pain I\u2019ve ever suffered suddenly hits me mid-thrust, as my intestines try to break free of their confinement. I fold like Rivaldo during the World Cup 2002, doubling over on top of my wife, who thinks I can no longer resist her sexiness and am about to fall asleep in five minutes. \u201cI love you\u201d, she whispers in my ear. \u201cI\u2019m dying,\u201d I croak in return.\n\nI finally push myself to my feet, and try to make it to my phone on the TV table to call 911. It\u2019s no good. I fall to the floor in a little ball of pain. It feels like the stomach is trying to rearrange the guts but can\u2019t decide where everything goes. After what feels like an eternity, the crashing waves of pain start to ebb out.\n\nMy wife stands over me with a slightly worried expression. \u201cYou ok?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust cramps,\u201d  I pant as I realize what just happened to me, finally realizing why people would drown from cramps.\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d She\u2019s quiet for a beat. \u201cCan we go again?\u201d\n\nI have spent the last month getting real exercise in a gym, and taking up stretching. I\u2019ve also realized that if I ever come close to dying, I\u2019m properly fucked unless my wife has been too.\n\nTLDR: The one time I didn\u2019t please my wife it nearly killed me.\n\nEdit: Someone gave me a \u201cI\u2019m deceased\u201d award, and I want to say thank you and that this was a close one, but I\u2019m still very much alive.\n\nEdit2: Holy crap, this is blowing up. I\u2019m trying to respond to all of you and the comments are a truly entertaining read! To those of you calling it a humblebrag or a boast about having sex \u2014 Hell yes I got laid! But I also try to explain that much of the time I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, so I\u2019m not trying to toot my own horn here. I leave the tooting of horns to my wife.\n\nEdit3: I would like to give a big thank you to all the wonderful people who have given rewards for this post. Thank you!\n\nAs for my TLDR, a lot of people are unhappy with it. I\u2019m sorry for that; it\u2019s the result of being a first-time poster in this subreddit. I don\u2019t want to change it now after the fact, but I\u2019ll try to improve on it if I ever fuck up again.",

Any time she tried to force it faster, I would stop entirely and wait. Something about the anticipation and buildup REALLY worked for her.

I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.\n\nTL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office.",

You know if you don't go they'll know something is up. So I head home and my mother and sisters are sitting in the kitchen. My moms like, there are some tacos for you in the microwave. So I hit start and nuke em, trying to play it cool. The buzzer goes off and I take my plate and open up my tacos to put hot sauce on them. Well, my brain couldn't put together what I was looking at. I look at my mother and loudly exclaim, why is there fucking scrambled eggs on my tacos? My sister starts cracking up. She says, that's cheese dumb ass. I was so fucked up I still couldn't figure out why there was cheese on my tacos. I had a grin ear to ear and just exited to my room to eat. Didn't come out all night.",

As the awesome uncle that I am, I decided to trip my balls elsewhere for the hour required, and proceeded to have a blast playing with the loudest fucking toys in existence, while watching my nieces. These toys were hilariously ridiculous, and the girls and I had a blast laughing at them.

Maybe I have a high tolerance due to my use of mushrooms. That was rookie mistake number two. We are only 12 blocks from the dorms. It is now nighttime and I'm beginning to see tracers as I drive which is not a good thing. I quickly realize I'm way too fucked up to be driving once I hit the four block section of road construction that is lit up with the orange flashing lights, lots of orange cones, and I still believe to this day an unnatural and unneeded large number of striped construction barrels.\nNot one of my passengers can help me navigate as I'm blinded by oncoming traffic headlights, orange tracers that just do not stop and barraged with their ceaseless screams and maniacal laughter.\nI'd read a lot of Hunter S Thompson in high school, but it didn't prepare me at all.\nI didn't kill anyone driving home that night.

            "How on earth are people believing this?? ",
            "Honestly, as a VR owner, it sounds fabricated.\n\nVR is fun and all, but it's resolution isn't entirely convincing. Even at a glance, you can still see the pixels in what is often referred to as \"the screen door effect.\" PSVR may have eliminated the fine lines that separate the pixels in other, more high-end machines with higher resolutions, but the blurring and pixellation is still visible.\n\nPlus, VR headsets, at present, are actually quite heavy, and as a consequence, the straps to hold them onto your head tend to be quite tight.\n\nDOUBLE PLUS - they get warm over time. If you wore one for a significant period whilst sleeping, it would almost certainly generate enough heat to make you notice it's presence. Itchy, sweaty, and hot.\n\nTRIPLE PLUS - The VR headset has a lower FOV than your actual vision. It's about 90 degrees in front of you, or something close to that. As a result, you have a thick black boundary around the edge of the screens that you cannot fail to notice. It's like wearing reverse sunglasses - everything outside of the lenses is completely black.\n\nQUADROUPLE PLUS - Daylight tends to creep in around the edges of the 'one size fits all' headset in the parts where 'one size' doesn't really 'fit all.' This is also extremely noticeable.\n\nQUINTOUPLE PLUS - Wires. You'd notice the wires. Unless you're using mobileVR, but this tends to have much lower resolution, much reduced fidelity, and many other factors that make it distinctly less realistic.\n\nHEXOUPLE PLUS - Heat from the headset causes sweat. Sweat evaporates and condenses on the screen. Suddenly, you've got a foggy screen. This tends to take a couple of hours to happen (so you won't notice during most gameplay sessions, but would notice if you went to sleep wearing it,) but headset owners will know the pain of having to de-fog their lenses.\n\nHEPTOUPLE PLUS - you can't see your own hands or body in VR. Unless you convince yourself that you've become invisible, you'd definitely notice this.\n\nThere's a hot brick tied tightly to your head, everything looks pixellated, you can't see your own hands/body, and yet you're convinced that you're actually in some unfamiliar place? And for that matter, how did his dearest mother get there so fast? She would have had to have heard his scream, gotten out of bed, put on some clothes, gone through the house to his room, and then wrestled the headset off of him, before he had even noticed that what he was looking at wasn't reality?

They're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we'll call L), and my nephew (who we'll call W) don't have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.\n\nBut imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A\\_Sad\\_Frog, can you check your bank? \"\n\nIt was my brother in law. L and W's father.\n\n\"W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll told, \u00a3422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. That's **FU number 1.**\"Tell them to stop what they're doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can't do anything about it.\n\nSo here's where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.\n\nI'm not mad at the kids. I genuinely don't think they meant it. I'm mad at myself. I didn't think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F'ed. We're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.\n\nSo, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.\n\n**TLDR:** Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.\n\n**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. This is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. It would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **FU number 3** confirmed.\n\n**UPDATE #1:** Playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when I can contact them.",

You can then lock down your account with a ~~password~~ PIN, so they can\u2019t log into it. But they\u2019ll have access to your games and stuff on THEIR accounts.\n\nEDIT with more details since this got so high up:\n\n* Since YOUR console is no longer your \u201cprimary\u201d system, it will need to be internet-connected in order to verify your purchases any time you want to play anything. Your niecephews\u2019 console will not have that restriction. ~~Additionally, you cannot play your games at the same time as them.~~\n\n* They won\u2019t need to log into your profile every time they turn on their console to access your games. Simply having your profile set up on their console is enough.\n\n* If you buy new games, they won\u2019t be able to download them without signing into your profile.

They don't understand that this is real money because they don't even understand what money is, they just understand that clicking these buttons gives them stuff to play with and companies shove this kind of crap into every game they can get away with. Sports games are riddled with this too and are another easy way for companies to exploit children and their parents with this kind of crap.\n\nIf you have kids and any kind of gaming device, don't ever let any kind of card details on the account. Buy prepaid cards if they need or want to get anything, that ensures situations like this won't happen. Moreover, if that device is ever stolen your details won't be used to exploit you either.",

If non of those in order garner a response, call 911, tell them shes unresponsive / no pulse and request a code 3 / priority code transport and begin CPR.  IF you do not know how to CPR, tell the operator, IIRC *all* 911 operators are trained to assist you in giving bystander CPR, do not worry about breaths if you do not feel comfortable, they are oxygenating with each compression. \n\nE; \n\n>Also, for CPR, make sure the patient is on a solid surface.

            "My buddy introduced me to LSD and we both enjoyed taking one tab. Eventually, he decides that he wants to take two and that I should join him. I don't want him tripping solo so of course I say yes.\n\nI don't know what or why but after a while, he had a seizure. Apparently it was a grand mal seizure from what the ambulance told me. It was bad. He somehow punched a hole in the TV while he was flailing about and was pulling hair out and doing all kinds of weird shit. I don't even know if it could be considered a seizure since to me, it just seemed like he was going through ego death or something.\n\nHe would stand up, fall over, flail around, and pause for a bit. Then occasionally scream and whatnot. I was tripping balls at the time and I could see his soul/ego leave his body. It was kinda funny cause he started out fine and was hype but as the night progressed, he spoke less and less and gave shorter and shorter replies. Eventually, he would respond by groaning... that turned to screams shortly after.\n\nOur friend had an idea of playing a song that he produced. I don't know how but he came back to us for a split second during the song. It was actually one of the only things he remembers from that night haha. The power of music!\n\nIn the end, he was fine the next day and says he barely remembers anything.",

After a minute of panicking she came around so I told her what happened and we panicked together for a while. My brother had epilepsy so I assumed it was a seizure and insisted that she go to the hospital. She calls her mom to tell her what happened because she\u2019s terrified and thinks she\u2019s dying. Her mom thought she was a virgin AND my gf just came out to her family two weeks earlier so they already hated me.

Because of the Lockdown and shit, I hadn't fucked someone since 3 months, and was low-key feeling desperate and was just looking to smash. Met a girl, let's call her Maria, who was also thinking along the same lines, went on a couple of dates, blah blah blah.\n\nSo now, a little backstory. I live with a Housemate. Let's call him Mike. We both have different rooms, and it's a 2 room apartment. He and I go to nearby colleges, and we're good friends. He knows me well, and I know him well. So he likes pranking, and I like pranking too, It's okay, we get along fine.\n\nSo anyways, after our last date, I told him I'm probably gonna sleep with this girl in a couple of days.\n\nThat's what happens, Maria's in my room, things get hot and steamy, we both haven't had any contact with the other gender since a lot of time, we're making out, clothes come off, and as we start getting down to business, Mike walks in on us in the room.\n\nAnd the cunt-head doesn't simple walk in. He's wearing baby clothes, has an apron on, he's holding a FUCKING ladle, he has this surprised look on his face, his hair looks like a Wasp Nest, he even has this sort of black smearing on his face, he's holding some lube and a sandwich, and you know what the asshole says? He goes 'Damn it Chris, What's wrong with you? Just as I get down to fulfilling your Fucking Ladle Fantasy (Jesus knows what that means), you go Hetero on me? I thought you swore you were gay?'\n\nI learnt that laughing in such a Scenario isn't a good idea. She thought the laughing gave it away that I was pranking her. In my defence, it was hilarious seeing him like that.\n\nWe both are VERY straight, like literally nothing sexual has ever happened before between us, and the MF does this without the slightest HINT of a smile. Well Maria goes ' I KNEW something was off!' and simply leaves the house, even as I try explaining the shit to her. I'm simply standing there, explaining, Naked, that he's lying, but apparently the lube gave it away, and she's sure I'm messing with her, and if I try contacting her again, she'll call the fucking Police.\n\nSo that's how Mike ruined a Hook up, and how a girl thinks I'm a pranking bastard. I swore at him for at least half an hour straight, but that doesn't bring the girl back.\n\nTo add insult to the injury, he got the idea from Reddit, of all places.\n\nTL;DR: My roommate walked in on a girl and me about to have sex, he convinced her that I was gay, and I'm lonely again.\n\nEdit: Lots of people are saying there are many loopholes in my story. I'll address the main ones.\n\n1. I'm 16: I dunno where y'all got this from. I noticed a post saying that I was 16 in r/teenagers.\n\nI don't use that sub, and didn't notice. My flair over there had been set long ago. Sorry for that. I've changed it now.\n\n2) The baby clothes: Mike is an acting major, and we both are in the Boston area. By baby clothes I meant clothes that babies wear duh.\n\n3) Now I'm pretty sure the comments saying I was gay are jokes, but I'll clarify: I'm straight, sorry for disappointing y'all.\n\n4) I'm a girl. I know where this one stems from. It's a meme I made. Do people not understand that a meme is a fucking MEME for gods sake? This account is a meme account, majorly. You can dig up my profile and find out that I'm a 45 year old women who came from Mars and occasionally lives in the UK and Zimbabwe while attending classes in Boston. I'll clear this. I'm a student, in an Ivy League University, about to turn 20. I'm a straight guy. Same description applies to Mike. He's majoring in theatre, and I'm majoring in Engineering. We both are tall. He's better looking. He's an extrovert, I'm in the middle you could say.\n\n5) This is fake: I dunno, hard to believe, for sure, definitely not fake. I'm pretty sure the homies saying this is fake are all middle aged people or 14 year olds, who have forgotten how wild college was, or dunno yet how wild it is.\n\n6) The lube: I think that it implied anal, since you need lots of lube for that. Thought it was pretty clear. I misjudged the average IQ of this sub. Sorry\n\n7) Immature of us: Glad you realised\n\n8) Yes we both are friends, very close ones at that. I'll clarify. We share a lot of stuff with each other.\n\n9) We prank each other all the time, together prank others, it's a fun life.\n\n10) I asked where he got the idea from. He got it from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fn67j/i_hear_my_house_mate_masturbating_should_i_walk/c1h5ruf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)\n\nTL:DR: I'm not 16, I'm a straight guy, This is real and fuck you if you think it's not.",

        "created_utc": 1518869578.0,
        "selftext": "Obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.\n\nI lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we\u2019ll call them Ned and Ethan. The three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. The most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out Adam Sandler\u2019s At a Medium Pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (Everyone thinks they\u2019re hilarious in college, I know).\nThe most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. But one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in Ned\u2019s bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of Adam Sandler on my shitty Washburn 6-string. \n\nTrying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but Ned was no random college student. Ned was the 6\u20193\u201d milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. Ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. Ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. In short, Ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. So to me, that meant that whenever Ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.\n\nSo I grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he\u2019d think I had went to bed early), and snuck into Ned\u2019s bedroom to position myself in his closet. It was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/UC2H/HMVJA37Y/FYAUC2HHMVJA37Y.MEDIUM.jpg). Ned\u2019s bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so I\u2019d have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and Ned, in case I accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. But directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was Ned\u2019s computer and desk. \nNed came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. Due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, I could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. The 12 inch proximity of Ned spiked my adrenaline, and I began to control my breathing. My back was pressed against coat hangers, and I had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. Ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and I had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([Artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/XmLM5Bh.png))\n\nAs Ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. Ned did not reach for his glass of water. Ned did not opt for the pajamas. Ned did not leave his desk. Ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.\n\nA million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. If I make myself known now, he\u2019d be immensely embarrassed and angry that I had just violated his privacy. But if I *didn\u2019t* speak up now, chances are I\u2019d have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. So I was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while Ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. It felt like I was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.\n\nMy hands began to cramp as I awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn\u2019t generate an ounce of noise. My legs began to jitter as I compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as I waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell I was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.\n\nAfter Ned\u2019s satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a Kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that I had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.\n\nNed promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and I had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. All critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until I remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. But with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would I get the phone out my pocket? Somehow I did, and I texted Ethan in the next room over:\n\n> foogama: In Ned\u2019s closet. Was trying to do Medium Pace gag. Ned started wanking before I could start. Now I\u2019m stuck in the closet and can\u2019t get out. Need help.\n> \n> Ethan: LOL right.\n> \n> foogama: Ethan, I\u2019m dead serious. I need you to help create a distraction for Ned so that I can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.\n> \n> Ethan: \u2026we\u2019re going to need to have a talk later.\n\nRight around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). It was 10:45pm on a Thursday, but I could hear Ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **\u201cHELLO? WHY YES NED IS HERE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NED! NED COME HERE, PHONE FOR YOU!\u201d** Ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. How this never raised suspicion, I\u2019ll never know. It was a cordless phone. There was no need for Ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. But thank god he did. I bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and Ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some \"stranger\" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.\n\nI was forever in debt to Ethan for saving my ass, and we never told Ned. That is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in Ned\u2019s wedding. There was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we \u201cfound interesting\u201d about Ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, I was convinced by Ethan to write \u201cThat he enjoys anal sex with large black women\u201d because it would make a fun \u201cbachelor story\u201d over 10 years after the fact.\n\nBut of course that\u2019s not what happened. The best man decided it would be more fun to\u2014without warning\u2014switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we\u2019d be reading the bride\u2019s, and they\u2019d be reading Ned\u2019s. And of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. I didn\u2019t even know her name. I had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.\n\nThe bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. Ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. He immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. I immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. Ethan and I waited for Ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. We were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.\n\n**tl;dr \u2013 Hid in my roommate\u2019s closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride\u2019s best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**\n\nI've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for Ned. Ned is a really great guy and I'm sure we'll be fine.\n\nEDIT 2: I got \"Ethan\" to create a reddit account and entertain questions.

            "This story is hilarious, and I love it because I can both imagine it being made up but can also 100% imagine it being real.\nIn college I lived in a house with 2 other guys who had their girlfriends around quite often.  I lived downstairs with the living room and they lived upstairs and often had their girlfriends over.  One of them had a computer (this was late 90's) and said we could all use it.  So the night in question he was out over at his girlfriends house, but my other roommate was there and had his out of town fuckbuddy at the house.  He had made this big deal about how he had just started dating this other girl so he thought he was going to tell this fuck buddy girl that it was over, and that it would be hard because they'd had a relationship of some sort for a long time.  So I went to use my other roommates computer and his room was right next to the other roommate and in fact had an adjoining door which had very poor acoustic separation.  So I'm sitting there doing some work on the computer and I start hearing crying and heaving breathing and at first I'm thinking - oh... he must have given her the news that their \"arrangement\" is over.  Then I realise that I was being naive.   The sounds kept getting louder and it was an old house.  Do I move, causing the floor to creak and letting them now that I heard them or do I just sit there and don't move.  and If I don't move, how long do I have to sit there before i can move?  Like 3 hours?  Isn't that creepier?  \nThe whole thing was awful, but finally I decided to just go and try to make as little noise as possible, which was IMPOSSIBLE in that house.  but still better than listening to the whole thing....",
            "Do people ever tell you \"you don't have a filter.\" and you don't understand why it's funny in this situation, but not that one?  If this is you, then you're just like me, and I can't help you.  It got better around 30 years old.",

            "I have had a similar experience, except I was Ethan, in the room next door, and it was more instant karma than slow burn. Funnily enough it also took place in 2005 at a boarding school when I was 17.\n\nSo naturally there were lots of pranking going on with many teenagers living away from their parents, this story involves the guy in the room next to me who was 1 year older than me (Person A), and one of my classmates (Person B), they were good friends and in the middle of a prank war.\n\nPerson A was a smaller guy, funny and a bit mischievous but generally quite well behaved. Person B was a swimmer, tall and ripped, however the most gentle person and a bit on the slower side. So A had instigated the prank war and it had been going on for a week, nothing absurd, hiding of books, stealing of keyboards, stuff like that, B had been very passive in it and not really retaliated, however at the end of the week he though \"I am gonna get him back\".\n\nNow to get him back he hid under As bed, ready to jump out at him and give him a good scare, however being a bigger guy he didn't really fit, being a bit slower he also didn't realize that. So A enters his room, sees half a shoulder sticking out from under his bed and does the natural thing, lies down on top of his bed and starts to pretend masturbate. B has the same reaction you did, he froze, lying there, he could not move, planning to ride it out and sneak out without being seen.\n\nA thought this was a very odd reaction, he knew B was there, so he thought, well I guess I have to kick it up a notch, and moaned Bs name.

I figured I'd be getting some action as we have been sending pics for awhile now. Now I'm a minute man so I was very nervous about the first time being 30sec, so I stopped by a circle k on my way to meet her. In a rush I picked the one with 5 pills in one pack and took them all... I guess ur only supposed to take one.\nBy the time I got to her house, my heart was racing and I was very jittery. I tried to hide it as best i could. We made out a bit but nothing more, which I was glad bc I was starting to really feel weird. Idk how to describe it. As soon as I left, I got super nauseous. I pulled over and puked my guts out. So glad I left when I did. Then I drove home. I'm still puking. Stting on the toilet as I type this. Also, still jittery. Hoping theres nothing more to puke so I can try to go to bed\n\nTl;dr: took 5 times regular dose of gas station dick pills and now I'm puking my guts out\n\nTo cement my idiocy here, I thought I'd let everyone know that last month I became a registered nurse(\u261e\uff9f\u30ee\uff9f)\u261e\n\nhi frontpage... guess it's time to delete previous post that will identify me=I\n\nSome updates: a lot of people have asked if it worked. The answer is yes. I tried to rub one out at home after puking, and just cpuldnt get to climax. Also, I take my job very seriously. I know some of u are concerned, but my dick logic is confined to my personal life. I never felt like I cpuldnt function after puking. Some of u were very forgiving and supportive and I commend u for that. Very sweet of u. Also, to the guy that suggested to use \"speed base amphetamine\" I hope ur joking. Please take care of urself and get some help if ur not. Also, no I wont do it again, was joking when I said I would.\n\nLast update: feeling better. Only got an hour or two of sleep. Ate breakfast. Feel queasy but not throwing up. Stomach def not happy with me.

A LOT of the gas station pills are counterfeit versions of the real thing. Basically a little crushed viagra and sugar. It does sound like you managed to get the real deal though.  \n\nSecond, even a normal dose raises your blood pressure. Taking 5 times the normal dose, your BP was probably through the roof!  They also contain stimulants to give you an energy boost, which is why you were so jittery.  Contrary to the moron that suggested takihg a stimulant, you need a downer! Not something illegal or even that strong, but something to relax you.  \n\nAnd finally, the biggest and nastiest side effect of those things is dehydration. You are going to have a 5-alarm hangover for days, my friend. Start drinking water, Gator-ade, Pedialite, and anything else you can get to re-hydrate you. I am super serious about this; you are going to be miserable for *fucking days* if you don't get yourself hydrated!  \n\nHope you feel better!  \n\n*Edited for clarity",

Please don\u2019t underestimate \u201ca bunch of random vitamins.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how much nursing programs go over electrolytes and their effects on not only the heart, but the body as a whole. But you should be extra vigilant in knowing that vitamin supplements, herbal remedies, etc, are critical in patient care because they CAN have these effects.\n\nPlus, Extenze is basically OTC viagra. It has Sildenafil, which is a sympathomimetic. That means it vasodilates, increases heart rate and cardiac output. That extra rush probably made you nauseous, and with the extended period of tachycardia made you feel the palpitations and anxiety.\n\nUse this as a learning experience to provide excellent patient care later down the line. As a medic, I have a bad habit of not paying vitamins and supplements. But they are a really good insight to not only what could be going on with the patient, but also what they may be trying to treat themselves. Don\u2019t underestimate them.\n\nOutside of all that, good luck with your new nursing career. Congrats on passing the program.

Had to cancel. That shit fucked me up so bad, I had to go to in patient rehab for 8 days and got diagnosed with GAD. (general anxiety disorder)...

        "selftext": "I\u2019ve been smoking weed since I went off to college ~3 years ago. I always thought weed just didn\u2019t have that much of an effect on me other than a little tingly feeling that made me slightly less anxious than I normally am. I\u2019ve had dozens of people tell me \u201coh you\u2019re not inhaling properly\u201d blah blah. I figured at first I probably wasn\u2019t and had each person I smoked with teach me how to inhale properly. \u201cTake it into your lungs\u201d or whatever. Okay...but every time I breathe in I\u2019m taking air into my lungs right?? So why are we acting like this is something that\u2019s hard to do...yeah I\u2019m a fucking idiot. So I\u2019m watching an episode of Skins (UK) yesterday and one of the characters Effie teaches someone how to smoke.  It went something like pull it into your mouth, then breathe deeper and pull it into your lungs. Something just clicked inside my dense little fucking head and I was like OH. That makes sense.\n\nSo today I\u2019m supposed to be having a boy over and I\u2019m feeling a bit nervous so I decide to take a couple hits of my oil pen that I\u2019ve been hitting for MONTHS. It\u2019s an indica cart with a high ass THC concentrate but at this point I\u2019m under the impression that I\u2019ve built up tolerance to it. So as I hit it I try the Effie technique (the first explanation that actually made sense to my dumbass) and I coughed so hard I almost threw up. I was like oh shit...this works. So I proceed to hit it three more times like that. Biggest fucking inhales and I felt that shit SIT in my lungs. \n\nFML. Next thing I know I wake up in my bed but I think I\u2019m dreaming. I close my eyes and open them again but I\u2019m still dreaming. I do this about 8 more times until I realize holy shit I\u2019m not dreaming I\u2019m tripping HARD. I literally lost an hour in which I remember nothing, and when I start remembering things nothing felt real. Everything felt like a dream or a simulation. Every time I thought it was over I\u2019d reopen my eyes and lose my shit again. At one point I was sniffing essential oils to try to bring myself back, and at another I destroyed my room looking for something I thought would \u201csave\u201d me (I don\u2019t even remember what). I was convinced I had \u201cswitched frequencies\u201d and was now on the wrong \u201cfrequency of existence\u201d and couldn\u2019t get back to the \u201cright frequency.\u201d It took me 3 fucking hours to come back to myself and realize I wasn\u2019t going to die. During this time I called my brother, his friend, and my mom who now think I\u2019m losing it. Also the guy that was supposed to come over thinks I\u2019m ghosting him now. And I\u2019m never smoking weed again.\n\nTL;DR: I inhaled properly when smoking for the first time, overestimated my tolerance and had the scariest trip of my life. I lost three hours during which the guy I like was waiting on me to send my address and now he thinks I\u2019m a bitch. And now weed is ruined for me forever\n\nEdit: I hope it\u2019s okay that I edit! A couple things, I went to sleep and feel a lot calmer now, I\u2019m aware my initial post was dramatic. I did not expect to wake up to this! Also, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m an actual idiot for not realizing how to inhale correctly. This is why I posted in this sub, so everyone commenting or messaging me calling me all sorts of names, I know!!! I\u2019m an idiot and all I can do is learn from my mistakes. I\u2019d really only smoked socially before and I\u2019ve learned a lot about smoking from this thread, so thanks to everyone that commented helpful advice! Side note, in my panic I googled what to do and one of the tips was to smell something citrus like essential oil, so that\u2019s why I did that. I don\u2019t remember if it helped, I think maybe for a moment it made things a little bit clearer. \n\nLastly, I told the guy I got \u201csick\u201d and he was super understanding; we\u2019ve rescheduled the date. I plan on telling him the whole truth in person. Thanks again to everyone giving advice or sharing similar stories! You\u2019ve made me feel a little less stupid for this fuck up",

            "I visited Amsterdam one year and tried edibles for the first time. Followed advice of taking small bites and waiting. Ended up eating 80mg (if you believe the label...if). Didn't feel a thing. Anyone reading with edibles experience is now certain that label was wrong. Fast forward a few years. I'm back in Amsterdam but did my research on where to buy. Get a 200mg edible from a coffee shop that could have given me a contact high while buying my edible. I ate the whole thing while walking to lunch. My next awareness was the waiter saying \"no, no\" in another language. I'm hovering with my face about 6 inches from the receipt I'm trying to sign. He's indicating that I don't write a tip on the receipt like you do in the US.\n\nI have so many stories from the following 6 hours that I can share, but basically I learned that gravity and time are far more flexible than I had previously realized. I told my wife gravity was trying to crush me into 2 dimensions. I also gave the security woman checking us in on the ship and awkward wave ad I am a very friendly person who normally talks to people but had convinced myself it was a bad idea to interact with ANYONE at that time. My friendliness impulse made me do this awkward wave where my arm was down by my side completely and I lifted my fingers at the wrist and rotated my lower arm back and forth 180 degrees like I was wiping down a 8 inch diameter ball, or as my paranoid mind thought immediately afterward SIGNALING THE SECURITY GUARD THAT MY WIFE IS HOLDING ME CAPTIVE AGAINST MY WILL. At least that's what I thought she might think from my subdued wave to her without any words. Lastly, I chewed with my mouth almost completely opening each chew. My wife was perplexed and said with a somewhat annoyed tone from having to unexpectedly babysit me, \"why are you chewing that way?!\" I explained that I couldn't feel my mouth and needed to make sure I was getting my teeth around the food.\n\nHope this made you laugh. I could have written a novel about my six hours, but you don't have time for all that unless I eat 200mg again and slow down time for us.",
            "I understood every moment of that panic you felt. I get it easily if I use too much. I smoke plenty, but I've never really built a tolerance. \n\nThe distress is crushing, as you wait for it to end, but time has ground to a halt. You aren't even certain if time exists, as reality fragments into an infinite number of pieces, each one it's own separate existence. \n\nI'm in that space - it's taken an incredibly long time to get this comment assembled.",

I peeled myself out and saw myself in the mirror: yellow skin with dark brown circles under my eyes.\n\nI was really close to fessing up to my mom and asking her to drive me to the ER when I suddenly unhinged my jaw and released the longest uninterrupted hurl on record. I felt like a boa regurgitating whole prey. Passed out and woke up on time feeling great.\n\nMy last edible.",

            "Man, this was amazing to read! I had a very similar experience when I first got out of the Navy. I was ripped out of my mind sitting on my friend's couch. I thought he'd let me drive home and I'd crashed my car I was hearing sirens and shit and I thought me sitting on the couch was a dream. I also thought I started a fight between him and his wife. At one point I was pacing around outside in my socks in the freezing ass cold mumbling about how it was helping to keep me alert or something. I asked my friend if he was gonna punch me in the face at one point, ya know because of the imaginary fight  I had started. Then at one point, I was just like I'm ready for bed and passed out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe thought he'd ruined weed for me forever lol. I thought it was hysterical when I woke up and realized what happened but at the time it was definitely a waking nightmare. Just take it a little slower maybe. That's what I did and it worked out. I'd smoke at home alone and I'd pick something with a decent amount of CBD and ease into it. It's ok to have a little and wait to see how you feel alone in a safe place. Now I smoke regularly and wish I could get that high sometimes. In regards to that guy you like I'd just tell him this exact story if he's worth keeping around at all he'll find at least some humor in what happened. Shit if he can't make it through one little accident what's he gonna do when real life comes knocking.",
            "Friendly neighborhood stoner tip #1:\nIf you are way too high and are freaking out, grab some pepper from your kitchen, eat some of it, drink some water, then put a pinch of it inside your cheek, like chewing tobacco and let it sit there. Something in pepper binds to thc and brings you down. Takes approximately 20 minutes to go into full effect.",

            "This happened with my sister. I smoked weed for a long time. And she had been smoking for about a year. I never wanted to smoke with her though because I felt kind of guilty as an older brother. She would always talk a big game and tell me how she smoked fire bud and all this bs, when in reality I would see her weed and it was just whatever. She finally convinced me to smoke with her and I rolled a joint of some really fire indoor. I asked her what she usually smoked and she said it was always a bowl/pipe. I told her to take a pull from the joint and inhale the smoke she pulled into her mouth. She took one hit. Just one. All the color drained from her face. She told me her heart was racing and that things were blurry. She kept saying \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna pass out.\u201d I got her a Gatorade and a granola bar because I have seen people pass out from weed/dabs before due to hypoglycemia so I didn\u2019t wanna take any chances. She ate that and felt better but was tripping out. I told her to just relax and that we would go for a walk. We walked around my neighborhood for hours and she just kept asking over and over \u201cIs this real? Am I dreaming? Do street lights always look like this?\u201d The next day she told me that after a year of smoking bowls and probably not inhaling properly, that joint was the first time she had been high off her ass. It scared her off weed for a while but eventually she started smoking again. Although she never wanted to smoke with me anymore because \u201cthe bud was too strong.\u201d Lol.",

I'm not a smoker now, bit used to room with some guys that regularly had FIRE and would hit it with them. Fast forward a few years into our relationship...we had never smoked together before. We take a vacation to Seattle, where it's legal and POTENT. We thought it would be fun to smoke a little and enjoy walking around the city. Holy shit....she trips so hard that I take her back to our room and call the fucking paramedics. She kept screaming that she was dying and that it was all over. I'd never been more terrified in my life. I was high too, but not her. She just wasn't prepared for it. The paramedics thought it was hilarious. Apparently this is a common thing in Seattle. Inexperienced smokers come from out of town and then trip fucking balls when they get try weed that is many times more powerful than they are used to. She hasn't smoked since.",
            "The \"switched frequency\" thing happened to me the first time I really got high, too.

It reminds you that you have a body and that it's totally doing fine and whatever worry you have about a body part you're focused on (in my case I thought my heart was beating too fast and that I would die) is all mental.

He lays on his side so the easiest thing to do was to give him a gentle stroke. He started stiffening but didn't really stir. He loves me licking his balls so I tried to give them a lick.\n\nIt wasn't easy without him helping to manoeuvre into the right position. I lifted his leg a bit and got a good angle. He started to stir and shift. So I sat back until he settled more on his front but still on his side. \n\nI was clearly in quite a determined mood and I tried to get to his balls from behind through his raised leg. \n\nAs I was trying to get in there again he let out a massive fart. Just instantly stinky, inches from my nose. I saw it before I felt it and I felt it before I smelt it but there was nothing I could do to save myself. So gross. Wouldn't recommend! He's not even that windy. It was bad luck.\n\nOf course he woke up hard and wanted to get going.

        "selftext": "Forewarning: This is basically going to be a horny teenager story.\n\nAbout two years ago, after my physical exam, my doctor recommended that I go get an ultrasound on my testicles because he felt a mass. I went to go get an ultrasound and it was a young male doctor and everything was fine. So I thought I knew what to expect.\n\nMy parents switched insurance and now I have a different doctor. A few days ago, I went for a physical and my doctor again recommended that I go for an ultrasound. The next day, I went to go get my ultrasound and to my surprise, a young female doctor (probably a resident since she looked 27-30 years old) called my name. She introduced herself and then said, \"we're a bit short-staffed so I will be doing the ultrasound today.\" My heart started racing and I was confused because I expected a male doctor since it was a checkup for my balls and didn't really want to show another female my parts. Honestly, I would have been fine with an older female doctor but the issue with her was that she was very, very, VERY attractive. She was wearing a mask but she had a great face and eyes, small boobs, a slim waist, and a PHAT ass. inb4 all the comments \"I dOn'T sEe A pRoBlEm,\" I'm a virgin male teenager with helicopter parents and ever since coronavirus, I don't get much privacy and probably haven't jacked off in 3 weeks. Now you kinda get the idea of where this is going.\n\nWe get into the room and she hands me a towel and instructs me how to use the towel to fold my penis up. The way she enunciated \"penis\" made my heart race and my head pound. She leaves the room to let me undress and I use the bathroom and see that I have a half-chub. I undress, lay down on the table, and probably went through 5 iterations of how to fold the towel over my dick to hide my half-chub. I'm laying there for a while (probably less than a minute but it seemed like 5 minutes) and reach for my phone and decide to browse Reddit while I wait. Unfortunately, the second post I scroll to is a highly upvoted post on the facefuck subreddit and I instantly go from half chub to full-blown boner. Fantastic! My mind was racing with how to get rid of it. I eventually settle on browsing buildapcsales to try to calm myself. Suddenly... knock knock! I immediately throw my phone to the chair next to me and grab both sides of the towel to pin my boner down.\n\nI look down and could definitely see a bulge but think, \"maybe she'll just think I have a massive flaccid dick.\" My mind wanders to porn mode as she sits down next to me and I start having absolutely ridiculous thoughts like \"holy shit! She's going to blow me to help ease my nerves!\" which does not help with the boner situation at all. I'm trying to think of the most unhorniest thoughts ever to try to control myself.\n\nShe starts by putting the gel on the probe and immediately gets to it. Upon contact, I think \"Oh my god, this super hot doctor is touching my balls with a probe\" and my boner is literally pulsing under the towel. I'm looking at her and she's mostly looking at her screen and typing so I reassure myself that she probably doesn't notice. \"Perfect, she's not even looking at me, I'll just hold the towel down and this will be over with.\" After a bit of probing, she turns to me and says \"now I need to go up your groin area a bit so I'm going to fold the towel up and push everything to the side like this.\" This all happens in slow motion. I see her hand slowly reaching for the bottom corner of the towel as she gently pries the towel from my death-grip and...... BOINGGGGGG! My fully erect dick springs up and launches the towel off, fully exposing me.\n\nI honestly don't remember her reaction. I frantically looked at her, looked at my dick, quickly grabbed the towel and wrapped up my dick like a burrito, and for the rest of the examination, I laid there with both my hands holding my erect dick back and let her finish the ultrasound. As I'm writing this I realize I didn't even apologize to her. I was dead silent the rest of the time.\n\nThanks for reading my embarrassing story of the first female to see my fully erect dick. On a more serious note, I was wondering if other people who have gotten an ultrasound on their balls have also had female doctors do the ultrasound. Did you guys talk to the doctor while they were probing your balls? I'm honestly looking to hear more personal accounts from other people so I know what is \"normal\" and what to expect in the future if I ever have to get my balls checked out again.\n\nTL;DR I went to go get an ultrasound on my balls and did not expect the doctor to be a HOT female doctor. Couldn't control my raging boner and accidentally exposed myself to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone so so so so much for the reassurances, personal recounts, and in general positive responses. It makes me feel much better about what happened and what to expect when I go again. I appreciate all the LPT people telling me to flex my legs or a large muscle, I'll keep that in mind for the future. It's funny because she actually told me to flex my abs a few times so maybe she was looking out for me. \n\nTo everyone asking about my balls, my balls are fine, thanks for asking! Apparently, they are just so massive and the biggest balls they've ever seen... just playing. They actually don't know what it is or what they've been feeling. Both my doctors felt something but both ultrasounds came back fine so I'm not sure what's going on. I personally can't feel anything but I've also had these balls since I was born and I haven't really noticed anything out of the ordinary. \n\nTo everyone saying \"Two years ago...coronavirus\" and saying I don't have my story straight. I apologize for the confusing timeline. Two years ago, I got the same ultrasound done but with a male doctor. I was just setting the precedent that I thought I knew what to expect. This story happened last week.",

At some point, he was trying to hang the tire with a large tow hook, slipped, and caught his balls on the hook. Fortunately, he did not rupture the testicles in any way, just tore the protecting skin. \n\nUnfortunately, I had the task of basically water-boarding his balls with cold water and cleanser prior to suturing. You would think that dumping cold water and soap directly on balls would keep him from getting erect. \n\nIt did not.",

I do keep everything covered as much as possible to maintain privacy.\n\nIf you have to have one again in the future and they ask you to do the prep, place your penis on your belly, take the towel or sheet and place it over the penis and tuck the sides in underneath you and pull it as tight as you can to keep the penis sort of pinned down (for lack of a better term) under the sheet/towel.\n\nI can assure you it isn't a big deal for us.

            "My ultrasound was 3 attractive girls, 1 doctor and 2 college girls shadowing. I luckily avoided the same mistake but while they were checking me to see about a possible torsion, I got the weirdest compliment ever which was: \"Oh this is a really good one for you to observe, this is what health testicles are supposed to look like, and he's got great (whatever those tubes are called).\" To which one of the college girls replied \"wow his are just like the textbook\"\n\nEdit: well, thanks to all the upvotes, now my girlfriend is nicknaming me \"Textbook Balls\"\n\nAlso, for anyone who wants the bigger story:  \nI was in horrible pain, went to the clinic, clinic referred me to the ultrasound, but it turned out not be torsion, so they said go home and if it gets worse hit the ER. I was already experiencing waves of excruciating pain in my testicles and groin, and worse it got, totally collapsed when I tried to stand, really fucking terrible, so I went to the ER later that night. \n\nSeveral scans and tests later, I find out I have Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, and the pain from the inflammation of the lining of my spleen and kidneys (due to a minor infection) was being referred down to the biggest nerve cluster in the area, my fucking balls. \n\nBut I got morphine and some antibiotics, as well as some Tramadol to take home, so the next days weren't too bad.",

            "I had a spinal surgery on my lower back and one thing my doctor told me was a possibility was clots forming in my legs due to being almost 100% stationary for the next few months. I was on blood thinners for a while but I always kept it in the back of my mind that I might just stroke out at any moment due to a clot going from my lower body to my brain. So as I am recovering, I am noticing that my left foot is always dry and scaly, which is really weird for me because normally my feet are a little moist after physical therapy. I keep a note of it and after a couple sessions, I realize that my left foot just does not sweat anymore. My skin is very dry on that foot and no matter what I do, its just always dry and doesnt sweat after physical activity. My doctor recommends an emergency ultrasound to verify there are no blockages of any major arteries in my extremities. Que the male doctor (assistant as I would later find out) leading me to the little locker room, telling me to disrobe and giving me a little cloth basically telling me to wedge it in my groin and pin my junk to the other leg, as they will need to ultrasound pretty much the whole left leg and inguinal (groin). I get set up on the table and in walks two bombshell women. One looked straight from a shitty pornhub parody and the other was younger, early 20's. She introduces herself as the doctor and the other lady was an intern and asked if I was comfortable with her being present. I was in my mid 20's and also in the medical field and fairly comfortable with myself so I obviously oblige. I understand its important to actually do things instead of just read about them or watch a video of it. She starts on my lower leg and basically works 360 degrees from ankle up to my hip. The gel is nice and warm and I am seriously trying to remember my high school football days of dudes just hitting each other and throwing the ball around. Trying to remember how physically hard practice was and how many times I puked from two-a-days. I made it through with a slight chub but I think embarrassment kept the rest at bay. She finished and I made a dumb quip about how the intern didnt get to try it out, so the doctor asked if I had another spare 30 minutes for her to practice on my other leg. Insta-sweating and I blushed. Thank god it was dim in the room for the monitors. I cant back down now. I know its important she gets training so I say im free and she can have a go. I didnt even have time to move my junk to the other leg before she did it for me and just stuck the probe right in my upper groin. She was very enthusiastic. She has my junk in one hand and the ultrasound in the other and is just awestruck staring at the monitor, I dont even think she realized. Because the doctor sure as fuck didnt realize as she was looking at the monitor too. I was sweating profusely at this point. It wasnt until she said, \"Ok, yeah, I can feel his femoral pulse...\" Uh oh, thats not my femoral... thats literally my pulsating dick... in your hand... She looks at what she has in her hand and gasped and basically released my good with one hand, and back handed my hard dick and balls with the other as she released the probe. Shes apologizing, the doctor is apologizing for her, im fucking apologizing for being hard. This all happened in like an 12 second time span, but it will forever be burned into my memory. The doctor grabbed her and walked out stating they would return \"momentarily\" probably to go laugh at me with the other staff. I dont blame them. She gave me a couple warm rags to clean the gel off my leg and said, \"That will probably be enough training for the day\" and instructed me to get dressed. I still fucking cringe at this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you, kind strangers for the awards! Im still sweating rereading this.",

What helped me was we joked around during the ultrasound: after she started looking inside my nads, I asked her if it was gonna be a boy or a girl, and she replied, grinning her big old lady grin and said \"It's twins!\" And after that we just shot the shit and talked while she gently massaged my coin purse with the tool. 10/10 would joke with that lady during a ballsack ultrasound again.",

I always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. One person in our office is a vegetarian, I am aware of this. They passed by as another person and I were enjoying gummy bears, I quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer I was like \"oh sorry, right! You won't want these!\" \n\nThey responded with \"Why wouldn't I?! I love gummy bears!\" I stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with \"well, they have beef gelatin in them.\" \n\nThem: \"what do you mean beef gelatin? Why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?\"\n\nMe: \"I thought all gelatin came from animals.\"\n\nThem: \"are you serious? You aren't serious right? I love gummy bears. My kid and I eat them together all the time.\" (kid is vegetarian as well)\n\nMe (now panicking): \"I think I am. I don't know. Maybe you're right! I'm \nsorry! You're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.\"\n\nThey now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. I swear I could see them going through the stages of grief because I know how sad I would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. So TIFU by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)\n\nEdit: omg. Front page. All you guys are awesome! And I'm learning so much! I just want to clarify a couple of items. First, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. I just happen to know their choice and respect it, I have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. Second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (Yay!). I'm excited about all the dialogue. And feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. But pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. Thanks Reddit world!\n\nEdit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. Hopefully it's a bit better now). Also, thank you for the awards!! But! It they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. Or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",

I send her a message on Instagram, she replied. We chatted for a bit, and then it was sort of awkard, I explained to her how I just found the message, and that I thought it was a nice gesture. Surprisingly she was quite ecxited and happy, didn't expected that.\nShe immediately asked me, If I wanted to get coffe today at around 17 o'clock.\n\nI'm not sure If I'll be able to go today, since I'm still at the hospital, and they're taking soo long, but if I do I'll definitely keep you guys updated on how it went.\n\n(Plus, Never realized how much of an impact a compliment could have, personnaly I never liked my freckles, since they basically cover my whole face, and I never met someone who liked them either. Knowing that someone thinks they look good honestly made my day. Just wanted to share)\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nWe met an hour earlier than expected, luckily I  got out of hospital in time. The weather was nice, so we decided to meet at the parc, and bought Iced coffe.\nWhile I was texting with her a few hours prior, she sounded really confident etc, but when I met her, she was still super shy.\nShe was very nice, but yeah didn't talk much.\n A few hours In she did start to open up a bit and get talkative.\nWe went to an Asian resturant, ( All you can eat).\nAnd damn I must say, she really took All you can eat to another level, she understood the assignment, and was out there trying every dish, I think the waitresses where on the edge of kicking us out lol.\n\nAfterwards, she didn't seem shy anymore, we went over to my place, and y'all I honestly need to shit so bad, but I can't. Anyways we're currently watching a movie, and her head is on my shoulder, that's a good sign I guess. I need to put my phone away now.\n\n\nBtw her Bestfriend texted me saying I told ya, didn't I?",

Everyone except me and my new friend.\n\nWe stayed up and talked the entire way to SF. One of those rare strangers you meet and hit it off with right away. Didn't hurt that we were both young and unattached. Plane landed and we head to the baggage claim, where I muster up the courage to ask for her email address (this was long before text apps). She happily wrote it down on a slip of paper and we said our goodbyes, and I told her I'd send her a message.\n\nFast forward a few hours, I got home to my apartment, unpacked my stuff. Took the slip of paper out of my jeans...but it wasn't there. I checked my other pockets, not there. I frantically checked every possible cranny it could've been in, and that slip of paper was GONE. Never did find it or realize where I lost it.\n\nSo that ended that. Worst part is that because I didn't email her, she probably thought I wasn't interested.

            "I'll give a bit different take than others. \n\nYes you should let her know. Of course let her know if you like her and that it was unintentional. \n\nBut most important you should tell her precisely because it was unintentional. As you said she could have taken it very personally and felt rejected which can be very hurtful for someone who is shy. \n\nMy opinion is you have an obligation to let her know. Even if you aren't interested in her you have an opportunity to at least put her mind to rest for her own mental health, if she did in fact feel rejected. It would allow her to have a small bit of closure and move on instead of wondering if she did something wrong etc. \n\nIt also could teach her to be a bit more explicit when she does reach out to someone in the future, if she hasn't already done that, so she reduces the chance of future rejection.",

She\u2019s super terrific to me, and I really think things are going better than they\u2019ve gone in my most recent relationships. We met on Tinder!

We started playing video games together recently, and I\u2019ve just found out that her interest in them came from a guy she just spent last weekend with. \n\nShe has no idea I know any of this information, and I\u2019m too into her to say anything.

            "Believe me, this is not a TIFU, you made a discovery, that will help you not make a great mistake, what you are feeling isn't permanent, you found someone that you like, and that will pass, believe me. It's not love that you are feeling, it's a comfort of having someone by your side. This girl obviously only needs to feel that and nothing else, she has feelings about her ex and is trying to fill that feeling of emptiness with other people, including you. Please, spare yourself the pain, accept the person she is without having false hope and leave, her. You don't have to explain what you found out, or tell people later about it later, because it is her problem and her issue to deal with, but i guarantee you, that \"relationship\" isn't going to work. Maybe it's hard to just throw away something or someone that gives you a feeling of not being alone, but it's going to hurt much more if you develop actual real long term feelings about her and just finding out more and more stuff about her, that will honestly just disappoint you and possibly crush you. I hope I helped, these kinds of situations can turn out painful and i think it is better to see people's major faults, and do something about them. What i'm 100% sure about is: you can NOT help her, turn her or do anything for her to forget someone. You are nit a psychiatrist.

            "First, other commenters are correct when they say this girl isn't your girlfriend. That doesn't make her a bad person or you a fool necessarily, but whichever way you cut it she doesn't see herself as such. Was there a firm definition of a relationship at the beginning or did the two of you just symbolically delete tinder? (Note, this doesn't change anything except how I feel about the girl in this story)\n\nIf she agreed to a monogamous relationship with you, then continuing to date other guys behind your back shows she has no respect for you as a person. Sometimes the people you love treat you poorly and it hurts, but you're worth basic respect and decency just like everyone else. The most important thing to remember is that you didn't deserve to be treated like that, and the next girl that comes along isn't the one who did it to ya so don't hold it against her.\n\nIf she didn't agree to any specific monogamous relationship then I'm sorry bud, that's unfortunately the way relationships have evolved in today's day and age of limitless choices. As a society we've become conditioned to pursue the \"most ideal\" and \"perfect\" people we think we want only to blind ourselves to the many fantastic people in front of us. You can't do anything to stop this trend, but you don't have to play like everyone else is. Reinstall tinder. Start up some conversations. Don't even bother making it romantic, and don't bother playing by the tinder rules; start conversations with every girl you match with and lead with your nerdy hobbies. It doesn't matter how many girls ghost ya because they're not interested in the geeky you, but if you keep it up eventually conversations will ignite with someone out there.\n\nStaying with someone who clearly isn't right just ties you up so you can't pursue the right one when she shows up out of the blue in the perfect position to start a long-term relationship. If I stayed with every girl who treated me like the one you're speaking of, I'd be miserable and alone instead of living a fantastic life with a woman who fits me better than I thought was possible.\n\nFinally, the absolute, number one, no holds barred best advice I can give you right now is take some time to breathe and process this before hopping back into the game. Find your happiness in yourself, that content feeling that comes with familiarity and comfort. Accept that honestly, it's okay to not be pursuing a relationship to focus on yourself for a bit and will likely put you in a better position down the line.\n\nWhen so much of dating has morphed into hiding our character traits, embarrassing hobbies, and goofy qualities that make us the lovable people we are it becomes borderline impossible to find someone who loves you for YOU. You know who you're going to attract with a heavily edited dating profile? Someone looking for the exact type of person that you portrayed yourself to be, and dating will feel like this endless shit-show of meeting the wrong people over and over.\n\nIf you take my advice I can virtually guarantee you a happier relationship down the line. Be your goofy, nerdy, weird self and the only people you'll attract are the ones who find you endearing. Be your goofy, nerdy, weird self long enough and a girl who fits you like a glove will find YOU instead of the other way around.",
            "This seems pretty cut and dry. Why stay with somebody like this?",
            "You didn't fuck up, you got lucky, really lucky.  It would be one thing if you just assumed you were exclusive and it turned out you weren't, but she straight up lied about deleting tinder.  She cheated on you bro, no two ways about it.  Whether or not you continue the relationship is up to you, but you need to confront her, and think twice about trusting her in the future.",
            "\"What do I do?!\"\n\nConfront and dump her ass my guy. No question.",
            "Have you had the relationship talk and established you're exclusive? If you haven't it's a bit complicated as you may have assumed that you were exclusive while she might feel that the field is still open. Six months is kind of a long time for this to be going on without talking about where things are going though. In this scenario then at best she's lying to you by saying she deleted Tinder, at worst she's cheating on you by leading you to believe you're exclusive while dating other guys.\n\nIf you have had that talk then she's just straight up cheating on you and lying to you. Leave before it gets any harder to do so. Six months is not that long and you may think you love her but you've just found out you don't really know her. She also clearly doesn't feel the same way about you.\n\nDon't be tempted to confront her about it. Don't be tempted to try and work things out. The thing about cheaters, especially ones that repeatedly cheat, is they rarely stop cheating. I'd wager good money this is why the ex she's still smitten with dumped her. And even if they do there's always going to be mistrust between you. You're always going to be wondering if every time she's being cagey about something that she's seeing another guy, every time she's got plans that don't involve you that she's seeing someone else. It isn't worth it. You don't have that much invested in this relationship. You don't have kids, a house, pets, or even a significant amount of time in this. Yes it's not going to be pleasant, but if you continue to see her she's probably only going to hurt you more. Get out while this kind of revelation is upsetting rather than devastating.",

The fact is no matter who you are you deserve a person that is willing to be with only you unless you are a person who is into open polyamourous relationships. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFind someone who shares your views on relationships. if your a 1 girl kinda guy find a one guy girl etc. You are worth someone on a equal level as you and you shouldn't settle. This doesn't neccesarily mean cut her off you can have a fun casual relationship with her for now but understand it for what it is. If you want a serious relationship I doubt you will find it with her atleast for now unless you talk to her about it and let her know that you know she has been seeing other guys. If she is faced with you maybe not being there she might say well lets try it out and see where it goes. But bro please to play the role of a sugar daddy to her you both need to invest equally into the relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe might say bye and end it which makes it easier for you to let go.  My personal experiences says tinder/SM/ Online are normally bad places to find relationships although they are good for hookups.  Best places I have met the best quality ladies for relationships have actually been Bookstores and places that hold meetups for different things you are interested in or hobbies you like. I feel like this works because in places like this people are more themselves than a person they are trying to portray themselves as to find a match.  \n\n\nWhile i see stories like this that normally ends bad they don't always go that way.   \n\n\nTL:DR Talk to her let her know you would like to get serious and see each other exclusively.

I didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a perfect summer night in 2018. I'm leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I'm being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I \"want both\" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext thing I know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:\n\n* You're so much better than him.\n* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn't deserve you.\n* You'll look back and laugh at this in a month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, he fucking ***DIED.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe guy died in a car accident and I'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** I was invited back to a girl's house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she's better than him, etc. He didn't break up with her, he fucking died.",

        "selftext": "Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. \n\nSo, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.\n\nI brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it\u2019s only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven\u2019t had a good release since a week. \n\nI take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. \n\nI reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. \n\nThe invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. \n\nI try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won\u2019t get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. \n\nSoon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. \n\nOne of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.\n\n She stares at me and picks up my phone. \n\n\u201cYou seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?\u201d She said. \n\n\u201cI am not. It\u2019s an honest mistake.\u201d \n\nThen she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she\u2019ll let me go. \n\nMy heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. \n\nMy heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There\u2019s nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. \n\n\u201cCheating from a video?\u201d She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. \n\nThere it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. \n\nThe professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. \n\nNow I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. \n\nAnyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. \n\n\nTL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn\u2019t allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.\n\nEdit : \n\n1. For the people who think this is fake. It is not.   \n                                                         \n2.  For people who are saying why was I failed and now need to produce an apology one even though I wasn\u2019t cheating - It is because in India these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. Also, I only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. \n\n3. The porn was Manuel Ferrara and Dani Daniels, they don\u2019t have much together. You will easily get it with one search on PornHub. If I may suggest something much more better, please try Manuel Ferrara and The Goddess Remy LaCroix. The video starts with them talking about cup or something. That also is easily available. \n\n4. About the girl who asked for the link. \n\nI was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. \n\nThe girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. As she came outside she asked me why did I bring a phone to the exam and even if I did, I could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. I said I could have but my I couldn\u2019t think at that time and was afraid. \n\nAfter that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. The girl accompanied me to the admin office. I accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. \n\nIt was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. She asked to show me what was the video while giggling and I thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. She started laughing and told me I am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. Then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. She remembered my name and my Department. Then we parted ways. \n\nFor fuck's sake, she is cute. Stop telling me to pursue her. I have another exam later. Maybe will meet her there. \n\n\nThe Indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.\n\nEdit 2: Man I have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. I have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. \n\nThanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. I haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.\n\nEdit 3: Invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. In fact, that is the word for Exam Proctor here in India borrowed down from the time when we had a case of Britishers. \n\nThanks for the Gold and Silver again. Open some sort of privileged Sub-Reddits I think.",

I was very much attracted to her and she seemed to enjoy my company so one day I asked her out for dinner date and to my delight she accepted. \n\nBeing a poor college kid, I did not have much money, but I did not want to go to a horrible chain restaurant, so I booked restaurant in the next town that had decent reviews but hopefully was not overly expensive. The dinner was going well we were having a very animated conversation and the food was very good. The restaurant was almost empty but and other large group people on the other side of the restaurant. But I was a bit nervous on how much the bill will be and did not want to get caught being not able to pay the bill but alas this was the least of my problems to come.\n\nIn the restaurant a group of people were on the other side of the restaurant had one uncontrolled child approx. three or four years old running around unsupervised. The waitress was getting really upset with him and the group as he was disturbing other tables and pulling cutlery from other tables and the parents didn't seem to be concerned with his behavior. But he wasn't really disturbing me as I was having a great time with my date and I ignored the antics of the child. \n\nMy date and I ordered dessert and I excused myself to go to the bathroom, while in the bathroom I could hear the small child making motorbike noises running around in the bathroom for a few seconds before exiting. I didn't see him as I was facing the urinal, and he had left by the time I turned around to wash my hands. I proceeded back to my table when dessert had just been served. During dessert, my date commented that the other table were the child belongs to seemed to be staring at us in a funny way. My back was to them, but again I was having a great time and did not care if another group was staring at us or not.\n\nAfter we finished dessert, I was surprised to see the restaurant lit up with the blue and red lights of a police car. A lady from the other table in which I now know is the mother of the child went out and met with the officers and then led them to my table and pointed to me and stared \"here is the man that assaulted my son.\" \n\nI was completely shocked! I told the child's mother that I had absolutely nothing to do with her son and never spoken or touched him. She told in the offices that I exposed myself to him while he was in the bathroom. She explained to the police that her son said to her \u201cI saw that man\u2019s wee\u201d, when I walked past their table from the bathroom. There were two police officers one male one female officer, the male officer led me outside for more questioning female stayed inside talking to the mother. \n\nI explained to the police that I when I went to the bathroom, I heard the kid come into the bathroom for a few seconds, but I didn't see him, and he was gone by the time I washed my hands. I never spoke to him or talked to him or even look at him in the bathroom, the police officer took notes, and the female officer came out and advised I was under arrest and they will take me to the police station for further investigation. The mother out the front of restaurant is yelling at me that I was a pervert and I need to be locked up.\n\nMy date made a brief statement to the police. She ended up paying and catching a cab home and I got a free ride to the police station. \n\nAt the police station the officer advised that according to the mother, the child uses the word \u201cwee\u201d as a euphemism for penis and the mother have made a formal complaint that I exposed my penis to the child while I was in the bathroom. I gave my own statement advising that I was \u201cweeing\u201d in the bathroom, the mother was not there and yes the child must of seen my back whilst I was urinating as that's what I was doing in the toilet at the time- there was no way he saw my penis in the few seconds when he ran in unsupervised and out. Nevertheless, the police charged me with indecent exposure to a child under 12.\n\nThis being a small town I got locked up for the weekend because there was no judge available to grant bail on the weekend.  I rang my father explaining the situation and he arranged lawyer to appear with me on Monday. I basically had no sleep for 2 1/2 days in the lockup and I was still wearing my restaurant clothes for my Monday court appearance. My lawyer petitioned the judge for the charges to be dropped as if we locked up everyone who went to a public bathroom in the presence of someone under the age of 12 then we would have to lock up the whole country. The judge agreed and the charges were dropped, and I could go home. \n\nBut the damage had been done, my date told her girlfriends what happened as if she was the victim of a horror date and then her friends who then told the whole college that I exposed myself to young children. The next day everyone was staring me in class some people coming up to me asking what happened some people no longer go near me or talk to me as the rumor mill was on fire. My date never spoke to me again.\n\n2 weeks later I had to front the college board and had to defend an honor code violation as my scholarship was now in jeopardy.  Though cleared this incident hung like a dark cloud over my time in college being a social outcast and severely curtailed my social and professional life in my early 20\u2019s not to mention having a hefty legal bill being sent to my parents.\n\n\nTl;DR\u2013 I got arrested for indecent exposure just for urinating in a restaurant bathroom",

A few months later, the woman sold her child on the black market and she stopped talking to my mom. Two years later, we were living in another state now when my mom learned that she was being sued by that woman for stalking and threatening both her and the child's lives. Because the charges involved a child in danger, the state picked up the case and sued my mom. She spent a further two years traveling out of state for the trial despite us being very poor to deal with a case that never even had any evidence and was brought up by a woman who never kept a straight story and sold her child illegally. The state then appealed the case when my mom was found not guilty, but I don't quite remember much from that point. The appeal didn't last long, so I assume the next judge thought of it as a joke and dropped the case.\n\nAnyway, sorry you had your experience OP.

        "selftext": "I am on a work trip that will last about 3.5 months. At this time, I will be away from my wife and we will both be not having sex until i come home (sometime in December). It is also important to state that I have some heart issues and am currently on blood thinners.\n\nI want to prep to have some mind blowing sex when I come home, so I have been \"training\" to hold my orgasm.\n\nOver the weekend i had to make a long drive and didn't have time to give it a wank. Today was the first time since thursday (4 days) with no wank.\n\nI went to the bathroom to do the deed and decided to lay in the filled tub while doing it.\n\nAfter edging for 55 minutes, I crossed the point of no return. I could feel an immense pressure build up, and I inadvertently aimed my rifle at myself.\n\n The pressure from no wanks and the edging turned my first part of the load into a mach 1 projectile. This projectile shot right to my eye, and I literally gave myself a facial. But then it got worse - my eye started burning and I could feel my contact fold into my eye lid.\n\nI panicked to get out of the tub to a towel, and ended up slipping on the tile and whacking my head on the edge of the tub. The next moment I am laying on the ground, dried cum on my face and eye, and something sticky on my head.\n\nFrom whacking my head on the tub, i cracked my head open and there was blood everywhere. I could still feel the blood wet on the back of my head and I felt sticky all over. Then suddenly I was getting very dizzy. I crawled out of my room and pounded on my door asking for help.\n\nNext time I woke up, I was in an ambulance heading to the hospital. One of the service maids heard me pounding on the door and opened the door to see me naked and covered in blood and she called 911 (according to the EMTs).\n\nThe EMT said I was lucky I made it to the door, since I was losing alot of blood still (there was a small pool by the door). He also said he \"cleaned up the blood and other secretions from my face.\"\n\nSo here I am, leaving the hospital, knowing that the hotel staff and paramedics saw me covered in blood after giving myself a facial.\n\nTLDR: edged too hard, rubbed it out, blasted eye with cum and slipped on tile floor trying to get a towel.hit head and almost died of blood loss due to blood thinners.\n\nSorry if this is ramble-y, I am very much so mentally lost from the crazy ride today.\n\nEDIT #1: hey guys, I talked to my boss and he is sending someone out to relieve me from work for a month. I was told to work remotely at home while I rest and recover. \n\nTo the people asking for pictures of my head, I'll have my wife take pictures when I am home. I am actually worried she will see this post and connect the dots as she is a redditor (but does not frequent this subreddit) and I didn't expect this to blow up. But I like to live dangerously, so the show will go on.",

        "selftext": "It all started 23 years ago when my horny ass 13 year old self was riding his bike and stumbled across a beat up VHS tape. Upon further inspection it turned out to be a porno and I thought I hit the jackpot! The only problem is the case was broken and my VHS player didnt want to play it...FUCK! I learned a lot about VHS tapes that day and that if you are careful you can transplant that tape into the case of an advertisment VHS tape for crash bandicoot I had received because I was cool and subscribed to nintendo power. Damn Im a genius! It was fappin time and I went to town. It was the perfect hiding spot too! Nobody suspected a thing but eventually I got the internet and the VHS tapes got put in a box and forgotten about. Fast forward to now and my mom is a volunteer driver for people that need rides to the hospital. This job allows here to interact with many types of people. She meets this sweet lady that fosters kids and mentions she has a ton of old VHS tapes the kids might enjoy. 1 week after my mom gives her the tapes the lady calls my mom back and is furious. She had put the Crash Bandicoot tape on and started making dinner in the next room. Those kids learned a few new things about life that day. As you would expect my mom called me very confused and I had to akwardly explain to her how my horny adolescent ingenuity caused this to happen over 2 decades ago.\n\ntl;dr my adolescent self disguised porn as a video game cartoon which was accidently shown to foster kids over 2 decades later",

As I was preparing to program the VCR, something flashed on the screen.\n\nHuh.\n\nI rewound the tape again and sure enough, a 0.2 second clip was there on the very beginning of this supposedly blank general consumer  tape (either a BASF or a Sony brand). I rewound it again and eventually managed to get it to pause. There was a flickering scene of some porno there, a girl was just changing position or something.\n\nThe thing is, this piece of VHS strip was apparently there to attach the VHS tape to the reel. It was so early that the player had trouble reacting to it; a mere flicker and then the blank tape began. You could just view it, taping over it was impossible as my player first began to roll the tape and then the recording heads moved at the tape, by which time the scene had already moved past.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSo a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I'm learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. She's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.\nShe kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she's what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that's when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her \"moister than an oyster\". \n\nHer face fell. It's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I've been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. I don't think I'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. \n\nTLDR: I decided to be sexy and asked my gf if I made her moister than an oyster. She doesn't think oysters are sexy.",

I would go to his house to play and we were becoming pretty good friends. His house was awesome. His dad had a sweet computer we could use with games, and he just happened to have this HUGE glass container filled with some really dope marbles. \n\nSo one day we bust out the marbles and start rolling them into each other, as you do, and everything is going normally. Just two normal kids playing with marbles. We were playing with a whole set of different colours, patterns and sizes. There were gigantic ones and tiny little ones. Unfortunately the marbles began to induce a kind of childlike creativity they didn't deserve. \n\nTo us, being five year olds in the late 90s, asses and toilet humour were some of the funniest things you could conceive. Somehow a connection was made between those smooth-ass marbles and our smooth-ass asses. A simple connection but one that would come with repercussions. \n\nAn idea was conceptulised and there was no turning around. We thought it would be hilarious to put a marble right up inside one of our tiny little asses. \n\nThankfully it wasn't mine... \n\nAfter much of a struggle Tim managed to squeeze a small marble into himself and upon realising it wouldn't come back out, began bawling his eyes out, having to be driven to the hospital by his mum to have the said marble removed from his anus. \n\nNeedless to say, I got in a LOT of shit. I was banned from ever going around to Tim's house again and I don't remember ever seeing him again to be honest.\n\nTL;DR: Today (around 23 years ago) I lost a friend, and my friend lost a marble",

I\u2019m planning on using that time to ~~learn a new language~~ look at memes. \n\n**Marked NSFW because I\u2019ll link a photo of the burn on my ass in my tl:dr below.**\n\nI\u2019ve been a paraplegic since a military accident in 2004. I\u2019ve always lived independently and taken very good care of myself and my ass because sitting-pressure plus lack of sensation, and decreased blood flow in paralysed areas can cause pressure sores that never heal, and I like to be as active as possible. \n\nSo I check my skin every day with a mirror or phone camera (belfie), change position, lift myself to allow blood flow etc. I spent a lot of time in hospital following my initial injury and saw guys living with open weaping sores that never heal, it terrified me (search for \u201cpressure sore paraplegic\u201d if you enjoy being disgusted) and I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019ve never had a pressure sore because I\u2019m so careful, despite skiing, kayaking, and even paragliding still. \n\nBasically I\u2019m a dumbass with a numbass, but I look after it... normally. \n\nI had an *open-book* pelvic fracture when I was hurt back in 2004, and quite a few other problems at the same time so they put me back together in a bit of a rush whilst idk ... resuscitating me and stuff. My pelvis is now tilted down to one side, when I sit it\u2019s considerably lower and bears all the weight. The leg on that side looks 3 inches longer than the other. \n\nAs I sat in my car for a three-hour drive home that side of my pelvis must have been pushing directly onto the heated element within the seat. Even though it wasn\u2019t hot enough to burn immediately, I suffered a \u201clow-heat\u201d burn after three hours. Which is *way* worse than it sounds. \n\nI could feel the heat on my lumbar region and never thought it would be able to burn me, I even turned the heat to the low setting to be careful. \n\nThat night I checked my skin and found my worst nightmare.  Which got worse. What initially looked superficial developed a softball sized blister overnight that burst to show something looking like an effect from the walking dead. \n\nTwo weeks later and the first layers of dead tissue are starting to lift, the skin is healing. Now I just have to worry about osteomyelitis. \n\n\n**TL;DR** An injury 15 years ago messed up my pelvis so badly that when I drive it pushes directly into a heating element in my new car\u2019s seats. A three hour long drive burned my ass as a result (possibly bone) and I\u2019ll be spending 3 months it so laying on my stomach while it heals. \n\nNSFW link to pics of my skinny, burnt ass:\n\n24hrs later right after the blister burst:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DE5eh17\n\nTwo weeks later with healing and necrosis:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bvOJYBP\n\n*Edit:* The bum burning car is a **2019 Ford Focus Active X**, UK model. \n\nI\u2019m sorry some of you clicked the pic links expecting to see a girl\u2019s ass but feel that\u2019s a lesson you needed to learn. I\u2019m happy so many people have seen my ass though, am I a \u201cthot\u201d now?",

It was lucky his leg twitched and jumped otherwise he would have left his foot in longer and it would have been much worse.\n\nNot being able to feel and heat/cold touching your skin is really dangerous and a hidden hazard for people who are paralyzed.

        "selftext": "This happened almost 15 years ago, and came back to bite me today, which is why it's a TIFU:\n\nMy wife loves Christmas songs, and she looooves to sing them. 15 Years ago, we were on a holiday car ride and she decided to pass the time by singing \"The Christmas Song\" over, and over again, and me being me decided to fuck with her just to be funny.\n\nWhen she got to \"Jack Frost nipping at your nose\", I blanched and asked her why she was singing THAT song, in an absolutely mortified voice.\n\nWhen she looked confused, I feigned surprise that she was unaware of her faux pas and proceeded to  inform her that like many a Grimm's Fairy Tale, Christmas songs often have a dark past and that \"Jack Frost\" was the name of a mental patient from the 20's who broke out of an Asylum during a Christmas break and went around devouring faces, particularly noses, to which he had acquired a taste for.\n\nShe bought it hook, line, and sinker. She was shocked, horrified that people would sing about it, and we talked about it for the duration of the ride, Jack Frost's antics growing darker and darker as the miles flew by.\n\nFast-forward to this morning: I'm in a good mood, it's super snowy, and I have snow-blow the driveway. As I'm getting dressed, I start singing \"The Christmas song\" and she chastises me in a teasing voice.\n\nI had NO idea what she was talking about. She then confides that Jack Frost, the serial nose biter had forever ruined that song for her, and she can no longer stand it.\n\nI laugh and explain that I was teasing that day, and I honestly didn't think she believed me.\n\nShe got mad. MAD mad.\n\nApparently, this has been her go-to-fact during the holidays, and for the last 15 years has shared this dark and gruesome tidbit with anyone who would listen. I guess a sea of confused and disbelieving looks and a flashback of people staring at her as if SHE were a nose biter came back to haunt her as the lie she had been spreading for years came back in a moment of dawning comprehension.\n\nShe's mad and a little hurt, and I am apparently the King of Lies who is never to be trusted again.\n\n\nTL;DR - I told my wife that a Christmas song was about a serial face eater, and she spread that gospel like it was handed down on a stone tablet.\n\n*edited a word that spellcheck didn't like - ALSO, thank you for all the awards, well wishes, and what not. She's forgiven me, feels stupid, and now...I have to explain to her what Reddit is, and how this is my top submission, so I'm not out of the doghouse yet.*\n\n*Next Morning EDIT:  All is well. She loves me, should have expected this from me as I have a tendency to lean towards mischief, and even laughed about Reddit AND Newsweek. All is good, there will be no divorce, I'm sorry that I'm basically Satan from the small group of you requesting that I kill myself for a good-natured teasing, and those of you who claim that you'd never marry me because I'm a manipulative asshole, you've never seen me dance. You would. You SO would.*",

            "Some other grisly Easter eggs from that song:\n\n> Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow / Will find it hard to sleep tonight\n\nThe terrifying thing about the three red Christmases of 1925-1927 was the way he'd use fire to cover his tracks. What made the case so well known is that investigators started using some modern forensic techniques that were widely reported at the time. It was the first time detectives and forensics experts had to painstakingly reconstruct destroyed bodies to determine true cause of death. There were widespread complaints that reporting of the case over radio, a novel popular technology at the time, was being overheard by children and keeping them up at fear of being eaten and burned.\n\n> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir / And folks dressed up like Eskimos\n\nThis is in reference to the police's use of carol singers to try to distract crowds that were gathering too close to the scene and interfering with investigators. One of the reasons for the fires was that they would attract a crowd - Jack craved infamy and attention from his lashing out.\n\n> And every mother's child is gonna spy / To see if reindeer really know how to fly\n\nThis is really not for the faint of heart. \n\nJack's attacks escalated before he was caught to become ever more theatrical and brutal. He would mangle his victims before putting them in costume, sometimes putting cheap \"antlers\" on their head and telling them he'd stop if they'd fly for him (one victim actually survived to talk about it, you can find the interview audio on youtube, but you shouldn't). He'd force them to jump off the building. Kids would reputedly stay up looking out their windows for Jack on the rooftops. \n\n> And so I'm offering this simple phrase / To kids from 1 to 92 / Although it's been said many times, many ways / Merry Christmas to you\n\nJack's last words in the electric chair, in reference to his 92 victims. \n\nTruly the world's most grisly, inappropriate Christmas song.

One of the girls who lived in my neighborhood asked why I'd stopped.  Coincidentally , I also had this HUGE scratch on my arm from playing with a dog.  On the spot,  I told her this long and increasingly unbelievable story about how I was a hacker and I'd been attacked by the mob guy I'd hacked, then was on house arrest because the police caught me.  Plausible enough because she knew I was into computers,  but completely ridiculous at the same time as we were maybe 11 or 12\n\nFast forward 10-15 years,  I'm in a bar and she comes walking up with another girl who I used to hang out with and begins spouting this story as gospel.

I'm wondering what they could be for and just think to myself they look like depth charges. \n\nSo I tell me wife with complete seriousness to ask her if she knew they were depth charges since ferries still carry them after the midget subs in WWII from Japan first entered the puget sound and remain as a precaution. She believed me until I told her I was joking and then started chasing me all mad on the top deck of the ferry.",

            "Oh man\u2026 I feel your pain. Ok, story time!\n\nYears ago, one of my best friend- we\u2019ll call him Dave, married this lady- we\u2019ll call her Jay. We all loved her. She\u2019s sweet, giving, loves to cook for EVERYONE\u2026 honestly, she\u2019s quite the peach. But she\u2019s also very, VERY, **VERY** gullible. I noticed this about her really fast. \n\nSo anyways- one day, I\u2019m going with her to pick up some stuff from IKEA and we\u2019re coming up to these vineyards. The first plot was on rotation, so it\u2019s nothing more than the old seasons support sticks. So she says \u201cI wonder what those sticks coming out of the ground are.\u201d\u2026.. and I just couldn\u2019t resist:\n\n*Actually, that\u2019s a broomstick farm.*\n\n\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d\n\n*Yup. They\u2019re gmo\u2019d. Can\u2019t remember exactly what they\u2019re called, but ye- they don\u2019t need much water and they grow perfectly. Ye just pull em and then they modify em to screw onto a broom. Plus, no plastic and biodegradable! And in the off year, they rotate in a vineyard.\u201d - And that\u2019s when we pass the end of the rotated field and she sees the vineyards.\n\nShe bought it. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but she did. Later on, when we arrived back at her house, she jumps out of the car, runs to Dave and spills EVERYTHING I told her. While she\u2019s talking about how cool of a fun fact she thinks it is.. I can see Dave stare past her\u2026 look me right in the eye.. and just shake his head in disapproval. \n\nThen there was the time she asked me what a boulder farm was. I told her someone had invented a special type of mineral that grew when ye watered them. \n\n\u201cNO WAY!\u201d\n\nMe with serious face: *Ye way, they use them for landscaping all the time. Remember when we went to so-and-so\u2019s birthday party and they had that beautiful garden with those boulders in certain spots?*\n\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d\n\n*Yeah, what- ye think they\u2019re goin\u2019 to spend a bunch of effort just to move boulders? No way. These minerals come the size of a pebble. Ye place em where ye want the boulder to grow and ye water them until they\u2019re close to the size ye like.*\n\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S AMAZING! I wonder how expensive they are.\u201d\n\nThis carried on for a few years until one day, Dave told her the truth and how I was just spinnin\u2019 stories on her. \n\nSo one day, Dave, Jay, myself and a bunch of friends are going on a camping trip. We get to the campsite and we all start setting up. This took place in Southern California and among all the trees, some of them were Mediterranean Cork Trees. While I\u2019m setting up my tent, Jay is pressing her fingers into a tree and is talking about how squishy the bark feels.. like a cork. \n\n*Actually, you\u2019re right Jay! Those are Mediterranean cork trees and that\u2019s exactly what corks are made of.*\n\nJay spins her head so fast to look at me. With an angry face she just snaps, \u201c**Oh yeah, just like your fuckin\u2019 boulder farm?!?!?!**\u201d and stomped off. \n\nIn that nanosecond, I saw how my joking came a full 360 and slapped me in the face. I could not. Stop. Laughing.",

Weeks later she comes back and says \"that wasn't true\" and he laughs saying he made it up. *The game was on*, and formalized: you had to slip in a lie to the other and have them a) believe it, or b) say something true that they'd challenge as a lie.  One point each but only if was caught. Strategy: not challenge anything the other would say so couldn't lose a point to them, while secretly researching the same claim at another time so you wouldn't carry on with lie in your head as the truth. \n\nThey'd been running this game for many years. Friends and relatives were aware and disaproving.

In part, it was why it was a cool date because I really did want her to see some cool shit that she\u2019d never seen before. \n\nAnyway, when we got to the elephants, they weren\u2019t there. I guess they\u2019d been taken inside for something. But I told her that you shouldn\u2019t expect to see them during the day because they burrow underground and only come out at night. Incredible that something so large could build giant underground burrows by scooping out earth with their tusks. She bought it. I laughed internally and then honestly never thought about it again. We often teased and joked with each other and there was no malice to it\n\nFast forward a couple of years to a dinner party we were at and a couple had come back from safari, having seen elephants. She absolutely earnestly asked if they\u2019d been able to see the giant burrows, and I nearly died. She nearly died as she tried to explain the tusk thing as I tried to change the subject and more people start looking at her like she\u2019s crazy. \n\nShe didn\u2019t find it particularly funny at the time, truth be told, but we find it hysterical now, years later. Lesson learned though.",

In an instant, I had a revelation a la The Invention of Lying, \n\n\"...You mean condom?\" \n                           She asked, \"what did I say?\"\n\"Condo. It's okay, common mispronunciation\"\n                           \"That's what I meant, I love these condoms.\"\n\nGlorious... Every few months or whenever we would talk about housing related topics, I'd check in and reinforce the little white lie. \"What do you think of these?\" She'd reply something like, \"I like the area, but just not these condoms.\" This went on for years... \n\nEventually, we all have our days of reckoning and she found out in a girls night out that, indeed, \"condom\" is not the correct shortened form of condominium and that her husband is a man-child.",

And then once those got too expensive, then it turned into a \"synthetic apple flavoured starch product\" made in a lab. She bought right into it, after all, I worked at McDonald's before our relationship, so it must be true.\n\nI didn't wait 15 years to tell her the truth though. Maybe I should have.",

I said the hardest part will be telling time.  She asked me what I meant and I told her that they use something akin to be metric system, but for time so she'd have to convert it all the time.  She bought it for a split second and panicked, but I couldn't not laugh.  She was mad for a bit, but I joke like that a lot and she's not divorced me yet, so....  I guess I found a good one.",

We told her they threatened the guy who owned it he better leave town or else.  She was very shocked.  I forgot about it then several months later we were all getting drunk together and I pointed out how we had tricked her into thinking ninjas attacked the local gas station.  She got very mad at us because she had been calling anyone who would listen to tell them about the gas station ninjas.  Shit was hilarious.",

My mom was annoyed at my brother (2.5 yrs younger than me) for some reason and me being ever helpful decided that I would take care of the situation, so for Mother\u2019s Day I decided the best course of action would be to just get rid of him.\n\nI posted my brother on eBay &amp; after a few days and several bids I managed to sell him to someone in Taiwan for $17.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me how in the hell I managed to do this and not get it taken down - looking back I can\u2019t make sense of it.\n\nSo once I sold him I then was faced with a thought that hadn\u2019t crossed my 12 year old mind - how am I going to ship him?? So I ignored it because according to the internet what I did was illegal.

I instantly got nervous because nobody uses that door so it must be serious or someone we don\u2019t know.\n\nMy dad comes back into the kitchen a few minutes later and tells my brother to go to his room.. and for me to follow my dad. I walk into the family room to have a seat in front of two state police and the states version of FBI.\n\neBay reported me to the state police &amp; my IP address was acquired - they were not however expecting a 12 year old girl to walk into the room as their culprit.\n\nI got a slap on the wrist &amp; a formal ban from eBay until I was 18 - and a very very long talk from the feds about what I had done.\n\nEDIT: this seems to cause some confusion - when I say FEDs, it was the states computer crime task force (federally funded department)\n\nEDIT 2: I fessed up immediately- my parents were questioned of course but I showed the computer crimes people what I did & took full responsibility.\n\nTL;DR when I was 12 I sold little brother on eBay, didn\u2019t know how to ship him.

I'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. Starting this job it was no different.\n\nNow, a few weeks later I'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. Somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. My manager named a few and I said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.\n\nThen I jokingly said, 'And nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...\n\nMy co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. She raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. It was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.\n\nI guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.\n\n**TL:DR** Joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement.

Kids have actually been shown to be much WARMER when running outside in freezing temperatures with no clothes on compared to kids who wear jackets. \n\nI feel so bad when I see warmly bundled children outside because their parents are just asking them to grow up schizophrenic.

            "This is why you should really tread lightly in the workplace.  Especially when I became manager... there are certain subjects that are off limits.  Vaccines being one of them, along with things like essential oils, religion, politics, Trump.  It\u2019s off limits.  If I hear people talking about it in the office, and I see someone\u2019s uncomfortable with it, I have to squash it right then and there.  I don\u2019t care if I agree with the person rambling about how trump is bad, it doesn\u2019t matter if I agree with the pro vaxxer - if someone is made uncomfortable, these subject are off limits.  Period.  And yes, I have had to pull people to the side and give them those verbal warnings and tell them to knock their shit off.  \n\nI agree with you that anti-vaxx is a horrible movement.  But you also have to understand that you cannot assume people\u2019s positions, or why they have them.  Some people are anti-vaxx because they wear a tinfoil hat, and they\u2019re assholes; then you have those who have the best of intentions, who have been taught that vaccines are harmful, don\u2019t want to harm their children, and they have fallen down a rabbit hole.  By telling *those* parents that they don\u2019t love their children, or that they\u2019re crazy or stupid.... guess what?  You just pushed them even further into their rabbit hole, you validated their persecution complex, and you made an assumption about their positions.  In the workplace, implying that someone doesn\u2019t love their children, that they are incompetent, is wildly inappropriate - especially when you don\u2019t know if that person started from an honest place.  You don\u2019t know if this manager was someone who was simply a concerned mother, who was scared and misguided by some shithead.  You don\u2019t know where she\u2019s coming from, and she\u2019s jokingly being called \u201cbraindead\u201d (personally I think as manager she should have understood that you made a faux pas) You assumed her position... that\u2019s really not okay and I think that if people actually want to solve the anti-vaxx problem, this sort of behavior has to stop.\n\nThis is why, in the workplace, you don\u2019t discuss religion or politics (this tends to loosely fall into one of those categories).  \n\nIt may not be popular to say on Reddit, but you have to be able to work with people.... that includes religious people who you don\u2019t agree with, that includes democrats/Republicans, that includes people who think plan b is abortion, that includes people who believe you should be paid less, and *that includes pro and anti vaxxers.* \n\nI know that a lot of people on Reddit are going to try and be tough and say \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter, she\u2019s an anti vaxxer, who gives a shit what she thinks\u201d because it\u2019s easy to just say that shit on the internet.  We need to remember that the internet is not the real world.  in the *real* world where you *do* have to work with others, regardless.  Yes, even pseudo-intellectual \u201cwoke\u201d people.  We share society with them, we share workplaces with them.  ",

        "selftext": "I'm a dude. I got a little carried away with personal grooming time. My usual mindset is along the lines of \"trim the grass but don't scorch the earth,\" and I'm not really into body shaving. But I had the brilliant idea that maybe a non-hairy butt might be something nice to explore, so on a whim, I decided to give it a go.\n\nI failed to take into consideration what a massive undertaking this would turn out to be. Even if you're normal-sized, your butt is bigger than you think. It's not like shaving your face, where there's a relatively small amount of surface that needs actual shaving. A butt represents a decent-sized parcel of real estate. And even if you're not super hairy, the hair is probably widespread, which means you probably have to shave the whole thing.\n\nWith my face, I get maybe two or three swipes of the razor before I have to rinse off the blade. With my butt, as it turns out, I get about half a swipe before the razor is full. And I mean full in a \"rinse it off, oops that didn't work, I guess I'm going to have to swipe backward against a washcloth or towel and then rinse it off some more\" kind of a way. I'm pretty sure I'm going to have to throw out this washcloth because even after washing it, it still has the appearance of my grandparents' shag carpet.\n\nAlso, even if you're flexible, your butt's kind of difficultly positioned and awkward to reach. I had to keep reminding myself which way I was going, and at some point, I developed a very real fear that I was accidentally going to do a sideways swipe instead of a vertical swipe, which would disastrous for obvious reasons.\n\nThen, at some point, you have to make a decision: Am I only shaving the outside? Or do I go, uh, between the pages? In my ongoing brilliance, I decided that shaving just the outer cheeks would only serve to make the inside appear that much hairier, so I parted the fold and continued inward. This, it turns out, is a different undertaking altogether. Skin that never sees the light of day is, understandably, much more sensitive. Also, by this time I was sweating from nervousness, and it helps nothing to also now have the potential for losing my grip on the razor.\n\nIt took probably 45 minutes altogether, and by the time I finished this somewhat harrowing project, I was feeling pretty accomplished.\n\nI wasn't done, however, with my string of bad decisions. Aftershave was a terrible, horrible idea. I only had a minute or two of enjoying my nice, smooth butt before I decided something along the lines of, \"Now let's make this smooth skin feel like someone set it on fire.\" It took a solid half-hour for the burning sensation to subside. And by then, there was no real enjoyment over my achievement, just a relief that my ass no longer felt ablaze.\n\nAnd that brings us to the final experience, which is the ongoing consequence of this particular grooming experiment. You know how each of us sort of learns the best way to position yourself so you can stifle a fart? Shaving your butt changes all of that drastically. You will never fart quietly with a shaved butt, and I do mean never. About an hour or so after I had finished, I dropped a normal-sized fart without really thinking about it. The sound visibly startled me. It was like someone fired a machine gun in an echo chamber. Anyone within earshot will clearly hear the unmistakable sound of your butt cheeks slapping against each other. And without hair to provide an easy exit, you will feel the little gas bubbles as they slowly work their way up your butt crack, like the carbonation bubbles on a Sprite that you've poured into a glass. Every fart since then has been a very similar experience, and I now suspect this will continue until the hair grows back.\n\nI guess it was worth doing in the sense of, \"Well, now I know what that's like.\" But I can't say I recommend the experience, and I'm certainly never planning to do it again.\n\nTL;DR Shaved my butt. Was difficult. Used aftershave, which set my ass on fire. Can never fart silently again.\n\nEdit: To those of you sending me private messages, I am 100% not going to send you a photo of my butt. I'm flattered, but it's not happening. Not even for \"science\" or for \"education.\" My story in text form is as far as I'm willing to go. You all are hilarious, though!\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\n\nFinal Edit: I can't even begin to thank you all for the ridiculous amount of awards, comments, messages, and hilarity. This has been the highlight of my 7 years on Reddit. You all are the best!",

I asked my gf to be my trip sitter just in case I decided to Peter Pan off the balcony or something. At the time my gf seemed really keen. She even joked about getting popcorn, which she actually did. \n\nShe ran out of popcorn more or less the same time she ran out of enthusiasm. I spent most of the night doing an invisible hula hoop dance and laughing hysterically. The higher dose definitely hit different. My gf said it was getting late and wanted us to go to bed. We ended up in bed and my gf eventually fell asleep. I was still wide awake and unable to stop touching my Adam's apple every time I swallowed. \n\nMy gf woke up to me standing on the bed completely naked and continuing to do the invisible hula hoop dance. She grabbed a blanket and left the bedroom. I have no idea how long I was dancing on the bed, but I must have exhausted myself and passed out because I remembered nothing else afterwards other than waking up alone in bed this morning and finding my gf sleeping in the living room. \n\nWhen my gf opened her eyes, I was standing by with breakfast and an apology, which my gf was grateful for. However, she broke up with me. Last night was \"too much frat boy\" for her liking. Apparently she expected an \"older guy\" like me to be more mature. I'm 22. She's 19. What the fuck. Anyway, she left. I really liked her. \n\nTL:DR Got high in front of my gf and she left me.",

No way to know at this point.",
            "> I asked my gf to be my trip sitter\n\nFirst mistake. It\u2019s not really fair to ask someone who has no experience with psychedelics to give up 6+ hours of their time humoring someone who\u2019s tripping. In general no one wants to do that. If the sitter also likes to use psychedelics, then at least there\u2019s a mutual offering for trip sitting, and they understand what it\u2019s like being high.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know of a lot of successful relationships where only one person does X and does it around the other person. Like if you smoke weed and your partner doesn\u2019t, in all likelihood they probably prefer to be around you when you\u2019re sober even if they doesn\u2019t admit it.",

            "Tbh, as someone who has enjoyed some good shroom trips in company, alone, and with a sitter, I also get kinda annoyed at people who do what you do, like hours and hours of some bizarre dance or (nonsexual) self-touching.\n\nIt's been unsettling for my trip and I can't imagine how dumb/stupid it seems to a sober person.\n\nNot shaming you for enjoying your trip, at all. But there are friends I won't do psychedelics with because they have their own version of the endless hula hoop dance. And anyone who thinks they would potentially \"Peter Pan\" to their death on shrooms is someone I absolutely wouldn't trip with. That would keep me scared and on edge.\n\nIt's not nearly as cute as people here without experience might be thinking. Seeing someone you know look like an absolute junkie isn't necessarily attractive or comforting.\n\nHave fun. Live your life. Find a chick who splits a quarter of shrooms with ya and have a blast. My girl and I do our fun things together and it's always a great time. I'm confident you'll find someone to match your vibe, but maybe consider the outward perception of someone doing what you remember doing for that long",

            "She was probably cool with drugs, but not cool seeing hours and hours of naked hula hoop dancing.

            "For anyone in here who is \"shroom curious\", some advice: 2g of shrooms to 4g of shrooms is *not* a jump I'd recommend anyone take. \n\nIncrementing your doses by 0.5g is the sensible way to work up to higher doses. \n\nStart out with a 0.5g dose. Then a gram, gram and a half, and so on. At various points (2g, 3g, etc) maybe repeat the same dosage.\n\nLeave a month or so at minimum between doses at below 4g, and longer between bigger trips.\n\nPretty much everyone I know who has taken big jumps in dosage has ended up embarrassing themselves (often involving inappropriate nudity), having a bad time, or gotten themselves in sticky situations.",
            "Jesus, there\u2019s a lot of angry psychonauts in these comments.  Y\u2019all need to get a few things straight:\n\n1. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous to think the average person is going to have a solid understanding of the effects of psychedelic drugs, it\u2019s not like they teach it to everyone in high school.\n\n2. It sounds like this was the gf\u2019s first time trip sitting, and OP took twice the dose he often does, which was a really risky introduction for her.\n\n3. She\u2019s allowed to feel like she doesn\u2019t want to be with someone who uses hard drugs.  The average person does not use hard drugs regularly, if more than a few times in their life.  If you use regularly, you have to be prepared to adjust your life if you want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t use.",
            "Honestly that's an easy trip to sit and she's lucky nothing bad happened whilst she was peacefully sleeping in the other room. If you decide to be a trip sitter you have to take responsibility no matter the outcome even if the trip lasts the whole night, trust me you don't want to be around someone who doesn't genuinely care about your safety.",
            "WTF is with all the people bashing the GF? If she hadn\u2019t experienced this before and realized she didn\u2019t like it then good for her standing up for what she needs/wants. It\u2019s pretty fucking dumb that people are incredulous that she decided she wanted something different from the person she\u2019s dating. They weren\u2019t married and no one here knows what their relationship was like before this night - they could have been on the precipice.",
            "For me, psychedelics require certain things to have a fun trip. Eating mushrooms by yourself in front of a sober person that doesn't even trip sounds like an absolute fucking nightmare. For the tripper and the sitter. \n\nSeems weird as fuck to be so casual about slamming an 8th of mushrooms by yourself, honestly. It's never going to be nearly as funny for sober people to watch you trip for 6 to 8 hours. It's the least shocking thing ever that she left you, bud.",

Everyone should do themselves, but I really commend her for knowing she wanted something different and acting on it.",
            "Bro, never trip when there's a sober girl you're into that's around you. I lost two potential relationships that way. I didnt invite them though, they showed up at the place i was at. One of the times I was watching The Wall and started having a bad trip. Then she stopped by and was talking to me and I told her I can't touch anything. She asked if she could touch me and it freaked me out and made my bad trip worse. It was horrible and i basically ran out of the house. She was mad and I remember my friend arguing for me telling her I'm tripping right now and telling her to come back later. \n\nI hate psychedelics now, too many questions.

As any parent does, I tell my son to give me all his dirty laundry (mostly so I don\u2019t have to touch it) so I can wash them for him. \n\nOne day he was not home, so, I went into his room and grabbed his dirty laundry. I notice a balled up towel in the corner of his closet and I just grabbed the end of it, thinking it was just a towel, nope! Out falls 2 of my girlfriends recently worn/dirty underwear! I stand there coming up with crazy scenarios in my head for a second like \u201cmust have gotten caught in the towel when he was done showering\u201d or \u201cmaybe it got messed up in the clean laundry\u201d. Then the realization hits me that our laundry basket is in the bathroom where we shower. \n\nAll I could say to my girlfriend was \u201cwe are about to have a weird conversation and I\u2019m sorry\u201d. I pull out the underwear and say \u201cI found these in (insert son\u2019s name) room\u201d and her jaw just drops. \nI didn\u2019t know what else to say besides \u201cat least we know he likes you\u201d\n\nNow it is a little weird and quiet around my house. The worst part is, I don\u2019t know how to bring it up to him!\n\nTL;DR: found my girlfriend\u2019s underwear in my teenage son\u2019s bedroom when I was just looking for laundry. Now there is a weird silence when my girlfriend encounters my son.\n\nUPDATE 1: The decision has been made to sit him down tonight after dinner. Im going to be short and sweet about it. Tell him that I\u2019ll love him no matter what. Tell him why it wasn\u2019t ok to violate my GFs privacy! Then take the opportunity to see if he wants to talk about anything, but not force him to. \n\nOFF TOPIC: To the guy who messaged me asking to trade my girlfriends dirty underwear for his SISTERS! You\u2019re disgusting!\n\nUPDATE 2: Ok, so here is the update everyone is waiting for! First of all, my decision was not based off any \u201cbro code\u201d. I feel it is my job to mold the best young man. Also, to those suggesting that I should not have told my girlfriend, her privacy was invaded and it\u2019s only right she knows. If he didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed about it, he shouldn\u2019t have done it. I decided to talk to him about it when it was time to drag the trash barrels out to the street. After we each dragged a barrel and we\u2019re walking back I said \u201clisten buddy, I\u2019ll love you no matter what, BUT I found what was in your bedroom in the towel. You\u2019re lucky it was me who found it and not her! That\u2019s extremely inappropriate and not ok, do not ever invade a woman\u2019s privacy like that. Especially, not a girl who has never consented to you in a sexual way. Do we understand each other?!\u201d\n\nHe just dropped his head and said \u201csorry dad\u201d and I just completely dropped it and said \u201cdon\u2019t forget the last barrel and went inside.\n\nUPDATE 3: here are some of the messages I\u2019ve gotten! \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in a similar position\u201d  \nEither by sons or moms that have gone through this, THANK YOU to these people! Perspective truly helps in situations like these! \n\n\u201cDoes your GF have onlyfans\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude1f\nShe better not!!! \n\n\u201cWhat he is doing is normal. Please leave him alone\u201d \nNo, I appreciate your opinions though! \ud83e\udd25\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible father for not talking to him right away\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re a terrible father for talking to your GF about it\u201d \nI think figuring out the best move is better then reacting with angry emotions right away!",

            "Hello friend. I have a dad that is very bad at communicating. So much so that we can\u2019t have a normal conversation for more than a couple minutes. This all started when I was in my early teens, getting into things that he didn\u2019t know how to connect with. \n\nOne day he found texts describing sexual acts I wanted to preform with my gf at the time. He was furious, drove me to a dark park and parked the car, and proceeded to yell at me. I never truly understood why he was upset until years later because he didn\u2019t properly communicate with me. \n\nI would not avoid clear communication. If you try to avoid the awkwardness, your message could get lost in translation of however you try to broach the subject. Sit him down. Tell him exactly how this makes you feel, makes her feel, and ask him how he feels. Proceed to set boundaries and encourage him to talk with you.\n\nASK HIM IF HE NEEDS A MINUTE TO PROCESS HIS FEELINGS. \n\nI\u2019m not this way, but I know many people that need to figure out their feelings before being able to talk about them. \n\nLastly, don\u2019t approach this from a place of anger, distrust, or aggression. It will instantly shutdown the conversation and turn it into a lecture. Make sure it remains a conversation so you can lead him to the correct thought process. I.e stealing is bad; invading privacy is bad; consent for sexual acts is mandatory; communication is of the utmost importance etc. etc.\n\nYour son will thank you for it later in life.\n\nEdit: clarification of background\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m really glad my first award comes from a place of honesty. Thanks friends.",

            "I read a bunch of the comments and I agree with the ones that say that you, as a parent, have the responsibility to say something to him.  Leaving it as a \"you know that I know\" situation leaves too many loose ends.  As a teen, he needs your definitive guidance.  Leaving it unspoken just leaves more questions in his head.  \n\nI also think it was a bigger violation with them being dirty underwear versus stealing her clean underwear.  \n\nYou don't need to punish him (\"No more masturbation for SIX MONTHS\").  The talk is deterrence enough for similar behavior.  \n\nThat's the best option.  \n\nIf this was a multiple choice test, there would be an option for the obviously bad advice.  That option might something like:  eliminate your son because he has now been identified as a close proximity male competitor for your girlfriend.  Don't do that.",

            "Hey OP, like a lot of other comments have said, this is not something to brush under the carpet, you have to make sure that your son understands why this is not acceptable behaviour.\n\nAlso i think you need to reassure your girlfriend that you are going to handle this situation, because if i was her, i would feel violated and uncomfortable all the time wondering what else this kid is doing... \n\nYes this could just be hormones making him so stupid shit, but if you don't address it, it could lead to way worse boundaries being Crossed, like for example him spying on ur girl in the shower, changing etc.. (Im not saying he's doing this, or ever would, im just saying what this could potentially turn into..) \n\nYes it will be embarrassing, for you and your son, but thats what you signed up for when u became a parent.\n\nAlso if you haven't had the sex talk with him yet, do it!!! Not just because of this situation, but because kids are getting exposed to sex and or porn way sooner with each generation it seems.. the amount of 13-14 year olds that are having sex is scary... \n\nAnd please dont be one of those parents that just tell their son to wrap it up and they are good to go!!! Make sure he understands consent!! And all the other things!!!",

            "  This is a really good time to open all doors of conversation. He is obviously at the age where he is feeling things pertaining to his body and sexuality. Porn has probably been watched. Take him for road trip. I had the best conversations with my kids in the car one on one.\nI would start with, hey buddy I  know this is awkward but we need to talk.  Then talk about respecting women and not taking things that isn't theirs. No shame, no discipline. Just talk but get that point across.You want to make it easy for him to talk with you and ask questions. Tell him that no question is stupid and you learn by asking. Tell him porn is not how the majority of people have sex. Tell him its okay to be curious but it matters what he does to appease the curiosity.  Etc.etc. etc.  You definitely need him to feel safe. Tell him that the girlfriend doesn't need to know all the details of his questions.   Talk about safe sex, if a girl says no...she means no. Also I would provide him with condoms so he could figure them out before he is actually going to use one. Any way you get the idea. Just use this  time to set boundaries and to have a talk. \n\nOh and he is old enough to do his own laundry. Lol\n\nSigned...experienced parent",

            "It seems like there is a lot of focus on the interaction that's coming between dad and son and trying to minimize discomfort and awkwardness.\n\nI don't think that's quite the right approach.  Your son has violated boundaries, hopefully this is the first time, hopefully this is the last time.  How you handle this talk could be critical to deciding that.\n\nI understand it's a tricky balancing act, but this is the moment to discuss boundaries, consent, appropriate versus inappropriate interactions and find a more suitable option for your sons use of female underwear.\n\nPlease don't down play this moment when it should be used for critical education.",
            "The best way to approach this is by being honest. This is best served as a one on one conversation, take him out to do something you both enjoy so he knows you arent mad at him (you aren\u2019t right?) and have the conversation afterwards. This isn\u2019t horrible behavior, hes a teenager - but its inappropriate, a violation of privacy, and generally uncool to do. If he gets a girlfriend later in life, and she wants to share her underwear thats great! But you can\u2019t go around nicking peoples knickers. Should he formally apologize? Maybe- if thats what you and the GF think is necessary, personally think it might shame him super hard in a bad way. He\u2019s already going to have trouble looking her in the eye after you guys talk, at least for a little while. Maybe have a talk about what he can do to occupy his brain when those thoughts happen, feels weird to say \u201ctell your son to use the internet.\u201d But if thats the kind of relationship you guys have, go for it.",

            "I can't believe how many of these comments are suggesting to do nothing. This is a conversation that's really important to have. These are the exact sorts of conversations about consent that all we need to be having with our kids.  \n\nDon't shame him, don't berate him, don't yell at him. Come from a place of kindness and tell him that he absolutely cannot do something like that without clear permission from the other person. \n\nWho knows, it might even lead to a whole conversation about consent, which is 100% a thing that should be ongoing and normalized. \n\nIt will feel weird to start talking about so openly, but you'll eventually get used to having those lines of communication open! \n\nGood luck, OP!",

I understand that kids are dumb and do stupid shit but really letting him just do this and not even have a talk about it? You owe that to your girlfriend, yourself, and your child.

He\u2019ll likely be mortified when he realises that you know he masturbates to your girlfriend (and that she knows!), but you need to establish boundaries. Reassure him that it\u2019s fine and totally natural to masturbate, but it\u2019s *not* to steal someone\u2019s underwear - which is a serious invasion of someone\u2019s privacy.\n\nThen, talk with your girlfriend and reassure her that it\u2019s been dealt with.

            "Most of the comments make either exactly the right points or are at least very funny. \n\nI'd like to make a point or two from your son's perspective, however. \n\nI was 16 when my mother died and not long after, my dad started bringing girlfriends into our home. None of them as young as 31, and I was not tempted to go on any panty-stealing missions, but I found some of them attractive and, while I was going through puberty, having my own problems with grief, girls, school, etc, it was not necessarily an enjoyable thing for me to witness my father's new-released adult sexuality first-hand at this time. \n\nI have, of course, absolutely no idea as to your own personal and family context, and mean no judgement here whatsoever. We do what we have to do, we only live once, etc. \n\nYour son is a developing person with an emerging sexuality, and you've introduced into the mix a relatively young, probably attractive woman, of no relation to him. He obviously likes her, as per the joke in your post. There may or may not be some kind of competitive dynamic between you and your son; there often is, your communication may or may not be usually good; often it isn't, between males, I've found. \n\nThere is then the porn factor, which is hard to know, but contemporary porn is absolutely rife with these kind of psuedo family taboo setups. In a 'conventional' nuclear family, the chance for sexual opportunism (eg stealing panties) is usually quite low or protected by relationships and familial bonds; when families separate these sometimes do as well. The sexual stuff can be pure skeevy opportunism or a way to relieve some emotional pain, or both. \n\nWhilst your girlfriend deserves to know about it, I do feel it's remiss of you not to have spoken to your son first. He is your son after all - you may wish your gf a part of your life for a while but he will be until the end. At the moment, he probably does understand why your gf is suddenly awkward around him, because he's put two and two together, but it hasn't been explained to him, so he probably feels quite ashamed. He needs to feel some shame but not for it to drag on, so two and two don't add up to twelve, as it were. Your girlfriend is an adult and should be able to get over it with time; it might be an awkward one for a while, maybe eventually it'll be a funny story. Your son may feel now that you have essentially taken her side in this.  \n\nObvious hindsight here, forgive me, but maybe the easy location of the laundry basket is not a good idea - it's a little like (tho less severe) keeping a child protected from a dog or something, you have to maybe have some care around physical boundaries as well as communicating behavioural ones.",
            "Tifu by writing on reddit instead of actually talking to my kid lol",
            "Dude. A family member used to regularly steal my underwear when I was a teenager, and my dad was too uncomfortable to talk to him, so it kept happening. I don\u2019t know if you can imagine what that feels like to a young woman, but I\u2019ll tell you. I felt absolutely horrified and disgusted. Not only was he going into my room and stealing my things, which is bad enough, but the knowledge that I was the object of this person\u2019s sexual fantasies was beyond disturbing. I felt victimized, and the fact that nobody did anything about it made me feel very helpless and angry. \n\n Maybe I\u2019m hard-hearted about it, but I think your son should feel shame for what he did, because, well\u2026 it is WRONG. He needs to know that it is NOT ok to steal from others, it\u2019s not ok to violate someone\u2019s boundaries by going into their room (if that\u2019s where he got them). His sexual fantasies are his own; if he wants to fantasize about your gf, that\u2019s his business- but once it crosses over into the real world, he is violating a very serious boundary and this cannot be ignored.

In my case, the underwear was taken from our bedroom.  I did feel somewhat violated and a bit awkward myself,  but nowhere near as awful as he felt getting caught. \n\nAnyway, I  decided to write him a letter explaining my feelings, and discussing consent.  I told him that we would not go through his things and that he could buy underwear or obtain it consensually without any judgment from us, but that stealing it is not acceptable.  I wrote that after this letter, I would never bring this up again and that I forgive him and love him.  I let his mother (my girlfriend) read it and then I gave it to him.  He didn't come out of his room for a full day, then apologized.  I just nodded and told him that is the end of it for me, and we moved on.  It never came up again.",

            "Uh yeah no. You need to educate the little creep on boundaries and what is and isn\u2019t okay. He\u2019s 13. He knows stealing is wrong. Stealing someone\u2019s clothes to whack off is also, by extension, wrong and he knows that. This massively violates your gfs boundaries and I would be pissed if was her. A 13 year old knows better, they know that it\u2019s a violation of privacy. He knows that\u2019s your girlfriend and he shouldn\u2019t be doing anything remotely sexual with her (or her clothes). Anyone who says to potter around his feelings because he might feel \u201cshame\u201d is crazy. He should feel remorse for violating a woman\u2019s privacy, and he should feel ashamed for stealing someone\u2019s (who didn\u2019t consent) clothes to jack off in to. he\u2019s actually old enough to be sexually active with people his own age, so who knows if this weird behavior is translating in to those relationships as well. This would be a big concern for me. It should be a big concern from you. It\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s gross af and any amount of shame you\u2019re trying to keep your son from feeling, I promise your gf feels. I\u2019d be so nauseous and disgusted if I found out someone was doing that to my things.\n\nETA: all the people saying you shouldn\u2019t have told gf like they aren\u2019t her underwear and she should know before she gets them back in her wardrobe, I\u2019d like to personally give you each a red flag.",
            "Ya\u2019ll make young kids sound like they\u2019re all disgusting creeps. I never met a kid or teen who was like this, because it\u2019s NOT normal to steal underwear. He didn\u2019t \u201cmake a poor decision\u201d, he violated someone\u2019s boundaries in favor of his sexual gratification, this is serious and not just some ~teehee boys will be boys moment~~. If you\u2019re already old enough to masturbate, you\u2019re old enough to know it\u2019s not ok to steal someone\u2019s underwear, SPECIALLY USED UNDERWEAR. It\u2019s disgusting how so many guys are downplaying it as a \u201clapse in judgement\u201d or \u201cjust hormones\u201d. Normal kids just watch porn and masturbate in private. This kid is a weirdo and needs someone to actually parent him, not validate him telling him that ooohh yesss hormones make you do dumb stuff, try not to do it again pretty please. Hormones just make you horny, bad character and lack of decency makes you do creepy/asshole stuff.",

        "selftext": "This actually happened about 10 years ago and we split up because of it. Before I go any further I want to point out that I am fully aware of how shitty and inexcusable cheating is. I was young and made a mistake that I paid for immediately. This is my story.\n\nSo one night my room mate invited me (21 years old at the time) to the beach to see a bunch of people that we knew from high school and hadn't seen since graduation. We had spent all night in the bar drinking and taking shots. Eventually the bar closes so me, my room mate and the remaining members of our group decided to grab the coolers from our friends hotel and head towards the water to finish the night off with a few more beers and listen to the water. The waves seemed to be appearing from a void. This is about the time things took a turn.\n\nWe had been debating getting in the water, but this is not very smart at night especially when you don't know the schedule of the tide, plus we were absolutely shit faced. I was the first one to start heading that way, removing my clothes down to my underwear, when one of the girls we were with sprints past me. I turn around and everyone is naked. I admit that at this point I had not even considered how my girlfriend would have felt about this, and I got naked too. We had been swimming for about 30 minutes when everyone started splitting up. This was during low tide so you could go quite a ways away from shore and still be waist deep. I had come up to a sandbar with this girl that I had been friends with for years. Neither of us had even realized how far away we had strayed from the group or the shore. This is the moment I cheated. About halfway through the deed I heard my room mate screaming our names at the top of his lungs. We were the only ones left out there and the tide was coming in. We made it only a few feet from the sandbar when I noticed what looked like fireflies in the water. I quickly realized that these were jellyfish and they were EVERYWHERE! We both frantically tried to hurry through but they just kept coming. There were at least 50-75 that we could see. Suddenly I felt a sharp sting across the back of both knees. I grabbed my friend by the wrist and started to pull her as I did my best to run because now shit had gotten serious. I made the one mistake that every beach goer knows better than to do. I decided we needed to get out immediately and climbing the rocks would help. I didn't even get a single foot planted because my toe was immediately sliced open to the bone by a clam. Now I'm naked, pouring blood, and both of us had been stung all over. We started back towards the beach when I was doubled over in pain shooting through my penis and balls. I thought I had been bitten by something, but it turns out a jellyfish had wrapped around my genitals. I had never been in pain like this before. When we finally got to the beach we were surrounded by all of our friends who heard us screaming and had called the police because they thought we had come across a shark. It's now almost 5 am and the experience had completely sobered me up. The police were surprisingly cool about the whole situation and one of them offered to walk us back to the hotel.\n\nFast forward to later in the morning when my room mate had driven us home. When we got home I started evaluating my injuries, I definitely needed stitches, but opted out because I didn't have insurance at the time. My penis looked horrendous however. I couldn't even believe what this jelly fish had done to it. It was swollen, tender and was a different shape. I took a handful or Ibuprofen and took a shower before passing out for the remainder of the day until the evening when I wake up to my girlfriend crawling in the bed with me. My heart sank. She knew I had gone out the night before, and my room mate informed her of my rough night excluding the fact that I betrayed her. She was there for maybe a total of 10 minutes before I completely broke down and confessed, but did not tell her about the cut or the jelly fish. She never looked at me, never cried and left without saying anything. I saw her about 4 years ago in a bar. She approached me and asked if we could talk for a while. She told me that she was never mad at me and that after some time she was just happy I was honest (after the fact she noted). To which I replied, \"well I've got something else to tell you about that night that you're going to love.\" She fucking loved every second of hearing the rest of the events from that night. We laughed pretty hard about it. I paid for her tab and left. We haven't spoken since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I cheated on a very good girl and was stung on the dick by a jelly fish immediately after.",

Luckily, through the years she probably came to appreciate your confession more than she was hurt by your cheating. I was cheated on, humiliated on, my ex never admitted to it, even though it was very obvious, and when I asked him what he had to say he said he would not apologize for anything, he realized how fun it was to mess around, and I just wasn't sexual enough. I waited and waited and waited for an apology that never came. Instead I saw him posting millions of pics with him ogling over and giving gifts to the new girl he cheated with (she also had cheated and left her own bf--which is how I find out). It's been almost a decade and I still don't forgive him, esp. since he never apologized. Last message to him said \"I wish you would have had the decency to have been honest. Maybe then we could've maintained some semblance of a friendship. I hope you learn to become a better person.\" Something like that, then signed it with my endearing nickname. Never got a reply.

At the peak of the pandemic I\u2019d joked with my brother in law about running a hot pepper gauntlet if I ever lost my sense of taste and smell from COVID because I *heard* you could handle spicy things. \n\nMind you, I\u2019ve always loved spicy things, but habaneros are usually the hottest I can go. So I started with those, because why not?  And nothing. So I thought, let\u2019s just jump right into one called the Death Spiral, which is hotter than a ghost pepper but not as hot as a Carolina Reaper. \n\nThis is the moment where I think I can pinpoint where my fuck up happened. Nothing. No taste, no spice. So I IMMEDIATELY threw two Carolina reaper peppers down followed by about 10-15 pieces of habaneros and death spiral peppers. About halfway through, my body started to retaliate. I was sweating. I was numb, I felt like I was going to die. But the burn wasn\u2019t there. Until it was. It\u2019s hard to describe. \n\nAnyway, I suffered through the night with awful indigestion and took antacids to try to calm it.  I was miserable. \n\nI didn\u2019t think it could get any worse, but then the moment came where I had to evacuate them. And my god, the pure fire and rage that my sphincter had was unbearable. It felt like satan himself was trying to claw his way out of my rectum. I swore I\u2019d shat blood, but there was none. For hours afterwards I swear the fire feeling that came from my exit hatch could have made s\u2019mores for the entire family. I\u2019m still in pain days later. \n\nTL;dr - lost taste and smell due to COVID, thought it was a good idea to eat the hottest peppers I could find. Paid the price when satan escaped from my ass. 0/10, would not recommend.\n\nEdited typo.",

The thing is, it never did.  I thought maybe it's just got traffic ahead and it'll come next time around, except it didn't and it hasn't.

Eventually we exchanged instagram accounts after which she asked if I wanted to have video sex on hangouts. She's a pretty girl and we had a good time. Or so I thought...\n\nThis afternoon I received a message from her saying she recorded everything and she wants me to pay \u20ac500 or else she'd send the video to all my contacts. I'm not the guy to start to panic so I called the police for advice. They told me to block her so that she can't send me threats anymore so that's what I did. I came up with the idea to post on my social media that if anyone receives a video of me to not open it because I am being blackmailed.\n\nBut to do that I first had to inform my parents. So i'm calling my mom. She says i'm very dumb but she appreciates me informing her. She then passes the phone to my father so I can explain myself to him. He asks if i'm just naked on the video, or if i'm performing any \"actions\" to which I respons; well yeah, i'm beating my meat of course.\n\nSo now i'm waiting for someone to tell me that they received a video of me masturbating while having to explain myself to everyone who is concerned for me because of my post.\n\ntldr; had video sex with a stranger, am now being blackmailed. I've had to tell my father that I'm choking my chicken on the video.\n\nEDIT: a lot of people are asking me how she got my contacts; she copied a list of all my followers on instagram. She also showed me proof of the recording. And for an update: no video has reached me or my friends yet.\n\nEDIT2: I can't keep up with the comments anymore. A lot of people are telling me their stories of how they got blackmailed. We're all a bunch of horny idiots, aren't we? I wish all the best luck to anyone who is or has been in a similar situation.

            "So um... the same thing just happened to MY MOM a few months ago. She called me up in a panic, told me the guy she\u2019s been talking to for last two months just did a 180 and threatened to send her pictures to her family, and even scarier for her, her coworkers if she didn\u2019t send him $5000. I gave her the obligatory \u201cugh, mom! You should know better!\u201d But you know, boomers.\n\nAnywho, after thinking about it, I told her she probably had nothing to worry about. Of course I was lying, I didn\u2019t know if that was true or not. I assumed that giving him money would only make him come back for more with the same threats. But NOT giving him money and blocking him, what would he get out of sending her nudes? There would no longer be the threat of sending them, right? This helped her sleep at night, kinda. \n\nIt\u2019s been about three months, and it was true. No one got a single naked picture of my dear mother, and he even apologized through her email about a week later asking if they could reconcile (HA!)",
            "They won't send it to any of your friends, it's not worth their time. They only want money. If you don't give them any, they won't do anything. Had a couple of friends who fell for that same thing. It's all a ruse",
            "I think your error was in telling your parents tbh. It\u2019s quite likely she won\u2019t bother following through on the threat. Zero upside for her and plenty of legal liability. \n\nJust block and don\u2019t be too specific in warning anyone. Shutting down the account entirely for a while is also a good move here. If you disappear from the radar she will forget you and go find someone else to scam. \n\nIf she really bothers to post the video, great, prosecute for revenge porn if you can figure out who she is. Which you might be able to do, if she told you where to send her the five hundred euros. \n\nIf you\u2019re innocent of actual wrongdoing you have no worries. Nobody wants to see your junk. That\u2019s what makes blackmailing innocent guys so pointless. A video of a dude wanking is the least hot commodity on the planet. No one will care, let alone be shocked by it, and the video will promptly fade into obscurity.",

            "This happened to me too. What I did was stop responding to her messages, block her and make every account of every social media as private, and then waited. The threats never went through and nothing happened. I learned my lesson. So don't worry op, as someone else in the comments said. Most of these cases never go through with their threats because it is just not worth their time; they'd rather try blackmailing someone else than keep trying to convince someone who isn't responding.\n\nJust make sure you've learned the lesson.",

She recorded my face and dick and threatened to everyone on my fiends list on fb and YouTube and other social media unless I paid $7,000.

        "selftext": "Obligatory, this happened a few years ago and kinda a funny story to look back on now.\n\nSo I used to work in film and TV production. Just graduated college and finally got a shot to work as a production assistant on Spiderman: Homecoming. My first union run set.\n\nDidn\u2019t, and still do t care about MCU movies, nor did I really follow who was acting in them at all. At this time, during shooting Tom Holland was pretty new to the role and the only thing I think he was in that people heard about was Civil War which I hadn\u2019t seen.\n\nMy boss, told me that I had to watch the food spread for any extras coming in and direct them to a different food spread, as extras weren\u2019t allowed to have the main spread. This may sound kind of rude to do but this is pretty typical if you have a lot of extras because it would take too much time for everyone to get a plate and eat so they divide it up.\n\nAnyway, it was right before break and my boss told me as I was waiting for the cast and crew to arrive I can get my food and wait around. So I did. While getting food I noticed a black cadillac pulling up (should have been my first clue) and a few people getting out, Tom being one of them. Again, still didn\u2019t know who he was so I just thought he was maybe an extra. \n\nTom is a super nice kid, came right up to me in line and started talking to me asking me how I was doing and all that. As we were making small talk I interrupted him and said \u201cI don\u2019t mean to interrupt, buy you by chance wouldn\u2019t happen to be an extra are you?\u201d. His face looked really confused and I looks like he thought I was joking, all he said was, \u201cNo, I play spiderman?\u201d\n\nMy stomach dropped, all I could think of in my head was my first big set and i mistaken the lead actor for an extra. I apologized to him and told him that I didn\u2019t know who was playing spiderman at all nor did I ever watch the movies before. He laughed and said it was okay. Bs\u2019ed with him for a couple minutes after until he had to go back to his trailer. I was happy that he took it as well as he did, was really cool to meet him too, but was so incredibly embarrassing.\n\nTL;DR\nI had to make sure no extras went to the food table on Spiderman: Homecoming, with no prior knowledge of who was playing Spiderman. Tom got food next to me and asked him if he was an extra.\n\nEDIT:\nI should of put this in the post originally but didn\u2019t think it was relevant at all, but i\u2019m seeing people comment the same thing. On big sets like this, typically what happens is that production changes the name of the film, in this case the film was called Summer of George, this is for anonymity among outsiders so we don\u2019t attract a crowd. This goes for the same thing with the casts names in the call sheet, it\u2019s usually abbreviated. When I got the call sheet the night before all I had gotten was where, what time PAs were supposed to be. Didn\u2019t even know it was a MCU movie until I signed my contract.",

Employees get to drive up the hill and park in a designated lot for quick access to the park.  \n\nAs I am gearing up while my dad ran to get my guest pass, a black SUV pulls up and the passenger rolls his window down and says \"Are we allowed to park here?\".

Idk where the hell I mustered the courage, but I halfway pointed at the empty seat about to ask if I could sit there, and before I could even ask Tom knew what I was gonna ask and said \u201cOh yea dude, please sit.\u201d I then enjoyed a 30 minute lunch and conversation with Tom friggin Holland, which for me is a dream come true because I\u2019m obsessed with Spider-Man and his is my favorite. \n\nHe really is so nice and humble though.

I never thought my post would get that much attention. I am glad a lot of you were able to get a good laugh out of it and I'm grateful for those who asked for an update because it helped pushed me to come clean to her. I felt it is my responsibility in the end to man up instead of chickening out and switching gyms or trying to play it off as a misunderstanding.\n\nBefore I begin, here are some things you guys wanted to know:\n\n1. I only used the women's room once. After the first day, I waited until I got home.\n\n2.  I introduced myself as Chris. I know that doesn't really help.\n\n3. Some of you wanted to know how I look and I am honestly too embarrassed to post a picture for everyone to see when I am at my lowest. Instead, I give you [this](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4497202/mediaviewer/rm2107681280/) picture of Jimmy O. Yang. My hair is the same length as his in the photo and if I lost my COVID 19 weight he would be my closest celeb lookalike.\n\nAlright anyways, it's been a couple days and while I had the intention of coming clean to her every time I went to the gym, more and more people were returning to work out and so I didn't feel comfortable coming clean to her with so many people around. It wasn't until Saturday that there were less people around. We were chatting as usual and at one point I bit the bullet and told her how I knew she thought I was a trans woman but that I couldn't bear to correct her. I also offered to switch gyms if she felt it was too awkward. She took it surprisingly well. She told me one of her ex who she is still friends with recently came out as a trans woman and that's why she was trying hard to be open minded and inclusive. We ended up talking about how we both still have a lot to learn about the trans community (like how I should have used trans woman with a space in my previous post). So yeah...I'm not sure how to end this but the situation has been resolved.\n\nSpecial shout-out to all the people who commented/messaged me about the correct way to spell trans woman, the guy who wanted to CashApp me funds to go to a new gym and lastly to the person who said I should post on r/bustyasians\n\nTLDR; Told the cute gym employee I am not a trans woman and we [may or may not have a date lined up.](https://imgur.com/nMSSTrz) \ud83d\ude0f",

She made it worse by saying \u201csorry sweetie you looked so cute!\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s the big one I can remember but plenty of other times. It\u2019s cause I\u2019m tail skinny and always have had long hair and I suppose took way more effeminate features from my momma. Around 18 I started taking it as a compliment... like damn if these dudes think you\u2019re a chick you must at very least be kinda pretty and that\u2019s probably not the biggest deal. So what I am saying is role with it! You\u2019re a pretty dude and I guarantee you there are women out there that will live you exactly how you are... there\u2019s even women in your town right now that will! I know it\u2019s hard, but own it! When someone makes a comment be like \u201cyee, I\u2019m a pretty dude oh well\u201d and just be free :) \n\nThanks for the update my dood.",

        "selftext": "This happened this morning.   \n\n\nThis TIFU started on Saturday (it's Thursday now)   \n\n\nMatched with a girl on Facebook Dating and she was very cute. I did notice that she only smiled with her top row of teeth in the pictures and figured that her bottom teeth might be effed up, but didn't think much of it. She had trad wife energy and I was into it.   \n\n\nWe end up meeting on Sunday after some pretty clean chatting. Turns out she lives exactly 8 mins from me so I offer to pick her up for our first date. I learn a LOT about her in a very short time - I won't reveal all the details, but she had battled a long time with eating disorders - thus her teeth a bit janky. From what I saw they weren't that bad.   \n\n\nThis is all a red herring - nothing about this TIFU has to do with the teeth. I wanted to mention it because I was so focused on this that I didn't pick up the other red flags.   \n\n\nI also find out that she doesn't drink all that often and only at meal times if it's appropriate - how nice. She also lives with her parents - why? She has a surgery coming up and it's involving a lot of physical therapy - I piece together it's probably due to her aforementioned eat disorders and a complication thereof.   \n\n\nOtherwise, great date.   \n\n\nFast forward to last night/this morning.   \n\n\nI invite her over for dinner. The plan was her dad would drop her off because she doesn't have her car due to a recent wreck and I would drive her home later that evening. Okay.   \nShe also tells me that she is a felon like 1 hour before we hang out. Okay...   \nDon't worry, it's just 3 DUIs and it's over with. Thanks for telling me? \\[No, really, I should've paid attention to this red flag\\]   \n\n\nShe comes over and after pleasantries I start to cook a shrimp curry soup. She asks for a drink - I show her my drink cabinet and picks out the most expensive tequila I have - that's fine. She proceeds to have 2 shots.   \n\n\nBiggest fuck up: I presume that EVERYONE is good at self regulation of their drinking. It's just what I believe - we know if we are getting toasted or not and it's intentional.   \n\n\nI join and catch up with 2 shots. I get a seltzer for myself and she grabs a cocktail. And another one. 4 drinks in 40 minutes for this 110 lb person. I assume she's good at holding her liquor.   \n\n\nAfter dinner we are cuddling where she has her head in my lap. Suddenly! To my surprise she takes her pants off and says \"let's go to bed - a woman has needs.\"   \n\n\nGentle reader - let me mention nothing sexual happened here. I was barely registering as tipsy and she was beyond drunk. \n\nI set her in bed and she immediately passes out. No worries. I'll put a trashcan near her and I'll go watch some tv/plays games and check on her.   \n\n\nThe horror story starts here:   \nI check on her and I realize that my bed is dark. I touch it: it's pee.   \nJust fucking great.   \nI attempt to rouse her and alert her she has soiled herself (and my bed). She wakes up and asks me why I'm waking her up and then tries to flirt with me. I then notice she's soiling herself. Again. Actively. .While trying to seduce me.   \n\n\nI somehow manage to get her to the bathroom and sit her on a toilet and have her drink water to sober up - this was a bad plan later.   \n\n\nShe refuses to use the toilet and I ease her down to the ground on my fuzzy bath mat. I drape her with a towel and place another beneath her - just in case.   \n\n\nI then spend the next 5 hours until 4:30 AM washing my clothes, her clothes, my bedding, and comforter. At some point I sit on the couch where she was earlier and realized that she had soiled my couch. That's why she was so urgent to go to bed. FML.   \n\n\n(I do check on her to make sure she's okay and I end up changing her towel twice)  \n\n\nI finally decide to go to sleep at around 5 and I have work at 9, despite the ice storm. I set an alarm at 8 so I can drive her the hell home and forget it all happened.   \n\n\nAt 6:30 she wakes up, confused and naked, to which I provide her some of my gym clothes that I don't really care about. I go back to the couch and she is embarrassed and hungry. Fine. Go eat leftovers, but let me sleep. She clangs around the kitchen awhile. She apparently ate all the shrimp in the soup. Great.   \nShe decides to cuddle with me on the couch and I had no energy to push her away. She attempts to kiss me, but I rebuke it - and then realize there's gin on her breath.   \n\n\nI spring up and go to the kitchen and realize SHE DRANK ANOTHER 4 OZ of GIN. At 7:30 AM!   \n\n\nI run back to the bed and she's catatonic again.   \nI start to freak out and see her phone - she told me her birthday on the first date and used that to open her phone - voila. Turns out she missed like 9 calls from her parents, so I call them from her phone.   \nI explain every single detail of the happenings of the night and they are mortified.   \nI tell them I have work and they need to come get her now.   \nAn hour later her father shows up - which is ridiculous because they live so close, but I was just happy he was there. \n\nI had gathered her laundry, belongings, etc and give it to Dad. Dad is not happy. He yells at her and I tell him, \"Hey, sorry, my house - please no yelling.\" He apologizes and agrees (surprised that actually worked, but I guess he was embarrassed about everything?) Dad takes the stuff and comes back and says, \"She was almost 1 week sober. And this happens. Not your fault, son.\"   \nOh.   \nThe DUI thing makes sense now.   \nShe CANNOT stand up by herself, so he tries to scoop her up from the couch, but she's completely dead weight and wakes up, yelling that she hates her dad  \nAND   \nPEES  \nON  \nHIM  \n\n\nAnd my couch. Again.   \n\n\nWe both end up dragging her to the car and my neighbors are watching, mortified of what seems like a kidnapping happening.   \n\n\nHer mom just texted me to apologize a few hours later and that she would get me my clothes back.   \n\nEdit: I'm most upset that in sitting here eating my shrimp-less soup\n\nTL;DR: I ignore red flags on a cute a date and she ends up pissing on everything in my house and her father.",

She has a obvious New York accent, I ask her if she has always lived in Southern California, \u201cno. I just moved here because my parents wanted me to go to rehab here cause it\u2019s far away from New York\u201d oh okay. Why were you in rehab? \u201cI started to have a bad coke addiction that turned into a crack addiction. I was fired for working at the hospital while high on crack\u201d. She honestly seemed fine and I am all for not dwelling on people\u2019s past.

She seems like a well put-together woman, with a steady job and a degree. Highly intelligent. But functional alcoholics can hide even in plain sight. \n\nA few weeks later, she tells me about her time at rehab, talks about her trauma, and her tremors in the morning. I'd always wondered why when she went to bed, there was a full glass of wine on the beside table, but not there the next morning - she got up to drink it, like someone would with a glass of water. Not sure why I avoided those red flags for the next few weeks after she told me her story.\n\nA total of 6 weeks after I met her, her nasty and violent side comes out when she drinks. I end it there. \n\nBut she forever changed my relationship with alcohol, and not for the better. Still working through that shit myself.",

I never witnessed/saw it while I was growing up until the last couple years of my Uncles life and then 8 years later my Dad's life (dad got sober when i was 4/5 and stayed for over 25 years) and I was the only one there for all of it with my Dad.

My parent's house is a one story, cheaply built house. This means that the walls are PAPER thin, you can pretty much hear any normal volume conversation from anywhere in the house with pretty great clarity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my case, doing the business isn't a loud activity so I don't have to worry about timing my strokes with the whir of the AC unit to mask the sound. I more have to worry about the activity level of those around me; as it is frequent where my parents will come to my room to talk or ask me to do tasks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith that being said. I have been caught off guard quite a lot and I have my lock down protocol in place to lower suspicion and avoid getting caught. One of the tactics of this 'lock down protocol' includes the time it takes me to answer a knock on my door. This consequently, is also the fatal flaw that now has me recounting the traumatic events of today. I figure that the quicker that I answer a knock with 'come in' the less suspicion I draw. I personally feel that if I were to yell 'hold on' and take like 10 seconds to hide the evidence, I would be raising the level of suspicion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, some may think that the tactic of answering as quick as possible is dumb. However, I have a little hallway inside of my room which is about 3 feet from the entrance of my door to my bed cutting off line of sight to anyone who even fully steps into my room. For the most part, my family never fully walks into my room past the hallway because they know that sound travels and that they don't have to make eye contact with me to get whatever they have to say across. However, tonight, my mom, who has gotten into painting during the quarantine, had a new piece of art to show me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo it's about 7pm and I can hear that my parents are in the living room down the hall watching their favorite TV shows, which they do for an hour or so every night after dinner. So I figure that now is as good a time as any to 'get busy' since I wouldn't be interrupted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was wrong. No one was watching the TV, and my mom was in her office right next to my room scribbling away at our messiah.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe folly of my judgement became clear as day when I heard a knock at the door just as I had past the point of no return. I scrambled to hide the evidence as the words 'come in' left my mouth. As I pulled my pants up, my mom turned the corner with a freshly painted picture of Jesus fucking Christ holding the hand of a little girl whilst they strolled down a dirt path in a meadow. I stood there looking into the eyes of Jesus while my mistake soaked my inner leg and sock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut at that moment I realized that this was only the beginning of my problems. I began to wonder why, in such a dark room, I was able to see the face of our lord and savior so clearly. It was then that I realized that in my rush to save what pride I had left, I had pulled my phone by my earbuds on to the floor, showing in glorious 1080p HD what could only be described of as SIN. I rush to put my soaked foot over the screen to possibly save myself from the eyes of the lord.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith the lack of reaction from my mom, I figured that she hadn't seen what was on my phone, only fixated on my reaction to her new creation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to pick up my phone, mashing buttons on the sides hoping to find the power button to turn it off. Unfortunately, at the same time, I was trying to disconnect my earbuds to put my phone into my pocket as quick as possible. The combination of both frantic actions lead to the high decibel release of pain and pleasure that filled the room and serenaded the ears of my poor mother with the sounds of some woman being ass-blasted by a well endowed gentleman. My mom exits the room with not another word spoken.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt has been 2 hours and the house has fallen silent. I fear that my time in this house has come to an end. I will live the rest of my life wandering the streets, homeless, hoping one day to repent for my sins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : I was masturbating and about to cum when a knock at the door from my mom had me rushing to be presentable. I came in my pants while looking at a picture of Jesus that she had painted while porn blared from my speakers, causing an awkward moment in the universe.\n\nGeneralized update and edit:\n\nIt's the next day. I've crossed paths with my mom a few times and shes been kind of quiet. She doesn't seem too cross, so I'm gonna stay under the radar and ride it out the best I can. My parents have really mellowed with age and I feel that this may have been just more awkward than \"wrong\" and time will probably alleviate the tension\n\nI've read through some of the comments and I would like to thank you guys for the humorous and light-hearted responses. Really helps take some of the anxiety out of the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would like to address some other types of questions to give a better understanding of my situation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I don't have a lock to my door. And I couldn't get one.\n\nMy parent's theory on door locks is \"If you're doing something that requires a locked door, then you probably shouldn't be doing it\"\n\n\\- Yes I know I should have done it in the bathroom. And yes, I should have done it when no one was awake\n\nHowever, as the title suggests \"Today I Fucked UP\" I fucked up everything for this situation. From my conditioning to respond to door knocks the way I do, to my inability for self control sometimes.\n\n\\-The Phone\n\nI know that video players across all modern phones pause the video when an audio device is connected or disconnected. However, on the website that I was using (xfantasy), touching anywhere on the screen plays and pauses the video. In my anxiety riddled, fat fingered attempt to hide the phone, a brush against the screen was bound to happen.\n\n\\-It's fake\n\nEverything is fake. Nothing could ever be real. You're just living in a simulation that is tailor made to anger you by filling Reddit with \"creative writing\" papers. What horrors it must be that you alone have to endure such torture, to be exposed to such inhumanities. Thank you so much for being the one to decipher the falsities of our universe. If only my programmer overlords who made this simulation could have made me in your image to be a truth seeker, what a life that would be /s\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "Figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. \n\nBf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. So our sex life has stayed at our normal level. Probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. \n\nI've been having horrible nausea and headaches. I already have anxiety so I figured I'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. \n\nThis morning I woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. I Google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. Symptoms include nausea and headaches. And the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. \n\nI've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. \n\nYou're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. Now that I know this it seems SUPER OBVIOUS. But uh, guess I was too horny to think it through.\n\nTL;DR did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it\n\nETA: Thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. \n\nTo answer as many questions as I can and also because I feel mildly defensive: He is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. There is no cure but no timeline either. We probably have a few more years. He is in EXCELLENT care at a renowned university program. We adore his team. I've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. This was not reviewed with us, only side effects. The separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. We didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. But it is mine. So all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. We're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. Or they just forgot. Or they figured we'd read the info. Shit happens. \n\nEdit 2: please stop hitting on me in my DMs, jesus fucking christ ",

I\u2019m not in a relationship though so we skipped over it but she still gave me the information booklet. \n\nBut then she made very clear that after using the restroom at home where I live with family, I (chemo patient) have to close the lid of the toilet and then flush twice. If in a public restroom without toilet lids, lay a toilet seat protector over top of the waste and then flush twice. All because that\u2019s how you get rid of the chemo, is through bodily waste/secretions. She went over that at least 4 times and then quizzed me at the end of the session. \n\nYour boyfriend should probably review any chemo reading material he received with you, or ask to have another chemo counseling session with you there. There may be more you both need to be fully aware of. And you should definitely go see your doctor. Wishing the best for him, and you. ",

They advised us to wash clothing and bed sheets separate from other laundry and assign a private toilet to him specifically. This would last for about a week after each treatment. \n\nAsk the doctors for information. There must be some brochures that clearly explain all of this.

        "selftext": "Last night, my wife's boss from her brand new job invited us over for dinner. On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. \n\nI scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. \n\nMy wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased.\n\nSoon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was.\n\nNow,  I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. \n\nClaim vegan-ism? No, I'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak.\n\nJust then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head.\n\nI knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window.\n\nHere's the big time FU.  The window wasn't open.  It was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake.\n\nMy wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. \n\nMy wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look.\n\nI just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was \"I... I'm so sorry. I am such a clutz... I don't know... I was just cutting it.. and... it...  ... it slipped... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz... right honey?... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up... I can't believe this... I am so sorry\" etc... etc...\n\nBoth women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story.\n\nI knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak. \n\nI remained pretty quiet the rest of the evening. My wife's only two words to me since the incident are \"I'm fine\". \n\nTL;DR:  Tried to sneakily throw my under-cooked steak through an open window... only to find out it wasn't open.\n\nEdit: Thanks kind redditors (:\n\nUpdate: Just got the first post-\"I'm fine\" communication from my wife, via text, who is at work...\n\n\"good news, [boss' name] and i just had a good laugh over how much of a fucking idiot u are. i hope u know u will never live this down. love u you moron\"",

We also live in an old wood house up a mountain.\n\nOk so this happened this me this morning. \n\nWe woke up as usual and I went to put on the coffee machine, which we set up the night before because 4am is a ridiculous time to try and do anything\n\nWhile the coffee was brewing I absent mindedly began to clear the sink from the night before. We are pretty lazy at night so all the dishes etc just get soaked.\n\nSo in my 4am haze I'm fishing about in the sink trying to clear out the rice from yesterdays meal so the water will go down. I grab what I assume to be a tea bag and go to put it in the bin. But of course, before I can do that I have to squeeze the liquid out as i dont want shitty water in the bottom of the bin.\n\n\nHere's the fuck up incase you didnt see it coming. The 'teabag' is a dead mouse that has drowned overnight and become waterlogged and swollen. I squeeze the mouse and it explodes, covering my face with it's awful pink water/viscera.\n\nNo idea why my mouth was open at the time apart from it was 4am and I was probably mouth breathing and half asleep still.\n\nIt tastes like pennies and sadness. I may never be the same again.\n\nTL;DR I exploded a mouse thinking it was a teabag and drank its divine juices, which I assume shot out of its waterlogged anus.\n\nEDIT: thanks to everyone contacting me to tell me to seek medical advice.

            "This reminds me of the bad mouse plague we had about 10 years ago. We live in a house that predates local records, so at least 130 years old. (Central West NSW, Australia) It's an old farm house in the middle of thousands of acres of crops, so the mice love it here as much as we do.\nAnywho, during this plague, the worst one I've ever lived through, I was catching around 500 mice an hour in one single trap in my bedroom. My traps were tall buckets with a small hole in the lid and a sprinkling of food in the bottom. They could jump in and until it was around half full of mice, they couldn't jump back out. (I'd take the bucket outside and thump the mice to death with a lump of wood)\nThe ground outside was a deep carpet of running mice. The cats were so over it, they would just lay there, covered in mice. \n\nYou'd climb into bed at night, with the mice in the sheets with you. They'd crawl all over you, but there was no way to stop them. Eventually you'd just be so exhausted you'd lay down in your mouse bed and try to sleep. There was no where else to go, every one had mice. \nDuring the night you'd feel them biting you. You'd reach down, half asleep and grab whatever mouse was closest to the biting and throw it as hard as you could at the wall, then roll over and try to go back to sleep. \nTo this day I don't know how I lived like that. We've had smaller mouse plagues, we are having a small one right now, but I hope I never see another big plague. It was beyond a nightmare. \n\nEventually the mice run out of food and begin eating each other. It's the only way a mouse plague stops.",

And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. \n\nRagebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I\u2019d take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.\n\nI fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn\u2019t care and...\n\nI broke my back.\n\nAnd then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. \n\nWoke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.\n\nTL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face.\n\nEDIT - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so I\u2019m not paralyzed and there shouldn\u2019t be any life-ruining effects. I\u2019m just on bed rest and LOTS of pain medication!\n\nThanks for the silver! And gold! AND THE POO!

Company held party to celebrate the completion of big project. As I was walking to my car, I noticed a drunk female coworker (mid 30s). We worked together for 3 years, but it's a big department and I don't know much about her. \n\nShe was having difficulty walking. I offered to help and she held out her hand. I asked if she drove here. She took an Uber. Helped her call another one as she vomited. Uber driver arrived, saw the condition she was in, and took off without saying a word. Understandable. \n \nI decided to drive her home. I have a duel front and rear dashcam setup. I moved the rear camera, placed it in front, and adjusted angle to make sure inside of vehicle is covered (lifesaver). \n\nFast forward one month to April 25 (last week) and I was called into HR. My manager was sitting with a serious expression. They asked what I did after the party. I immediately became defensive and asked what the meeting is about. \n\nHR person said that they received a complaint from an employee accusing me of inappropriate behavior. I responded, \"I have no idea what you are talking about. I did nothing inappropriate during or after that party. Whoever complained has the wrong guy!\"\n\nThey stepped out into the hallway for a couple minutes. I'm starting to sweat even though I did nothing wrong. Thinking, I remember giving coworker a ride home. That must be it. They step back into the office, manager says they have a witness who saw me put drunk coworker into my car. \n\nI said, \"Yea, I drove her home. Nothing happened...and I did not 'put' her in. She accepted the help.\" Silence. They stare at me like I'm guilty. Nothing but suspicion and judgement. HR says they'll continue investigating and will speak to me the following week.\n\nI received an email today, telling me to make a statement for the police and that I'm suspended until the case is dismissed. I'm pissed. Really pissed.\n\nI hired an attorney and submitted statement to police. After asking around, I learned the coworker I gave a ride to is apparently the ex-wife of my manager's golfing buddy. Yea. \n\nLittle does the company know I protected myself with dashcam footage as well as a short cell phone video of me walking her to the house. I am innocent and will fight this.\n\nTL;DR - I drove drunk coworker home. Accused of inappropriate behavior one month later. Suspended by my company while they investigate. I hired attorney and have video footage proving my innocence.",

            "So... who called the cops? HR? The manager? Seems like none of them have standing to report a crime based on giving a person a ride & nothing else... and why would HR tell you to make a statement, rather than the police themselves?\n\nFurther, if it was a company event where the employee overindulged, the company itself could potentially be liable for getting an employee too drunk & then causing an accident or being unable to consent (the former from the state, the latter from a lawsuit). I was an HR employee for multiple companies for 12 years, & still work closely with them... no way would we have called the cops over a non-crime (esp without talking to the alleged victim employee). There would need to be something more alleged than just giving a ride.\n\nIf true, though, I do wish you luck! Sounds like you should find another place to work, though.",

            "HR Professional here. The advice in this comment thread is really terrible don't go making matters worse by listening to some of the nonsense high in the comments here.\n\nFirst and foremost when there is a complainant involving \"inappropriate\" behavior which could be some type of sexual harassment, or worse, you absolutely suspend the person being investigated. If no wrong doing is found, you are brought back and paid for the time you were suspended, which is the case almost always. Whether is it legally owed depends on a lot of factors.\n\nWe're missing a lot of details here. I don't understand why any sort of statement is being made to the police or why the police are involved at all. The only reason would be if a crime is reported to have taken place or suspected to have. My gut tells me that the individual who OP gave the ride home made a complaint after blacking out and being told weeks later she in fact was not driven home by an Uber.\n\nWhat are the details of the complaint outside of \"inappropriate\"? I certainly could see this complain as being \"OP drove me home drunk and recorded me in this compromised state without my knowledge or consent\". This also makes the police report make sense to me as well.

There i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.\n\n\nFast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. We went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. I dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if I won he would get Graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those Graham cracker Christmas houses, yes it was Spring, yes we were wasted.\n\n\nSo the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. The liquor probably helped a lot but I thought it was hot as fuck. He starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and I close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. Not a second later I hear a girl screeching. It scares the shot out of me so I scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. The guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and I'm still laying down and I cant see shit. She runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. \n\n\nI dont really know what I was supposed to do so I just kind of took a shower and left. Their shower was really nice though. It was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.\n\n\nOverall\nGuys looks: 8/10 Nice beard\n\nSex: 9.4/10 Nice and steamy \n\nCum in eye: \u00df Gritty?\n\nShower: 10/10 Really cool\n\n\nTL;DR: Got drunk, lost a bet, got titfucked, got cum in eye, fucked a relationship but showered in a really cool shower.\n\n\nEdit: So... I was piss drunk when I made this post and simply put I would much rather have not posted this story at all. However as people seem to be deeply intrigued in it I will leave it up. I apologize for the parts of the story that seems to be just rambling as I had quite a bit to drink last night. Also, to those that gave me the awards I greatly appreciate it.",

            "Dear Reddit Community,\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I write this farewell message to express my reasons for departing from this platform that has been a significant part of my online life. Over time, I have witnessed changes that have gradually eroded the welcoming and inclusive environment that initially drew me to Reddit. It is the actions of the CEO, in particular, that have played a pivotal role in my decision to bid farewell.\n\nFor me, Reddit has always been a place where diverse voices could find a platform to be heard, where ideas could be shared and discussed openly. Unfortunately, recent actions by the CEO have left me disheartened and disillusioned. The decisions made have demonstrated a departure from the principles of free expression and open dialogue that once defined this platform.\n\nReddit was built upon the idea of being a community-driven platform, where users could have a say in the direction and policies. However, the increasing centralization of power and the lack of transparency in decision-making have created an environment that feels less democratic and more controlled.\n\nFurthermore, the prioritization of certain corporate interests over the well-being of the community has led to a loss of trust. Reddit's success has always been rooted in the active participation and engagement of its users. By neglecting the concerns and feedback of the community, the CEO has undermined the very foundation that made Reddit a vibrant and dynamic space.\n\nI want to emphasize that this decision is not a reflection of the countless amazing individuals I have had the pleasure of interacting with on this platform. It is the actions of a few that have overshadowed the positive experiences I have had here.\n\nAs I embark on a new chapter away from Reddit, I will seek alternative platforms that prioritize user empowerment, inclusivity, and transparency. I hope to find communities that foster open dialogue and embrace diverse perspectives.\n\nTo those who have shared insightful discussions, provided support, and made me laugh, I am sincerely grateful for the connections we have made. Your contributions have enriched my experience, and I will carry the memories of our interactions with me.\n\nFarewell, Reddit. May you find your way back to the principles that made you extraordinary.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNABDad",

        "selftext": "Actually just happened a few minutes ago at the time of writing this. I'm one of those losers who loves Snapchat streaks. I collect them diligently and keep them going with morning and night streaks every day. At this point I have streaks with about twenty five people, some of them reaching almost 500 days.\n\nI say all that to set up the fact that I'm affecting several people that I've been doing this with for a long time. Today I was brewing coffee in my giant metal percolator. It's very shiny and... reflective.\n\nI sometimes sleep in the nude and last night was no exception. This morning I was waiting until I had to get ready for work before I got dressed, so I was still very naked when I decided to send my daily morning streak. Today I decided to take a picture of my brewing coffee as the picture (I'm not very creative). I did so, added a couple of \"good morning\" graphics, and sent it without a second thought.\n\nThen one of my friends took a screenshot of my streak, prompting confusion. He sent it back to me and asked \"Uh... did you mean to have your dick in the pic?\"\n\nSure enough, in the picture, my dick is CLEARLY visible in the reflective surface of the percolator. I just sent this to 25 people and so far only a couple of them have opened it, but I now live in dread of what this day brings.\n\nTL;DR sent a reflective dick pic to 25 people via snapchat streaks and a coffee percolator\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE** since everyone keeps asking. Fortunately for me but disappointingly for many of you, no one seemed to notice except my friend who told me about it in the first place. At least, no one said anything to me about it so far. Lesson learned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDouble edit! For those who are wondering what a streak is, it's simply when you send a snap to someone and get one in return once every 24 hours. After three days, you get a little number next to their name showing how many days in a row you've snapped.\n\nFor those who are insulting me for being a grown man who uses snapchat, I'm sorry that my usage of a social media app that takes perhaps one full minute out of my day is so annoying to you. Let people enjoy things!\n\nFor those reminding me that there's no way 25 people care about what I do in the morning, *I know that*. You think I care about whatever bullshit they send me back? We do it to see the little number go up and get that quick dopamine rush, not because we give a shit about what coffee we're drinking!\n\nFinally, god damn you thirsty bitches, [here's the picture](https://imgur.com/a/qFOWhbP). It's not super noticeable unless you know it's there.\n\n**Final edit:** No, I will not be starting an OnlyFans. Please stop DMing me about it xD",

At a certain point, I took a picture of my vagina.\n\nWhat happens next? Instead of choosing a person and then making a snap, I always took one and chose who to send it to afterwards. I had always done it like this so it was out of habit. You can already guess what happened, I accidentally sent it to a girl of my class.\n\nI realized that it was too late and I couldn't find any better solution than first changing my name to something random, then deleting my account. Next day at school while I was talking to my classmates and the girl was around, I casually dropped \"holy shit my snapchat randomly got hacked and a few friends told me they got really weird pictures, I managed to delete my account\"\n\nLuckily she was more of a quiet one that didn't like to gossip and start drama.\n\nEnglish is not my native language but me and my then boyfriend were both gamers and used a lot of English words in our sentences out of habit anyway. Sometimes we'd even use a full English sentence. The fact that the caption I added with the snap was in English probably played in my favor to make my story slightly more believable.\n\nShe never said anything about it herself, and up until this day I still have no clue what she thought. Honestly, until I read this post I had totally forgotten.\n\nAlso, I'm an adult now and I don't send nudes anymore because I don't trust people anyway.",

He likes to follow us around the house and is generally near me.\n\nI also happen to have IBS, which has been aggravated by the stress of having a new puppy, and has apparently decided to manifest itself by me farting incessantly. I\u2019m not talking about quiet farts - I mean these loud, lawnmower-engine sounding farts that you would not expect to come out of a very small girl.\n\nSince these farts are rather embarrassing, I\u2019ve taken to jokingly blaming them on my puppy. Whenever I fart in front of my family and he\u2019s around (which is most of the time), I would loudly say his name in a scandalized voice. This would usually result in him walking over to me, so of course when my adorable puppy comes over, I would pet him and kiss him.\n\nYesterday, I was home alone with him and he was on the other side of the room. I let out a roaring fart, but since I was alone, I didn\u2019t say his name to \u201cblame\u201d it on him. However, as soon as he heard it, he still walked right over to me and sat down, tail wagging, waiting to be pet, which is when I realized I accidentally trained my dog to associate my farts with coming over to me and getting pet. \n\nTL;DR I accidentally trained my puppy to come (not that time of come, you pervs) when I fart.\n\nedit: [dog tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/sploot/comments/itxmm2/kitchen_sploots_are_his_favourite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

He did it more often after the first time I said \"Eew, that's nasty!\" One day my husband said to me, \"Watch this!\" (We were sitting in the living room, the dog was elsewhere in the house.) Husband called out \"Penis Nose!\" and the dog came bounding over to him.\n\nEDIT: Trai (full name Trailways, because he was a greyhound...my husband's sense of humor at work once again) crossed the Rainbow Bridge in 2003 after living with us for 11 years, so I don't have many digital photos of him stored away.

There has been a persistent cricket issue in my basement that I have not gotten around to addressing yet. While jerking off on said beanbag, I felt something slimy and sort of greasy in my asscrack. I immediately assumed this was some ass sweat from the jerk off session and wrote it off. Well, once I finished the act, I scratched the crevice, and to my surprise, the disfigured body of a still twitching cricket wound up on my hands. I flicked the cricket away swiftly and quickly rid of any cricket residue in my glory hole. Cricket guts now cover the edge of my beanbag, and I am on the brink of vomiting just writing this.\n\nTL;DR- felt something weird in my ass while jerking off, was a dumbass and decided to continue without taking precautions, and came with a cricket still squished between my cheeks.",

To make matters a little extra fucked up, because the universe thought this wasn't bad enough, I threw up all over my side of the bed. He  jolts awake, mid stream, thinking he has  just pissed the bed, to find this gigantic mess of vomit and piss everywhere. We spent the morning cleaning up the mess. We talked about it, but in that moment we didnt even know what to say to each other, all we could do was laugh hysterically like two maniacs in a bed covered in fluids.\n\nTL;DR Tried to wake my boyfriend up by giving him head, and he pissed in my mouth and I threw up on the bed.",

The whole unit (and the neighboring floor) has been turned into negative airflow rooms to keep airborne COVID-19 particles from infecting the rest of the hospital. This isnt a big issue for the semi-sick covid patients, since they are generally droplet and contact precautions. But in the ICU, most of these patients are ventilated and constantly aeresolizing this virus.\n\nAnyways, I'm lucky enough to have a PAPR, which is a hood that goes over your head and shoulders that's hooked up to a machine around your waist by a tube. This machine blows air into the hood, making it so any aerosolized material in the air is pushed away from my face. It's not a closed system like a scuba tank or anything though; all the air that's blown at your face is sucked in through this belt machine, which is filtering it constantly through a 3M filter.\n\nAnyways, I'm all geared up and working in a patients room when I have to pass some gas. The patients intubated and sedated, I'm wearing a hood, no one else is around- what's the harm?\n\nI let a silent but deadly rip... right under this PAPR machines intake. Now, no particulate is getting through this thing, but gas sure does. I spent the next 5 minutes trying not to wretch as this hood circulates my toxic ass scent through my hood.\n\nNote to self, wear the papr on the front next time.\n\nTL;DR: dont toot in the air chute unless you wanna smell your own ass fruit",

You didn\u2019t mention that you weren\u2019t and in your story you didn\u2019t mention that you disliked it so I might be assuming but it doesn\u2019t sound like it. \n\nHumans are complex. She probably wanted to be okay with it. She probably wanted it to be fun for all of you. I feel bad that this has happened to you guys but she probably just needs to sort through her feelings... even if she kept telling herself she was going to be fine with it, and telling you that, at some point (obviously) she couldn\u2019t convince herself anymore. \n\nI hope you guys are able to work it out and if not, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a good learning opportunity though. \n\nIf she ever wants to have a threesome in the future, she should probably set some ground rules. I had a friend who liked to participate in threesomes with her man but she had rules - he wasn\u2019t allowed to fuck the other girls, and depending on who the third person was, he may or may not have been allowed to touch them. Her boyfriend was totally okay with that despite how selfish it sounds - seeing her with another girl turned him on, seeing him turned on turned her on, third person had fun regardless... win win in these kinds of scenarios. \n\nJust boundaries. Establishing boundaries are key. Haha. \n\nGood luck, OP.",

            "I think to make sense out of this its important to ask how long, after his girlfriend walks out of the room, did OP keep fucking her friend in the room without her?",
            "A lot of really terrible advice ITT. First of all, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but this is the kind of situation people really need to talk about first and set boundaries. (Edit: realizing that this might look like I\u2019m blaming you for what happened, but that\u2019s not it at all, just some advice for the future. It\u2019s hard to turn this kind of thing down, but it\u2019s not worth it if it ruins your relationship. Obviously you had no idea this would happen, so don\u2019t blame yourself, just be more careful in the future.) It\u2019s not as sexy as the spontaneous threesomes you see in movies and shit, but you won\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings, and you\u2019ll still have an awesome time. It\u2019s a lot harder to stop things when you\u2019re in the moment without feeling guilty for ruining someone else\u2019s good time.\n\nSecond, to everyone blaming the girlfriend, have you considered that maybe she just made a mistake and she\u2019s not reacting well? And perhaps she doesn\u2019t know how to express herself or deal with her feelings, and associating what happened with something else that would make her unhappy is the only thing that makes sense? It\u2019s totally reasonable, especially if they\u2019re young. She\u2019s probably never done this before, she probably had the best intentions, then all of a sudden she realized she wasn\u2019t ok with seeing her boyfriend with another woman or with a friend, and now she\u2019s the bad guy for ruining it for them. She could know she\u2019s a hypocrite for getting up on her friend, but it doesn\u2019t change how she feels, so how does she explain that? Y\u2019all are totally ok with saddling her with the entire burden of what happened and just fucking off, you\u2019re gonna have a lot of shitty relationships.\n\nThere has to be something else going on here. If you care about her, keep talking to her about it. Unfortunately sex, especially for young people (in the US at least), is very closely tied to guilt and shame, and you\u2019ll never know what actually happened until she tells you. Keep trying to talk to her. Tell her that you love her and you would have never done it if you know it would have affected her this way. Let her know she\u2019s more important to you than anyone and you really want to work out what happened so it doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nEveryone else: Sex is a group activity, and if you care about someone, take responsibility for doing everything you can to ensure that they feel safe. Talk to your partners about sex before you get into a situation like this, even if it\u2019s just the two of you. Making sure everyone feels comfortable with what is going to happen is more important than killing the vibe. You don\u2019t want to lose someone over a shame or guilt issue you never knew was there. The mental burden from religion, parents, society, expectations, shaming, abuse, all kinds of shit, is really hard, and you want to have talked about it BEFORE you get naked, or you could easily be in a situation where that person never wants to face you again even though you did nothing wrong. You can\u2019t expect everyone to be able to easily deal with their issues on their own and not have to do any work with them to make sure no one gets hurt. Make a fucking effort.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I mostly made this comment because Reddit is filled with children. In the US we mostly don't tell our children how to act in these situations, so hopefully some people can take my advice about talking to each other before sex, because you will avoid a lot of problems this way. I don't give a shit about upvotes and downvotes. Don't spend your teens creating hurtful, scarring memories about your sexual relationships. Also, there's a lot of blame and anger going around in comments. While I can understand coming away from this situation with these emotions, I am worried that they inform a lot of peoples' opinions of potential partners, both men and women. Don't let your bad experiences turn you into a suspicious and angry person, both for yourself and how it'll end up causing you to treat others. Don't assume you know what someone is thinking or how they feel. Try to find out. It will save you a lot of heartache. Understanding that people do shitty things for a lot of reasons and that you don't have to automatically react to them negatively will make you a better person.\n\nEdit 2: I'm not sure why so many people are hung up on how \"she cheated\". It's super blamey; the OP didn't say anything about being upset about her getting on her friend. In fact, I could make the same assumptions about his state of mind and say that he was into it because he jumped in the sack with both of them. But maybe he had reservations about her actions, but did it anyway because it would be awesome to have a threesome. We don't know. He didn't tell us. They should probably talk about it (another time).",

I go to our bedroom and I'll sitting on the bed taking my clothes off and as I'm about to get under the covers my partner and her friend walk into the room (to this day I don't know where the friend came from, she wasn't with us). They both come over to my side of the bed and together they start \"handling\" me. Just like you I stopped, asked her if she was sure about this, she said yes so we continued. It was fantastic! The three of us had so much fun we got together 4 more times over the next few weeks. Then one night (we were home alone) she's taking a bath and the reality of the situation hits her and she completely falls apart!\n\nNothing I say or do helps her. She done, we're done.\n\nIt was a great time but it permanently killed our relationship.

            "Going to go against the grain a bit here and say that I don't think OP's GF's reaction was *that* unexpected or bad, and I do think OP fucked up a bit. I think everyone fucked up a bit here, but nobody involved seems like a bad person.\n\nIf I were in OP's shoes, I wouldn't have touched that shit with a 10 ft pole without *extensive* discussion of the topic beforehand with my gf, what's ok, what's not ok, what might make her uncomfortable, what might make me uncomfortable, etc. \n\nSexual relationships are complex and delicate enough when there are just two people involved. Add in a third, and it's an absolute mess. That's why I have a difficult time blaming OP's gf too much. She clearly wasn't thinking either, and hadn't thought through the implications of a threesome, and got caught up in the moment. Then she realized after it was too late that she wasn't really that comfortable with the idea. That's frankly a pretty normal and not unexpected reaction to an unplanned threesome. \n\nAbsolutely possible to have very successful threesomes where everyone has a blast and no one gets hurt, but in my experience that requires everyone involved to be *very* clear on their boundaries going in. Not only clear with each other, **but also clear with themselves**. Frequently things people think they're ok with turn out to not feel so great once they actually do them (as seems to be the case here). Not uncommon, doesn't make OP's gf a shitty person imo.\n\nOP's gf shouldn't have initiated if she hadn't herself thought extensively about what she was and wasn't ok with. But, OP also shouldn't have dived right in with no pre-established ground rules, but I think he knows that. \n\nJust an unfortunate situation generally, I don't think anyone here is really a bad person (despite the vilification of OP's gf in this thread). Just an ill-conceived idea that wasn't properly thought through, and that lack of forethought resulted in people getting hurt. Nothing about this situation really surprises me lol, this is about how I would expect a threesome with no planning in a young relationship to go.\n\nYou live, you learn.",

I took the day off of work, but despite that it's just been a normal day. No friend group gatherings, no gifts, just another day (and I'm totally fine with that). My mom on the other hand felt bad that there was no celebration of any kind, so she was insistent that we go to my favorite restaurant (a local Mexican restaurant). I agreed to go for a very early dinner.\n\nWe get there and are having a good time and it was nice to pretend the world was normal for a moment. I ordered a margarita, they ID'd me and figured out it was my birthday. Fast forward to the end of the dinner and I thought I was in the clear from a birthday celebration from the staff. As they bring the bill, they put a big sombrero on my head and started clapping and singing and set down a dessert in front of me. One of the guys had whipped cream on his finger and went in to put it on my nose, drunk me didn't comprehend that and was very confused. Due to the big sombrero covering my face, he was kind of stumbling trying to find my nose, I thought \"oh I know what I'm supposed to do!\" and my dumbass self sucked the whipped cream off his finger.\n\nI realized immediately after that, no 'Dundermifflinhoe, that is not how you interact with strangers' but it was too late. They picked up the pace of their singing and the guy ran away right after and hid in the kitchen. The whole restaurant (which granted was like 10 other people, but still) stared at me and my mom couldn't stop laughing.\n\nWe got put the dessert in our to-go box and left. 23 years is off to a great start.\n\nTL;DR - My waiter was trying to put whipped cream on my nose to celebrate my birthday, drunk me was confused and sucked his finger instead\n\nEDIT: getting a lot of hate for going out during COVID. I agree with everyone saying that it was a stupid decision to go out to eat. It was. I know I\u2019m the asshole. Thank you for all the lovely reminders in my inbox. I wanted a break from the stresses of life and went about it the wrong way. I take full responsibility.\n\nEDIT PART 2: Guys, thank you so much for all the kind words. I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me.

This happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  \n\n\nIt was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  \nSo i got an idea, to \"prank\" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where the FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, \"wall\" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  \nThe next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction\n\nTL;DR: Ordered food online and set restaurant on fire by pasting bee movie script into the order-note box\n\n\nhave to edit here: thank you for those shiny medals gyus/gals! made my day <3",

            "Reminds me of the time when I was in middle school and the school printer had an app (it was a Lexmark app and no one knew it existed since you\u2019re supposed to use the computers to print). It was a really bad looking app and you were supposed to use an image to print. Since me and my friend didn\u2019t have computers at the time we ended up trying that out. We go to the library and notice that the printer won\u2019t stop printing and it\u2019s printing quite rapidly too (to the point where it would almost shoot out paper). It doesn\u2019t print the image but it\u2019s instead a 2 line combination of random numbers, letters, and those Microsoft word emoticons. We realize that the app is broken and it doesn\u2019t work. Whatever. Later on we get the idea that we can remotely \u2018hack\u2019 the printer to distract people. So we do a test in front of the librarian and try it. She panicked and cancels the process via a button. It had already printed like 40 pages (it\u2019s loud as hell too). During one of those parent teacher interview nights my friend takes a paper, places it in the bottom tray, and curves it so that it acts as a ramp for the rest of the ammunition. I load in some random picture of the GTA V logo and then press print. The printer is rapidly shooting paper everywhere making a mess and a firework show. It was beautiful. Looking back it was pretty rude, we shouldn\u2019t have done that.\n\nedit: the reason why I couldn\u2019t do it after was because I think 2 weeks later they updated their app to the modern \u2018style\u2019 (think of iOS 6 to iOS 7 era).",
            "You idiots realize this is not possible and did not happen right?  First, no POS software has an unlimited field for printing \u201cnotes\u201d. Second, any printer could print indefinitely without overheating to the point of actually catching fire. If this restaurant did actually catch fire it\u2019s an unrelated coincidence.

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened 9 years ago but I still think about it every day.\n\nIt's a **long** one so buckle up.\n\n(Apologies about the grammar and such, writing is not my forte.)\n\nMe: $D\n\nFriend/Co-Conspirator: $F\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis story starts with me, a 'quiet but well liked throughout the school' 17 year old in IT class at my High School in a large suburban, two city public school district. We had one of the best high school IT programs in the country at the time for many reasons. Part of our class (of about 35) involved us going around the school to do basic maintenance on school computers. Although with the exception of myself and $F, our class never touched staff computers.\n\nMyself and $F were the two students always finishing our two week classwork cycle in about two days. So we were always tasked by our IT Teacher with helping the school IT guy (district employee stationed at the school in the IT lab) to go around and fix issues throughout the building while everyone else worked on their classwork. Often, we were loaned the IT guy's keys and district keycard to go around the school and take care of business. (This is important later) Over time, myself and $F became well known by staff around the school for being able to fix \"anything\" so we eventually gained a lot of trust from our IT Teacher and District IT guy. To the point that we knew passwords we **ABOSOUTELY** should not have known.\n\nWe knew everything from the password to the surveillance system to the master (domain admin) password district IT used to access everything from HR files to grades to mechanical systems. This password literally let us access anything on any computer in the entire district. And before you ask, yes all buildings in the district (including admin) were linked together and no they weren't firewalled off from each other. Now we never used our powers maliciously as we loved our school and never would've done anything to harm anyone or damage any systems.\n\nOne day I thought to myself \"wow, Information Security (InfoSec) in this district is **atrocious**, I wonder how easy it would be to test it from a student perspective, then present my findings to the district IT guy\". This, would be the beginning of the biggest fuck up of my life.\n\n(I'll try to keep the technical stuff to a minimum)\n\nMy mission started one day when I was tasked to grab a computer from a classroom and bring it to the lab. Easy enough. I was given IT guy's 35+ keys and sent off. While walking to the room, I dropped the ring, it took me a minute to find the right key on the ring. When I found it, since I was looking  bit harder than usual at each key, I noticed something peculiar about the key he used to open doors inside the school. It was stamped DGM and looked different than the usual \\*M stamp master key for this one high school building. Not seeing this abbreviation before, I thought, \"ok this must be an important key since it works like a school master but looks different\".\n\nI opened the (empty) classroom, fired up a locksmithing app on my phone and took a digital impression of the key that gave me the bitting code so I could duplicate it later on, grabbed the computer, went back to the lab and gave the keys back. Curious about what this DGM stamp meant, I started googling on my phone, \"DGM \\[Key Manufacturer\\]\". It came up with GM as \"Grand Master\", the key above the master key. Nothing with DGM came up in the search.  I thought \"ok this is just the \"grand master\" key that opens all three buildings on the school property, NBD. (Main School, Theater, and Aux Gym buildings)\n\n\"Ok. but what does that D in DGM stand for? Nothing in the school district starts with a D, except... **District**. Holy shit, it must mean \"District Grand Master. But they can't be stupid enough to make one key that opens doors in all 15 schools. Right?\"\n\nI get home and order a key duplicate on the website that built that locksmithing app. A week later it shows up and I bring it to school. Before gym class I tried it on one of the doors in the Aux gym and low and behold, it worked. Great! Part one of my test plan is complete. Someone with this key could cause a lot of damage if they wanted to, but how would they get past the alarm systems in each building? Because it would be difficult to discreetly do a lot of damage if the building was full of people. Naturally someone with ill intensions would carry out their act at night while the building alarms are armed.\n\nI already knew that the alarm systems were controlled by keycards that every staff member in the district had. (It was an antiquated system with flaws known to the IT world) Their cards only worked for the buildings they worked in. So the cards, electric doors, and alarms must be controlled at the school level, not at the district admin office. Right?\n\nSo how was I going to get a hold of a keycard long enough to scan and duplicate it onto a new card? It required a laptop and a special piece of equipment that I couldn't just bring to school while everyone was there. I thought \"I can't access the security system and lookup badge codes with the IT master password I know, that defeats the whole purpose of this test. Where's the next vulnerability in this system?\" Then I realized, there's a gate to the staff parking lot that's opened with keycards, but not their district cards, they had separate cards for the gate. I scanned the entire network for this gate controller, but couldn't find it anywhere. \"Good Job school district, leaving your gate system closed circuit. It's inconvenient to program, but definitely more secure.\"\n\nOkay, so where is this gate controller located? I've got a district master key so when I find it, I can access it locally. I look at the gate itself and see a freshly paved line in the concrete leading from the gate motor to the Aux Gym. \"Okay, its somewhere in the Aux Gym.\"\n\nI wait until Saturday during Football practice, the Aux Gym is disarmed and the front door is open. Everyone's out on the field so no one will see me enter the building. \"Hey there's a closet by the front door I'll try this one first.\" There it fucking is. The gate controller is mounted on the wall. I open up the panel and attach my laptop. \"Fuck there's a password, what could it be? It's not going to be the master password, this isn't connected to the network.\" I look at the circuit board, there's a label with \"admin - (name of city school is located in)\". Unbelievable, that's the login. \"District IT People are paid six-figures to make this shit up? Seriously?\"\n\nI accessed the swipe log and I noticed an interesting trend. Half the time someone swipes into the parking lot, there's an access denial that immediately precedes a valid gate card swipe. \"They must be swiping their district cards first instead of the gate card!\" Lucky for me, this system records badge numbers when access is denied. So I had access to several district keycard codes, protected by a password that is the name of our city. Wonderful. I sift through the logs and notice the names of three district janitors, all three with the preceding access denied messages and codes, followed by their valid gate cards. I remembered these people from my previous schools, so their district cards must open multiple buildings. (Remember when I mentioned that district buildings weren't firewalled off from each other on the network?)\n\nI took one of the codes and encoded it onto a blank keycard with that special piece of equipment that cost me $20 on eBay, walked out the front door and scanned the card. I heard a loud click and the reader light turned green. Holy shit, I now have a DGM key and a keycard that disarms **EVERY** school alarm system in the district. Nothing is off limits to me. Part 2 complete.\n\nI call up my friend $F who somewhat knew what I was doing, and once nighttime rolled around, we decided to visit almost every school in the district. Just to see if it actually worked. And boy it did. We easily swiped into each school, the alarm automatically disarmed, and the DGM key opened every door in every building we visited. I found myself thinking \"Good Lord, security here is even more atrocious than I thought\". We had the decency to rearm each building before we left and once we were done, we planned on telling the IT guy on monday when we went to class.\n\nWell, my dumbass decided to try one more school the next day (Sunday Morning), I swiped in and within 10 seconds, the (middle school) principal walked through the door and asked \"Who are you?\" I could've bolted out the front door, but I wanted to be honest because they were gonna find out on monday anyways. So I told him who I was and what I was doing (very short version).\n\nHe took me to his office and had me sit down while he made a phone call. It was someone at the district office. All I heard him say was \"I can't distinguish this from my own badge, its a perfect copy but it has his name and photo on it\". He hangs up. Asks me more questions and it eventually leads to the DGM key. This especially panics him because he knew what it was but didn't know anyone other than the District Ops manager that had one. He makes another phone call, \"This is (principal name) at (middle school) I need someone to come down here now.\" I'm thinking \"Okay, someone from the district will be here to ask more questions, cool.\"\n\n**Boy was I wrong**, within a few minutes about six police officers show up and start asking me questions. I'm honest, I tell them my plan and what I did. They all looked utterly confused by the end of my short explanation. They took the keycards and DGM key and asked me to call my parents to pick me up. They search my car and find pot in the trunk (oops). So there's a charge right there. They said they'll notify us later once they talk to the district and I was released into my dad's custody.\n\nA few hours later, my mom gets a phone call from $VP saying I'm not to attend school monday and we will have a meeting that evening at the high school. \"Okay, understandable. I haven't been able to explain myself. They're playing it safe.\"\n\n**Whoops wrong again!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIT Teacher: $ITT\n\nDistrict IT Director: $ITLady\n\nVice Principal: $VP\n\nCops: $PD\n\nWe arrive at the school for the meeting, my IT teacher is sitting in the school office with a disappointed yet very proud look on his face. As we arrived we were called into the conference room, I expected it to be just $VP, lmao no. It was $VP, two cops, and some random district official. My IT teacher was there just to translate the technical terms. I explain my whole plan, being interrupted many times by everyone to ask their questions. At one point $VP says \"Jesus $ITT you're not supposed to be teaching this stuff!\"\n\n$ITT: $VP, Do you realize the amount of critical thinking and work that went into this project?\"\n\nWell, after he says this, there's a knock on the door. \"$VP, $ITLady is here\"\n\n\"Random district official\" leaves and $ITLady enters and sits down in front of me\"\n\n$VP: $M this is $ITLady, the District Director of IT. She has some questions for you.\n\n$M: Ok\n\nShe proceeds to tear into me, asking \"WHAT DID YOU BREAK, WHAT DID YOU HACK?!\" I could literally see the veins popping out of her head. She was **pissed the fuck off**.\n\nShe couldn't accept that a bored teenage kid that just wanted to see if this was possible, was able to compromise her systems in one week. At one point the officers asked her to leave the room and take a break because she was getting so worked up.\n\nFast forward to after the meeting, the police took myself, my mom, $VP, and $ITT to my house and seized all of my electronic equipment. Everything from my cell phone, to my laptop, to my WiFi adapter and everything in between. My favorite part was when they were searching my computer bag. The police officer opened it, rummaged around for a bit, taking everything electronic out, then gently and over dramatically pulling a strand of condom wrappers out in front of everybody.\n\n$Mom: \\*Glares at me\\* Previously not knowing I was having sex at 17\n\n$Mom's new BF: \\*Leaves room immediately\\*\n\n$Cops: \\*Looks at $VP not sure what to do\\*\n\n$ITT: \\*Gently facepalms\\*\n\n$M: Thinking \"Fuck, this is bad\"\n\n$VP: \\*staring at the cops for about five seconds\\* \"Okay well let's move on\"\n\nThey all leave after seizing basically everything I own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to a few days later, I get a letter from the district saying I have been suspended pending expulsion. Great.\n\nWe attend the expulsion hearing, I say exactly what I said in the first meeting with $VP and the cops.\n\nGet another letter two days later, I'm expelled. We appeal to the school board and the district's lawyers. They don't want to hear any of it. Appeal denied. They're pressing full charges. Okay I didn't know what the charges were but they were pressing them. Cool, great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTwo months later I meet with county Juvenile, I again explain to them my story, they're just as confused as the district people but my Juvenile rep is taken back by my calm demeanor and willingness to share all the details. By this point the district has done a through investigation and found no evidence that I stole or caused damage to property or their computer networks. They then Inform me I'm being charged with:\n\n\\-- 9 counts of Felony Burglary 2\n\n\\-- 3 counts of Class A Misdemeanor Computer Crime\n\n\\-- 3 Counts of Class A Identity Theft\n\n\\-- 1 Count of Poss. Controlled Substance on School Grounds\n\nI'm also ordered not to use any electronic devices until I see the judge. This included something as simple as a TV remote.\n\n***Fuck Me***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a few more meetings with the County Juvenile rep, she was actually a very nice person and was surprised I was assigned to her in the first place because she usually got the murders and rapists. She got to know me and my true intensions with the entire plan over the next month.\n\nBefore my first hearing, she (the county) recommended to the school district not to press charges. They felt this could be remedied in-district, since while crimes were committed, I wasn't aware of the crimes and there was obviously no bad intent.\n\nDuring the hearing, my Juvenile rep and shitty court appointed lawyer explained my side and the district lawyer explained theirs. The judge was extremely confused by the whole situation, saying \"we've never seen a case like this before, at this point I don't know how to proceed\" The DA also looked equally as confused.\n\nJudge asked the district's lawyer: \"How do you want to proceed?\"\n\nLawyer: We'll take this under further review\n\nJudge: $M expect a call from your Juvenile rep this week. Adjourned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree days later, we receive a call from Juvenile. The district is pursuing all charges and wants $80,000 in restitution for a new district security system. **Wonderful news.**\n\nI live in a constant state of panic for the next three months while waiting for the next court date. I end up going to the district's alternate school for a while while attending twice weekly meetings at juvenile.\n\nWent a few more times in front of the judge, my lawyer, Juvenile, and district lawyers doing all the talking, explaining the entire case to the judge. The district still insisting I stole and damaged district property even though I never did and they ever found any evidence.\n\nAbout seven months into this, the Judge had enough. She didn't want to hear anything more and was going to issue my disposition (ruling) at the next hearing.\n\nShe explained that $80,000 in restitution was ludicrous and the district was going to pay for their own security upgrades if they chose to.\n\nShe then looked at me and asked me to rise.\n\nJudge: \"I have three options here Mr. $M\"\n\n\"Option 1, I dismiss all of the charges and we'll be done here\n\nOption 2: I drop the marijuana charge, reduce all other Charges to Attempted (Misdemeanors), and sentence you to one year bench probation\n\nOption 3: I send you to jail right now\"\n\nI almost lost it right there.\n\nJudge: \"Based on what I've heard from our Juvenile rep and read in the police reports, I'd like to go with Option 1 and dismiss the charges. But because of the sheer severity of the crimes on paper, I am unable to do that. So I am going with Option 2. I hereby sentence you to one year of bench probation and order you to pay restitution in the amount of $3,200 for district staff overtime. Good luck Mr. $M.\"\n\nI don't remember what was said after that because I was so relieved I almost passed out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter three months of thinking I was going to prison for 20 years, it was all over. I was numb for the rest of the day.\n\nAll in all, The whole experience only left me with severe depression and anxiety for a few years but hey I'm not in prison. Great, right?\n\nActually it ended up better than I thought. I ended up graduating from the alternate school's accelerated graduation program shortly after that. (The district wanted me out of their hair ASAP)\n\nI received a full diploma from my regular High School at the end of my junior year. I got to essentially skip most of my junior and all of my senior year of HS. Ended up working my ass off and got a great IT job at a company I still work for today. And now I have IT Director as my title.\n\nAnd that is how I royally fucked up by shaming the fuck out of my school district\n\nShove it $ITLady!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I exploited security flaws in my school district's security system. They got royally pissed and tried to send me to prison. Instead the judge gave me a slap on the wrist and I graduated a year an a half early. Now have a great job in IT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: [Some amount of proof that this isn't fake](https://imgur.com/a/3wruqc2) because I forgot people on the internet are asses\n\nEdit2: random internet people, while yes, this story is extremely dumb and sounds extremely false, I swear on my life this story is 100% true.

For the vast majority here too young to know, you use those cards to call an 800 number from any phone (usually a payphone) and then put your code in to make long-distance calls.  So we got to make free calls.  Great.  We knew no one outside the town but it was cool anyway.\n\nSo, when the codes got blocked, he'd hack in again and get more.  This was what eventually lead to his downfall.  He was using an Atari 400 computer and a dial-up modem from his home phone.   When he went in again they were waiting.  They traced the calls and he got arrested.\n\nSo, what happened to him?  The Sprint people proposed dropping all the charges if he showed them how he did it.  The DA agreed since he promised not to do it again.  He's fortunate he did this in the 80s because it didn't ruin his life.\n\nHe's been working in IT security for the past 30 years now.",

Used that controller to get badge accesses.\n\nI applaud you didn't use the password you were given to get the IDs, but you realize you basically did that anyway, right? You were temporarily entrusted with a set of passwords (keys), and instead of only using what you should, you stole one of the keys. You then used that to access things as if you should have that key.\n\nYes, the IT guy shouldn't have given you access to the keyring in the first place, but he thought he could trust you.

        "selftext": "While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It\u2019s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It\u2019s a remarkable sight. \n\nFor those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify\u2026 I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there\u2019s another reason to steer clear.\n\nAnyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. \n\nA genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. \n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a clever idea!\u201d I thought, relieved that we wouldn\u2019t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. \n\nAh but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe early effects weren\u2019t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: \n\n\u201cHey we need to\u2026. We need to\u2026 do something\u2026 like\u2026 now?\u201d I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. \n\nThis was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.\n\n\u201cSergeant, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m high as shit!\u201d He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. \n\n\u201cSomeone, relieve him!\u201d (genius)\n\nSeveral individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. \n\n\u201cWho the hell approved this!!?\u201d The First Sergeant yelled\n\n\u201cI believe you did..\u201d The CO responded \n\n\u201cWell where\u2019s the detail that brought it in?\u201d \n\n\u201cThat would be us First-Sergeant\u201d Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned\u2026 I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking \u201cohjesusohjesusohjesus I\u2019m going to get caught...!\u201d It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. \n\nI turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other\u2019s laps, goofing off, and having a \u2018deep philosophical conversation\u2019 about a bug\u2019s journey through life.\n\nInert.\n\nI wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.\n\nI assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.\n\nAt this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. \n\nAlthough I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.\n\n \n\nTL;DR \u2013 Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened about 18 years ago and, please, read the whole thing before passing judgement.  :)\n\nFirst, though, a little back story.  My oldest child, my only daughter, was born in 1998.  She's healthy, smart, witty, beautiful, and all the things a proud dad could hope for.  At the time of this story, though, she was only about 3 years old.  \n\nMy second child, however, was not so lucky with the health issues.  At five weeks old, he had a near-miss SIDS incident that left him with massive brain damage and a host of other issues that stemmed from that.  At the point of this story, he was in the state's Early Intervention program, which meant that we as a family got extra assistance with a few things, my daughter got preferential treatment to get into early education programs and a few things like that.  For the events of this story, he was (as I recall) with my parents this day, but that's how we came to be at the particular event where this TIFU occurred.\n\nThese events happened sometime in early 2002.  The early intervention program was having a dinner/event for family members, and so my wife, daughter and I were all going to this event.  Due to life being life, my wife and daughter were heading to the event from home and I was heading directly there from work, meeting up with them there.\n\nSo, here we are, at an Early Intervention event sponsored by a state aid program, and the wife and I are chatting with director of this program, who is essentially a state empowered agent to look after the welfare of special needs children and their families.  We'll call her Jenn for the sake of this story, which is definitely not her real name.  My wife and I both like this state agent and were enjoying a conversation with her and my daughter was making the most of the event that did have other kids but was mostly for adults.\n\nThe conversation turned, however, when Jenn asks my daughter what's on her mind.  I swear, to my dying day I will never forget exactly how my daughter replied to her: \"**Mommy doesn't like it when Daddy beats us**.\"\n\nI was, I hope understandably, speechless.  I looked to my wife and she also had no clue where the hell that came from...  we looked to Jenn who was looking back and forth between us, because she'd been working with us for a while and didn't think me capable of beating either of them.  We turned back to my daughter to try to figure out what she was talking about.\n\nIt seems that since we arrived at the event separately, one of us had to get there first and that day it was me.  When my wife arrived she noticed my car already in the parking lot. Since we had joked about racing there, she said something to my daughter to the effect of \"Oh, darn, Daddy beat us.\"  As in, I beat them to the event.  I arrived first.  But my daughter took the phrase \"I beat them\" to heart, and was happy to share it with Jenn when she asked how my daughter was.  After all, she was 3, why would she be worried about other meanings of the phrase?\n\nOnce we figured that out, we shared a relieved if somewhat awkward laugh. The rest of the event came and went uneventfully;  honestly, I don't remember much of it after that, as I was still recovering from the \"OMFG\" shock at what my daughter had said before we figured it out.  Considering that my daughter said that to a state employee I'm very glad she knew us well enough to take the time to figure out what happened with us, but, yeah.  I do still enjoy reminding my daughter every once in a while of how she did me wrong that day, but she usually rolls her eyes at me when I do.  \n\nTL;DR:  My daughter told a state employee that I beat her and my wife to an event in a way that could have been easily misunderstood.",

We each said one of the others, apart from my sister who said dad\u2019s favourite was Judy. \n\nThe counsellors glanced at the one way mirror and made a note. \n\nLater on, we were asked what our parents do at home. My sister said my dad likes to sit on the sofa with Judy on his lap having kisses. He\u2019s always telling Judy how pretty she is.\n\nMore glances at the window, more notes, one counsellor goes outside, comes back, more questions. \n\nWhat else does dad do with Judy? \n\nSometimes when we get up for school, dad is in bed with Judy. In fact, dad spends most of the day in bed with Judy. \n\nThis sent the counsellors into a bit of a spin, though they wouldn\u2019t let my parents explain the situation. We were kept there for hours, until my sister said she\u2019s not jealous of Judy at all, because when we go to the beach, when someone throws a ball, Judy always brings it back to her. \n\nWhen it was cleared up that Judy was the family dog and that my dad worked nights, we were allowed to leave.",

            "When I was young, I must have been 13 or something we used to make these extravagant treasure hunts for our birthday parties and it was my sisters birthday and I had made this complicated story and they had to get to the forest and meet the princess from another dimension but first get past the gatekeeper. And I played the princess and my dad was playing the gatekeeper and for the role he was wearing a turban and a Turkish kind of vest and he is pretty big and has a big beard. So we went to the forest together so we could play our roles and he was putting face paint on me and he put a color that I didnt want so I yelled at him \"I dont want that, I dont want that\" and apparantly at that moment a woman biked by and she went to the police. So this party ran into the woman and two police officers in the forest and they asked if they had seen a big man with a turban and a little girl. And my mom kind of realised what was going on so she asked them \"oh are you also looking for the princess from the other dimension?\" Luckily they realised that it was a misunderstanding but I think it must have been pretty cool for the kids that the police was even looking for this princess. And also I'm happy they didnt come arrest my dad.",

She was concerned because she knew my parents were together, and she asked my mom about it at pickup- I meant the crack in the porch, not my parents relationship (this was 1990 or so).

            "A teacher of mine once told parents if they promised not to believe half the things we told them about her, then she wouldn\u2019t believe half the things we told her about them.\n\nMe and my now ex used to play fight with my son all the time. When he was five he watched something about Shaolin training and would ask us to slap and punch him all over his body to toughen him up. We did. Not hard, but not lightly either. Never enough to actually hurt him.\n\nWe were going to get interviewed by a social worker for a home study, and I knew he would be talked to as well. Since he loves to leave out important details, I asked him earlier that day what he would say if she asked if we ever hit him. He said he would say yes, but it was just pretend hitting. I said good. Make sure you leave that little detail about the \u201cpretend\u201d in there.\n\nFast forward to the interview. We were asked to step out of the room while she talked to him, but we could still hear him. She began by asking how he was. He immediately responded, \u201cThere is something that you need to know. My mom and dad hit me, but it\u2019s just for fun.\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f She hesitated a little but continued, asking him about rules he had to follow and how he was punished if he didn\u2019t. He happily shared about how he punished his animals by handcuffing them and putting them in time out for two hours. Luckily she didn\u2019t ask him many questions, or he would have eventually told her all about the time I let him drink alcohol (it was one drop of a pre-mixed store bought bahama mama, I used a straw to put one drop onto his tongue because he wanted to taste it, but he told people for years his mommy let him drink.) It was around this time that he used to say he would deal with his future ten children by putting them in their cages if they misbehaved, but he didn\u2019t mention them during the interview. \n\nNote: He has never been handcuffed as punishment, time outs were never more minutes than his age, and he has never been put in a cage.",

I have followed with tradition, but I escalated it to a game where I actually catch them and play spank them or shake them.  They love the game, especially the shakings, and will frequently come up to me out of the blue and ask for a \"beating\" because it is really a game of chase. I warned people in my office of the game because you never know.

            "I work in child welfare so I see things like this pretty often. One example I will never forget is that a child who was in our care who had been reunified with her father gave everyone quite the scare. So once a child has been reunited (reunified is the term we use ) with their parent the case stays open 6 more month for protective supervision to make sure everything is alright before they request to close the case at whxiu point it's up to the judge. So anyways back to my story. The child went to day care and when one of the staff asked the child how was her weekend with her father she replied \" daddy put his pee pee on my pee pee\". So naturally everyone was concerned when we heard this. An abuse report was generated and a child protective investigator quickly went to the home. Now while interview the father he was kind of clueless so they went back and asked the child what happened and to show where the \"bad touching\" occurred. The daughter then went to say that she went to go pee in the bathroom and didnt flush then her dad went to go use the bathroom but didnt flush before using it. So mystery solved. Daddy did in fact put his pee pee on her pee pee. Makes for an amusing story now but man did it cause a little scare",

It want coercive or anything, just creative in getting the child to clarify. \n\nAfter spending more than a year in jail, losing his reputation, career, marriage, and going basically into financial ruin, the father was released and charges dropped. \n\nIt turned out that the little girl had peed in the toilet and her dad went into the bathroom and peed after she'd left.

My son believes that I'm being mean when I tell him he can't have something.  When he says I'm being mean my wife up to that point had piled on with \"yeah, stop being mean\" and a smile knowing we were joking.  That took some explaining from both the wife and I.  He's smarter than we had given him credit for up to then and had to quickly switch to over explaining everything.",

            "I had one similar to this. But mine almost resulted in me getting stabbed. My ex had an 8 year old daughter that I would watch while she was at work. Well, one day I was watching her, I got up and went to the bathroom. She had dribbled pee on the seat somehow. (Still don\u2019t know how she did it because she never had before or after) so I cleaned it up. Her and I made poop and fart jokes all the time, and I grew up using the word \u201cpee-pee\u201d for urine. so I came out and said \u201cyou pee-peed on the seat and I got it on my hand! GROSS!\u201d which she thought was hilarious. Well. Fast forward. My ex gets home and tucks in her daughter, comes FLYING down the stairs into the kitchen, clatters around and then comes out and stands over me on the couch with a HUGE knife! I clearly asked her what the fuck she was doing. She had gone and apparently drank before she came home that night, and in the scariest voice I have ever heard another human make says \u201cMY DAUGHTER JUST TOLD ME YOU TOUCHED HER VAGINA!!!\u201d And points the knife at me! Little did I know that they called vaginas \u201cpee-pees\u201d... so her daughter had told her that I touched her pee-pee in the bathroom... mine didn\u2019t end with a laugh though. I explained my side and she calmed down. But I slept in the basement that night with the door locked. We broke up not too long after.",

My mom rushed me to emergency, where I continued to run around and run into things, falling over and then getting up to do it again, all the while coughing up water occasionally, and laughing at the gurgling sound that seemed to be following me. So anyone who works with small children can tell you, if a mother comes in with a toddler that\u2019s covered in bruises and has a lung full of water, it\u2019s probably time to worry. Just to make things even better, I had a huge vocabulary for my age, and when we got to see the doctor I looked up at him and said \u00ab\u00a0 abuse!\u00a0\u00bb pointing to *a bruise* on my leg.

        "selftext": "First, some background. My partner always leaves a little bit of Coke Zero in his can after drinking it. And this is totally gross, but I love the taste of flat soda. So whenever I clean up the empty cans, I\u2019ll take the last swig of whatever is left over. Really disgusting. I get it. Nobody\u2019s perfect. This is my flaw. \n\nANYWHO. This morning I go to do this, as I always do. Come to find out, he had done a water test to test the ammonia, ph, nitrates etc in our aquarium\u2019s salt water the night before. He had dumped the remnants of the test chemicals and salt water into his Coke Zero can, unbeknownst to me. \n\nI picked it up this morning and was like \u201coh man, score there\u2019s a lot left in here\u201d and geared up to slurp it down. Slurp slurp slurp. Yes, I\u2019m a disgusting human. Get over it. \n\nOf course, upon initial contact with this horrific concoction, I had realized my grave error. I ended up spitting it out all over the living room and, not long after, my throat started to tingle. I mean, REALLY tingle. \n\nThis is when panic set in. I was alone. My dogs just stared at me. \n\nThis is how I die. What would the coroner think?\n\nI ended up calling poison control to ask them if I was dying and had to tell them that I had accidentally consumed a mixture of aquarium water testing chemicals and salt water. This is harder to explain than one might think. Especially when you think you might be actively dying. \n\nAt this point my throat is PULSATING and I can feel my pulse quickening. I know I am probably imagining these problems, but I can\u2019t help it. \n\nAfter asking me several times, \u201cWait, you did what?\u201d the kind man at poison control told me to gargle with vinegar, monitor my symptoms, and to not consume aquarium saltwater test chemicals ever again. \n\nNo shit. \n\nTL;DR: TIFU by drinking what I thought was leftover flat soda. It was actually a mixture of flat soda, saltwater, and aquarium test chemicals. The fear of imminent death ensued. I\u2019m fine, and poison control got a kick out of my story.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nOh, wow. Thanks for the awards. My first gold, all because I\u2019m a dumbass. \n\nMay my story be a cautionary tale to you all. Don\u2019t drink beverages that have been left open and unattended, and don\u2019t revel in someone else\u2019s backwashed flat soda. \n\nAs for my boyfriend, yeah...he fucked up, too. At least we learned our lesson with minimal consequences. A fuck up all around. Be careful with chemicals. They ain\u2019t playing around.",

I had filled up an energy drink can at work with water, and had left it in my work truck. We were working line maintenance in the height of the california wildfires, and we were having an emergency meeting in a parking lot. I jump out of my aerial boom truck, grab my water and there\u2019s about 10 of us talking to our boss feeling all serious. Then I take a huge swig of water and spit that shit out and dump the rest of it out. About 12 cigarette butts and this nasty murky water splash on the ground. All the guys bust up laughing and pat me on the back. Then the other dude that\u2019s in the truck with me apologizes. He had bought that same energy drink that morning. And he smokes.

What luck!\n\nHe grabs it without a second thought and takes a big ole swig....and immediately realizes his mistake. \nHe\u2019d never tossed his piss from days ago.

It was a very dark-brown liquid. For some reason, he decided to keep the remaining liquid in a Coke bottle. He then proceeded to leave the bottle out on the counter which his son then took and drank.\n\nI think by the time they realised what had happened it  was too late and the child sadly passed away. Very tragic for all involved and even dad to this day gets upset talking about it. \n\nMorale of the story is, make sure you lock poisonous chemicals in a safe and secure location, preferably in a clearly labelled container. Leaving poison out like that can literally turn into a life or death situation.",

Quick ride to the emergency room later, they found out he had really fucked up his esophagus, it had gotten very burned and scarred by the chemicals. He required months of physical theraphy in his throat before he could start to swallow food normally without any choking hazard. He's pretty much back to normal today, but it was an important lesson in one: why you should never store chemicals in food containers and two: why you should never store chemicals among food products.

        "selftext": "This happened while ago while I was traveling to the US on a 9h flight from Europe.\n\n*Context: I'm Greek / Lebanese and am a rather moderately hairy person, most of it on my face.*\n\nI had an important meeting to attend in the US that was happening a few hours after I land, so I had to freshen up and prepare while on the plane still. A few hours into the flight, I went to the bathroom to change my clothes, wash my face and freshen up, shave and trim my beard, put on some deodorant etc. Took my backpack with me since I've got everything in there. \n\nAfter spending some 5 minutes in there, struggling to move around the tiny bathroom stalls on planes, someone knocks on the door. I brushed it off with something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019ll be right out\u201d, I thought someone needs to use the bathroom but it was clearly occupied. Another 5 minutes go by and I start hearing chatter outside and could feel some people moving around. I hear a knock again, at this point i had my shirt off and my face was half shaven with mousse all over the other half. I open the door in this questionable state. To my surprise I see 3 flight attendants looking terrified standing around the door... Two women and one man. So I laugh and ask them if there is a rule and a timer for how long you can use the bathroom or what exactly was going on. The man proceeds to tell me some passengers complained because they saw me go in with my backpack, and i stayed in there a while, so they were scared something was going down and reported it to the flight crew. Mind you it wasn\u2019t even at the \"questionable\" beard or stage or anything... it had grown for some two weeks or more give or take ~~just a week or more of fuzz~~ (*edited to say that definitely more than a week\u2019s btw should have been clearer*). So I laugh some more and tell him I fully understand, but I had an important meeting upon landing hence freshening up, and that i\u2019ll need a bit longer to just shave fully and finish grooming myself. He then excuses himself and we laugh a bit then he goes away. \n\nShortly after he comes back knocking and I open, this time in a new fresh shirt and fully shaved, and i ask what\u2019s up? He tells me that some passengers are still concerned i\u2019m shaving my beard and thought I was shaving my body too since I opened the door with mousse dripping on my face and without my shirt on. I was very confused and at that stage started to get annoyed, just let me use the damn bathroom in peace there are many others people can use. **Turns out that apparently some extremist muslim groups do this before they \"get up to no good\"** (aka sacrifice their life in an act of holy retribution/terror/whatever the fuck you want to call it). Something about going to heaven freshly clean... So at this point i\u2019m laughing too hard but I tell him I fully understand and that this is a good thing they check on such instances. I\u2019d rather be safe than sorry. I then show him my meeting email with the time and date for the sake of their peace of mind. I also mentioned I was Christian born but not religious and that even as a Lebanese dude I had no idea terrorists were shaving before acts of terror, thanks for the information I didn't really need. \n\nWe then had a chat outside with the rest of the flight crew, laughing and making jokes. I could tell they were still a tiny bit paranoid but 95% apologetic. They didn't check my bag or anything and now that I think about it I should have shown them what was in the bag (snacks, iphone cables, some books, clothes and my toiletry bag).\n\n**TL;DR - I groomed myself on a flight and the flight crew along with some passengers went full anti terror alert mode while fearing this was something more than just one beardy dude shaving and putting on fresh clothes.**\n\n----\n\nEdit: \n\n[Here's a photo of where my beard was at more or less before I shaved](https://i.imgur.com/mOFrIPP.jpg) \n\n[And here's a photo I took after I was done with the whole ordeal](https://i.imgur.com/noFtQ0o.png?1) (hoodie was swapped before meeting lol)\n\n----\n\nEdit 2: For the many \"why would you shave on the plane\" queries - it was a special circumstance trip that I booked on a day's notice and my beard grows too fast so shaving before we took off would mean I'd have some annoying stubble when we landed. I wanted to look as fresh as I could for that meeting and I did what I could with the given circumstances. I also groomed myself during a \u201clights off\u201d time where everyone is asleep. Queues to bathrooms don\u2019t form during that time. Remember, they **offer you shaving kits** on some business flights so to think anyone shaving on a plane is extreme is funny but understandable if you\u2019re unaware. They have plugs for razors, hair dryers, etc in the plane bathroom stall. I mean they change poopy kids in there so think about that for a second Reddit. \n\n\nThanks for the feedback r/tifu!

It was a flight manual for the exact plane they were flying on.  This is when she realized she was going to die.  The guy's leg was shaking, he was sweating, and he seemed more nervous as he read his book.  Realizing how much a misunderstanding would make her look like a racist shit bag, she eventually started talking to the guy.  Turns out he was really nice and let her know all about how he was coming to the US (he's Greek) to take his commercial pilot license test.  He was super nervous about taking the test.  She brought up the fact he was reading about the same plane they were on and he said he didn't even notice since he was freaking out about the test so much.\n\nEdit: I clarified some things with my wife. They were headed out of DC, not into it. The guy didn't have a beard but maybe a couple days of scruff. In addition to taking his plane test, he was already a helicopter pilot.

He said he wasn\u2019t able to get up after sleeping on the couch and was surprised no one came to help him. He ended up calling his mom to come pick him up. \n\nWhen he was gone both bf and me and the other couple were talking and they didn\u2019t come out either because they assumed we were having sex.\n\nWe all felt really bad.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not answering the same questions about this over and over - \u201cwhy didn\u2019t he scream/call for help/call your phones or names?

            "At my old house me and my 2 cousins slept in the basement, there was 3 \"rooms\" but none of them had doors but honestly none of us cared because it was the first time we had walls separating us.\n\nMy youngest cousin was 12 at the time, her room was essentially just a section at the end with a sheet up as a make shift wall but there was a section open that acted as a doorway. \n\nWell I walked out of my room and glanced into her room because it was pitch black and I thought she was home. Saw a figure sit up really quickly and saw that she and her brother (15) was laying in her bed. I gave them a weird look cause like. Who lays in a bed in the complete dark at 8pm with their little sister? \n\nWell I walk up get whatever I was getting and go back to my room to watch youtube. A short time later he comes into my room and tries explaining something about how when I walked by that she just wasnt wearing pants for some reason and that he told her that she was weird. And I'm just trying to watch youtube and hes telling me a stupid story about how for some reason she wasnt wearing pants while laying in their own bed. I guess I'm just stupid. \n\nBut eventually I come get called up stairs. There are cops and everyone is comforting my younger cousin. They ask if theyve seen him and I say he came to my room a little while ago but left. \n\nHe had apparently been raping her for the past year, just on the other side of a layer of drywall from me without me ever knowing, and even with me seeing them with my own eyes I was still just blind to the fact that this was happening. A small solace is that me walking past and him freaking out was what it took for her to realise that this wasnt ok. She went and told my mom and then everything else happened. \n\nIt kinda fucked me up for awhile. My mom asked me if I knew what he was doing and just even that was a gut punch. That she would even consider that I would let that happen knowingly. But I understand why she asked. \n\nI occasionally have dreams where hes back home and I'm the only one who seems to have an issue with it while trying to desperately get him away from us. \n\nShits fucked and hindsight is 20/20.",

        "selftext": "Alrighty it\u2019s now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won\u2019t stop laughing at me. \n\nLast night hubby & I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. \n\nAs usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know \ud83d\ude09\n\nAs a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I\u2019m no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. \n\nThe night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I\u2019m having a shower & he says he doesn\u2019t care, he\u2019s going to bed. \n\nI should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone\u2019s concerned we drove under the influence). \n\nI\u2019m washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... \n\nOk feels good but need more pressure.. \n\nOk feels better but I could still use more pressure.. \n\nOhh ok that\u2019s just right. Yeah that\u2019s the spot... oh YEAH THAT\u2019S THE SPOT!!!!! \n\n...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! \n\nJust as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. \n\nHubby came running in and I\u2019m telling you it was a fucking sight. \n\nI\u2019m planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I\u2019m crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. \n\nI fucked up y\u2019all. \n\nIt takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that\u2019s ever happened. \n\nI managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.\n\nAnyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. \n\nI told the nurse & doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. \n\nI\u2019ll be telling our landlord the same thing today. \n\nTL;DR went to town on myself with the shower head, as I orgasmed I slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ED for a few stitches.\n\nEdit: changed the TLDR for u/Nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate\n\nEdit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. Thanks for the awards too. \n\nTo answer the biggest question: I was embarrassed and panicked when I said I was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying I slipped. Stupid I know, but none of us are perfect. \n\nTo all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can\u2019t so you\u2019ve got that \ud83d\ude02\n\nTo the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think I\u2019m a man, who slid into my DMs just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. I\u2019m not responding to anyone who attacks me, it\u2019s pretty sad you\u2019ve got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it\u2019s just not needed. \n\nI\u2019ve also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and I\u2019ve learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",

I am known in my friend group for being a steel trap for secrets because I don't care, and don't have a good enough memory to share with anyone what they tell me.\n\nMy friend, lets call him Hiram, confided in me a while ago that he went to hang out with a female cousin of his, lets call her Amelia. Well, Hiram and Amelia always had a weird relationship because Hiram always found Amelia very attractive, and he thought she would flirt with him sometimes. They ended up going to a movie together and ended up playing hide the cucumber in the back of his PT Cruiser. He tells me this in a dairy queen parking lot, and I nearly had aneurysm. So, I sat on the secret for like 2 years, and I was doing so good in the whole \"not sharing earth shattering secrets\" department.\n\nFast forward to last week. I was hanging out with Hiram, and some of his other cousins, all of whom are men who he has not had sex with (to my knowledge), and we were just playing video games and having a good time. At some point Amelia comes up in conversation between all of us. His male cousins snicker a little bit because apparently they knew he had a crush on her at some point, but I interpreted their snickers as them knowing that Hiram had boned Amelia. I wasn't too wrong for thinking this because these guys tell each other EVERYTHING. So, anyway I say \"dude I still cant believe you banged your cousin\" and one of his other cousins yells \"YOU WHAT\". I think at that moment I saw Hirams life force leave his body. Now, I have to live with the fact that I may have just destroyed an entire family with one sentence.\n\nSo, anyway I'm now going into witness protection because Hiram is going to fucking kill me, forward any of my mail to my new address in Argentina.\n\nAdios muchachos\n\n\\- Anon\n\nTL;DR- I unearthed my friends long kept secret of him boning his cousin in front of his other cousins, and now for the rest of their lives family reunions are going to be very very awkward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: spelling",

        "selftext": "TIFU by going blind and posting in r/pics \n\nA friendly Redditor [u/kevindavebob] suggested I post on TIFU so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). This is certainly a TIFU and it all just happened so I\u2019m still feeling pretty terrible about it.\n\nI have a rare disease called Usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. One of the ways I cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever I can to create visual memories before I go blind. I went to Iceland to try to see the northern lights. I can\u2019t even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. I didn\u2019t know if it would be too late for me to see them. \n\nI really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for Usher syndrome. Only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, I certainly can\u2019t capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. I was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. The photo has been linked so many times that I didn\u2019t spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going\u2026.).\n\nWith my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, I posted in r/pics. I chatted with a few kind Redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about Usher syndrome. Then I went to sleep\u2026.\n\nWell, all hell broke loose.\n\nMy post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. I woke up to THOUSANDS of hurtful messages and comments \u2013 calling me a liar and telling me I don\u2019t have my disease, Redditors telling me they\u2019re happy I\u2019m going blind if it is true, that I should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones I won\u2019t write here).\n\nI wish the mods took my post down while I was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite Reddit telling me I was a fraud. It then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where I got even more hate. I didn\u2019t say it was my picture, but I didn\u2019t credit the photographer. I SERIOUSLY fucked up.\n\nI can\u2019t even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. Living with Usher syndrome is NOT easy. There is no cure and it\u2019s terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. My vision especially. I want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for Usher syndrome to discover a cure. Not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. \n\nI was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, I didn\u2019t make the effort to credit the photographer the way I should have. I fucked up Reddit. \n\nI am getting so much hate now, even outside of Reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. I\u2019m sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for Usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. We have too much negativity in this world and it\u2019s got to stop at some point. \n\nThank you to everyone who was understanding and realized I made a mistake. Thank you Luke Stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. I\u2019m sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. Your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.\n\nI really did fuck up, though. \n\n\nTLDR; I tried to raise awareness for Usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, Luke Stackpoole. My post made it to the front page and Reddit now hates me.\n\nEdit: A nice Redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested I share the non-profit that donates to Usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don't want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - The Usher Syndrome Society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org.

I'm appalled at the community, I'm furious at the mods of all of these threads that have just let you be a victim of this hate, when all you did was what, forget to credit a photographer of a free to use image? \n\nYOU shouldn't be writing a post on TIFU, every person who attacked someone with a crippling and terrifying illness and the mods who let them get away with it should be.\n\nTrying to look from an optimistic standpoint - at least your illness is probably going to get a lot more awareness around it than you were ever predicting haha. In a cruel fate sort of way, I think this sort of thing happens to a lot of people with chronic health problems. They basically get bullied for doing absoltuely nothing wrong, and next thing you know there's a new twitter hashtag trying to raise awareness about the health issue they were attacked for in the first place.\n\nThe takeaway from this is - know that you are heard, you are so loved, and you don't owe a single apology to any of these people who've hurt you.

Look, on a sub that you view frequent and thats smaller then the generic r/pics i can see how its annoying to repost something that's done daily. That's just karma fishin. However like i said posting to a HUGE subreddit with a generic picture and posting something like what you did is NOT an issue. Like at all. You werent making the post about the photo, it was about the disease itself. However we live in a fucking simpleton time where everyone reads the title, looks at picture if there is one, and maybe the first few words of a post. Even this reply, so many people will not read it and just say \"omg wall of text loser!11!!\" which just further shows the incompetence of the generation we're in. A generation where information is literally a click or two away, and for the most part is summarized without even needing to click on an article.

She took the tent to a huge outdoor festival, started chatting to some friends on the camping site with tens of thousands people milling about, & started to complain about the shop. \n\nApparently at one point she very loudly exclaimed \u201cI hate Blacks!\u201d. The realisation hit pretty quickly, & she cried out in an even louder tone \u201cthe outdoor store! Blacks the outdoor store!\u201d. I don\u2019t think she stayed outside long enough to gauge the reactions of the people nearby haha.",

At one point I ask \"are there any questions?\" and this kid puts up his hand.\n\n\"What does *whore* mean?\"\n\nI blink. \"Sorry, can you repeat that?\" He does.\n\n\"What does whore mean?\"\n\nI look over at the teacher, my mentor. He just shrugs and makes a \"not my problem, you figure it out\" gesture.\n\n\"Well, erm, where did you hear that word?\"\n\n\"My brother says it all the time.\"\n\n\"Oh dear. Erm, can you use it in a sentence? How did your brother use the word?\"\n\n\"Well, he plays these video games and then he shouts *for the whore!\"*\n\n\"...Do you mean *horde?\"*",

She relented and told her daughter she could have it.

This lady was in her 90's and had a number tattooed on her wrist. We get her in the back of the ambulance and start towards the hospital. The poor old woman farted, and she apologized.

My brother in law complained about something and my 5 year old daughter piped up \u201cit\u2019s probably those damn Jews\u201d.

            "When my daughter was little, we had a conversation about how smoking was so bad for you (her grandparents smoked and were trying to quit). She asked why smoking was bad, and I said that the inside of everyone\u2019s lungs are nice and pink, but if they smoke then their lungs turn from pink to black and that\u2019s not healthy. Fast forward a couple of months - we are out shopping and there is a black man in the store as well. She had never seen a black person before.

            "This is one of the better stories to come out of my slow pitch league.\n\nI've been the pitcher for my mixed gender slow pitch league for a few years. I know most of the people in the league and generally joke around a lot while playing the game.\n\nIm not very competitive so I'm known for pitching a lot of 'melons'. Melons are slow moving easy to hit pitches straight down onto the center of the plate. They keep the game moving and allow everybody to play. At some point I started calling these watermelons. This will become relevant later in the story.\n\nSo anyways... I'm pitching a game against one of my friend's teams and this big, strong, athletically built man comes up to bat. I usually pitch harder for players like this because they can easily hit it out of the park. I send two trash pitches and can tell he's not too happy.\n\n\"I'll give you one nice one and that's all you get!\"\n\nSo I send him a patented Kosnov watermelon straight down the plate and he crushes this ball so far out that it goes into another ball diamond further out from us.\n\nThe game continues and in a later inning, this same guy comes up to bat again. Queue the garbage pitches. I send three balls and he doesn't swing. I figure if I throw one more ball, he'll be walking anyway and it IS just a fun league, so I send another watermelon.\nBoom.\n\nCrushes this ball directly into the neighboring ball diamond again. I'm impressed and I loudly exclaim \"No more watermelons for that guy!\"\nThe issue here is... The guy crushing these balls out if the park was black. I didn't even think about what I said until it was too late. \n\nAnother person from their dugout yells back at me \"What the fuck man???\"\nEverybody who knows me knows that in no way did I mean anything by it but I had to spend the rest of the game throwing everyone watermelons to make sure people understood.\n\nTLDR: Told a black man he couldn't have any more watermelons while playing baseball. Probably marked as a crazy racist for the remainder of my ball career.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

My friend (Asian) and I (white) bragged that we knew how to write a cursive \u201ci\u201d and showed each other.  I told my friend that his \u201ci\u201d\u2019s were wrong bc it didn\u2019t look like the cursive \u201ci\u201d I learned from my mom.  We argued about it a bit before he became so upset and told the teacher that I kept telling him his \u201ci\u201d\u2019s were wrong.

            "One day, when I was probably 3 or 4, my dad took me to play on a park playground in a heavily Jewish area of New Jersey (we are not Jewish).  He was sitting in a park bench reading, when suddenly he is horrified to hear me come down the slide screaming \"THE JEWS!!! GET THE JEWS!!!\"  He has absolutely no idea where I even learned to say this phrase, because he and my mother are not anti Semitic, and no one they know of that spent time with me is either.  Embarrassed as hell, he quickly ushers me away from the playground while the other parents look at us with disgust.  Once we are in the car, he asks me who taught me to say that.  Once I explain about how we were pirates and protecting our treasure chest, he realizes... I was saying \"get the jewels!  Get the jewels!!!\"",

After some stumbling verbal evasion and then some internal searching for the words to use, she found a relatively age-appropriate way to tell me that it meant to have sex.\n\n\"Oh,\" I said. \"Ok...\" And I paused, gears churning for a moment. Then I asked a followup question:\n\n\"Do people really do...*that*, at work, so much?\"\n\nShe seemed baffled, said no, and told me she wondered why I asked that.\n\nI said something like \"I keep seeing stories on TV where someone is at work and the boss yells \"do a better job or you're gonna be laid!\" Or someone comes home from work really angrily yelling \"I got laid today!!\" or is instead just really sad about it having happened...\"\n\nMy mom became more pale, and more tense, while I was telling her the above answer, and by the time I finished saying it, she seemed to be feeling some kind of shock at realizing what had just happened. She just sat still and processed for a moment, then slowly turned to me, and said \"...did you mean, '*getting laid off*'??\n\nCompletely oblivious to her suddenly dying inside, I replied excitedly \"*Oh right, that's what it was*! Laid Off! Yeah I forgot part of it! Haha. So, what *does* \"getting laid off\" mean?\n\nShe told me, in a flat, expressionless tone. (Basically it means getting fired from work.)\n\n(I thanked her!

        "selftext": "A friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a Halloween party experience for his friends.\n\nSince I don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, I agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. It ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.\n\nOur host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. Don't break ANYthing, NO answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. He was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. This was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. He wore a black mask and black clothing.\n\nImmediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. As I mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. I didn't want to be the \"guy who's super excited to lead the group\", and I guess they didn't either.\n\nThe escape room was history-themed. Computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. Lots of books stacked around.\n\nThe first thing I did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.\n\nI put in the first relevant number I thought of, 1492, the date Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas.\n\nLock opens.\n\nThings got a thousand times more awkward.\n\nI apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. The host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as I could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. He didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.\n\nSoonafter, I decided it'd be better if I just left, apologizing again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad I tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. I can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but I appreciate everyone assuring me I didn't FU. I agree with you on principle I suppose, but I also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. The escape room was \"intended to be easier than normal\" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. Dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. Thanks for all the positive responses!!",

            "I don't even know why you kept apologizing. An escape room isn't simply \"find a 4 digit number and you're out!\" I'd be laughing my ass off if I was in your shoes.",
            "Reminds me of the first class trip of high school. It was meant so that students of grade 9 could meet others. It was a pretty fun weekend long trip. \n\nI remember that for one activity, we were taken to a log cabin. There was a giant, very pretty, mural on the wall. \n\nThe people there said that it was very old, with only one detail changed down the line that did not fit the era it was made in.\n\nWe were challenged to find that one difference. I glanced over it and I saw a red flag, the Canadian flag. For those that don't know, the Canadian flag we all know is very new, so I knew that it didn't fit the era. So I almost instantly answered \"The Canadian flag\"\n\nWhich was the right answer. \n\nI guess I ruined that activity because it was apparently supposed to take a long time, most people probably never got to even think of a correct answer",

            "He's an ass. If the room was history themed and only required 4 digits to unlock the door obviously it would be 1492, 1611, 1776, 1812, or something else with historical significance. It was poorly designed and not really thought out.",

            "Reminds me of a time at work when my boss came out with a combination lock which you pushed directions instead of spinning the dial.  It was allowed to go in four different directions.  Up, down, left, right.  He was very confident that no one could discover his combination as you could set it yourself and handed it out.  After passing a few people who tried, I got a hold of it and my gamer brain went, Up, down, up, down, left, right and CLICK it opens.  Not exactly the  **Konami Code** but its what made me think of the pattern.  He got very frustrated and the others laughed at me when i explained my guess for the combination.",

Or the year that George Washington became our first president or something along those lines. Idk, clearly it was obvious. \n\nAnd he probably wasn\u2019t mad at you, he was probably embarrassed and disappointed that he had put a lot of hard work into the room only to have it solved so easily and quickly.

The one I worked at usually had more rooms after the first door, so most of the time I would let them go if they figured it out quickly, but if that was the door to get out of the whole game, then yeah, I get why he closed it again. Dude didn't really have to get angry though, you can't stop humans from throwing shit at a wall until something sticks.",

            "Not your FU at all.  It's all on the friend who did a poor job of constructing an escape room. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, a dry run with four strangers isn't going to translate to an actual escape room scenario, which is likely going to include people who know each other.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, if you make a history-themed room then 1492 is about the WORST exit combination he could pick, next to 1776 and 1812.    Using a historical date at all is a bad idea.",
            "It sounds like dude thought he was clever and you hurt his feelings by proving otherwise. Not a fuck up. Unless the rules are strictly \u201cyou must have the necessary clue in hand before opening the lock\u201d then dude needs to just sack up and try harder next time.",
            "Had a somewhat similar experience at an actual escape room with a friend. One of the doors was locked with a 4-5 digit combo and I had been watching a lot of the locking picking lawyer recently and noticed that some of the numbers were looser than others so I lined them up and bingo skipped half the game. I know it defeats the purpose but couldn\u2019t resist trying to see if it would work. Thanks lock picking lawyer.",
            "Biggest \"Why are you booing me, I'm right\" moment over here.",
            "Using a meaningful date as the final puzzle was idiotic on his part. The codes should be mostly random sequences of numbers to avoid the possibility of just brute forcing through the locks (regardless of this being something that goes against having fun in an escape room).\nHe could have used a code that was the sum of 4 specific dates that you could guess because of 4 suspicious books about Columbus, the American Revolution and whatever other important dates, for example. That way you can't just randomly guess.",
            "I had a similar experience working in IT. A woman had opened a ticket because she couldn't unlock her iPad. She said her PIN wasn't working. Normally there's nothing I could really do. The org wasn't smart enough to have receipts readily available, and I would need those to request an unlock from Apple. Anyhow, I show up to make sure it isn't something simple. She hands me the iPad and complains at me that she's tried her PIN several times and it won't take it. I ask her for her PIN, which does not work. I look at her for a few seconds and type in 1970 figuring her for being around 49 years old.... and the iPad unlocks. I ask if she had reset her PIN recently, and she says she had, but was sure she'd used something else. She asked what I used to unlock it. I told her 1970 and she immediately went beet red. Noped right the fuck out of there.",
            "I did that once in middle school. Teacher had all these blanks on the chalkboard no one seemed able to guess and we were playing \"wheel of fortune\". It was a Friday... Seemed natural that I guessed \"have a nice weekend\"",
            "Really, the guy should've laughed it off with something like \"oh shit, error number 1\" then told people to keep trying random shit until it went smoothly.   \n\n\nWhat a dumb-dumb.",
            "Not a FU. \n\nThat is the risk if you make too many things themed. \n\nRealistically, he's probably more upset at himself for not thinking that someone could straight up guess the final puzzle's answer. \n\nYou want those type of things to REQUIRE the completion of previous sections, which if he's wanting it to be themed, could individually require the use of historical knowledge, but the actual key should be \"unlocked\" by the knowledge, not having the knowledge be the key itself.",
            "I work at an escape room. Big rule for combination locks, don't make them guessable. If it has to be related to the theme (like a letter lock), it should still be vague/random enough that players won't guess it. This seems obvious, but you'd be surprised how many rooms are guilty of it. \n\nSo like, you should never use STAY as a code in a Hotel game or DEATH as a code in a serial killer game (or any game for that matter), but you could use something like BIND or FIEND that's still tangentially related.\n\nUsing one of the only historical dates that just about every American knows as the final code in a history-themed room is terrible game design. For number locks, there's no excuse whatsoever for using a guessable code. Wanna use 1492? Great. Use it in the puzzle, NOT as the answer.",

        "selftext": "So today was pretty f*cking eventful. \n\nFirst, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it\u2019s a lot of fun when everyone\u2019s enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend\u2019s older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.\n\nIt just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (We\u2019ll call him L) got into a fight with another group of guys. Although he and his bro didn\u2019t sustain too much damage from the fight (The other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) L and I got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. It would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.\n\nWe caught up and chilled at a local public playground (Keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. Being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we\u2019d deck the other and how we\u2019d essentially easily F*ck the other up. We began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. \n\nIt was just two 18yr olds messing around. \n\nAll of a sudden, I say something stupid in a mock Japanese accent (I\u2019m Asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at L, when this child that couldn\u2019t be over 8 jumps in and says \u201cHiiyaahh\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop my momentum and proceeded to YEET this kid into the sandpit... \n\nNo amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.\n\nI went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. He wasn\u2019t seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. \n\nHis older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. I apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying I talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.\n\nHis bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. All in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and I got to kick a child in the face... Win-Win.      (that\u2019s a joke)\n\nTL:DR\nBest friend and I were pretend fighting in a public park and when I attempted to do a ridiculous kick I saw on UFC, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. Worth it.\n\nEdit: Holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, I am not worthy of this. I made this post at 12am last night and when I woke up, I was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. \n\nI appreciate you all!\n\nEdit #2: I didn\u2019t make one point clear enough regarding the playground. Besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. L and I made sure that our presence wasn\u2019t making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn\u2019t have even entered the playground area at all.\n\nHope that kinda clears some shiz up",

She's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.\n\nWell my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming \"OH FUCK!\" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.\n\nIt took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..\n\nTL:DR - I gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower....

One kitten I didn't know was behind a rocking chair when I sat down and popped it's eye out of socket. We carefully pushed it's eye back into socket and took it to the vet to make sure it would be OK. Took a couple weeks but eventually when it started to heal up, that kitten wouldn't stop following me around. Especially when the other kittens would pick on it, seemed to have chosen me to be it's protector.\n\nOne of my current cats has a weird habit of biting my goatee. She doesn't bite hard enough to cause discomfort and only does it once or twice before headbutting my chin and passing out. When she was a kitten small enough to fit in the palm of my hand, she did that one night while I was just dozing off. It freaked me out enough that I sat up so quickly that I sent her flying across the room into a hardwood dresser. It really didn't take long after that for her to get attached to me. It's pretty obvious how much she loves and trust me despite doing that to her at such a young age.\n\nPretty sure cats can tell when your trying to look out for them and eventually recognize that for what it is.

        "selftext": "My wife is great, let me start off with that. I am really shocked I ended up married to her; everybody that knows me never lets me forget how lucky I am. She is like a master at being functional, whereas I'm not. When we do household chores together, she gets this beatific expression of contentment; it's adorable. \n\nAbout three months ago, we were both in the yard; I was mowing and she was gardening (we live in WA state; it is warmish here in the winter). I couldn't help but notice how wonderful she looked. I stopped mowing, went over to her, and said something like \"I love you so much, you look so homely.\" She seemed fine. A week or so later, I said it again. \"You are the most HOMELY person I've ever met.\" She didn't seem to respond as expected; I just figured she was down. \n\nSee, I thought \"homely\" was like some adorable snow white type shit; homes are cozy and make you feel safe, right? Here was my wife, going around the house, dusting and playing with the cat, saying hello to houseplants, and doing it in a way that gave me cozy, or what I thought were \"homely\" feelings. I kept calling her homely for another month or so; I could feel some distance between us but couldn't source it. Then it happened.\n\nI got home from work, and went to give my (now sad and confused) wife a hug. \"My GOD you are just SO HOMELY!!\" She pushed me away, looked me right in the eyes, and said \"I...don't think you know what that means. You've been saying it for months, and I really think you have NO idea.\" So I looked it up, and found that (at least in America) no, \"homely\" doesn't mean cute, or cozy. It means ugly or unattractive.  I thought I was complimenting my wife whenever I called her homely, when I was really just killing her soul a little bit at a time. With that unfortunate misunderstanding fixed, we are now doing fine. \n\nTL;DR   I thought \"homely\" meant cute, and ended up calling my wife homely for months. Found out that It means ugly. We both died inside.\n\nEdit: To those who wonder why she took so long to tell me, all I can say is that I wondered the same thing. My wife is *extremely* chill; that's part of what I love about her. What she told me was \"Your body language didn't match up with the word.\" Every time I called her homely, I projected an otherwise kind and loving presence. I think that dissonance really weirded her out. She's always struggled with assertiveness; that, her general chillness, and my strange demeanor was apparently a perfect storm that lead to repression.\n\nEdit #2: We live in Western Washington, which is quite warm in the winter compared to the upper Midwest where I grew up. As long as the grass is green, it's warm to me.",

I'm pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.\n\nAs an adult, I assumed, well, since I'm full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.

There's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.\n\nTL;DR - I'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",

Most brands all run differently size, but they are all usually within a half size of each other. I had someone come into the store today requesting a 13D, and he eventually left the store wearing 11EE. \n\nLife ProTip: NEVER go up in numerical size if you only need width. The arches in the shoes will be too far forward, which can lead to plantar fasciitis. Always wear the correct length AND width. If the store doesn\u2019t have your size, special order it, and special order at least two pairs. If you need them immediately, go buy a pair of cheap shoes from Walmart or target that are the right size until the order comes in. Trust me. You\u2019ll be happy you took care of your feet when you\u2019re one of the only people in your nursing home that isn\u2019t painfully hobbling around in crocs.",

            "It's a shame that old school mom and pop shoe stores are a dying art. I'm lucky to have one in my town but the best that I know of is about two hours away. You should try going to a shoe store that measures your feet to learn your true size. The employees are paid by the hour so they're there for you, not to sell you shoes that don't fit. Your shoe size can also change for many reasons such as weight loss/gain, depression, surgery, injury, stress, and for women pregnancy. People are sized for their glasses/contacts once a year, why not get your feet sized in the same fashion? Sadly, most people aren't wearing the correct shoe size.",
            "The worldwide accepted system in place that determines the size of a shoe is very primitive in regards to the human anatomy called the Brannock Device. It measures the length and width of the entire foot. Sounds good on paper but there two problems. All shoe manufacturers sizing can vary. Every shoe has a point of least resistance where it naturally wants to flex and crease. The idea is to choose a size of shoe where the ball of the foot is aligned with the part of the shoe that flexes the most or point of least resistance. If the ball of foot is fore or aft, it will slide back and forward after every step, potentially causing blisters. The shoe doesn't care where the ball of your foot wants to flex, it is going to flex in the same spot regardless. Put on the shoes in question and kneel on one foot, lean forward with one hand holding the shoe from the back until it stops flexing and the other feeling for the middle of the ball of the foot. Now with shoe flat on the ground hold it stationary and try to move your foot in all directions. There should be a tolerance but not excessive free play. This allows for expansion without restricting blood flow during the day.\n\nEdit: The best way to get a running injury is wearing shoes on concrete according to some studies I've read. If you run often for the sole purpose of exercise, I recommend ditching shoes all together and run on a dirt trail barefoot or as minimal as possible. Also pay attention to your posture when running. Landing on the heels first sends the energy straight to the ankles to the hips into the spine and then the neck. We have springs in our feet that work great at storing energy, propelling us forward and not to mention, humans are designed to run barefoot.",
            "To a certain extent, you were most likely self conscious about the size of your feet at age 18, and subconsciously just went with the smallest size, since a larger shoe would have drawn more attention to your already disproportionate feet.  \n\nSource:  my own experience",

            "Since you mentioned running... your running shoes should be 1/2 or even a whole size bigger than your walking shoes.  When you're running your feet both lengthen and widen (at different stages of the cycle) more than when you're walking, so you need extra room.  For example, I wear size 10, but I usually run in size 11.  It depends a lot on the brand and the shape of your feet, so it's best to get measured in a running store.  Not only will they help you get the right size but they will tell you the right level of sole support for your gait (overpronation/underpronation).  If you have wide feet then a lot of the brands probably won't work for you at all (try ASICS).  Definitely don't run in the same size shoes that you walk in though.",

Me and my girlfriend were sitting around bored during quarantine playing sporcle quizzes on the computer when somehow the question of what the average dick size is came up. Since we were sitting at a computer, I was like, well why not look it up? (This was my first mistake...)   \nI pulled up this article that had a nice looking bell curve and you can look at the percentiles and what not. The average was around 5 inches or so, like yours truly. Then as she was looking she said \"Huh, I wonder where 9 inches falls on this graph\". At this moment, the gears started turning in my head.. What an oddly specific length to ask about. I ask her, \"why did you ask about 9 inches in particular??\" (my second mistake..) and then she casually mentioned that she had a \\*COUPLE\\* of exes that were 9 inches. A COUPLE!!! That's about as likely as dating two guys that are taller than 6'10\"! (for perspective 6.3 inches was 95th percentile, 7 inches was 98th or something, so 9 is literally off the charts)  \n\n\nNeedless to say, I became super insecure and for the next few days we'd be in the middle of sexy time and all of a sudden the image of her getting dicked down by a monstrous 9 inch cock twice my size would pop in my head killing my mood. Like there's no way I can measure up.

            "Recently I discovered a show that helped me overcome my insecurities.\nNaked Attraction is a dating show where people select a date based mostly on physical appearance, starting with the genitals.\nIt shows a bunch of very average men and women which is something you don't see in porn or gemeral media.\nThere's some episodes on YouTube. Its a show from the UK I think so its hard to access in America.",

They see something they think is comparatively big and come up with a measurement that seems big.\n\nShe was with a couple of guys whose size impressed her.  She was not with guys who hung 9 inches.",
            "Once again, let me remind you that most women do not orgasm by penetration, many women are too small to actually enjoy huge penises, and many of us actually prefer medium sized penises since we can try more positions without being in pain! It seems like this obsession with big dicks is almost always strictly male, perpetuating the idea that just because a guy has a bigger dick it in any way means he gives more pleasure or is a better lay. Hell no.\n\nI wish dudes realized that for MANY women, a dick in the v isn\u2019t in and of itself all that pleasurable the way sticking the dick in the V is. Clitoral stimulation and mental comfort/ arousal are crucial and literally anyone can do that no matter their dick size. As long as you aren\u2019t tiny tiny, you\u2019re very likely fine for any girl. Best sex I\u2019ve ever had was with a partner with an incredibly average (Idk if it was even 6 inches) not that girthy dick because our mental connection was great, we were both creative and into the same experimentation, and he was very confident and giving.",
            "Why would she even mention that wtf",
            "she either exaggerated the size or they lied how big it is",
            "The first couple I had seen were about 7-8\", and they were both Italian (I don't know if there is a link or not).  However, most don't need all of that extra length.  A cervix is only so deep.  My husband's completely average penis occasionally causes discomfort from hitting my cervix (though mine is extremely tilted so that may be why).  Giving her a good warm up and an orgasm is more important than penis size any day.",
            "Yeah but a bigger dick doesn't always feel better. The *perfect* dick is long, yes, but it's also the perfect thickness (which is somewhere in the middle), and the perfect curvature, which varies for everyone, but is even more rare to find one that fits you just right. So it's very unlikely that her sexual experience with these two exes was better. More likely, it was worse, because flaws, like heads that are way too fat or a weird curve that stabs you in the wall, are much more likely to be noticed in a big dick.\n\n\nAnd before anyone assumes that I'm just some guy who is hating on bih dicks because I have a small one, my experience lies in taking them, not giving them. And because I have had a variety of dicks up my ass , my female friends feel perfectly comfortable telling me all about every dick of any shape and size that they've had the privilege (or lack thereof) of sitting on. The consensus does not lie with the monster cocks, despite what social convention would have you believe. This goes for any orifice.",
            "1) They probably exaggerated their dick sizes and were not actually 9 inches.  \n\n\n2) As a woman, let me say that 7+ inches HURTS. Bigger is not better.",
            "Compare dicks to a woman's breast.  Most guys would prefer big boobs, but there are some fabulous looking women with a cups.  Size might matter a little, but if you act like you have a baby dick, I promise she'll treat you like you have a baby dick.  You don't need to be 9\" to make a woman cum.  Your size is fine.  Own it.  You were born this way.  Walk with 10\" confidence and it'll be fine.",

I will not include details before I knew them. \n\nIt all started when I (f23) got home late from work. We had a meeting after the park was closed and didn't get home until 10pm. I take a shower and smoke my dab pen while drying my hair. (I then proceeded to forget the next hour) So, my hair was dry and I was playing Red Dead Online. I had just got comfy when I hear my cat Winnie make a strange meow. My cat only meows like this when she sees something outside. It's like a low yowl and not a cute meow. I pause the game and take my headphones off. She is meowing in the living room. She runs into the doorway to my bedroom and meows again. I follow her out into my living room which is only lit by a night light. I see that my motion activated light is on outside. Winnie is looking through the blinds and meows again and again. The light goes off and then comes back on. \n\nI call my roommate(m26). He is at work and gets off in an hour. I am fried at this point and I'm thinking that I am over reacting. Winnie meows louder and longer. Over and over. I'm freaking out and a shadow from my patio moves. A few seconds later, there is a knock on the door. I feel my heart in my ears. The heartbeats are really loud and everything is in slow motion. I'm staring at the door for what seems like about 30 seconds but was probably only 2 or 3. I dart to my room, lock my door, and then was in my closet with a large knife. I don't remember if I got the knife before or after the knocking. \n\nI'm on the phone to police. My breath is incredibly shaky and raspy. I'm having memories and images of my family and friends rushing through my head. Then I think of my parents and how I need to call them but I'm on the phone with 911 telling them info and location. I am mentally preparing to kill someone or die. The 911 dispatcher was silent. She said there were 2 officers close. \n\nSilence. \n\nI ask where they are. She tells me they are turning into my apartment. I wait the most painful 30 seconds of my life. If seriously felt like 10 minutes. I hear voices at my front door. \n\nI hear the dispatchers voice. \nShe asks \"did you order delivery?\" \n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR, I forgot I ordered delivery and called the cops on my delivery driver for delivering my food. \n\nPS, sorry for formatting. On phone.\n\nEdit: wow this blew up overnight. Of course, thanks for the gold, kind stranger and everyone else who awarded or commented on this post. I love reading all of your funny and related replies. Shit happens and we laugh and learn from it.\n\nEdit 2: since I keep getting asked, yes I still feel awful, yes I tipped the driver online and no, the cops and the driver did not see eachother. The driver dropped my food at the door.",

            "My sister called the cops on me once thinking I was an intruder. When I was 20, I was a year into my 4 year Navy career. I got stationed at a naval base about 2 hours away from where my parents lived. Well we had agreed I would come visit since my sister was going to be in town for a week. The date for my arrival was set and I was excited. I got even more excited when our CO announced we would be pulling into homeport two days ahead of schedule.\n\nNow me being the genius I am, I got the big brain idea to head on home early with the intent of surprising them. I had to work that day so I didn't end up leaving base until about 2100. I ended up getting home around midnight. I had the key to the house and let myself in.\n\nNow I really thought this was a good plan. They would sleep soundly, wake up in the morning and find me making them breakfast. Genius plan.\n\nWell imagine my absolute shock and horror when after being home for 20 minutes. Two police officers show up in the basement of my parents house where I am staying and am confused as I can be. I have no idea what's going on, they look like they have no idea what's going on and were kind of at a stand still for a moment. Then my sister comes down and sees me to great relief. She heard me come in the house and thought I was a burglar. We all had a bit of an awkward laugh at that point and the officers took their leave.\n\nAt first my parents were a little pissed when they found out about it, but ultimately laugh about it now looking back. It was a \"come to jesus\" moment where I knew I fucked up. My sister said when she saw me, I was as pale as a ghost. Fun times. Fun, stress-inducing, heart-racing times.",

No one, not the dispatcher or officers who responded would be upset about what you did.\n\nHaving said that, let me give you one of the worst I\u2019ve been on the other side of the phone for.\n\nWoman calls 911, it\u2019s after midnight, probably around 2am, she is whispering and sounds extremely freaked out. She says someone has entered her home. She goes on to say that they are currently on the couch looking at their phone. My WTF radar perks up. Strange, but going through possibilities, it could be a friend or family member, or possibly someone went into the wrong house. I ask if she was expecting anyone, she says she lives alone and her family lives out of town. I then ask if she actually saw this person. She said no, but she can see the light from their phone screen reflecting off the walls, and it keeps changing, like if someone were browsing or watching a movie or something. She then mentions she has a dog, and I ask if they alerted to noise and where the dog was. She said the dog was asleep in bed with her, and never alerted to noise which she then said was odd because the dog barks anytime someone comes in the house.\n\nOfficer gets on scene, finds the door locked, and not seeing anything out of the ordinary, he knocks on the door and identifies himself. No movement or anything. He then asks if the caller can come to the door. All of a sudden she says, \u201cI am so sorry, I\u2019m an idiot, I have an electronic picture frame, and the light I thought was from a phone was from that. There\u2019s no one in the house. This is so embarrassing!\u201d\n\nI reassure her and make sure she knows she did the right thing and disconnect the line.\n\nThis happens all the time. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s embarrassing, but if it were actually something, then you\u2019d have been glad you called. That\u2019s what 911 is there for.",

Especially if - as here - the \u201coffending\u201d partner really hasn\u2019t done anything wrong and it\u2019s more about the other party\u2019s fit of pique\u2026\n\nI\u2019m certainly not saying I\u2019ve never had a row-driven night on the sofa, but it\u2019s always been my choice.",

            "i used to fear Muslims when I was little (was 11 when 9/11 happened, also dad was a bit racist). But then, I made my best friend when I was 14. I didn\u2019t even realize she was Muslim till I went to her house. NGL, I was a bit freaked out by her family at first. But I knew better than to say anything rude or start panicking, even at that young age. \n\n\nThey were always kind to me, so I guess I just got over it that way. My mom thought young me was fat and we didn\u2019t have a lot of time or resources for me (brother was a nationally ranked sports champion, the lessons and travel ate up all the spare money, time, and love). So my friend\u2019s house was always my haven to get a good traditional meal and advice or help without shouting.\n\n\n\nOnce, all of us went out for the movies. Now, I must stress that I am so white I look like printer paper. However I am great with languages and was able to converse a bit in Urdu, which was all they ever spoke to each other. Due to some things in my life, I also permanently looked sad and scared for several months. Even without trying. This was in that time.\n\n\n\nOf course, as one does, I drank too much soda during the movie (damn you, giant cups!) and had to pee right after. I hurry away from the others to do so, since I need the closest bathroom ASAP!\n\n\n\nThis \u201cI want to see your manager\u201d type lady in her 50s practically corners me by the sinks and asks if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m totally confused and say I\u2019m fine, can I go now?\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s like, I saw you with those damn A-rabs, and you\u2019re as white as can be! And you look sad! Are they maybe hurting you? *Do you need help?*\n\n\n\nI stammered until I hit on saying, \u201c*I\u2019m* fine. At least I\u2019m not an awful racist like *you*!\n\n\n\nSMH. It was just absurd.",
