        "selftext": "I see a guy in my building to give him the occasional BJ when he\u2019s in the mood but the women he\u2019s casually dating are all unavailable. It\u2019s all fun and games. Nothing serious. I go over, get on my knees, we both leave happy. \n\nSo today while giving him a very sloppy service, he decided to straddle my face and make me lick his ass. I mean, I have done it once or twice. It\u2019s not my first choice or second choice on the menu. But he seemed like he really wanted it, and I thought doing it would distract him from wanting to anal me, as he had stealthily moved from squeezing my butt cheeks to fingering my butt during BJ. I was not ready for anal.\n\nSo I let him squat over my face and plant his butt crack squarely on my face. I assumed all guys observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs. The BJ to ball licking to taint licking to butt licking transition happens enough that I assumed every guy cleans the entire pelvic region before a BJ session. \n\nI assumed incorrectly. I screamed into his ass canyon but my screams were muffled. I got out from under him so fast. I didn\u2019t want to look at him. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I saw his tightie whitie on the floor as I left, looking down to avoid any eye contact, and noticed the skid marks. The sight of it made me puke a little acid bile in my mouth. \n\nTo top it off, on my way back to my unit, I had to wear a mask in the elevator, which only amplified the scent of his unclean ass. It was a no for me. 0/10. Do not recommend. \n\nTL;DR: I assumed all men observed the clean ass etiquette when they make their partners lick their butts. I was wrong.\n\nUpdate 1: I just can\u2019t stand awkwardness and I was pretty rude the way I ran out. I messaged him to apologize and clarified it was a hygiene issue, which he claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of (how?). Anyway, I told him it wasn\u2019t my favorite on the menu, but willing to do it if he cleaned thoroughly. Turns out he wanted to eat me out mostly, but thought he could only do it if he let me do it first. I clarified for him that he can feel free to dine out on my butthole and finger me all he wants. I don\u2019t feel the need or desire to reciprocate. Just no anal yet. Communication and friendship re-established.\n\nUpdate 2: Also, all these chat messages calling me derogatory names are stupid. You don\u2019t know me. Be nice to others. Thanks.",

        "selftext": "I have not clue when this FU started but I do know that I realised my error at the age of around 25, I'm currently 34.\n\nI was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular [image](https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.\n\n\nBackstory:\n\n\nLike most children, I was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt I was getting too old to have them help me, around 7, 8, 9 (for a guess, god knows). I remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. I used to hate it when my father washed my hair. He used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and I could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.\n\n\nAfter I was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure I had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. It's only after realising my FU that I recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.\n\nI can only presume that once I had the ability and trust to clean myself, I choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. For many years I would use shampoo and simply rub it onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that I thought sufficient before washing it off again.\n\nI'm half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. I could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. I'm not sure whether this was a factor or not but I could never style my hair in any way. So It wouldn't need combing when I got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.\n\n\nFor as long as I remembered every time I went to the barbers I would notice a huge about of what I thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. I used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that I had a dry scalp condition. I even purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.\n\n\nI couple of times a barber would tell me that I needed to clean my head properly. I just presumed that they didn't understand a dry scalp when they saw one. Before going to the barbers I would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later I would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.\n\n\nOne time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. I was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. At the end of this particular cut I looked like I had been out in the snow for an hour.\n\n\nSo the realisation came one day when I was around 24/25 and I was washing my ears. Other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, I never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. I don't know why but on this occasion I decided to put shampoo inside my ears. I washed around for a while and after a few seconds I start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.\n\n\nI suddenly thought of the phrase 'squeaky clean', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. Memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. I had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since I was a kid.\n\n\nI quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms I dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. After a while on a certain spot I heard/felt a squeak.\n\n\nOMG! Right there and then I quickly realised that I didn't have a dry scalp condition, I had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. I washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.\n\n\nI've made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. On the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn't been one since.\n\n\nI told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that I didn't have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. I will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.\n\n\nTL/DR\n\nFor ten years I thought that I was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because I had a dry scalp problem. It turned out that I just didn't know how to wash my hair properly.\n\nEdit: Grammar\n\nMany thanks for the gold :-)",

            "Barber here! hey OP i hope you understand this isn\u2019t an odd or uncommon occurrence part of our job is to help you understand hair maintenance and hair health. For each culture and race it differs vastly. For one, most indan cultures have very oily hair because their diet consists of oil based/heavy sauces and curries. So it\u2019s not uncommon for me to actually smell a faint scent when cutting/clipping hair (note your hair and skin reflects what you ingest). i generally suggest more abrasive shampoos with the ability to strip heavier oils from the hair. with caucasian people mostly from northern parts of europe they generally deal with finer hair or thinner strands which means using very gentle and non stripping shampoo and keratin based shampoos vs my indian/asian clients. With my mixed race or african american clients this is not uncommon at all, with the density of the hair it can take some serious effort to get to the scalp and deep cleanse. curly and course hair builds oil much faster that other hair types, yet can be dry and brittle towards the ends due to need of constant moisture and natural oils . it may require a lot of love to make it healthy. so please don\u2019t feel for a moment this is uncommon i generally have one client a day with oil/buildup. \n\nalso remember for many people who take certain medications or with skin conditions their scalp can react very negatively. i\u2019ve also has several clients with special/able bodied needs come to me weekly since they are unable to care/wash their hair properly. so please don\u2019t feel self conscious about this, i\u2019m just very happy it had a good ending and you were able to figure out the problem! for others it\u2019s definitely not as clear . \n\nhave a happy healthy scalp!",

            "I'm glad you figured out that soap and shampoo removes oil, and to clean any part you need to scrub it.\n\nKeep in mind, the squeaky clean thing is really overkill and need not be the goal.  In fact, I would guess you just weren't properly scrubbing and rinsing all the way down to the hair follicle. Over time, this would build up with dead skin as you noted.  You also might have had some dandruff, which is extra dry scalp due to a skin fungus.\n\nPersonally,  I've stopped using shampoo and soap altogether in daily showers; resorting to just hot water and some mechanical scrubbing.  Oil is actually really effective at trapping dirt and the dirt makes it all soluble in water, allowing you to get clean just by scrubbing with your finger nails or a slightly abrasive cloth.  There is a good reason our skin and hair produce oil on their own, nature knows what it's doing.",

Used everything commercially available with mediocre results.  About 15 years ago I started using baking soda to clean my face.  Works perfectly and I have the smoothest, cleanest face ever.  At about the same time I stopped using shampoo.  I just wash with water and the baking soda from face cleansing while in the shower is enough to get the oils out of my hair and keep it clean without drying it out too much.  \n\nSounds crazy.....baking soda.

Like everyone else said, you\u2019re stripping your hair of essential oils that you need to replenish. Also fun fact, YOU DONT NEED TO WASH YOUR HAIR EVERYDAY; especially for curly hair, the coiliness of the follicles means oil can\u2019t travel down the hair shaft easily so greasy hair is not likely to be much of a problem but DRY HAIR is because the oil produced by the scalp stays kind of trapped close to it and it takes way longer for these oils to travel down and moisturise the hair shaft. all this to say, as you scrub the oils out, please replenish them or your hair will be dry.

Not just with clippers but also with a razor. I shaved my head with a razor for about 6 months and then let my hair grow back. Since then I haven't had dandruff, not even a single flake. My guess is that shaving with a razor \"scraped\" the dead, infected skin off and allowed for healthy new growth. It may not be an option for everyone but for those who are willing to, give it a shot. Also, after shaving with a razor, rub some of elixir of the gods, aka aloe vera, on and your scalp will feel silky smooth as Scrappy Coco intended it to be.",

It's like it completely reversed my problem and I'll never get back to that cheap stuff.  \n\n\nI know some people might be worried about the price but usually those shampoos have the advantage of not requiring huge amounts of it to make a foam and be efficient so it would last a couple of months. The best advice would be to apply a little bit with your hair wet, rinse then apply the same amount again. Of course using your fingers as OP said is a good advice as well.

I hope you choose to address the truthfulness issue now it's been pointed out - and not take the easy way out by saying you will and ignoring the need to change.\n\nIts very hard in some ways to never lie, but you never need to remember a lie again, never hurt someone's feelings when they find out you were lying to them, and never scar your reputation for good with people you care about who catch you in one.",

            "Don't feel bad op, I had the opposite problem from 12-25.\n\nI have always washed my hair too often and with shampoo everyday. I was embarrassed at the barber for more than a decade because I always had dandruffs and no matter the medications I use, I continue to get white flakes.\n\nLast year while going on a trip, a good friend of mine apply this oil on her hair after a shower. She said it was a leave in conditioner and asked if I would like to tried some. I thought it might give my hair more volume so I brought a bottle after and used it with my new dandruff medicine. 2 weeks later my dandruffs we're almost gone!\n\nI kept buying the new medicine because I thought I finally found the cure. Except 3 months, when I moved to another state for work, my dandruffs came back. I used more and more of the medicine but my dandruffs continued to get worse. \n\nThen it hit me. I left my bottle of leave in conditioner back in my old state. My dandruffs was gone not because the medicine but because of the conditioner. Then it hit me again, I didn't have dandruffs all these years, I just have a dry head because I used shampoo every single day.\n\nI googled how to confirm this and took an advice to use some of my skin moisturizer on the tip of my hairline and check if it get better in the morning. I woke up and my hairline was no longer flaky.\n\nSince then I have use conditioners everytime I shampoo and cut out shampoo to 3 times a week. My hair no longer have any flake except for the colder month, which I turn up the moisturizer more. I owned a lot to my friend for letting me try her conditioner (She was a bit stingy because it an expensive one though \ud83d\ude10).\n\nGuys, visit a dermatologist and don't self treat like I did for a decade.",

        "selftext": "Today I fucked up (well last night if you wanna be technical) while on a Tinder date. I'd seen the guy, let's call him A, a couple times a few months back and nothing ever happened. I ended up getting into a relationship anyway so I thanked A for his time, but let him know I was now taken and with that I deleted the app.\n\nTwo months later and that fling had ended and I found myself wondering what ever happened to A. So I re-downloaded the cursed App and got to swiping with the sole intent of finding A again. Weeks passed and I had almost given up, I was going to forget A and just focus on the guys who I'd matched with along the way - but then I found A's profile! \n\nI swiped, we matched, and I instantly sent a message asking if he remembered me. He did, and we got to chatting and a couple days later we had organised for me to come to his house Tuesday night for pizza and drinks. All went well, he got me a vegetarian pizza and we had a lot of fun catching up, and this time around there was definitely a lot more chemistry... And by the end of the night one thing lead to another and we started hooking up in his bedroom. Here's where the fuck up happened.\n\nNormally I have a pretty good gag reflex, but for some reason last night, God decided to look down on my with hatred as the most embarrassing moment of my life took place. I was going down on him, and he was enjoying it too, and moving his hips in time with me to help with the sensation. I guess we fell out of sync for a second because the next thing I knew, his dick was halfway down my throat and I baby barfed (you know that little bit of vom that you can usually just swallow back down?) Well this time, because his dick was in the way, I couldn't just swallow this baby barf away, and my attempt at doing so only made me gag on his dick more, and I proceeded to projectile vomit all over this poor dudes dick and crotch, and it was chunky, vegetarian pizza vomit full of spinach leaves, tomato, feta, and onions.\n\nI went into shock but A was very sweet about it, he reassured me and got me a towel, took me to the bathroom and put me in the shower all while I was a crying, apologising mess. He said he was going to go and clean up his room while I shower and he kissed me on the forehead and told me it was all fine. After calming down in the shower, I then began to laugh uncontrollably at the situation because, let's face it, it was pretty funny albeit mortifying.\n\nIn the end he offered me to stay the night which I was very thankful for, because nothing would have been worse than to be kicked out after the whole debacle. The rest of the night and following morning was fine, we never spoke about the incident again, and I don't think I can ever eat vegetarian pizza again.\n\nTL;DR: went on date, ate pizza, hooked up with dude, vomited all over him and his bed in the middle of oral sex, and was surprisingly NOT immediately kicked out of his house!",

It\u2019s 2017 I had been dating my high school crush for 3 months now, meeting up at parties, getting drunk, the usual for a 18 year old, one day we decide that its time to spend the night together in my parents\u2019 house, because, you know, 3 months is a \u201cserious relationship\u201d for an 18 year old. Obviously, I had to do some prep before she came over. Fairy lights along the bed posts (cause chicks love that\u2026) tidy the room, change the bed sheets, apply a lil bit of lavender to the pillows, spray some nice cologne gotta smell fresh.\n\nFast forward a few hours, it\u2019s about 11pm, we are in bed, nothing but fairly lights lighting up the room, love is in the air, super romantic, things get heated and before we know it we are on our way to pound town, bed is rocking giving the classic bed frame squeak, having the time of our lives.\n\nSo this went on almost every day for a year, she would come over, we would get down to business go to sleep, repeat. And I thought nothing of it. The only thing that I questioned was when my mum came up the stairs and passed me a bag full of condoms. Me being innocent was like \u201chmm why would I need these, mum? I don\u2019t have sex?\u201d she just said, \u201cokay they\u2019re there if you need them\u201d and walked out. Anyway, that didn\u2019t rouse any suspicion.\n\nNow, mid-week, no one is in the house but myself and my girlfriend of a year and a bit. She sat down on the bed and it squeaked  a little bit, it had gotten worse over our year together and it made us think about how the sound might travel\u2026 Now I live in a two-story house, I stay upstairs, and my mum and stepdad sleep directly below me on the ground floor. So, I send the girlfriend downstairs into my mums\u2019 bedroom and I jump on the bed making it squeak. she comes back upstairs with a horrified expression on her face, apparently the sound carries through the floor and is amplified by the hollow ceiling, acting like a big amplifier. So, my poor mother who has since bought an expensive pair of ear plugs has had to listen to my girlfriend and I going at it for the past year\u2026 I wasn\u2019t able to look my mum in the eye for a few weeks after and I think she might have understood why.\n\nTLDR : My girlfriend and I had been screwing for a year straight in a squeaky bed and my mum could hear everything and I didn\u2019t know\n\nEdit:Spelling of fairy lights was wrong\n\nEdit 2 : thank you for my first gold you beautiful anon",

So as a man of culture and purveyor of such things, I said of course I have a bunch in my room. So he borrowed at least 3 to 5 tapes as he was gonna get busy, haha. By the way, this was around 3 am in the morning. So long story short, he tried to do the deed. Woke up pants down, dick in hand while his family was having lunch. Forgot to mention their vhs player was in the living room which is in a common area with the dining room. You might think nobody even tried to cover him up with a blanket, his mom did. But it was hot, so of course he threw it to the side. Worst thing about this, it was his mom who told me this story.",

But because it was so early when I went to bed, I just got \"prepared\". My intention was not to wake him up, but I wanted to be ready if he chose to pursue. \n\nWell, it did not happen, and since I had a buzz, I drifted off to sleep. My intention was to get up and remove it before I went to sleep, but as the title says, that did not happen. I woke up roughly 4 hours after being asleep, and remembered it was back there, so I reached around back to get it out, and when I felt nothing, my eyes popped wide open! I was fully awake! I got up and searched the covers, searched around the bed in case it fell, checked again inside of me, and nothing! I panic and I'll call my husband at work, and he was like \"it is a bit busy, is everything okay?\" And I am like \"No! I went to sleep with the butt plug and now I can't find it anywhere!\" He was like \"what, let me call you right back\" (I am assuming because he wanted to go into the break room for privacy). As I was waiting for him to call me back, I was like well let me go sit on the toilet right quick. After a few pushes, I hear a \"clink\" and I was so relieved because I did not want to be one of those dumb ass people that had to go to the hospital because they got something stuck up their butt! When he called me back I told him what happened, everything was safe now, he busted out laughing, I told him it wasn't funny because I was really stressing, he said \"if it was still in there I wouldn't have been laughing\". \n\nLater that day, after he gets off of work, he asked me if any zucchinis have came in, in my garden, I told him no but I have some cucumbers coming in, he said and I quote \"you're not going to lose them are you\"! F*** that a******! I don't use food for that stuff!\n\nTL;DR tifu by going to sleep with a butt plug for about 4 hours. Couldn't find it when I woke up, went to the bathroom and after a few pushes, heard a \"clink\" in the toilet\n\nEdit: I am so elated to receive my first award, the hot dog award!

So my best friend, also girl, lended me her white shirt(she goes to other school). I took it and went to school without trying it. When I tried it, alone in class 5 minutes before photoshooting, I couldn't buckle up few top buttons. I took my messenger camera, filmed how my boobs in bra were outside of shirt(completely), and also zoomed in pretty way too much. I pressed 'send to' and tapped on my best friend's name. As I did that, someone knocked on door. Fast as I could, I randomly threw my phone on desk and started to buckle up. Classmate came and asked me to fix her makeup. 20 minutes later I go to my phone and see 3 new messages.  First was from my best friend, second was from my female TEACHER, she wrote 'wow, wrong person I believe(and hope) so?', and third message was from hot male acquaintance, he wrote 'nice tits damn'. I am absolutely ashamed that I sent my boobs also to my teacher and my acquaintance, told them it was accident, they laughed it off but I believe it's way too much embarrasing. \nTLDR: sent boobs to my teacher and acquaintance, went well",

        "selftext": "So I (F) have a friend called Scott (M). He\u2019s generally very comfortable with me and  the physical contact in our relationships pretty adequate. \n\nNow this happened about 2 weeks ago. I was with him and a bunch of friends at some gig. It was late night and we both had smoked a couple joints before hitting the road. So we\u2019re at the back of  the car wondering how we\u2019ll fit six people in the back. We decide I will sit on top of my other friend Jade. We\u2019re pretty far away from home and the area we\u2019re driving through is a bit sketchy. Also the roads haven\u2019t been done up in years so it\u2019s a pretty long drive (45 mins on average). \n\nI\u2019m sitting ontop of Jade and her legs were starting to hurt so I move onto my other friend and finally Scott. We have 30 mins of our ride left and I\u2019m sort of on the edge of Scott\u2019s knee, so i scoot backwards. Now my ass is kinda on his thigh but nothing crazy. As the road gets bumpier I keep getting tossed around, so I lean back trying to press into the window but there isn\u2019t enough room for me to make the adjustment and I end up right on top of Scott\u2019s dick. I try not to make eye contact and adjust forward but this on top of the bumps in the road make it sort of like a bouncing/grinding motion. Scott asks me to get up for a second so he can adjust his lap but that only makes it worse.\n\nWe sit like this in silence for 10 mins. \n\nAnd oh my god.\n\nI felt it grow...\n\nNow I don\u2019t know if Scott knew I knew he had a semi but he out of the blue asks if he can place his hand anywhere since it\u2019s getting uncomfortable and ends up placing it on my thigh. \n\nOh cherry on top. We\u2019re both soaked from the rain. I mean dripping wet. \n\nNow my back is pressed into his chest and I can feel his breathing a bit more intensely but I hold back a comment. And then the throbbing starts. I can feel Scott\u2019s dick literally throbbing below me. \n\nHe starts shaking his leg and clenching his thigh but I don\u2019t know what that would do considering I am literally on top of him and it\u2019s only making me bounce up and down on it. \n\nAnother 20 mins of sitting like this.\n\nFinally we pull up to our friends house and when we finally get off the first thing I see is him adjust his pants before walking hurriedly inside.\n\nTLDR: Gave a friend an unintentional boner making it the most unusual car ride of my life.\n\nEdit: Gender added.\nEdit: the driver and everyone else was sober, only Scott and I had smoked.",

            "This reminds me of an old army story that happened to me. \n\nMe and a bunch of hold overs down in old fort sill were told to help a bunch of drill sergeants set up and take down the range for their rifle qualifications. So there's 6 of us and we have to cram into the back of a pick up truck the units van was being serviced or some shit thats not important. Anyway we almost manage to fit us all in but there's one female specialist who can't fit and she ends up sitting in another female soldiers lap. The one she was sitting on had a hip problem that's why she was a hold over so mid ride she can't take it anymore and we tell the drill sergeant who told us to just figure it out and the specialist ends up on my lap!\n\n Now I'm not usually so sensitive but I haven't touched a woman beyond a handshake in almost 7 months at that point and ended up getting a rager boner. I was actually really good friends with this specialist to the point where people used to joke that we were secretly dating (we weren't) and it made it even more awkward.\n\n\n Anyway long story short me and her are married now.",

            "Just going to say this right now that unless the guy straight up doesn't like women, he will 100% get a boner if a woman ends up unintentionally grinding/bouncing around on his groin. He doesn't have to be into you, nor does he have to like you. You press the buttons, you get the results. It really is that simple, neither one of you had a FU. It was just an unfortunate situation that was contained very well.",
            "It may be helpful to note that flexing any muscle and holding it for 30 seconds will help deflate a boner by redirecting blood away from said boner.  legs or arms it doesn\u2019t matter.  \u2026 although, if you knew that and he didn\u2019t it would have been a hilariously awkward conversation during the ride.",

Like, I don't know Scott personally,  so I can't say with 100% surety, of course. But any guy I know would want for nothing more than the sweet release of death. \n2.) It happens. A boner is a response to physical stimuli. Doesn't mean anything. Don't read too much into it. \n3.) Scott tried his best. The thigh thing is a technique guys do to get excess blood pumping elsewhere. Scott tried his best to avoid the boner. The man fought and lost.",

        "selftext": "Happened this morning. I'm not a fan of grocery shopping, it's always crowded and chaotic. Usually I go together with my boyfriend so we can get it over with twice as fast.\n\nNow, with the corona virus, they only allow an X amount of people in the store at the same time and they urge you to do your shopping alone and keep 1.5m distance. I decided I'd go by myself this morning, while my boyfriend is off to work (he has an essential job and still has to go every day). \n\nLuckily it wasn't too crowded this morning and I could get inside without waiting. Nevertheless, I wanted to go in and out as quickly as possible. Our supermarket has those hand scanners with which you can scan the products yourself, then after scanning you just have to pay and get out. I really like this because it's a lot faster than waiting in line for the cashier.\n\nInside the supermarket I was getting a little stressed as some people were not keeping their distance as they should be, so I started rushing even more. They had a pretty good sale on wine with 50% off, so I decided to take 2 boxes with me, 6 bottles each. I quickly loaded them onto my cart, grabbed the remaining items I needed and quickly went to the pay desk. Since I had some beer and wine, a lady came over to check my age and after that I could pay and go.\n\nOnce at home I checked the receipt to see if the discount from the wine was calculated correctly, but then I noticed the wine wasn't on the receipt at all! I must have totally forgot to scan it, so I just stole 12 bottles from the supermarket!\n\nI just went to the supermarket again to tell them about my mistake. Both because it didn't feel right and because I didn't want them to find out and put me on a blacklist or something as I go there regularly. The cashier had to laugh at my story and could understand my mistake, she was very happy I came by again to pay anyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Due to the Corona virus I rushed my grocery shopping and forgot to scan 2 boxes of wine, thus ended up leaving without paying for them. Went by the supermarket again to pay this afternoon.",

            "When I was a little kid there was a corner shop about 3 blocks or so away from my house. The owner, who also ran it, gave me a nickle too much in change for some gum I had bought and I didn't realize it until I had walked home. I walked back and was little enough that 3 blocks was a pretty good distance and I had a lot of time to think. At first I was worried that he'd be mad and think I stole the nickle or something but the more I thought about it the more I was certain he'd be impressed that I brought it back. By the time I got there I had built the situation up pretty big in my head and really expected him to make a show of my honesty.\n\nHe just looked at me, took the nickle and walked away without saying anything.",
            "A long time ago at a local supermarket I was, for some long forgotten reason, waiting at the customer service desk. A woman with a cart full of wine bottles (pretty much as many boxes as you could fit in a shopping cart) was complaining to the assistant how she didn't get her loyalty points. So the assistant checked the receipt and noticed most of the bottles weren't scanned nor payed for.  \n\nThis was before self scanning was even a thing, so she probably left the boxes in her cart, handed the cashier one of the bottles and told how many she had (which is an accepted and convenient practice) and likely the cashier misheard (as they tend to talk among each other). So she got very lucky.\n\nAnyway once the assistant mentioned this, our lucky wine lady decided to leave very fast. Right in the arms of the friendly store security guard.\n\nSo moral of the story:  sometime supermarket provide quality entertainment.",

The next day we went back with the bag of chips and he asked me to tell the cashier what had happened and say he wanted to pay for it. I translated but the cashier gave me this disgusted look, then  looked at owner and then started telling me \"I don't like Japanese. Tell him go back Japan, f&#$ off from Thailand!\" The owner gave me a confused look so I actually had to translate it. He once again asked me to apologize and explain he wanted to pay for the chips but the 7-11 cashier continued with his racist rant without pausing. I was a bit in shock so I just kept translating \"He's sorry, it was an honest mistake, he came back because he wants to make it right and pay.\" The owner ended up putting the bag chips back on the shelf and walking out.

She got all mad about it though I am guessing she must have recently got yelled at by her employer for voiding things or making mistakes or something she was trying to rush me out without whoever else was behind the counter seeing and I was thinking if I go back in there and have her ring up a drink I don't have I may get her in trouble. So I left. That was several days ago and it is still bothering my  conscience and I was thinking I should have just offered to put one back and only taken one but not sure why I did not think about that at the time. Good on you OP for going back to the store to pay.\n\nTL;DR Cashier only rang up one drink instead of two made me take the 2nd one free I still feel guilty.\n\n\\*Edited conscious to conscience because the Monster drinks did indeed make me feel conscious again but my conscience is what is bothering me.",

Ironically enough didn't even know she was there till I went to the back and pulled out my yoga mat to start stretching. She was already back there getting ready to leave (atleast it looked like)\n\nBy some miracle I was able to apply some of the breathing techniques so many kind people shared with me and was able to not only have a smooth conversation, I not once felt my anxiety set in till the conversation had actually ended. So thank you again for all of you kind reddit peeps.\n\nShe has my water bottle, she didn't have it with her but she says it's at her apartment (she forgot to put it back in her car after washing it she said). I out right told her sorry about the other day letting her know the mix of my nervousness and post workout exhaustion had my mind completely fried. She apologized again for interrupting my workout and said she should have waited till I left the gym to try and say anything to me on our way out.\n\nWe chatted for a good 10 minutes, mainly small talk about our workout routines, stuff we do outside the gym and a slight bit about our work lives. The conversation went smooth as butter for what I normally dish out. She gave me her phone number so I could reach out to set up a day to meet her at the gym next week to get my water bottle back.\n\nI texted her a solid hour(ish) ago and we've just been chatting ever since. We're going to the local farmers market tomorrow to hang out and get some food. SHE IS GOING TO BRING MY WATER BOTTLE WITH HER!!\n\nNeedless to say, reddit came through. Thank you people. I truly am grateful for your kind words that helped me face anxieties I've dealt with for a few years now. Strangers on the internet aren't all bad and you kind people have been proof of that.\n\nTo clear a few things up off the rip; she offered me her phone number. I didn't go out of my way to \"pick up\" this girl at the gym. I didn't go back there anticipating to make a friend or get a date. My goal was to apologize and retrieve my water bottle as respectfully as possible. \n\nI've made a friend. That's all I know right now. That's enough for me. \n\nTLDR; Made a complete ass of myself at the gym infront of a cute girl, left my water bottle behind and my dignity, decided to confront my insecurities and mistake and turned out making a friend and finding my water bottle to be safe and sound in the process.\n\nIf you've messaged me asking for my breathing techniques; just breath. In through your nose deep, quick exhale through your mouth fast. So many people mentioned me how we forget to breath when anxiety takes over. Paying attention to my breathing the same way I do when running did me wonders.\n\nIf you've messaged me and ask for my gym routine or how to get started my honest answer is to just start. Anywhere. Doesn't matter if it's 10 push ups and a walk around your neighborhood. Just start. There is no glory in what you will be doing. Set small goals and achieve them. Take your small victories and build on them. My actual gym routine is a collaboration of workouts I've stolen from people who were more successful than I at the time. Find influencers that are actively trying to teach you, not show off their personal achievements (yes they exist) Hazzytrainer is a great place to start. He teaches alot about techniques and ways to avoid injury. All of the actual hardwork is done outside the gym. If you're looking to lose weight you MUST be in a calorie deficit. If you're looking to gain weight you must be in a calorie surplus. There are fairly easy and accurate ways to calculate these things. Best of luck.\n\nThank you again to all of you kind people.",

            "I too also have social anxiety and I'm also a total clueless person when it comes to people interaction/ especially girl flirting.  I have a story very similar I'd like to share.\n\nI get coffee from the quick check (convenience store) every morning before work.  One morning there was a cute business lady also getting coffee there and she smiled at me a few times by the coffee table with the creamers but I just remember thinking \"wow what friendly people are in the store this morning\".  Anyways I go to check out in the fast lane and she walked up to the one next to me.  The coffee can be semi tricky to scan because you have to hold it at a slight angle but you can see the red line from the scanner and you just have to match it up on the cup bar code it's not rocket science.   Anyways she looks over at me and says \"can you help me I can't get the coffee to scan?\" .  I was like sure, so I walked over to her register and  noticed her red line on the coffee cup was no where near the bar code and now that I think about it, the bar code wasn't even on that side of the cup.  So I grabbed her cup from her and tilted it around and it beeped right away but during the process she had her hand on my arm semi stroking it which was making me slightly uncomfortable and my anxiety was going up and she keep smiling but I remember thinking \"she's just being super friendly\".  She was also super close the entire time.  I showed her she had the cup angled completely backwards and the bar code needed to be up.  She rolled her eye's and said \"silly me\" and placed her hands directly over mine to get her coffee cup back and I remember thinking that's smart she's being careful not to spill/drop her coffee.   I remember telling her she was all set and quickly proceeding back to my register to finish my coffee check out.  I remember looking over again to see her give me a look of annoyance like \"really??\" and I remember thinking \"I didn't mean to insult her it's just not hard to scan the coffee and that's what I get for trying to help someone I guess\" before leaving the store",

            "Why did OP delete his account?",
            "I used to have the same crippling anxiety when it came to women.  In high school I never spoke to girls, because I thought they were magical creatures who would never want to waste their time with someone like me.  I always saw my negative qualities instead of my positive ones as I am a perfectionist and also did not have any girls or women in my life except for my mom.  As I got older and discovered women can feel the same way with social anxiety and that ALL people are flawed and no one is perfect, I realised that it is okay to be anxious and it is okay to make a mistake.  Other people don't expect us to be perfect.  Even people we are attracted to. \n\nI am so proud of you for having the guts to speak to her again.  I hope your new friendship or relationship or whatever it is gives you some confidence.  Remember you are worthy to speak to her and you sound like a really decent guy.  A word of warning, be sure to focus on building your self-esteem around your good qualities and who you are, and do not become dependent on her or anyone else to feel good about yourself.  What I am trying to say is there is no problem with someone else making you feel positive about things, as long as you don't build your self esteem entirely around them.  I say this based on experience. \n\nContinue to work on strategies that help you cope with anxiety and consider seeing a therapist to work through it.\n\nBest of luck, man!  Keep us updated on how things go for you!",

There is no glory in what you will be doing. **Set small goals and achieve them.**\n\n\nCommenting here to just reinforce this.  The way I started getting in shape was to just do a set of like 10 pushups and thirty crunches.  Easy and attainable.  I then stepped up to 12/35, then 14/40, etc.  I'd do a step up every 4-5 days with a rest day in between.  I added riding my bike daily for about 15 minutes.  I felt healthier and accomplished in no time.  \n\n\nThe worst thing you can do is to be overly ambitious and either hurt yourself or set an unreasonable goal, or even just do too much and make working out an activity that you dread.  Take things very slow.  \n\n\nThis relates to diet too.  Make sensible changes, follow nutrition recommendations.  Fad diets work by starving you - not just calorically but nutritionally as well - they never work. What *does work* is simply cutting *some carbs* while cutting *some fat* while cutting (frankly) *almost all sugar* while intaking about 90% of your calorie needs.  You will not succeed without learning to eat correctly.  Starvation diets will rebound immediately in nearly all cases because they don't teach proper eating habits.  Good eating habits become tolerable very quickly and are sustainable.\n\n\n\nI managed to do modest workout plus a sustainable diet last summer and lost 50 pounds in three months.  What a lot of people don't realize is that it doesn't take crazy exercise or a crazy diet to loose weight.  You need a moderate diet and moderate exercise *together and at the same time, without cheating*.  \n\n\n\nIt is going too far, too quick that leads people to fail at exercise and dieting.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:**  About the diet part, I wanted to add that it is more than just *trying to cut bad stuff*.  It is actually quite scientific.  To learn your calorie needs you use something like [this](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) (better calculators use wrist size to judge body type, but this is what I found with a quick google search).\n\n\nFor nutrition facts (you need to make sure you are getting all critical vitamins and minerals with a restricted calorie count) you'd use something like [this](https://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-food-calorie-counter) Again, this ones kinda clunky and there are better ones out there but it shows calories and there's a button show nutrition facts.  You need to make sure you get the appropriate Vitamin A/B/E, iron, calcium, etc.\n\n\n\nFinally, you try to eat like 90-95% of the calories you need.  By cutting those calories (and making sure you don't starve yourself or make yourself malnutritioned) you will slowly lose weight - but you need some increase in physical activity to really get it going.\n\n\n\n**EDIT 2:**  I feel I have take the diet thing a bit off topic and - I think, at least, sadly too late for a lot of people to see.  I write this last part mostly for a note to make a post in a dieting forum about this.\n\n\n\nSome might see what I describe as \"calorie counting\" - and it is - but that is inevitable.  What isn't inevitable is the idea that calorie counting takes a lot of effort.  \n\n\nI will premise this by saying that your body will like the foods that *it needs*.  What I mean by this, is that any food that is fulfilling the nutritional needs of your body will thus be appetizing to you.  What this means is that while you have to *initially count calories and keep track of nutrition requirements for your diet*, you don't have to do this constantly.\n\n\n\nWhat you do is simple:  You come up with fruits/vegetables/proteins/dairy/(a very limited amount of carbs)/etc. which will allow you to meet nutritional needs while cutting calories.  Notice I didn't include sugars - you will get those with the fruits, mostly.\n\n\n\nYou identify a few different fruits which give you good nutrition and roughly equivalent calories.  You find a few protein sources that are roughly equivalent, you do this with every kind of food category.\n\n\n\nWhat you end up with is maybe 15 specific foods that you eat all day everyday - changing them out when you get sick of something (meaning you switch your 2x daily apple with oranges).  \n\n\n\nThis brings us back to the body deciding what tastes good.  \"Eating only 15 things!  That would get boring in a week\", you say.  The thing is that it won't.  It will taste good because your body is happy.\n\n\n\nThis brings us again back to the simplifying the diet.  You don't have to calculate this stuff out after you figure out the interchangeable food items you can eat to stay on course calorie-wise and again, **no, you won't get sick of 10-15 items of food because your body will crave them**  This is a great way to beat the calorie counting issue with dieting.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reads this at this point, I hope it is helpful.  Feel free to ask any questions.  Moderation and a plan are key to dieting (and exercise, for that matter).",

So many people mentioned me how we forget to breath when anxiety takes over. Paying attention to my breathing the same way I do when running did me wonders.\n\nI feel like I can contribute to this, at least what made it finally \"click\" in my mind. \n\nA couple years ago I did Judo, and one things Judo has is about a million things to practice and get exercise. (Also this particular thing isn't even Judo-specific) So the Sensei has us partner up, grab each others Gis (uniforms) and tells us he's going to yell \"Push\" or \"Pull\" and when he does, we're to try to move our partner accordingly.\n\nThe next minute or two he's yelling \"PUSH!\" and we're pushing each other and then \"PULL!\" and we're pulling each other, trying to move our partner, get them off balance, really straining, etc.\n\nEventually he tells us to stop. By this point I'm just dying, out of breath, would like to slump to the floor, etc. Some of the more advanced students look just fine, and all the other senseis were fine, but that's pretty normal honestly. I didn't question it.\n\nThen he says the magic words that are burned in my mind - \"Again! *But this time, don't hold your breath*\". \n\nHoly shit. I hadn't realized I was holding my breath in the first place. The difference it made was staggering, and suddenly struggling against someone for that same amount of time was much easier. \n\nYet another simple lesson I couldn't simply be told and didn't learn until I was shown. But it stuck, and I'm much better off for it.",

It's just a big thank you to everybody)\n\nI AM ABSOLUTELY BLOWN AWAY by your kindness, your funny stories, and your willingness to take the time to read. You cannot, cannot, cannot know how all of your comments, good and bad, touched me.\n\nThank you for all the awards. I am now wealthy beyond all my hopes. I am having a new room built on to the back of my house so that I can display them.\n\nStill trying to pay the kitty tax. Every day I get a little closer.\n\nA bunch of you have requested chats. I'm looking forward in the next few days to reading up on what they are and how to do them.\n\ud83d\ude18\u2763\ufe0f\u2763\ufe0f\n\nHERE IS WHERE THE ORIGINAL POST STORY BEGINS\n\nA Lot of people don't understand what aging women go through when our bodies begin to betray us in astonishing and confusing ways. I am in my mid 60s. I have not been athletic in any way in at least 20 years. I'm lazy. I don't care. I am not apologizing. I am very much not athletic. No part of me is athletic from my fingertips to my toe tips.\nGiven this true fact I find it almost incomprehensible how I managed to get what I can only describe as athlete's foot in the folds of my upper thighs. Itchy, red for days. And no, dear internet acquaintances, it is not something that I earned through having wild animal sex with the pool boy. I don't even have a pool.\n\n The doctor basically said yeah, it happens. She told me to keep it clean down there and dry too. She gave me an ointment which did seem to help over time and when I ran out of the ointment I bought some antifungal spray which I have a very carefully applied to the tops of both of my legs twice a day. The good news is, it works. The bad news is, I'm an idiot.\n\nLast night after carefully washing the basement of my body, I reached for the spray as I do every night. I carefully covered the delicate middle territory where Queen Ladybits rules, between the top of Leg One and the top of Leg Two so I would not get medicinal spray where it wasn't supposed to be. Just like every night. More regular than bedtime prayers. This is something the kitties know. This is not something highly unusual or fascinating.\n\nLike lonely old ladies everywhere who don't know how to use that swipe left thing and would never ever try to meet a man or even a friend online, I have replaced anything resembling a social life with a number of cats. My cats and I love each other. They are three of the noisiest, most talkative little beasts I have ever known. They yell at me all day long, follow me from room to room, order me to change the cat litter RIGHT NOW AND WE ARE NOT KIDDING OR WE WILL PEE ON YOUR PILLOW , and other fun things. This is just to say that my kitties and I are very close.\n\nHowever, some things are meant to be done alone. Without an audience. Some things are not participatory events. And anyway, me spraying my twattledeedee is a non-event as far as the beasts go.\n\nSo imagine my confusion when I did my nightly spray and all three cats corkscrewed their little faces and gazed at me in adoration. I thought to myself, huh. Sweet but weird.\n\nAnd all of a sudden all three were in my lap nuzzling the moat that surrounds Queen Ladybits, purring loudly and rolling over on their backs to bat at invisible butterflies that seemed to be filling the air around them. I love my kitties, but this was just too... intimate. And weird. They were acting almost like they were stoned----ohhhhhhhhhhhh.\n\n I reached for my spray bottle of antifungal spray, brought it right up to my nearsighted old lady eyes and read the label. I really think that people who manufacture spray bottles need to be more careful not to make antifungal spray bottles look and feel like catnip spray bottles. I mean it just makes sense, right?\n\nYes, new internet friends, I will say it so that you do not have to. Since I was covered down there in catnip spray, of course my pussy was suddenly churning with a lapful of pussies.  \n\nFortunately, it all happened so fast that it did not occur to me to grab my phone and snap a picture so I can prove it later to any doubters when I'm telling my tail, I mean my tale. This is a good thing, because if I had a picture I'm pretty damn sure I would attach it to this post as proof. Because I'm weird. Because I'm one of those weird old ladies with cats instead of human friends. So it's in everybody's best interest to just take my word for it and be relieved that you do not have to see photographic evidence. \n\nTL;DR if you mistake athlete's foot spray for catnip spray, what happens next is your own damn fault.\n\nKITTY TAX http://imgur.com/gallery/wxEzGyr\n\nGahhh!  I THINK IT WORKED! Got them there just without the titles and descriptions. Jack is the big boy. Echolalia is the one with the spot on her nose. Joey is the one with eyes forever.  Now. For the kid who called me a karma whore, which I know is supposed to hurt my feelings but instead made me laugh, do you still need for me to post my birth certificate? Now that I know how to do it?",

            "Yes, darling. It is. Now between now and to the Future, I have some words of advice. First of all, don't waste time vacuuming. Once a month or so wrap your cat, dog, small child, or ex-husband in double-sided tape beginning just below the eyes and ending just below the legs. Because they are so taped, they will not have use of their arms or legs, so it will be easy to lay them on their side and roll them around to pick up all the hair. Secondly, don't believe everything you hear about broccoli. It does not belong in smoothies. Third, spend as much time as you possibly can in a rocking chair on a porch with a really good book. Or a really bad book. If you do not have a rocking chair, borrow one from the neighbor as long as you remember to return it. If you do not have a porch, borrow it from a neighbor. Just don't let them catch you. Fourth, when the police show up at your door or at your neighbor's porch or wherever it is they show up at, do not make direct eye contact. Nod your head quickly at everything they say and thank them repeatedly for straightening things out for you and now you understand and what a wonderful job they are doing. This actually works for traffic tickets too. See you in the future!",

It might capitalize one noun three times and then ignore the capitalization the fourth time. It reminds me of the tweets of a certain ex-president. And then the other final weird thing it does is when I dictate a proper name that is obviously a proper name, like William or Ribbadelta, it briefly capitalizes and then there is a flash and the name then appears without the capital.

So I  would would spray  or dab whatever perfume I was using on pulse points, smell nice and eventually get into bed. The cat  would follow and lick wherever I had put the scent. Cat licks are like wet sandpaper. Repeated cat licks will take off a couple layers of epidermis if you let them.\n\nAnd it wasn't just me. My husband  occasionally wore something like English Leather or Brut and the cat would do the same to him. Husband taught the cat to fly because that was how the cat left the bed when he started on my husband..\n\nCat got his revenge. Husband was asleep with cat curled against his chest ( how adorable) . Husband moved. Cat was startled and  put out all four sets of claws deep into husbands chest . It was a contest who yowled louder.\n\nMe?

A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.\n\ni walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say \"hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed.\" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say \"he doesn't want to be with me anymore\" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say \"best of luck\" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say \"im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed.\" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells \" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!\" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n( now I've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone.

I'll keep all of the content the same, but improve the writing of it, so if something doesn't make much sense, please don't blame me! Here it is...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm keeping any names other than mine out of this for privacy. This story happened roughly 2 hours ago. I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch, and as I was trying to get my lighter to work I heard crying. The front porch to my house is enclosed by a white gate wall. This wall and my front door have little holes in them, which I can see through from the inside, but nobody can see through them from the outside (this helps me catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I look for the crying; it didn't sound like a child, but rather a fully grown woman. I quickly find out who is crying - directly across the street and to the right 1 house I see my neighbor's significant other on her knees, crying. She was either A) beaten up, or B) devastated from something such as a breakup. I heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. I assumed the latter, and wanted to check if she was, at the very least, unharmed. I usually keep my nose out of people's business, but the inner *Captain Save-a-hoe* in me kicked in for some reason. To be honest, I try to look out for my neighbors regardless; my reasoning being that you live next to them so you might as well be social once or twice to figure out if things are going to be chill between you and them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI walk across the street and introduce myself. I have not spoken to these people before because they leave around 6 AM damn near every day, and are never home until almost midnight. They are very quiet and not nosy in any way, so I never attempted to talk to them when an opportunity to do so arose in the past. I say \"Hi, I'm Taylor. I apologize for the intrusion; I just want to make sure you aren't harmed.\" Clearly she was very upset. She could hardly speak clearly and only got out the words, \"He doesn't want to be with me anymore.\" At this point, I'm relieved to know she is fine physically, so I'm ready to say \"Best of luck\" and head home. Not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and it's the neighbor. He starts yelling, \"IS THIS THE MOTHERFUCKER YOU'RE SEEING?\" I think, *How did he come to that conclusion?? If I sort of recognized his face, why can't he recognize mine??* I immediately say, \"I'm your neighbor, I was just trying to make sure she was unharmed.\" But then, the woman FUCKS ME OVER, dragging me into the drama further by yelling, \"Yeah, this is Taylor, and he's way better than you in every way!\" My face turns red out of anger, my eyes are wide and my mouth agape. I say, \"Why the fuck would you say that?\" The dude likely interpreted that as \"Why did you just tell him the truth\", and I'm sure that's how he interpreted that because just as I finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD. I should have seen it coming since he was visibly very angry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I've done time in prison so I am no stranger to fighting. The only reason I mention this is because I want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. I do not call cops, I do not EVER run from a fight. I never ever EVER stick my nose into other people's business, and I broke that rule over a woman crying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am on someone else's property and I get hit. Well, I have cameras outside my house and I know that his house is within full view, so I could have just called the cops and been done with it. But no, this is something I didn't consider at all. Instead, I unloaded on this guy. He was the same size and build, but I was probably in better shape than him, aside from my lungs. This woman that made things worse was now full-blown hysterical; she was wailing and crying louder and harder than before. I kept fighting with my neighbor and he kept fighting back, but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie - soft hands, no calluses. He absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially, but he made a huge mistake, and I did too. The noise from this woman drew the attention of other neighbors - now, I know most of the immediate surrounding ones, except for 2, and guess which neighbors came to investigate? Take a wild fucking guess. The neighbors I don't know, and they're on the phone. ***FUCK........MY........LIFE.*** I decided I'll go home and pull up the recording, so if the police show up I have some sort of defense. After all, I have a record, and things look bad. I'm expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault, you name it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n10 minutes later a patrol car arrives and a cop bangs on my door. I have the recording on my phone so all I do is hand the phone to the officer and let fate decide. I gave my statement in cuffs and was put in the back of the car. For almost 45 minutes I'm thinking, t*his is it, I'm screwed*. Then the magic happened. A second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking. They watch the video I asked them to look at. I know the first officer already saw the video almost right away, so I'm thinking, *yes they believe me and this dude is gonna get it*. Sure enough, they place him in the car and the officer comes over, opens the door for me, says \"Step out,\" unlocks the cuffs, and tells me I'm not under arrest, and that my video saved my ass. Then, they cuff the woman and throw her in the car I was in. I asked why she was getting arrested since she wasn't directly involved in the fight. And then I heard the SCUMMIEST, most absolute piece-of-GARBAGE thing ever. They both, the couple, tried to say I attacked the dude, threatened the woman, and that I was trying to threaten them from calling the police. **WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK**. Just an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. And now, they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. The officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video, but the audio is what made sure I was innocent.

IF I SEE MY NEIGHBOR AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - I saw a female neighbor that I didn't know at all, crying. I went to see if things were fine and it turned into me getting punched by her husband. I was then almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats. Footage from my house's cameras cleared my name and got the couple arrested instead.",

            "A victims life is directly tied to their abuser. The person that is the sole / enormous role in provider of financial , physical and mental support. When that person also abuses you, you\u2019re screwed. They know your secrets, weakness, everything. They can ruin your life in every other way if you try to leave or just to keep you dependent on them. Say your parents think sex is shameful, abusive partner tells them that\u2019s what you guys do. He\u2019s now strained / eliminated that support system. Your friends you had don\u2019t like him and find him bad and so they distance themselves from you. You now how nobody you feel you can go to when he calls you lazy and useless and you\u2019ve decided to put up with it. When you do something \u201cwrong\u201d and he hits you, you hope nobody else notices. Because as your life revolves around this person and maybe you have kids with them the financial and emotional risk is to leave. Making you yourself homeless with no support and also those children if you have them. The way people treat the homeless and being in a bad financial situation is equally as shitty as getting abused the other way by your partner. \n\n\nIf people want domestic abuse victims to leave they need to provide an environment that is equally or more beneficial than the one they are in. \n\nSo instead of moving into a run down muti people cot house where people can steal your kids shoes to sell for drugs or get raped (women rape women, people specifically target women in these circumstances at facilities staff/ men etc. ) the person has to be housed equally to the apartment or house they lost by leaving the abuser. \n\nGive them jobs to financially support themselves. \n\nFood of equal or better quality than they got with the abuser.\n\nMental health counseling, therapy.

            "Fucking hell, OP, I can relate.\n\nI used to work as a bouncer at a pretty rough-and-tumble bar. It was a local hangout for a certain prominent outlaw biker gang, street people, and low end street gangsters. One night this drunk, angry, and generally dysfunctional couple comes in. The guy gets stopped at the door for being too intoxicated, but, for some reason, the dumbass at the door let his girlfriend in.\n\nOne of the bouncers inside (most ineffective guy I\u2019ve ever worked with) tried to kick her out, but she decided to lie on the floor and refused to budge, so they called me over. At this point, the place was still pretty green and I was the only guy with any previous experience and ability to handle myself, so I got pigeonholed into both leading the other guys and doing all the fucked up shit that needed to be done. Yay.\n\nI picked her up gently, dropped her off at the front door, where her drunk ass boyfriend was waiting, and asked them to come back a different night. Instead of exiting gracefully, she took this opportunity to tell her guy that I had been banging her head on the floor inside.\n\nHe was understandably irate (which I don\u2019t blame him for at all), but not violent, so I tried to talk him down, and we were actually making progress, until the same idiot at the front door decided to grab the guy by the shoulder, and he started swinging. For some background info, the front door guy was like the annoying little brother who was always trying to prove himself, but mostly made things worse and put the more qualified guys in unnecessary danger.\n\nI probably should\u2019ve let him get his ass kicked so he\u2019d learn his lesson, but I\u2019m not that kind of guy, for better or worse. As a side note, during my tenure there, I took a lot of hits to the head to stop dumbasses bouncers who were more bark than bite from seriously getting hurt. I\u2019m not really a violent person, but I\u2019m quite large and very strong (and definitely more fearless than is healthy) so I feel that I have a responsibility to use that for good. \n\nAnyway, I threw the drunk guy in a headlock, and dragged him and the other bouncer out of the bar while they were both trying to wail on each other,  and told him calmly, \u201cmate, you can give up now and we can all walk away, or I can choke you out\u201d. He didn\u2019t stop, so I warned him again. He kept going, so I choked him unconscious with carotid pressure.\n\nAs soon as he went limp in my arms, I dropped him. He landed facedown in a massive mud puddle. I didn\u2019t want him to drown, so\nI pulled him out, put him in recovery position, and checked his ABCs. When he started coming to, I noped the fuck out of that situation and went back inside.\n\nHis best friend (who wasn\u2019t shitfaced) later approached me, and told me that he saw the whole thing. I told him that I don\u2019t blame the guy (aside from choosing not to stop fighting after he was clearly beaten) and honestly felt bad for him because I would\u2019ve been fighting mad if I were in his shoes, and asked him to tell his friend what really happened the next day. It floors me that the girlfriend told him something that, at minimum, made a ridiculous scene (and very well could\u2019ve gotten him seriously hurt!) because her pride was injured.\n\nHow callous and shallow people are in that industry is a serious factor in why I finally left it to pursue a professional career full time (a different kind of callous and shallow, as I would later find out lol). Sometimes trying to do the right thing only fucks you over (especially when bad people are involved). I get that bad people have their reasons for acting the way they do, but that doesn\u2019t make unnecessarily hurting others (especially those they \u201ccare\u201d about) excusable.",

They are powder kegs waiting to go off at the slightest spark. \n\nIn college I had two friends who learned this the hard way. They were sitting out on one of their porches when they heard this terrible fight in the parking lot between the woman next door and her boyfriend. The boyfriend grabbed her and started beating her. \n\nMy friends decided they would not stand for that and one of them, a big, strapping linebacker/body builder type who worked as a bouncer grabbed the guy and told him to stop hitting women. \n\nThe woman lost her shit at that point, grabbing a shovel and taking a swing at the linebacker friend who had pinned down the guy who had been beating her savagely. \n\nFriend number two saw this and grabbed the woman before she bashed linebacker up side the head with the shovel. Her adrenaline kicked in and she began hitting friend 2 (a normal sized healthy guy). \n\nBoyfriend saw someone besides himself beating on his girlfriend and then his fight or flight response kicked in to \u201cfight\u201d mode. Then he dialed it up to 11. \n\nNow linebacker friend was engaged in a dangerous fight with the boyfriend while friend 2 was trying not to get himself brained by the damsel in distress with the shovel. \n\nSoon the cops showed up in force, broke it up and sorted out the mess. Both boyfriend and woman wound up going for a ride to county lockup, and the police thanked my friends for trying to help out but told them to never, ever, ever get involved in a domestic dispute again. \n\nCall 9-1-1 and let the cops handle it. \n\nEven if you think he\u2019s about to kill her, don\u2019t get involved.

No, not those sort of photos you filthy minded swine!  It did, however, require copious amounts of eye bleach.\n\n\nSetting the scene, I (36M at the time) and my older sibling (41F) were working through our recently-deceased mother's (74F) possessions in order to clear her house.  We stumbled upon her Kindle during our room cleanups, and my sister came out with the fatal line:\n\n\n \"Awww, she used to love reading.  I know she's bought tonnes of books from Amazon over the years.  I wonder what she's read recently?\"\n\n \nBlithely, I opened up my mother's Kindle library and, well...  \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Oum9A9E.jpg\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1yHvKbe.jpg\n\nFor those who can't be bothered to open the photos, they are a small sample of the titles she had purchased.  I snapped these photos in a moment of insanity but felt the need to keep some sort of evidence.\n\n\"Diapered for Pay\" and \"Breeding my Sleeping Wife\" are particular gems, however \"Hot Cooking Spanker\" takes on a new dimension when you consider her former occupation as a chef.\n\nSuffice to say, the expression on my face made my sister grab it out of my hands.  Turning bright red, she muttered \"I knew I shouldn't have introduced her to 50 Shades\".\n\nTLDR:  Found deceased mother's Kindle.  Discovered her late-life sexual awakening.  Not enough mental and eye bleach in the world sufficient.\n\nEdited to add a couple of points:  Thank you for the awards, and thank you also for those pointing out the This American Life piece on https://www.thisamericanlife.org/689/digging-up-the-bones/act-two-4.  I'm thinking of tracking this guy down and starting a support group.\n\nThat is not me - today is the first day I've heard of that site, in fact.  I'll grant our stories are similar, although this was direct on my mother's Kindle and not via a shared account.  I am also British like the chap in the story, which is why this evokes a level of cringe beyond what you might normally expect.  We - and certainly folk of that generation - do not discuss sex, as a rule.\n\nLastly, I fully appreciate that yes, my mother had sex like any other person.  It's more the somewhat unusual choice of... \"content consumption\" at her advanced age which was slightly eyebrow raising.  Still, if it got her pulse racing, good for her.",

Normally, I'm very tame, but because I really missed him during that week, I thought I'd send him a sexy pic while he was on the bus home. The picture was me, with one of my legs bent all the way up to my head, with my heel at the back of my head. There was a red bow around my dick, and my asshole was gaping open.\n\nIt wasn't until he came home and I, after an hour of being weirded out by his lack of commenting, asked what he thought, that I realized what I'd done. Checked the messages, and saw who it was for.\n\n\"I am so sorry, sir. That was meant for my boyfriend.\"\n\n\"You're gay?\"\n\nHighest IQ moment of my life. The asshole told everyone at work - and there are over two hundred people at the firm, and I'm in charge of eighty of them. Went to work today, and was met with cold, dead eyes wherever I went. One of the girls working there is forbidding me from talking to her boyfriend (a handyman to whom I HAVE to talk) because she's afraid I'll seduce him.\n\nMy boss asked me to take some pics of a machine so he could see what was broken. As I was leaving, he added, \"No bows, please.\"\n\nTLDR: Sent my boss a nude pic, exposed my asshole, and exposed myself as gay. You know, as a kid, you always dream of that magical moment when you come out. This ain't it.\n\nEDIT: Well, since this blew up, I'm giving a short update. My boss DIDN'T out me. His wife, who also works at the firm, heard him laughing at the pic after I sent it, and saw it when she came to investigate. She's the one who told everyone. I'm in the clear as far as getting into legal trouble goes, but a guy did practically run out of the bathroom today when I walked in.\n\nAs for the girl who thinks I'll seduce her boyfriend....

        "selftext": "Obligatory throwaway account and this happened last weekend, but I'm only discovering the total impact today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy sister's wedding was last weekend. During a hurricane/tropical storm thing. I haven't lived in my hometown for several years, so hurricane/tropical storm survival skills are a little rusty.\n\nMy best friend drove, as I had flown in for the event and didn't rent a car. As we are about to leave, I remember that my lipstick is in the house, and in case they want to do pictures at the reception or after the ceremony, I need to be prepared. I run back in the house, grab my lipstick, run back down the driveway, and open the door to my friend's car.\n\nIn the .3 seconds that I stopped to open the door, my legs suddenly felt like they were ON FIRE. So when the door opens, I'm screaming \"I'm on fire!!!\" and my best friend looks totally befuddled as there is no evidence of anything burning. 3 seconds later, I realize I have been swarmed by fire ants.\n\nFire ants. In my shoes. In my clothes. In my hair. In the car. Hundreds of them. My best friend and I are frantically trying to get these ants off of me and out of the car. I run back in the house, and rinse my feet off in the bathtub. My feet are starting to swell. Throw on a pair of slip on casual shoes because my now-swelling feet won't fit in the shoes I brought to wear to the wedding. Get to the wedding, 10 minutes late, with whelps erupting all over my feet, legs and fingers. Found an ant crawling on my arm in the church.\n\nNow, you know how when you've been itching all over you start to itch in places that shouldn't be itching? Like a phantom itch? Ok, so, I had an itch in my crotch during the wedding and reception. Yeast infection? No. Probably just a phantom itch because my entire body is itching from the 45 or so bites. Or so I thought...\n\nA couple days later, I return home and me and the hubs have sexy time. He says \"you ok? things felt kind of... hard?\" I made some joke about getting old... well...\n\nDuring my shower, I also realize things are.... hard. I intrepidly take a very graphic selfie to investigate.\n\nFire ant bites. On my inner labia.\n\nThere is no WebMD entry for how to treat fire ant bites on genitalia.\n\nTLDR: Went to sister's wedding, came home a firecrotch. Fire ants swarm during heavy rain, kiddos.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : RIP my inbox. Some items to clarify:\n\n1. Bites are healing. Even THOSE bites.\n2. Regarding attending a wedding in a pandemic - all of the venues limited the number of guests to under 50, even outdoors. The church holds 1100 people-- so all of us basically had a pew to ourselves during the ceremony. The reception venue holds 200 - only 40 or so people attended. Half of the attendees stayed in one section of the venue watching football on a big screen TV. Again, limited contact. And masks and sanitizer were available throughout the venues for people that didn't bring their own.\n3. Yeah, I know, weddings are the new super spreader events and the decision to attend was not made lightly. I did spend all day Saturday before the wedding with my dad, helping him get ready, watching football, and going through his old high school yearbooks reminiscing about his friends and his memories. His wish was to have all of us together for a happy event one last time, COVID be damned. He gets tested approximately once a month as well. So far, he's still negative.\n4. Fire ants form \"ant rafts\" in water as they try to escape their flooded mounds during heavy rain. Car was in the driveway. Ants had aggregated in a puddle next to the car, and that is what I stepped in.\n5. Yes, I know \"whelps\" are puppies. However, my very southern dad has called \"welts\" \"whelps\" my whole life-- force of habit. I'm keeping it. ",

            "I like that you called them whelps and not welts.",
            "One time as a kid I was playing with the hose, I liked to flood the yard in a dirt section and then play in the mud. My mom didn't care as long as I wasn't wearing good clothes and hosed myself off good before I went in. My property is an 1 1/2 acres, so I couldn't reach most areas with the hose we had. Well we got an extension for the hose one day and I decided \"there's an even bigger dirt area back further, I'm gonna make an even bigger mud puddle to play in!\" I was excited. I turn on the hose and begin flailing around in the dirt so that I can turn it into the perfect creamy mud... the kind you can use as a slip and slide. I start feeling pinching but ignore it, it's probably just some rocks in my new mud spot that I'm scaping my skin on, my old mud spot was picked clean of rocks because they're not fun to slide on, I'd do the same to this one. And then all of a sudden it gets 1,000x worse. By the time I realized what was happening I was completely covered in a swarm of ants. I screamed at the top of my lungs. My brother must have heard and sprinted from the house, told me to get away from there, and then put the hose on the painful jet setting and fired at point blank range, he power washed the ants off of me while I cried.\n\nIdk what type of ants these were, I live in NY. They were redish, but they weren't the normal itty-bitty red ones I normally see, yet nowhere near as big as carpenter ants. It looked kinda like the reddish-black of a fire ant... but I don't think we have fire ants here.\n\nEither way I never played in that \"mud area\" again.\n\nEdit: After some quick research I think they were field ants, and I think they were spraying me with their acid, since when they bit they'd then curl up and point their little ant butts towards me. Nowhere near as painful as fire ants I'm sure, but quite painful for a 6 year old when there were so many I could barely see my leg and arm skin through the sea of ants. I like ants though! I want to get into keeping ants actually, I'm just careful not to drown giant colonies of them now.",

My mother runs out (yes, it was the \u201880s and we were often outside for hours unattended), sees me rolling around on the ground in agony. Scoops me up, runs as fast as the Quiksilver, strips me down and throws me into the shower scrubbing ants that had gotten into every place they could. She took me too the hospital after all the ants were eliminated and I was swelling up. Turns out, a few more minutes the doctor noted I probably could have died (I wasn\u2019t allergic, but so many of them swarmed me, it was overwhelming my body).

I realized after an embarrassing amount of time later that I had leaned up against a tree that had a hole in it filled with fire ants. I promptly moved my chair about 25 feet away, then took my shirt off and shook it out for several minutes, while brushing the small army of them off of me. I didn't have access to enough water for me to hop into, so I just had to kill them all off or brush them off of me. I was very mad at myself for doing that.\n\nAnd honestly, the worst part wasn't even the bites. I can deal with pain and itchiness.

            "STORY TIME! \n\nIn my early 20s I had the luxury of living at what was basically an RV resort. I loved it. I essentially only had neighbors for 2 months out of the year. I was in an amazing area with 3 intersecting rivers and lots of nature trails. I'd had a lot on my mind and decided to go sit by the smallest of the rivers in a more secluded area. I was there reading for maybe 30 minutes when I felt something on my leg. \n\nSURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER, ITS TEXAS AND WE HAVE FIRE ANTS! \n\nAs I frantically swat it away I feel something else on my lower back. To my horror I realize i had fire ants in my pants. Up the legs and down the back. \n\nI begin to panic.  (Thankfully I'd actually worn underwear this day!) I'm swatting and slapping myself like some redneck version of stomp the yard. Realizing that I am in danger and my funky dance was not helping I begin running back towards my RV. The pain is getting worse and my legs are on fire. \nDid I mention I'm allergic to ant bites? Cause I am. \n\nMy panic ever growing, I am now running as fast as my little legs will carry me. I realize I need to get my pants off asap! I'm running and stripping at the same time. I have my pants half way down when the maintenance guy sees me running. He wide eyed asks me if I'm ok. I scream FIRE ANTS and continue my mad dash. I'm maybe another half mile from the RV and I finally have my pants and shoes off. I'm now running through the resort half naked, still swatting at myself. I make it home and jump in the shower. I had bites everywhere. I had to go to the ER because my lips were tingling and my legs were 3x bigger than they should be. Shortly after getting home I find my pants (washed and dried) and my shoes in a bag by my door, hanging from the awning with a note from maintenance.  \"Hope you are ok. Washed your britches.

I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I'm going to change the name of my job and the people I'm speaking of.)*\n\nUD: \"Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?\"\n\nMe: \"It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.\"\n\nUD: \"Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah man. I get you.\"\n\nUD: \"I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm glad to hear that. What is his name?\"\n\nUD: \"My boy Frank.\"\n\nMe: \"Frank...Gallagher?\"\n\nUD: \"Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.\"\n\nMe: \"Um..When was the last time you talked to him?\"\n\nUD: \"Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I'm going to hit him up soon.\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.\"\n\nUD: \".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.\"\n\nMe: \"I've been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.\"\n\nUD: \"No, he didn't. I'm going to call him right now because I'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.\"\n\n**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**\n\nUD: \"He probably didn't pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha\"\n\nMe: \"Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.\"\n\nUD: \"He wasn't some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...\"\n\nMe: \"or early 50's? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I've ever trained. He died, man. I'm really sorry you found out like this.\"\n\n**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**\n\nUD: \"I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry...I don't know what to say\" *looks at the clock on my phone*\n\nUD: \"He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40's bruh.*\n\nHe eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.\n\n**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together. \n \n**Edit** name and grammar\n\n**UPDATE** This has really blown up. I didn't expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages I received that say \"Kill Yourself asshole\" or \"Scum for doing that to a person\".

            "Well, a lot of people in here are upset in general, but I just wanted to chime in to say that this wasn't a fuckup in my view. Frank's friend may be grieving but it's good that you told him the truth instead of lying to him, even if it was uncomfortable. Playing along like Frank was still alive only to have the driver find out later he was always dead would have been the choice of most of us socially awkward seals, but you bit the bullet and told him a hard truth. Maybe he'll realize he needs to seize the day while he's still alive. If you stay in contact with the guy, maybe he could become more of a friend than Frank ever was. Either way, death can only be a harmful subject if we never confront it, living in the false belief that it could never happen to us. ",

I worked in the drawing office, and there were quite a few guys there who had worked for the firm for 25+ years.\n\nThey were clearing out a store room, and discovered a ton of candles, torches and portable heaters that had been bought during the fuel crisis in 1973.\n\nOne of the old guys said \"I bet old Dave ordered that lot and forgot about it, he was always doing stuff like that.\" Then the others started chipping in stories about old Dave, who, it seemed was the rather eccentric caretaker: he would sit on the floor to drink tea from a tin mug; he would whistle the same tune all the time, silly stuff. It also turned out that old Dave was my grandfather; I had been told he had worked for the firm years before.\n\nI mentioned this and everyone got interested.

All he did was let the driver know that his friend had passed away, and wanted to be sure that the driver knew.  What would have been the better way to do that?  Lie about it? Tell him \"oh you're probably right, were probably talking about two different Franks.  Your friend is most likely just fine and doing well!\"  Damn everyone in this thread is so quick to jump all over OP for basically no reason at all.  Obviously it was an awkward situation that OP wasn't prepared for, and I doubt most of you would have handled it any better.  Nothing that OP said indicated he enjoyed being insensitive or enjoyed contributing to the Uber driver's sadness.  Everyone here needs to calm the fuck down.

He explained it was a friend's grandmother who he sometimes would visit when he was in the area but the last time had been a few years ago.\n\nI looked up the number and could see it had been cancelled about 8 or so months prior. The reason given in the system was \"death\". I was so struck I went silent and I could tell he got nervous. I could tell he cared about the dead lady, he had meant to call in advance and ask if he could visit. I didn't know if it would be better or worse for him to get the news from a random stranger on the phone. I also wasn't quite sure if I could legally dispend information like that.\n\nI ended up deciding that he shouldn't hear it from me. Whether that was to spare him or because of my cowardice I don't know.\nI told him the number wasn't active, that it had been cancelled last February. He asked if there was any reason added and I could tell he got suspicious, his voice got quiet. I didn't say anything and he said that she'd had a surgery scheduled in February so maybe that went south. I asked him if he still had contact to the family, and that if he did he should really call them. He thanked me for my help and said he would call her son. I think that if he hadn't had anyone to call then I would've told him. He deserved to know.\n\nAfter that call I immediately took a short break, I had to regain composure. I asked my colleague how he would've handled the situation and he said that he would've told him. I took a lot of difficult calls in that job but I'll never forget that one.",

He and I were like brothers through high school. I stopped talking to him because he was getting heavier into drugs and I wanted to walk away from that lifestyle. He died riding passenger in a car driven by a drunk driver. He was 20 years old.\n\nI was going to go to the funeral, but I remembered a conversation he and I had where he said he didn't want anyone to be sad that he was gone.

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.\n\nBackground filler:\n\n\n(I graduated law school in December 2007 and passed the bar exam in February 2008.  I kept my BarBri materials as I was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state I was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)\n\nThe Story:\n\n\nOur son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  He was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  One night I had enough and decided to find the most boring thing I could, so I pulled out my Barbri Book on Contracts and started reading it.  He was fascinated and demanded I read more and more.  He'd ask questions, like any good Dad I answered.  So I was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  \n\nFast forward to Kindergarten.  He got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did X and Y.  Well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  This did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  She had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  He would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  He will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  And if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   When they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  \n\nThis eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  Only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  He started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. He knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   We eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  \n\nIt culminated in Third Grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  This time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  So then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   Who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.\n\nNow that this happened, we had to also see the Principal to discuss this.  She is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  So it is now put in his Education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  \n\nTLDR: I taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  When he got to school he used these skills to play adults. \n\nEdit: *When I say put a stop to it I mean the outbursts when adults don't meet their obligations in his eyes. The principal encourages him to talk out solutions and to find compromise. \n\nEdit 2: **Clarified the time line and added context. ",

            "Not quite at this level, but I had a discussion with my dad when I was about 6-7 about why businesses were where they were, and houses were where they were, etc, and of course he tells me about residential zoning and business districts and a bunch of other things of that type.

That the other children are either not developed enough to detect the dishonesty, or too timid to speak out against it, should not excuse dishonesty.\n\nAt the very least, being dishonest with the kids is sending several subtle messages to the kids on subjects such as \"teachers (authority figures) cannot be trusted\", etc.",

To you and I as adults they matter, but it's a new word regardless.  If they here it over and over, and learn it's meaning, that's the word that matters.  \n\nAnnectodal: My son 4 year old knows more complex words because we never dumbed down speech and if he's interested in something it's likely to stick. That's how they can remember weird character names and skill sets.  Ask a 4 year old about their favorite anything and they'll know more background then you can imagine.  This kid chose to be fasinated with the power of agreement.\n\nThe story shows a slow escalation.  His dad is presumably still a lawyer and his kid has constantly re isited this and Dad says he explains stuff to his son.\n\n6-6.5 years with a mentor in contract law with practice on teachers and kids.   That is reasonable to learn the skill.  I can't play soccer or draw as well as some 9 year olds but I've never put in the time or was passionate.\n\nJust because you can't do it, doesn't mean a kid can't...and this is not in a court, this is with a layman and kids.

            "My kids don't know contract law but they're both high functioning autistic. This means they're very literal and logical, add in my younger son has basically an eidetic memory. They often will do similar things. One of the things I noticed is that oftentimes adults not used to this will engage them when they start trying to negotiate thinking they can out smart the boys. Well that rarely works because the adult's assumption is that the negotiation is the beginning of a tantrum and it's not so they underestimate the reasoning skills of my kids. It's actually quite frustrating because it's an easy fix. Stop the negotiation before it starts. I told my kids that sometimes adults have to make calls that are for the good of everyone involved and sometimes yes, it's not fair. I try to be fair but in reality that's an impossible standard, besides the world isn't fair and they need to know that. If they start trying to negotiate about something or I know they will try I simply tell them, \"this is not up for debate.\" They get frustrated but because I don't over use it and because they've actually changed my mind on some of my outdated policies this system seems to work. I'd say try it OP. My boys have done this since they were very small so I feel your pain.\n\nOn the other hand I'm very cautious about when I promise them something because my younger one's strength is recalling exactly what I said and when I said it. The older one will then come in all logical and calm and further hold me to my words. This ends up being that I'm way more vague than most parents probably but it's a self preservation tactic.",

Nobody in the family is anything close to a lawyer, and no legal training has bee. given.  \n\nSo, this is completely plausible.  10-15 year olds are graduating college and getting PHDs, so nothing too crazy here.  I would even argue most kids are capable of this but not given the chance or even actively denied chances.  Allowing a kid to watch sponge bob because you want to scroll through facebook instead of playing a game or reading a book or building with blocks/lincoln logs/tinker toys is a disservice to the kid and robbing them of the chance to develop and show off their brilliance.",

        "selftext": "This actually happened today, typing this up on my lunch break while the kiddos are napping.\n\nBackground: I am a male teacher that works at a preschool attached to a church. I am not religious.\n\nThis morning, I saw one of my male students hit a girl. I pulled him aside and explained to him why he shouldn't hit anyone, but especially not girls because he's a boy. \n\nHe asked, \"Why especially not girls? Does that mean I can hit boys and not get in trouble?\"\n\nBeing that we are attached to a church, and because I honestly didn't have a better answer on hand, I thought it would be safe to reply: \"No, you need to always keep your hands to yourself but God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them, not hurt them.\" \n\nGoddammit, I was wrong. Big mistake.\n\nThe little boy seemed to have an \"a-ha!\" moment in his head, as the idea clicked in his mind. \"OK, I won't hit girls. I will be strong and protect them.\" he says. After a few more minutes of time out, and apparently mulling over the mildly misogynistic thought I just inadvertently planted in his head, I allowed him to go back and play.\n\nImmediately, I knew I had fucked up.\n\n\"DID YOU KNOW THAT BOYS ARE STRONGER THAN GIRLS?!\" \n\nHe's running around the room telling everyone with ears that boys are stronger than girls, quickly earning the ire of the girls in the class. \n\nNow, mind you, this is a stage of development where most of the girls in the class are actually bigger than the boys. The tallest of which immediately claps back at him, \"Nuh-uh! I'm bigger than all the boys in here, and I'm stronger too!\" \n\nHe says \"It doesn't matter! Mr. Soprano just told me that God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them. Right, Mr. Soprano?\"\n\nI literally facepalmed. I weakly tried to walk it back, saying, \"Well some girls ARE stronger than boys but we should really just all keep our hands--OH MY GOD!\" I was interrupted by the girl screaming \"ATTTAAAAACK!!!\" as she punched the boy square in the stomach, and all of the girls stanced up to fight all of the boys 1v1. It was madness! I could see seething hatred oozing from the eyes of the girls, they were bloodthirsty after their strength was questioned. One girl started pretending to use force lightning on a boy. \n\nI got them to settle down, and had talks with all of them about keeping our hands to ourselves and not hitting ANYONE regardless of gender. I still heard bickering under their breath of which sex was the strongest, but I at least ended the violence. Crisis averted.\n\nAnyhow, that's how (TL;DR) I mistakenly created a mini-misogynist and caused a feminist uprising in my preschool class by telling a boy that boys shouldn't hit girls because \"God made boys stronger\". Oof. Let's hope they forget it all happened completely after nap time.",

I live in a high rise building (19th floor) and recently ordered a pair of binoculars as I am going on a trip with some friends and thought it would be nice to have them just in case. Well the binoculars got delivered today and I decided to try them out. I was on my balcony looking at some other high rise buildings nearby when I ACCIDENTALLY looked inside an apartment at the building right across me (around 150-200ft away) and saw a naked middle aged woman who I think just got out of the shower (no idea why her blinds were open). Unfortunately, she saw me looking at her with the binoculars and ran into another room. I panicked as well and ran inside and closed my blinds. And now I\u2019m just sitting here and hoping no one knocks on my door. I don\u2019t even know how I will explain myself and if anyone will believe me.\n\nTL;DR got caught looking at my naked neighbour with binoculars and now I\u2019m shitting myself.\n\nUpdate: So I left my apartment the day it happened for several hours and came back pretty late. There was a knock on my door yesterday and I obviously freaked out and was expecting to get yelled at but luckily it was just an Amazon driver delivering a package. It\u2019s been over two days now and nothing has happened so I think I\u2019m good.",

        "selftext": "This happened today during dinner time. And I still have all that adrenaline in me so I decided to share it here to help myself calm down.\n\nSome background context before the fucked up. Me (25yrs), my wife (24yrs) and my son (6mths) are staying with my parents. My son has recently started on solid foods(pur\u00e9ed) and he enjoys it. Also, his motor skills has been developing much faster than most babies his age. So, many time we just let him be, thinking he'll be fine.\n\nMoving on to the fuck up. During dinners my son would usually join us in his high chair eating his baby bites (biscuit for baby). It was the same tonight just that he was asking for more this time. So we decided giving him apples might be a good idea since he likes the pur\u00e9ed version. My mom then proceeds to cut a slice of apple (normal adult sized slice). We then feed him the apple, letting him suck on it. Then my wife asked my mom to cut smaller so that he can eat it. My mom replied saying that she's worried that if it's too small he might end up breaking it with his gum and choke himself. But in the end we somehow got my mom to cut it into smaller bite size.\n\nSo, we just continued our dinner while talking about what to do if a baby does get choke, heimlich maneuver, CPR... Basically topic around those area. Then we hear a tiny apple crunch. He was still happily eating, so we continue chatting and eating. But shortly after my wife shouted for me saying he's really choking. I turned and saw my son's face turing red-purple-ish, no sound was coming out of him. I instantly shot up from my chair removed him from his high chair and tried to perform the heimlich maneuver for babies, basically mimicking from a vague memory of what I saw on YouTube years ago. And then he cough and started crying. This was the first time that I'm glad to hear my son's cry. \n\nNow I'm having a slight headache from all that adrenaline rush. But I'm glad my son is alive and kicking. Thanks to that random YouTube video I watch years ago.\n\nEdit 1: my wife saw this post and she corrected 1 of my mistake. It was actually my sister who suggested to cut the apple into smaller slices. We just didn't disagree with the idea.\n\nEdit 2: OMG... This really blew up I posted this before going to work (I work night shift), it was only about 100+ up votes before I left for work and I could still keep up with all the comments. While I was at work, I kept receiving notifications... Then I saw 2k up votes... And now 20k... I never thought my first post on r/TIFU would get 20k up votes and thousand over comments and all those awards. Really want to thank everyone for your concern. My son is fine, actively crawling around\n\nEdit 3: I saw some comments about CPR certification. I served the military for 2 years. So I was trained to do CPR. But on adults. Not babies. I only knew about it cos I spend way too much time on YouTube.\n\nEdit 4: just saw many comments about led weaning. We are doing this. Usually we would mesh bananas, sweet potatoes, saute apples, It's just this one time that we decided it's fine to let him suck on the apple and some how ending up letting him eat it... Horrible mistake which we will never forget.\n\nEdit 5: I realized I might have used the term \"heimlich maneuver\" wrongly what should I call it tho? Heimlich for babies maneuver?... What I did was holding my son face down at about, legs slightly higher up and I slap/thrust/pat(?) I think it was more like a pat/slap. I was panicking and everything I did was base on my vague memory of a video from youtube... In the moment I was more like do whatever possible to save my son.\n\nTL;DR we fed my 6 months old son some apple causing him to choke. I performed the heimlich maneuver for babies base on a vague memory of a YouTube video to save him.",

My CPR certification has run out, so my info is a little old, but about 5 years ago I went through a pretty in depth course (~5 months) that spent a bit on choking babies. Basically, this is true of anyone who requires heimlich/other choking maneuvers, but particularly for babies. Any time choking happens there can be throat damage, and the maneuvers to resolve it can cause issues with the lungs or other internal organs. Unlikely your son has issues, but definitely worth a visit.",

            "Just a general FYI. Never, ever feed toddlers and small children hot dogs that have not been split lengthwise. A hot dog is the same size as a child's trachea. Splitting it ensures that it does not block the trachea in case if choking. Hot dogs are the most common food they choke on.",

            "My daughter was born with pyloric stenosis (basically the valve above her stomach was closed) so after she ate a bottle, within a few minutes she was projectile vomiting. Every. Time. One day, she didn't get it all out apparently. After cleaning her up I laid her in her bassinet in the bedroom and went to clean the mess in the other room. Randomly I felt something was wrong n went to check on her. She looked like she was gasping for air but there was no noise. She was choking on vomit. I grabbed her up and tried hitting her back - nothing. Laid her over my knee and continued hitting her back - still nothing. I started freaking out and called 911. I literally flipped her upside down, holding her by her legs and kept smacking her back while trying to explain to the person on the phone what was happening... She started crying, so did I. The lady on the phone still sent the paramedics because (I'm honestly not sure how long this was going on but it felt like an eternity) she said she could've been without oxygen for a long time. Thank God they came, because that was when we discovered it was pyloric stenosis causing the vomiting and that she had actually gotten very little to no nourishment in her entire 3 months out of womb. Much longer and she would have died. Choking actually saved her life. \nWhen things like that happen, some super-human strength (physical AND mental) seem to take over. She's 10 years old now and loves to hear the story of when \"Mommy saved my life\" lol no matter how many times I tell her I was just doing my job",

I used to be a nanny and one day I was holding the baby (he was probably about 12-13 months at the time) and standing next to his mom while she was talking to a visitor. She was mindlessly giving him small pieces of bread while she talked and at one point I told her that she might want to slow down because it looked like he was pouching it in his cheek. Whether she heard me or not, she keep going. About 2 minutes later the baby starts choking. I have been trained in CPR/First Aid in the past and I guess that just took over because I immediately flipped him over and started doing back thrusts to try and clear his airway. I did it about 3 times before he vomited all over the floor and started crying. I wanted to cry right along with him once the adrenaline started to wear off and I really processed what had happened.

And just a few weeks ago she choked on little cereal flakes I gave her, because rather than chew one at a time like she was, she crammed four to five in there at once when my back was turned and thought chewing was optional. \n\nEveryone around me letting their kids the same age have whole slices of cheese, potato chips, cucumber slices....and then there's mine, who chokes on the most basic things.

In this situation things worked out, and I'm really glad that they did. But everyone should check out some videos on what to do if some kind of emergency happens, choking, seizure, how to handle different types of fires, stuff like that. You hope that you never end up needing the information, but if something does happen, you'll be better prepared. You may not remember everything from the videos perfectly, but you're likely to remember some parts of it and that could make the difference. This is a good post to point out to look up the proper technique to use on a child, if the situation is about a person. Child technique usually differs from adult technique because of how small and breakable they are, so you have to be a lot more gentle.\n\nAgain, really happy that things worked out for you all.

It was the scariest moment. Thank goodness my mom was there because even though I\u2019ve taken her out of the high chair a million times, I fumbled and couldn\u2019t get her out. My mom pulled her out and we gave her some back blows. The apple flew out. She\u2019s 3 now and I still get nervous with her eating apples. It took a good 2 years after that for me to let her eat apples again. So glad baby is ok.",

            "You can contact your local Red Cross and take classes for CPR/Heimlich for babies to adults. It helps to actually take the class, so you know when to do something, and when to do nothing. My oldest daughter choked on jello in a restaurant (among other things at other times), and my youngest son ate a chunk out of a toy, and both needed the upside down back slaps. Both survived, and I think I would have worried more if I wasn\u2019t CPR certified. Also, my son had a seizure as an infant, and being certified helped with that a lot. Take the class, it will help immensely.",

            "PSA: triple check the label before feeding babies any store bought snacks. My daughter choked on a freeze dried yogurt drop because we misread the label and fed her one a few months too early. Those early months make a HUGE difference in what they\u2019re able to process and swallow. The freeze dried snack got stuck in her throat, and same thing, no air, started turning purple. I was able to open her mouth, see the obstruction, and swipe it out. Heimlich was next but thankfully didn\u2019t need it. We are both trained in CPR for babies, so attend a CPR class and read those labels closely.",
            "As someone who was the choking child once basic first aid and cpr training is sooo important for parents. I choked on a hard caramel candy when I was maybe 3 or 4 and it felt like a damn lifetime before I could breathe again. I remember my mom and gma on the phone with the doctors office (I think because paramedics never showed up so I don\u2019t think they called 911) and I remember the lady on the phone saying (because the tips she was giving wasn\u2019t moving it) \u201cok, now this is the scary part, but she might pass out.

            "My eldest daughter was given food she shouldn't have been given on her first thanksgiving. I had voiced my concerns and was ignored. She choked. I had to scoop her up and do the baby heimlich, which is just holding them upside down and slamming on their back. It worked, but I was still pissed. My daughters life was jeopardized over something inconsequential. \n\nThere was another time she was playing by herself in the living room while I was working in the kitchen. Her mom mentioned she didnt look right and thought she was choking. Inran over and opened her mouth and could see a white toy key lodged in her throat. Had to reach in and pull it out for her. Scary as hell, but she was fine. \n\nMy second child is much more into food than her sister. She has choked I don't know how many times.\n\n While I was pissed about the thanksgiving thing, and terrified about they key, the fact of the matter is that it's pretty normal for kids to choke on shit. There's a good reason it takes so long to raise a child. \n\nI dont blame OP one bit for the feelings of guilt and shame, but op should know, if it wasnt the apple, it probably would have been something else. I'm glad op got to experience this, despite the terror associated with it, since it's good practice and likely won't be the last time it needs to be dealt with.",

            "So scary! I am glad your son is okay! We did self feeding with my daughter (2nd child) and something that really helped was the mesh bag attached to a little handle....i can't remember what they are called but it looks like a little ring pop handle, big enough for the baby to grip, and it has a little mesh pouch so they can chew and crunch and but but the fruit or veggies stay in the little baggy.

If you didn't do this you need to bring em in to ensure your adrenaline strength didn't damage something inadvertantly. Probably best to have the doc look anyhow.\n\nActually the Heimlich has somewhat fallen out of favor in medical training (mine advocated for backblows and Heimlich in rotation).

        "selftext": "This happened today. About 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.\n\nI just started a new job about a month ago. It's a quiet office environment. I only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.\n\nOne of the things I love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. This morning I thought a bagel sounded nice so I went to go toast one up. This is where the FU begins. \n\nI separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. I've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a \"bagel\" setting. I figured it wouldn't hurt so I punched it and waited. \n\nWhile I stood there my mind began to drift. I started thinking about Lord of the Rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. I heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.\n\nThen the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. I took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. Warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. I started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. My brain was still in fantasy mode though, and I said to myself in full-on Smeagol voice, \"Oooh yes! We likes it! Gives it to us golden and crispy!\"\n\nAt this point, my rational brain kicked back in and I realized how fucking weird I can be sometimes. Oh well, no big deal. I take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like I just arrived from another planet. I tried to give a polite smile, but I'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness I was experiencing made that creepy too. I shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before \"the new guy\" is rebranded as \"the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself.\" Shit.\n\nTL;DR Talked like Smeagol while buttering my bagel and was overhead by my new coworkers.

        "selftext": "So obligatory this happened yesterday but I\u2019m still traumatised as I\u2019ve never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.\n\nSo let me set the scene first. I live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in Europe that has a good amount of nature patches. The people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. The location of this FU was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. Anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in Europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.\n\nI was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as I was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. Picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that\u2019s me. Suddenly, I bump my head into a rock - or so I initially thought. I look up. It was the largest man I\u2019ve ever seen - about the size of the mountain from GOT. He looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let\u2019s call him ARNIE). I was startled for a second before I see his buddy (let\u2019s call him SLY) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. \u201cOi, watch where you are going\u201d I bellow (jk, obviously Arnie did). So being super alpha and dominant I mumble \u201cSorry\u201d and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. \u201cI mean how the f\\*\\*\\* was I meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other.\u201d I think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. And oh boy that worked - somewhat. What happened next I could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. Hey, I mean even with the current AI technology I doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.\n\nI see the chestnut flying Roberto Carlos style towards the junction (hell, I heard the crowd roaring) and IMO it probably even broke the sound barrier. While the chestnut was still in flight I raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. And I\u2019m talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-Susan from middle-school hand raise (no, Susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).\n\nSuddenly everything kept coming down.\n\nThe chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. Remember how I said they had nature patches in the city? Well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.\n\nYou guessed it, despite almost 40\u00b0C there was a puddle the size of a small American town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. His breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. Behind him, a red car doesn\u2019t manage to break in time but does a Fast and the Furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. Then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car\u2019s path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. By a miracle of God (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. Yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. What followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.\n\nAnd then a split second of silence.\n\nUntil I hear a majestic roaring that Simba would be proud of: \u201cDUUUUUUUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!!!\u201d, yup Arnie and Sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. They start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let\u2019s call him Miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a Cyberman.\n\nAt that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. My future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. I was not going to make it a single night in prison.\n\nSuddenly the commotion starts - picture a Real Madrid vs Barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. I\u2019ve never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their Super Saiyan form on me while I was still trying to flee Miyagi\u2019s claws (I know, statistically not all of them could have been Super Saiyans but still). What I haven\u2019t mentioned yet is that I actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive Europe - yeiy). Throughout I just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by Arnie, Sly, and Miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.\n\nAfter about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. I think Sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only I could see and pointed into his direction. I am no fighter but I took one class of Wing Chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. \u2019trap the dragon\u2019s head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites\u2019. As Sly got down to his last finger I do the Kung Fu twist with my arm, break Miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards Sly. For a split second I thought I\u2019d run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, I was impressed). And then the sprint of a lifetime started. I was Powell, Bolt, and Blake at the same time. I ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). Luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind Arnie and Sly cause they figured I\u2019d never get past them, so I didn\u2019t actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. I see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought I was somehow involved) so I kept running and I had a good 100 m head start. I was just in front of my apartment block when I had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way I would show them where I lived, so I ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until I reached a park to lie down. I was pretty sure that I lost most people when I passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but I had to be sure.\n\nI cool down and call my neighbour who\u2019s flat looks down on the junction. I told her the whole story (she\u2019s a super old family friend) and she couldn\u2019t believe I was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). Turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren\u2019t harmed either. According to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.\n\nSomething I didn\u2019t realise from my POV was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn\u2019t drive\u2026 and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. His insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).\n\nI haven\u2019t left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that I made frozen pizza, and I promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.\n\ntl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running\n\nEDIT: Submitted this around midnight and went to bed to wake up to a blowing up inbox. Thanks guys. Also thank you so much for the gold. I put somewhere in the comments that excessive humour is my coping mechanism to deal with things. I apologise if that style really wasn't your jam and will work on semantics for the future. If you did enjoy it, you're welcome - we probably could make great friends in RL. And yes English is not my mother tongue, and I lived all around so that's why my units of space and mass are very all over the place. ",

I open it up and chrome is open on reddit with her signed in. I know IATA here but I was curious and honestly hoping to find some nudes that we could use later to try and spice things up(idiot). \n\nA little backstory. I am an individual with serious mental health challenges and lately my depression has gotten the better of me and was sucking the life out of my wife. She has told me as much. I never thought I would be winning husband of the year awards but I genuinely love my wife and would do anything for her. I'm probably letting myself of too easy. Anyways in December my wife tells me that she can't handle it anymore and I need to get my stuff together or we're done. I have given every effort possible since then, multiple counselling sessions a week, changes in medicine, changes in careers and feel like I've made solid progress.\n\nBack to my fuckup, I see her profile and notice the most recent post was really highly liked (3k+) and even given an award, Cool! Then I read it. I won't go into specifics because some degenerate will track the post down but needless to say it paints me very negatively. She describes me with very harsh language and this was all brought on by a fight we had that I will admit was not my finest moment. I get upset after reading the first couple of lines and give up, close out of the browser and prepped for my presentation. Later that night my wife notices that I'm upset and asks me what is wrong. I try to avoid the confrontation because we had been doing so well but she persists and I brake down. I tell her that I saw her post and that I was sorry, I had no right to look at her account. I told her I wasn't angry at her for making the post but it did really hurt and killed any self-confidence I had left. In a credit to our couples therapy we talked it out like adults and she even read me the post in full and said that was it. We make up and all is well not good but atleast ok.\n\nAs I'm laying in there in bed something is nagging at me. Something about the way she kept saying that was it made me feel like she was hiding something and lying to me. So I get up and go to the living room and Fuck up again by looking her post up and finding her account. I read for hours, she only had one other post about me but it was fairly generic deadbeat husbands asks me to make breakfast on my morning off(I'm working on not doing shit like that now sorry honey). Then I look at her comments. I get why she lied and said the one post was it, she was protecting my feelings. She hates me. She doesn't think counselling will work. She's just biding her time to kick me out. I am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities. She doesn't enjoy our sex life and feels like it ranges from a forced chore to pathetic and boring.\n\nI plan to talk to her about it. I know I am the asshole in this for reading her shit. This is the love of my life and mother of my children. I have destroyed everything good in my life. Its over. I have no chance to save it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Borrowed my wife's laptop and found her reddit account. She hates me.",

            "Not quite the same as you, but I came across this Quora post that may help you (I went through a similar thing as the Quora chap). Here\u2019s what he wrote, and I\u2019ll put a link in to it..\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhen I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other\u2019s company. She was from Japan I am white american.\n\nI learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us.\n\nThey say that people change and you grow apart. I don\u2019t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she did something nice for me, I would do something nice for her. Or if I did something nice for her, she would do something nice for me.\n\nThat all sounds fine and dandy, but I think in practice, it doesn\u2019t work. When I do something nice for her, I expect something of equal niceness in return. However, often is the case that you don\u2019t perceive what is done in return is as valuable as what you gave him or her. So the next time you do something, you feel less inclined to do something as nice. And so the love kind of fizzles.\n\nYou basically stop caring because you perceive your partner as not caring. And chances are your partner feels the same way about you. Neither person has changed. They are both the same person, but the love isn\u2019t there anymore. They let it spiral into nothingness.\n\nThat is what my wife and I did. After 20 some odd years of marriage, there was nothing. I really had no desire to do anything for my wife, because she wasn\u2019t going to do anything for me. We didn\u2019t hate each other. We helped each other when needed, but that is about all.\n\nI was unhappy with the marriage. I either wanted out or I wanted it fixed. But after 20 years of marriage, I knew that she wasn\u2019t going to try and fix the marriage. I knew that she thought I would not change so why should she have to do anything special and if I did change, it would only be temporary and things would go back to how they were, so why even try. I knew this would be her mind set.\n\nSo I had 3 options. Divorce, stay in the lifeless, sexless marriage, or take a chance and do something about it.\n\nI thought perhaps divorce would be the better way. Start anew. She had given up on me and didn\u2019t care.\n\nBut I decided to give it a try anyway. I completely revamped my approach. I decided that I would try for one year to fix this. I would not require her to do anything. I would just do these things on my own. If these things wooed her back then she would be back on her own terms and not mine.\n\nSo I did the following.\n\nI committed to get into shape\u2026 better diet, exercise\nI committed to do something special for her everyday regardless of whether we were getting along or not.\nI committed to do at least an additional 30 minutes of house work every day.\nI committed to pay her a sincere compliment at least once per day.\nI committed not to fight with her and to only have calm arguments with her.\nI decided to fix her dinner and breakfast as often as possible.\nIn essence I decided to love her every day.\nAs I thought, I got essentially no response from her day after day. I mean she would sometimes say thank you, but that was about it. After about four months she started to change. I kept at it. She continued to change. Ok.. she didn\u2019t change. She was the same person, but she saw that I was trying. She saw that she was important to me. She saw that I wasn\u2019t giving up. She wanted to be loved.\n\nShe started doing things for me again. We started talking a lot more and doing a lot more together. We started dating again and going on trips. It was almost like we were newly weds again, but with less passion, but it felt great. Sometimes I would just hold her in my arms for 30 minutes.\n\nLove can be revived. It is not easy. True love takes work. Making the decision above to love her regardless was the second best decision of my life. The first of course was to marry her. Our marriage is not perfect, but I look forward to seeing her every day. She is an awesome woman. She is basically the same person I married. We just let our love die. We were lazy lovers. She asked me one day what got into me and I talked with her about my plan. I think it was a pretty good plan and so did she. And yes, we are still married, but much more happily now.\n\nI knew our love couldn\u2019t be one sided, but I also knew it needed to start somewhere and why not me. Ask yourself, why not you? Do you want the love back? what kind of sacrifice are you willing to make to have the love back? If I had decided that she needed to do something while I was doing something, then we would have been right back to where we started. You can\u2019t base your actions on what the other is doing in return. You need to commit to love regardless of what is done in return. That is the sacrifice and that is where real love will begin.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOP - You can still sort this out. \n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-caused-you-to-fall-out-of-love-with-your-past-lover/answers/100414629?ch=17&oid=100414629&share=51f73df4&srid=uefxG&target_type=answer](https://www.quora.com/What-caused-you-to-fall-out-of-love-with-your-past-lover/answers/100414629?ch=17&oid=100414629&share=51f73df4&srid=uefxG&target_type=answer)",
            "There are two possibilities here, OP. Either she really hates you, and at least now you know, or she was just blowing off steam to relieve what you yourself admit is the considerable stress she\u2019s been under. Either way, you both might want to skip Reddit and make an emergency appointment with your couples counselor. You don\u2019t know for a fact that your marriage is over (and even if it is, your life is NOT), but you\u2019re not gonna find out here.",
            "The trouble with being a shitty partner for years is it really kills any love or romantic feelings for the other person. My ex husband treated me like shit and basically thought I wasn't ever going to leave. His attitude killed any love I may have had for him. By the time he realised it was far too late. Bad treatment builds up and never really leaves the effected person, you can fix it early on but the longer it happens its slowly eroded the relationship and there's no going back.",
            "On one hand... don\u2019t underestimate the catharsis of being very cruel about someone behind their back, without identifying details, in a medium you assume will never get back to them. It\u2019s a vent, a way to let go of pent-up rage. It is possible that venting online is the way she deals with her frustration towards you, giving her the patience and calm to actually deal with you in real life.  \n\nOn the other hand, you may have to ask yourself some real questions about your life, your finances, and how you\u2019re gonna go at it on your own. I\u2019d say, get your shit together *in preparation* for when/if she kicks you out. You may, in the process, become a better person who has some kind of plan for their life and a handle on their mental health. And who knows, that may actually regain her respect. \n\nBut don\u2019t do it for her. Leaving or staying is her choice, and this kind of sustained disrespect for your person would be hard to heal from in the best of circumstances. Do it because the person you are now is clearly not someone you want to be.",
            "Just like your wife isn't/wasn't likely to find expert advice on Reddit, neither are you. Some people here are saying your relationship is over, but they can't honestly know that.\n\nYou mentioned you're going into counselling. Is this together with your wife? You also mentioned she wouldn't want to do couple counselling. Are these her words? If they are, I would still try to talk about it to her. If she really doesn't want to, then atleast you can have a honest conversation about it. Otherwise, it reads like it would do you both good. If you can find a good EFT (emotional focused therapy) therapist near you, that could be a good start for you both.\n\nGood luck!",

            "What husband thinks \"oh dear I hope my wife posted nudes on the internet\"?",
            "Bad interactions with a spouse isn't permanent. Have good communication and ensure that she really understands you are trying to change and that a lot of that has to do with your love for her. Talk to her about what she's feeling and try not to take everything too personally. Her feelings may be brought on by good reasons but it doesn't mean you have to \"have your self confidence shattered.\" Feeling sorry about your actions doesn't mean you have to feel sorry for yourself or shit on yourself. Everything emotional here is fixable. You need to communicate, frequently, your feelings in kind ways, and ask her to do the same. It seems like you have trouble communicating because of your lack of self-worth and self-concept. Work to not give in to the void so much, buddy. I'm sure therapy can help that, but you need to be choosing to be positive as well and not be feeding negative thought processes. A lot of this post is desperately feeding negative self-beliefs. It got worse as you went on. Your life is not shattered, there are just some changes that need to be made on both sides, and you both need to talk about what you need and WHY without insulting each other.\n\nP.S. A bad sex life can change too - fuckin communicate!\n\nEdit: see a lot of people on here saying just cut and run, there's no coming back from this or that you're not the kind of person that should be in a relationship. I'm not intimately aware of your situation but in most situations I would say that is bad advice and deeply unemotive. A partner can seriously help you work through personal issues and keep you accountable to goals. Depression is fed by loneliness - the void. You just need to do work for your relationship with your wife to be one in which you can both grow. This is possible.",
            "You were hoping to find nudes you haven't seen before on your wife's laptop to \"spice\" things up??",
            "Hey man, if she was protecting your feelings she doesn't hate you. She might have a lot of anger and resentment built up towards you, and her thinking that counseling won't work is probably more about her wanting to protect herself from getting her hopes up and being disappointed. Also, you looked into her private comments that she probably uses to help vent and deal with her feelings. Sometimes we say things out of anger because it's cathartic, and not because it's fully reflective of our actual feelings.\n\nYou need to TALK TO HER, like an adult, not with accusations or anger but just to get to the root of what's wrong with your marriage. And prepare yourself for the reality that it may take her a while to be able to see you in a more positive light again, even if you do everything right from here on out. There's also the possibility she may never be able to fully see you that way again, but you'd be surprised what a marriage can come back from.\n\nDon't spin out, don't fall apart, keep going to counseling and therapy and doing what you need to do to be a better partner to her, and most of all communicate with her and really try to hear what she's saying. I'm going through something similar with my girlfriend - shit - I guess technically my ex right now. Fuck, that hurt a little to realize. It's all pretty new and still evolving. But all I can tell you is not to give up, and it may take time.",

I relate to this so hard because I know the frustration of feeling like you can\u2019t control your own emotions and snap out of it even as it negatively affects your relationships and friendships. And when you\u2019re in this state of mind it can be so easy to focus on holding on to what you think are the things keeping you grounded (your wife and kids) to the point where you idealize them. Don\u2019t forget that you are your own person, outside of your family. You have value in this world. And depression is not the only thing that defines who you are.\n\nI\u2019m not married but I know marriage takes work and there will be ups and downs. But both of you have to decide if you want to continue to work through it. Love is not enough. As hard as it is to think of others when your own feelings are so low, you have to remain present and active with your family. Do new things together so you\u2019ll have new things to talk about. Go on weekly date nights. Do the chores your wife normally does instead. The first step is the hardest, but if you can take that one step, you can eventually take another, and then another. I live by \u201ca journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d And it\u2019s something I think of often every time I feel as though everything is shit and I can\u2019t go on.

            "Hi OP, I'm in your wife's position rn.\n\nHear me out here: it's rough. It's really really *really* rough being partner to someone with severe mental health issues. It strains you every moment of every day, you lose sleep, you're constantly walking on eggshells, and you're always stressed out.\n\nI hate my boyfriend sometimes, I catch myself daydreaming sometimes about being single, about having a different partner, etc. I write these thoughts in a journal and we have an explicit agreement that this is my dark place, he doesn't see what's in it because it's where I put my most angry, vile, and pissed thoughts and feelings.\n\nI think reddit may be your wife's journal. That's not great, as it's public, but I can understand it.\n\nTalk honestly with her about this, ask how often she feels like she wants to leave you: is it every now and then or is it constant? Because we have moments of weakness as caretakers. We get pissed and hateful sometimes, but we try our best to take it out of us in ways that won't hurt anyone.\n\nIf she's really serious about leaving, it's okay, it's going to be rough as hell, but not everyone is cut out to be in a relationship with someone that is working on themselves. If it does happen use the time to work on yourself and let your treatments help you, maybe one day you guys can rekindle.",
            "Hey, I'm an internet stranger, but I can only share my anecdotal experience. \n\nI have not gone through what you're experiencing from the it being on the internet side of things. But in a similar way I've gone through it from word of mouth.\n\nI was dating a girl that was the love of my life, for almost a decade. Mental health and putting myself down ended up with me burning out at a job that literally had nowhere up for me to go anymore and I wasn't even earning what I was giving that company. She literally bottled it in, and tried to comfort and support me and help me change meds or make doctors appointments and it got dark for us both.\n\nShe went from a partner to my caretaker, and I just shut things out and worked to make money as if that's all the value I could provide was. There was a few other things, but nothing major or of consequence.\n\nOne day, she came to me and she broke down and said she loved me but couldn't do it. She wanted to break up. Something in my head clicked, I knew I couldn't lose her, but it had already happened and I recognized how hard it was for her to do that. I comforted her in it, with a strength I didn't know I had because I could barely be my own person. I told her I understood and I supported her decision.\n\nI moved out a bit later, and left my job, moved back to my parents. Typical \"ah, shit, I'm a loser\" story.\n\nI have a couple close friends that are close to her and I know she didn't tell everyone, but she needed to vent to a couple people and it was hard to talk to them when they knew her side and I didn't know what she had said.\n\nI didn't beg for her back, didn't ask them to tell me anything other than if it was ok, please let me know she's ok.\n\nFast forward, I started really figuring my own shit out. I got new doctors, new meds and I was more cautious about that stuff, changed careers, and we met up as friends a couple times in the process.\n\nIt took owning up to it, willing to do better, and actually doing better and we eventually did reconnect and have been together since. Life throws shit at you sometimes, and we've had some worse shit happen since but we're stronger than ever because we face those things together now and instead of fighting each other we fight problems.\n\nIt's not going to be the same for everyone, but sometimes a break to look at yourself in the mirror and work to do better is the best you can do. I hope things work out for you, no matter what happens.",

We each have our own flaws of course, but you over look those minor things for someone you care so deeply for.  \n\n\nWithin our first 2 months of living in the home, I could feel things were off.  My wife seemed, distant?  I went out of my way to tell her how incredible she was in my life.  She smiled and thanked me, but it didn't feel genuine? When you've been with someone nearly a decade straight, you know when something isn't right. Continued being cautious of my wife's emotions for the next couple weeks until I discovered something. At the time I couldn't comprehend what I was reading.  \n\n\nThe thing is, my wife isn't a redditor.  I didn't discover some post online, her emails, or go snooping through her phone.  I found a hidden diary with pages upon pages upon pages of how much my wife hated me.  She wrote so many specific details about me that shocked me to my core.  It was as if I was living one reality, and hers was an absolute nightmare.  Literally describing every me as a worthless human being, and she couldn't handle it anymore.  To add even further insult to my self esteem, there were many entries describing her longing for her coworker.  She had been secretly talking to him for over two years, and yearned to be with this man. How she was much more sexually compatible, desired him, and loved seeing him every day of the week. Those words are seared into my soul.  \n\n\nIt took hours to read everything. I decided what would be best was to do exactly as you posted above OP, I confronted her, apologized, and said I'd do my best to change for her. In that moment, a light switched on for her.  She realized she was finally free.  The words she had wanted to say to me for years were finally out in the open.  She had a nuclear meltdown, and I honestly can say that wasn't my wife that was screaming.  Just some person I didn't know but was in love with.   \n\n\nShe left two days later, and is still with this man.  They quit their jobs and traveled the country together.  I've been alone since.  \n\n\nIt's been one year since.  Don't be scared to move forward alone.  You'll find strength in yourself you never knew.  I'm sorry about everything that has happened to you.  You have a few choices to make that are not easy.  Good luck, internet stranger.",

            "What someone says right after an argument or unleashes online after a period of bottling up their emotions can be way more harsh than the reality. It was never intended to be seen by the subject so it can be played up, dramatized. Validation from random strangers who share your POV can be euphoric. \n\nMaybe there's more evidence that she truly does hate you but i would wait to hear it from her mouth. Rather than draw a final conclusion from what is the equivalent of a emotional diary page she shared with some people online whom didn't have the full context. Either way I'm sure it hurt and I feel for you.",

            "So I am a big supporter of mental health. However it sounds like you do a thing many guys do\u2026 I see you seeing how she affects you. But I didn\u2019t hear much empathy for her or an attempt at genuinely understanding her POV. In my life, guys aren\u2019t taught empathy the same way as women. I heard a lot of \u201cshe\u2019s felt x and that affected me and I feel like a POS\u201d but no \u201cI think maybe she feels x and I should try to better understand her\u201d \n\nYou have a victim mentality. You\u2019re focused on how all of this affects you. How is what you doing affecting your wife? You sound like you\u2019re taking responsibility by being self deprecating, but from this bit of information it feels like you\u2019re not taking responsibility. Being self deprecating is still making things about yourself and still making you a victim. \n\nI\u2019d start with trying to have empathy for her feelings and try to genuinely understand her. Listen to what she says. Actively listen. Often times women will literally say what they want and men don\u2019t take them seriously. She said she would love breakfast on your day off some days. Have you tried that? It will probably take lots of time to make a difference so don\u2019t expect immediate results. But give it some months and see what happens. Then also, she doesn\u2019t like your sex life. Well, many women need to feel appreciated in the relationship to enjoy sex. \n\nStop thinking about what kind of person you are and take some action. \nYou need to get rid of this victim mindset and stop self deprecating and try some genuine self reflection and self work. \n\nI\u2019m not a therapist so take what I say how you will, but this is what I\u2019d say to any friend of mine.",

            "OP. With all due respect, as someone who has mental health issues, and has dated someone else with mental health issues, and has had a relationship ruined by the bad interplay of that person's issues with mine, you need to stop and chill out for a second.\n\n1) Consider the negative tone of your post, and the emotional place that's coming from. You are using a lot of superlatives, a lot of sweeping generalisations, a lot of assumptions about your wife's feelings about you, and a lot of language that assigns blame solely to you. I'm not going to say that any statement in particular is wrong, because only you and your wife are really in a position to evaluate that, but I want you to come back to this later, take a deep breath, and pretend someone else wrote it. Are these conclusions totally rational, or are they extrapolations? Are they fair to you? To your wife? Or was the purpose of this post to vent emotions and fears rather than to examine reality as it is? Are you spiralling right now, conflating fear and reality?\n\n2) Consider, after doing the above, that your wife may have been in that same scared, emotional place as you when she wrote those posts. Maybe she was posting her worst fears and most repressed emotions, just as you are. Maybe she is even ashamed of making those posts - hence why she didn't bring the first one up even as you two were talking about the other one. \n\n3) Lastly, I do want you to address the worst case scenario that maybe your wife could possibly harbor secret resentment for you, but do it impartially and without attributing blame to yourself. Is it really fair to say this is your fault if she's hidden these concerns from you and from your couples therapist? Why should you be responsible for things she has not given you the chance to address? How can she expect to fix things with you if she refuses to admit that she actually believes they're unfixable? Therapy only works if you believe it can work. If this really is how she feels (see above, I'm not sure it is, but again, worst case scenario) it's on her to deal with it at this point, or at least to be straight up with you and be honest about how she feels. You can only work with the info you're given.",

Accept that neither if you is perfect and look to the future.\n\nMake a conscious decision to be positive, forgiving and loving even if you don't feel like it.\n\nStart again, find the things you like doing and do them together.

            "Definitely not great to look through her reddit posts but I don't need to tell you that.\n\nBut I want to give you my perspective on this because I am in a similar situation with reversed roles. My partner has mental health issues too and was in a kinda good place when we met. He was doing well when we moved together and then at some point a lot of misfortunes happened and covid and he's been really struggling. His depression got the better of him and he's had a really tough time. Our relationship struggled a lot too. That's a tough situation for both parties involved. So quite similar to your situation.\n\nBUT never ever would I have turned to reddit and talked that way about my partner. At this point you have two okay options, break up and leave which is totally fine if you can't handle it or you do your best to support your partner. And that means no judgement, lots and lots of communication and work. That's a commitment and a big thing to do. As I said totally fine if someone isn't up to it. But it's your choice to stay with your partner and support them so don't blame them if things don't work out directly.\n\nIt's a long and hard process and you definitely have to change your expectations and sometimes just be the bigger person and do more work or accept that your partner is struggling and can't do everything. Yeah it's annoying when you have to do the majority of the household and it's okay to be frustrated but it leads nowhere if you blame your partner. You just can't expect them to do that all the time.\nIf the disease would be purely physical you wouldn't expect that either and get mad if your partner just lacks the energy some days. And your partner will have bad days too and maybe act wrong of say something wrong. But then you have to talk about it and communicate your feelings. A relationship is a partnership. You are two people who work as a team. When one part of the team can't do something the other one helps out. That's how it should be.\n\nYour disease, and that's what it is, is not your fault and you are not at fault for the symptoms of it. You seemed to do the best you could and try really hard and that's the most anyone can expect from you. Your partner should be proud of the progress you made and not be mad about what you couldn't do yet. You can't just magically cure that and accomplish everything. It's fine to fail sometimes and to be weak or frustrated. In the end you are the one who suffers the most from it.\n\nAnd yeah, either you can do this as a partner or you don't, totally fine but it's never your right to judge your partner for that. If you can't take it then be fair and leave. OP this is not your fault. You seem like a great person who does his best and deserves the support your partner should offer you. Keep on working on yourself and getting back to be in a good place. Please talk to a professional about this so you don't get pulled down. Your wife made a ton of mistakes and should have either long left or communicated a lot more. And even then she has no right to ever talk about you like that. You don't deserve that at all. We are not ourselves when we are sick and what we can't accomplish then is not our fault. You didn't destroy anything at all. Your wife did by talking about you like that and discussing those issues with anyone but you.\n\nI really hope you can find a way out of that and realise that you are a good person and it's not your fault for being sick. All the best for you!",

Even if you think you\u2019re a worthless pile of sh*t, you\u2019re still a human being that used to be just some little boy running around having fun. You\u2019re not fundamentally bad or broken or anything. Don\u2019t trust the self-sabotaging lies that your mind comes up with. Everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves. Take that chance.

If you think it's a good and doable thing then, just say: \"Babe, you're right.  I need to be better.  I'm going to be better.  You're the most important thing to me and I do anything for you.\"  \n\nDon't look back and just go for it.\n\nThere's a lot of details I don't know.  From a certain perspective I've been a worthless bum for some fairly long stretches of my marriage.  I can acknowledge that.  However my wife has also generally encouraged me, supported me, and most of all was patient and committed.  \n\nIf you have genuinely been a loser lately then stop it!  I know there are so many things that I don't know but it doesn't sound like she's been exhibiting very relationship healthy behavior lately herself.  \n\nI'm not sure my marriage would have survived with a different woman.  \n\nI was married before.   My prior wife was kind of mean.  In the end I learned she ultimately didn't care how I feel.  That was never a priority for her. \n\nMy new wife cares about how I feel.  That makes all the difference.  I think she's more concerned about trajectory than how fast we get there.  \n\nHer feelings and needs come first to me, and my feelings and needs come first her.  That's why it works.   Sometimes that's really difficult.  I have learned what it takes and I understand what it could take in the future.  Regardless of what may come I'm committed to her true needs as a higher priority than my own.  I'm sure as long as she has that same commitment I'll always have love and appreciation for one another.\n\nI hope you get some helpful wisdom from your post.

Mental health is tough and you both deserve credit IMO - you for making your best efforts to improve yourself, and her for trying to wait until you're in a better place before making a move that she feels is in her best interest. You're trying to improve yourself for her, and she's making a personal sacrifice for you. Now don't strain yourself patting yourself on the back, because going through someone's accounts is a serious breach of privacy, BUT she should be communicating more and not letting things build up and airing her dirty laundry online. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't be too hard on yourself and be with someone who makes you happy, not dependent.

Try to get your own mental health under control and find more ways to reinforce your value to yourself.  Building your own self esteem will build your confidence and help you find success.

I seriously thought that he was in big trouble because the paramedics were treating him like he was having a severe heart attack. He looked like he was on the verge of dying as they loaded him up. \n\nAnyway, afterwards my other manager tells us all to go home. It was Labor Day so there weren\u2019t that many people working. I go home and am freaking out, nervous as hell until my manager called me and told me my boss was stable but it was close. \u201cCome in tomorrow for work at 10am we need to have a discussion\u201d\n\nAt this point I\u2019m double freaking out because I\u2019m thinking \u201cshit I\u2019m going to get fired over a stupid ass spider prank.\u201d\n\nI get into work at about 950 and I make the dreaded trip up to my desk. At this point everyone in the office knew I basically killed our boss and literally everyone stopped to stare at me. I just kinda tried to keep my head down as I was thoroughly embarrassed. \n\nI got to my cubicle and my manager was already standing there, \u201cdon\u2019t put your stuff away this will take just a moment.\u201d \n\nHe takes me to my bosses office. Which I thought he was going to ask what the spider on the fishing line was doing there and then, after I answered, fire me. \n\nDoor was already open and after I walk in my manager tells me to take a seat and then he closes the door after I step in (he stayed out).\n\nI sat down, pretty much sweating out of my clothes and all the sudden, to add insult to injury, my boss sneaks up behind me and yells \u201cTHOUGHT I WAS DEAD HUH!!!\u201d \n\nWell at that point I basically shit my pants frightened like a little girl seeing a monster in the closet. He claps me on the back and I turn around. The fucker is wearing no shoes and was hiding behind the door to creep up behind me.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m both relieved, terrified, and just generally shook. And he sits down and tells me how he did it.\n\nApparently the manager (my buddy from last post) that let me in early on Labor Day told him about my entire plan. My boss knew about the spider and pretty much planned around my move\n\nThe fucker literally let a bunch of workers have a half day to foil my prank and got his EMT buddy to make a quick stop by to \u201ctreat his heart attack.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m never pranking my boss again. On a good note I\u2019m not fired\n\nTl;dr had a juicy prank for my boss, he faked a heart attack, let half the workers have a 1/2 day, scared the shit out of me by coming back to life, and now I\u2019m not fired and never pranking again.\n\n\nEdit: wow had no idea this was going to become popular.

        "selftext": "This happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this TIFU. Burner because reasons.\n\nAfter taking a break from smoking for a few months, I decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge I bought a while ago and let the good times roll. I\u2019ve been hitting it the past few days, and each time I get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and I don\u2019t know when to stop hitting it.\n\nI was on Facebook yesterday morning when I was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. The top comment on it was \u201che pasta way,\u201d and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.\n\nLater that night, I was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food I had brought back with me from home (I\u2019m a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). One of the containers was a tortellini salad, and I noticed it had a \u201csell by\u201d date of four days before. I was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. I had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.\n\nA few hours later, the high times have come and I\u2019m hitting my vape pen. After watching a Rodney Dangerfield classic, I go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden I start feeling a sense of doom. I start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. \n\nAt the same time, all I could see in my head was \u201che pasta way\u201d and started thinking that I was an almost 23-year-old college senior and I ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. I suddenly realized that I never saw the guy\u2019s name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. Shortly thereafter the EMT side of me takes over, checks that I have a pulse when I\u2019ve pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and I basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure I\u2019m alive. I fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.\n\nTL;DR got so high I thought I had seen my own death before it happened",

About 15 min later I was getting a ride to my friends house from my DD for the night and I just completely loose it. Not your typical loosing it but the kind where reality slips away and you can\u2019t conceive anything outside of your immediate experience.  It was an extremely foggy night with 10/15ft visibility and my brain slipped into the nothingness. The only thing my brain could comprehend was that I had transitioned beyond life and into a Metallica song (one, it was playing in the car) that would forever float through the nothingness. This continued for the duration of the 6/7min song until the next song turned started, and then I snapped out of it. I wasn\u2019t upset but I also wasn\u2019t happy when all of this was going on, it was more of a confused acceptance of my new existence. \n\nWe all had a good laugh at it the next morning.",

My boyfriend, being the saint he is, decides he wants to go down on me and seriously goes to town (sorry for that detail lol). I\u2019m totally into it, obviously. Suddenly he stops to say something to me and I don\u2019t really think much of it. Then all of a sudden, like the force of a thousand winds, my crotch starts burning. It\u2019s on fire. Suddenly the realization hits me, we ate jalape\u00f1o poppers as part of our dinner that night. Fuck, I got jalape\u00f1o juice in my puss. I held my flaming crotch and hobbled over to the bathroom. While he tries to muffle his laugh in the other room, I have tears starting to form from the pain. I soaked my crotch in cold water and felt some of the best relief of my life. Eventually my crotch started feeling better, so I got back in bed and decided to not make jalape\u00f1o poppers for a while.\n\n\nTL;DR: I let my boyfriend go down on me and totally forgot we ate jalape\u00f1o poppers that night.

        "selftext": "So usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but I've only just recovered enough to talk about it. \n\nAlso for context I am a detective with the police which was on my profile.\n\nSo I have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. I was recommended Bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.\n\nI downloaded the app Thursday and by Friday I had a date so I thought things were going well. First date I arrange for Saturday at a busy shopping centre.\n\nNow I've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see Mortal Engines.\n\nI knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole \"hey is that x? \u300aYOU NOW HAVE 1 SECOND TO DECIDE ON KISS ON CHEEK, AWKWARD HUG OR LAME WAVE THING\u300b but what happened was none of those things. Instead I get hit with \" TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I NEED TO VERIFY YOU\" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing \"let's have a toast for the pretty lady!\"\n\nAnyway she then asks \"WHAT'S THAT ON THE FLOOR\" pointing to a large pile of dust. It's a pile of dust I tell her and she makes me double check.\n\nDust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes \u300aYOU ARE NOW LOCKED INTO THE DATE\u300b\n\nWe got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to Starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me \"...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with...\" \n\nNow I've got some H.P. Lovecraft dark stories so I try to give her a PG version of a double murder I had some involvement with. (Note: everything I discussed could also be easily read about online)\n\n\"HOW DID HE KILL THEM? WAS THERE A LOT OF BLOOD? DID YOU SEE IT? WAS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? I LOVE MURDER STORIES, HAVE YOU SEEN MAKING A MURDERER? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X MURDER? DID YOU KNOW THIS ONE GUY ONCE CHOPPED HIS MUM'S HEAD OFF AND HAD SEX WITH THE CORPSE ISN'T THAT FACINATING?!?!\"\n\n(Let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)\n\nShe also hits me with a few probing questions \"Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever done drugs?!\"\n\nTrying to recover some semblance of a date I joke \"haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime\"\n\nNext it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic \"Tell me about your self\" (I know it's lame but I panicked)\n\n\"Oh I've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in Broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and I got to meet people like naked Phillip\"\n\nNow gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double D breasted woman feels in a slasher flick I decide I have two choices.\n\n1) Run into the crowd and disappear\n\n2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? It's just 2 hours of awkward silence)\n\nLet's just say I chose poorly...\n\nBefore we move off though she asks me to search her chair... I don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.\n\nFinally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the Red Sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.\n\nSuddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! The woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling \"MY EYES! TURN OFF THAT LIGHT!! ARRGHHFYFBIFWYH\"\n\nmy date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady \"I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT I TOLD YOU TURN THAT LIGHT OFF\" \n\nI'm not about to white knight defend this woman, I'm a god damn spectator here! The fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.\n\nDate goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time I have to step in and say thus is not ok.\n\nSo movie time. I'm sure Mortal Engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. All I'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice I was given prior to app dating\n\n1) don't get drunk\n2) don't send dick pics\n3) don't stick your dick in crazy \n\nSo despite the horror movie Mortal Engines has become I am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so I'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. Lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.\n\nAfter the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...\n\nShe returns dead serious \"I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME\"\n\nthis is where I die i think, I'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.\n\nShe walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust\n\n\"WHAT'S THAT?\"\n\nI say just a large pile of dust \"ARE YOU SURE, CAN YOU CHECK\" \n\nSure enough it's just dust...\n\nSo keen to make good my escape I lay down a \"woah look at the time... 8:30! Got to grab that train\" she responds \"you know I'm really thirsty... could really go for a drink!\"\n\nNot willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede I push on \"central line that's Me! Oh you too? Great...\" \n\nNext she smashes out a \"you know the Overground train for me is an hour wait.... I don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty...\" \n\nThe next stop I just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, \"oh look at This! Haha my stop lovely to meet you BYE\" \n\nThe journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...\n\nTLDR\n\nMy first date in years was with someone murder obsessed and recently released from a mental health facility. Now too scared to date anyone ever again.",

It's inexpensive and gives you a public place to meet\n2. If she's a good fit you can take a little stroll and window shop a little after your coffee\n3.

We have a minivan so that we could all travel together. Overall it was about a 4 day round trip once we got there and stayed a couple days before coming back. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I weren't able to fool around during this time.\n\nOn the way back my boyfriend and I were sitting in the back of the van. Everyone was ahead of us, so they couldn't see us without turning around.\n\nWe started texting some naughty things about what we'd like to do to each other and I got extremely turned on. This went on for quite a while and progressed into us touching ourselves while we were looking longingly at each other. Needless to say, I was SOAKED.\n\nOf course, since we were driving and my dad is pretty stingy with bathroom breaks I couldn't exactly clean myself up. My underwear were completely soaked and I had no option but to sit in it until we got home.\n\nWhen we got home all was good. My bf and I snuck off to have sex and it was great.\n\nHowever, if you are aware of female hygiene practices at all, sitting in a wet bathing suit or underwear is a big no no. Your lady parts are supposed to stay pretty dry for the most part.\n\nFor several hours that day, mine did not, and I payed for it by waking up the next day with the absolute worst yeast infection I have ever experienced. It was horriible and took over a week of embarrassing-to-buy over the counter drugs to fix it. Will NOT be doing that again!\n\n\nTl;dr got so horny I gave myself a yeast infection\n\n\nEdit: Holy crap guys, that's a lot of upvotes! Thanks for laughing at my pain!! \ud83d\ude01",

We were driving back from New York and we decided to stop in Washington D.C. to see the White House and whatnot. When we got there it was dark, rainy, and foggy so my ex and I decided to stay in the car, one thing led to another and we started having sex right there in the back seat of her parents SUV. It went well but then I noticed a large group of people walking towards the car so I threw her off of me real fast but unfortunately the last stroke I did before I tossed her off of me was the stroke that made me ejaculate. So I\u2019m just sitting in that car literally creaming my pants while everyone is opening the doors to get back into the car and my parents say it smells funny so I just tell them probably because we have been in the car for hours and they agree with me. I had cum in the inside of my underwear for nine more hours until we got back home to Georgia.",

Without knowing all the details, it basically requires a lot of paperwork and a couple of signatures (in our case my sister and myself, and a 3rd witness); and all this needs to be renewed every 5 years. It's basically a will/permission that gives my sister and I the authority to decide in his name (i.e. respect his wishes) if he is no longer able to himself. Last June he had a stroke at age 77 and has since mostly recovered. Accordingly we discovered that the paperwork needed to be renewed around this time of the year.\n\nMy sister is the principal contact on the paperwork and as such she was going to take care of it (like she has always done before). She is a schoolteacher and this morning the schools are opening again, so the past weeks have been a bit hectic for her.\n\nLast night I went to bed around 3 a.m. and this morning shortly after 8 am - while still sleeping -  I get a call from a city clerk. The paperwork was still missing the signature of my dad, and apparently she had been trying to contact my sister to no avail. So she reached out to me before it expires and gave me an appointment in about 2 hours from now.\n\nMy dad recently became my neighbor, and is usually already awake this time of the day sitting in his office. So still somewhat sleeping I put on pants and walk over to his house. Oddly enough he is still sleeping so I wake him up (which requires specialized skills).\n\n\"*Huh what*?\"\"*wake up dad*\"\"*huh? oh its you? huh what*\"\"*they called for your Euthanasia, we need to be there at 11h15*\" (im still not fully awake)\n\nHe looks totally bemused at me, sits on the bedside for a couple of seconds and gives me this look of utter defeat and says: \"*well shit, that's fast*\". To which I say, \"*well we still have more than 3 hours, so no rush, I'll pick you up around 11, cya*\".He mumbles totally disappointed: \"*3 hours and you gonna leave me alone*\"? At which point my penny drops (technically speaking eurocent): \"*you stay in the car, I pick up the paperwork, you sign it, I return it and we are good again for 5 years, turns out my sis forgot something*\".\n\nNever seen him being more relieved before in my life! Turns out he had been dreaming about it in some way or form and me putting it like that made it all a little bit too realistic for him.\n\nTL;DR while being sleepdrunk I woke up my dad and told him we get to do his Euthanasia later this morning. He took it a bit too literal.\n\n*Edit 1: It is my dad his own decision that he wants to be euthanized if he ever ends up in a situation where he has to live in a vegetative state with zero quality of life. He talked about this extensively with his doctor, with the family, friends, ...  At first I wasn't very happy to sign that paper, but in the end it's his choice. And respecting his whish is important to me. There is a whole process involved: first off all the paperwork which can be seen as his will/testament. Second off, if god forbid he ever ends up in such a situation, there is another legal process we'll have to go through before it can happen. Third off, there is no way whatsoever that me or anyone who signed that document can enforce anything while he is still mentally sound.* \n\n*Edit 2: When this conversation took place my dad was somewhere in the middle between sleeping, dreaming and waking up. And I wasn't fully awake yet either, or else I'd have just told him \"they called for your Euthanasia* ***paperwork, it's missing a signature,***  *we need to be there at 11h15\".* \n\n*It's as simple as me failing to form a coherent sentence (not fully awake yet) towards my dad who is still in lalala land. Some of these comments are batshit crazy.*",

            "Where we live, the closest town has a nursing home named Woods View or something. All the people just call it the Woods. People go there for rehab after surgery, or if they need to go in permanently because family can't care for them at home anymore. I was sitting and chatting with an elderly couple and the man had pretty severe dementia. The woman said \"Pretty soon I think we'll have to take him out to the Woods.\". And he started having some anxiety. No one ever wants to go in a nursing home, even for rehab, so I thought it was just a general fear of that. After she said it a few more times in the conversation, I realized he did not know she meant Woods View or even that there was such a place. The poor man thought he was going to be taken out to the woods and I don't know what other thing he was envisioning. Nothing good. I told her maybe we should just call it \"rehab\" or something. Now when I hear people talk about the place, I look around to make sure no one is horrified if it's referred to as \"The Woods\". TLDR: The nursing home here is called \"The Woods\" by a lot of folks, and it sounds like you're talking about taking someone out in the woods and leaving them there (or worse).",

Crushed me for just a moment.\n\nHe was really shocked when he ended up in the hospice wing of the VA with a 40 inch TV a comfy bed, and all the ice cream he could eat (he was diabetic, I provided it 24 little peel top cups a week).

            "I wish we had this option in Scotland instead I had to spend 11 days at my dad's bedside while the hospital slowly killed him by doping him up with morphine and stopping him getting any fluids. They call it palative care, I wouldn't have treated a dog that way. \n\nThe only good thing that came from those 11 days was a day of clarity on my birthday. \n\nSome background, my dad had a stroke and I looked after him.He stayed at home the first year and seemed to recover then he went down hill mentally and started forgetting things, then wandering the streets in his dressing gown in the middle of the night. \n\nWe bought a house in the same street when he had his stroke to help be close to him. He would turn up at my door at all hours of the morning, we decided it was time he went in to a care home when he turned up at my door at 3am with just his slippers and dressing gown on in the snow. \n\nMentally he didn't know who I was, he always thought I was his brother who had died about 30 years earlier. He didn't recognise anyone and he was in his own wee world in his head. \n\nWe got a call from the car home regularly about him getting in to trouble, shouting at other patients or banging against stuff and tearing his very thin skin. \n\nThis one day I get a phone call to go to the hospital as he had a fall in the home, the home said he was fine just had anothet few bruises to go with the rest. So I made why way to the hospital (I work about an hour from the hospital) and when I got therey sisters where their too and my dad's sisters.  I instantly knew something was wrong. The docs called me and my two sisters in to a wee room and said he wasn't going to make the night. No explanation why, we didn't ask as we where so emotional. \n\nWe spent the next few days with him, where he was unconscious and the hospital said they where stopping his drip to help him pass peacefully. Another week goes by and he is still hanging on in there. \n\nThis is the crazy bit that makes me question all I know about altziemers and dementia. On the morning of my birthday he opened his eyes and gave me a big smile. He gestured me in close so he could talk to me. He said 'I love you son and I'm proud of you' I nearly died on the spot, he hadn't known who I was or had a full conversation with me for about two years before this. He then asked to speak to my sisters and spoke to each of us, he sat up in bed and made jokes and we all had a great time. He went to sleep that night and never woke up again. Three days later he passed. \n\nSo this makes me think that when people have dementia or Alzheimer's they might still be stuck in there. The docs said it was just his dying mind flooding his brain with chemicals that's made him Access memories he couldnt before and they had seen this before. \n\nI don't know what happened but I appreciate I got to speak to my dad that one last time. \n\nNow would I have missed that experience if we had the option to euthenize him? It's a.tough question but during lifey dad always said don't let me rot in a home I'd rather just go but we didn't have that choice. \n\nApologies for the long text and for hijacking your thread but this all just came out for some reason.",

No other.  \nNever, ever! can it be for anyone else's consideration.\n\nThis is at the very core of the entire philosophy of Euthanasia.\n\n\\-As to the road ahead:  \nI recommend talking to your father about this.  \nHowever, be aware of your agenda here!  \nConscious or not..\n\nIf he is forgetful, it may take some time to 'set in stone' his wishes.\n\n\\-The reason why the philosophy is so clear on the precedence of ultimate self-choice:  \nThere are many reasons why one's relatives may want their elders to check out.\n\nBe it inheritance, burden, time, finatials or others...  \nThere are many incentives why it would be personally beneficial for one's elders to move on.\n\nNow, we are not accusing anyone of anything.  \nBut that is why the philosophy on Euthanasia is clear:\n\n**Euthanasia must be for the benefit of the Euthanized alone**\n\n\\--\n\nWe can draw some comparison to how we gift **dogs** the peace of Euthanasia.\n\nIt is never for us humans. We would like their love longer.  \nBut now, they suffer. There is no other choice.  \nOnly then, when the suffering must end.\n\nDo we cry goodbye.\n\n\\--\n\nFor those interested:  \n \"**Half a Life**\" is the 22nd episode of the [fourth season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_(season_4)) of the American [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) television series [*Star Trek: The Next Generation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation), the 96th episode overall. \n\n\\- \"Timicin is about to turn sixty years of age, he prepares instead for a ritual suicide.

Just wanted something to do for the weekend instead of just sitting around doing nothing all day. \n\nAfter drinking I decided to pull some money out of the ATM and go looking for a roulette table. I\u2019m not one to gamble much so I only took out a couple hundred and only found tables with $50 minimums. Not wanting to lose my money in 5 minutes I thought, why not go looking for a different table? \n\nI took a walk and while passing some slot machines I saw some girl looking at me smiling. I looked away and then turned back and she was still looking at me. She waved and called me over and we starting talking. She basically gave some story about her mom in bad health and she was just looking to go out and drink and have \u201cfun\u201d.  She then leaned forward and grabbed my groin in the middle of the casino floor. \n\nAfter missing several red flags, I thought to myself, \u201cI haven\u2019t been laid for a minute, fuck it, I\u2019ll have a one night stand if she\u2019s just dtf.\u201d So off we go to my room. \n\nWe get to the room and I say, \u201cso you\u2019re not just looking for a place to stay for the night right?\u201d And she says, \u201cNo, I live here, I\u2019m just looking to have fun. I thought you said you\u2019ve been to Vegas before?\u201d I tell her yes but maybe not the real Vegas. \n\nAfter a short pause and a confused look she says, \u201cUh, I\u2019m working\u2026\u201d after another short pause she says, \u201cSorry, I thought you knew.\u201d \n\nI was surprised, but more so with the fact that I was that oblivious. I\u2019ve been in a weird situation before where two girls at a bar decided to dance with me and pick me up so I just thought this was just going to be some crazy out of the blue hookup. \n\nShe tells me that she\u2019ll at least need 10 dollars since I basically just cost her money. Awesome thing about taking out hundreds in Vegas is now I only have hundred dollar bills. I wanted to make a joke about asking for change, but I just gave her a hundred and said, \u201csorry for wasting your time\u201d. All I could think of was a joke about possibly paying for an STD instead of just having a one night stand and it being free. \n\nMy friends asked me at that point why I didn\u2019t just go through with it. I gave it a thought, but paying for it would not have been worth it. \n\nI laid in bed for an hour after that. After not being able to sleep, with my last hundred I took it to roulette and lost in 5 minutes. I then drove home at 4 AM. \n\nTL;DR: I picked up a girl thinking I was just going to have a one night stand, but she was a prostitute.",

It was silent at first, waiting for her to tell me where to go, or say hi. But no, just a weird grin on her face. Like she was really happy to get in this cab for some reason. First word spoken was her. \"Wassup, baby.\"\n\nAt that moment I knew what was going on especially considering the area I picked her up from was notorious for hooking. I felt embarrassed but I laughed and shook my head. \"Guess I'm not here to pick you up am I?\" Then I think it clicked for her that I was really just looking for my call as a cab driver in a clearly marked cab. \n\nShe got out and yeah, that was it.

So we all got on the elevator, some elderly couple got on too (lord only knows what these people were thinking the whole time).  So we hit our floor number and asked them which floor they were going to, they said they were on the same floor.  We chatted a bit... missed several red flags. Then we all got off on our floor... this is where the awkwardness started.  \"So which way to you guys room\" ... my brother and I looked at each other and this was suddenly when all the red flags dawned on us that they were prostitutes... we just kindly explained to them that we thought they had lost their room key and just needed to get up the elevator (we assumed a friend was in their room to let them in).",

This was my first time I took a trip somewhere without my parents.\n\nThe last conference session was done for the day so I was looking around just checking stuff out when this woman came and started a conversation with me. I thought she was probably also in Vegas for the conference, so I started talking to her about some technical stuff and she seemed really into the conversation.\n\nShe made a comment about how she really loved what I was talking about and asked if we could go back to my room so I could show her and we could have some fun together. The way she worded the comment, it was clear she was not well versed in the technical subject I was talking about, so I figure I have nothing else planned for the night, so I guess I could invite her back to tell her a bit more about it.\n\nWhen we got back to my room, she had her hands all over me and asked me if I had $200. At this point, I'm a little freaked out, so I tell her I didn't have any money (which was close to true). She incrementally kept asking for less to see how much I had, until she finally said she had to go and asked if I could give her $20 to help her get out of here, which I also said I didn't have.\n\nShe looked pissed and just walked out without saying goodbye or anything. At this point, I could've sworn someone was going to come back to my room and something bad was going to happen. The next day, I didn't even leave my hotel room until dinner time because I was afraid someone was going to be waiting there for me.

            "This happened to me once sort of. I was at some club and I was grabbing a drink at the bar. There was this gorgeous girl standing alone next to me and I noticed her drink was almost empty so I figured I would throw a dart at the board and offer her a drink, she was definitely out of my league looks wise. She accepted and we chatted for a bit and she was laughing at my jokes and giving a very flirty vibe so I was feeling like I could be getting lucky, she then asked me to come out side for a smoke and I followed. Once outside she asked if I wanted to go to her place for drinks instead of going back in the club. In hindsight it is never that easy and I should have started to see the red flags but I was pretty buzzed and feeling pretty confident in myself at that point in the evening to I happily accepted the invitation. \n\nWe grabbed a cab and took a short ride to her place. Once we got in we started making out and groping each other, in my mind I am thinking this is amazing nothing what a successful night. Then we pause and she walks to the kitchen and pulls a couple beers from the fridge, she hands one to me and then proceeds to say something along the lines of 'my rate is '$200 an hour or $600 for the night'. My heart dropped and immediately I went from feeling like a king to a complete idiot, I guess I didn't hide my reaction well and she immediately realized I was completely caught off guard and under a completely different impression of the type of encounter I was about to have. She became extremely apologetic, and kind of started consoling me like I was a kid who dropped their ice cream. I wasn't crying or anything but I guess she could tell that on the inside I was banging my head against the wall. She insisted I sit for a bit and have a couple more drinks as sort of payback for wasting my night, I agreed I guess just to be polite even though I really wanted to just gtfo and get the embarrassing night over with. We sat on the couch and just kind of chatted a bit, the flirty elements were gone but it was a good friendly conversation and I remember thinking if I she was a colleague or something I could see myself being friends with her. \n\nAn hour roughly passes by and it around 3 AM and I finish my second beer and have gotten up to get ready to head home. As I am at the door about to put on my coat she tells me that if I want to stay the night I am welcome to, I hesitated to answer as now I was overthinking everything and she quickly clarified she meant sleeping with her (free of charge, though it was not explicitly said) and not just crashing on the couch. I accepted her offer and my excitement from earlier in the evening returned. I won't go into detail about the sex but she was really hot and did it for a living so yeah it was pretty good.\n\nThe next morning we woke and she let me grab a shower and be on my way. I was tempted to ask her out but I felt like that would be a can of worms not worth opening if she ended up actually wanting to pursue some sort of relationship. I gave her a hug goodbye and never saw her again, I think about her often and wonder what her life is like now... I hope she is doing ok.",

If you\u2019re in Vegas (anywhere really, just probably a lot more common there) and call a number from the papers and cards that people pass out on the streets to have woman or women come to your room\u2014 please take a few minutes to talk to them before and after. \n\n\u2014I\u2019m not saying this to shame sex workers in any way. I think that it should be legal and don\u2019t think that being a sex worker makes someone a bad person or someone to look down on\u2014 Make sure that they want to be doing what they\u2019re doing. If everyone does, great, have fun. \n\nI\u2019m just saying this because I know a family who runs a bakery in the Bay Area. Their 17yo daughter worked there a lot. One day she just disappeared. No one could find her. They had no idea what happened because she was actually very shy and only spent time with a handful of others around her age. The cops wouldn\u2019t do anything. Then a week later, she starts making rushed calls from I guess burner phones. Like whispering \u201cVegas, they\u2019re probably going to kill me. Please help\u201d and then just hang up. She started sending pictures from the windows of the hotels or motels that some horrible sex trafficking pimps were taking her to. They moved her around a lot. The cops still did not care!\n\nShe has 3 older brothers. They went to Vegas on a mission to find her and get her away from the men who had taken her. Her brothers are all very tough, strong guys who had no fear of anything happening to them. They only wanted to get their sister back. Said they were willing to die, told each other to sacrifice any of them if they had to to get their sister back home. \nIt took them at least 3 weeks to find her. They\u2019d been walking everywhere around the city showing her picture but also memorizing the views from every cheap hotel. That ended up being the key. She texted a pic from a window, one recognized a sign and building and knew the hotel that it would be visible through the window of. I have no idea how they got her, but they did and took her home. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all, just cried constantly for weeks. Their mother finally got her to start talking to a counselor. She was afraid to leave her home for. After weeks she\u2019d leave when she had to but would only do so during the day surrounded by male family and friends. Their mother said that when they got back, all of her brothers were really beat up but one had a broken arm and eye socket, teeth knocked out. Apparently once they had rescued their sister they just got in the car ASAP and sped home. Just left behind the stuff they\u2019d had in their hotel room and took off.\n\nCrazy scary story. I\u2019m sure that that kind of torture must be happening to others. Having 3 brothers who really weren\u2019t afraid of dealing with whoever had her even if those people might kill them *and* were able to devote a relatively long period of their lives to doing nothing except searching is probably the only thing that helped her escape.",

        "selftext": "A little backstory\n\nMy husband and I sleep naked, always have. We like the skin on skin contact and it\u2019s overall comfier to not worry about getting tangled up in pajamas at night. Lately he\u2019s been working a night shift for his job, and I\u2019ve been sleeping alone at night. Naked like usual. \n\nAbout a month ago, right when my husband started his night shifts, we got a kitten. She\u2019s our first pet and everything we could have asked for. She\u2019s adorable, lively, and at times very crazy and sassy. She sleeps in our bed at night, most of the time right above my head on my pillow because she likes my hair. \n\nRecently however, she\u2019s started to enjoy sleeping under the covers between us. We don\u2019t mind, so long as we don\u2019t squish her (We\u2019re pretty good at staying put at night, I don\u2019t think rolling onto her is very likely).\n\nOnto the FU. Last night was a regular work night for my husband. He goes to work and I go to bed at around 11pm, naked. Our kitten follows suit and cuddles up under the sheets with me. I fall asleep not knowing the pain I\u2019m about to feel a few hours later. \n\nCut to 2am, I wake up PANICKED about a red hot stinging pain on my chest, like someone had grabbed my nipple with a flat iron and twisted it as hard as they could. I\u2019m still half asleep at this point, and couldn\u2019t seem to figure out exactly what was wrong and why I was in so much pain. I frantically flipped the sheets over, grabbed at my boob, and finally realized what was causing the red hot nipple pain. \n\nIt was our kitten, who had probably woken up to play with her tail and saw my boob as a great chew toy opportunity. She bit my nipple HARD. Naturally I grabbed and almost threw her across the bed, which hurt even worse because she bit down harder as I pulled her off. I yelled some gibberish obscenities at her then proceeded to wrap myself tight in the sheets to keep her out. I spent the next half hour or so rubbing my throbbing nipple and trying to keep the tears at bay until I could fall back asleep. \n\nIt\u2019s now about 1PM the next day and my nipple still feels sore. It hurts to wear a bra and I can still somewhat feel that burning sensation from being pinched with her tiny sharp teeth. I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t break skin or leave a bruise or anything.\n\nWhile I still think she\u2019s the sweetest kitten in the world, I\u2019m now very much aware of the inner nipple-biting gremlin. \n\nI think I\u2019ll wear a T-shirt to bed tonight\u2026\n\nTLDR: I slept naked and my kitten bit my nipple while I was asleep.",

While I was dumping the popcorn from the microwave bag into the bowl, she tried to scare me by jumping out from around the corner. I knew she was coming because I heard the water from the toilet rushing through the pipes and just had a sense that she\u2019d make an attempt. She didn\u2019t scare me but, our cat was standing right behind me and she scared the hell out of her. She climbed up the back of my thigh, left flank, shoulders, neck and scalp like I was a tree.

I was essentially completely unprotected from the waist down and none at all from the waist up. It hurt like hell. I was shredded and bleeding everywhere.

She spared me the unnecessary details but, she said it was during Summer, and quite warm so they were completely uncovered, pretty hot and heavy. Cats being the nocturnal hunters that they are are pretty active after dark. The cat saw swinging testicles and decided to go in for the kill, pounced from the foot of the bed and latched on with claws and teeth. She said she thought he was gonna kill the cat. He didn\u2019t but never trusted that cat again and always made sure that cat was out and the bedroom door closed at night after that.

And she started running. Terrified, thinking maybe she saw stray dogs too, me and my brother took off running towards her. She eventually reached her house, closed the gate and ran inside. Now I'm absolutely scared, and me and my brother ran all the way to our house without stopping. Only once I reached home did I realize why she must have run. Unfortunately, I never met her again. And this happened in India, so I completely understand her. But how can she mistake me for anyone dangerous? I was about 13-14! I was shorter than her!

        "selftext": "Throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.\n\nSo I live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. This morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. By the time i\u2019d gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNow i wasn\u2019t too concerned since she can\u2019t get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn\u2019t lost. After searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she\u2019s a lazy pupper). I went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn\u2019t want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.\n\nSo the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. I have a small sister who doesn\u2019t like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is \u201cbanished\u201d to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. After checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she\u2019d gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.\n\nIn i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. They must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_\n\nTurns out 30 seconds wasn\u2019t fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i\u2019m pretty sure my dad\u2019s dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). I was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.\n\nMy sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. And yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.\n\nTL;DR: let my dog slip into my parent\u2019s bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.\n\nEdit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while.",

            "Well, it's a completely different type of story, but it does involve losing track of my old dog. \n\n\nI went over to my aunts to visit with her and my cousin one day and brought my old chocolate lab, Ginger. Well, I thought it would be a quick in and out bc I had to go back home shortly, but my aunt is a talker so it ended up being about 25 minutes. \n\nI left Ginger in the cab of the crew king pickup with all the windows down, her on her bed (she owned the backseat lol she went everywhere with us), as well as her water bowl on the cab floorboard. She was pretty lazy at the end of the day, so she was happy not to have hop in and out the tall truck again.\n\nAfter I get gone chatting and catching up, I walk out to the truck and legit, no joke, feel ice shoot thru my veins as I don't see her head in the window looking back. I immediately start screaming her name as loud as possible and start running around my aunts apt complex asking anyone and everyone if they've seen Ginger. I call my aunt and cousin and they, along with her bc, start helping me look as well. They call everyone they know in the complex to help.\n\n About 30 minutes go by and weve got about 15 kids and adults helping us look for Ginger when I say I'm going to go hop in my truck so I can cruise around the complex faster and hopefully see her better in an elevated position. I hop in the front seat and start doing laps while hollering her name everywhere. \n\nAt this point I am tearing up and I'm having to hide myself from crying openly because Ginger was my best friend and I feel like it's my only fault that she's gone. I reach into the back for my bandana to wipe the tears away when I feel a witness down my arm and turn to look at what was leaking...\n\nWouldn't you know it, it was good old ginger in the backseat! I completely forgot to check and see if she was laying down in the seat when I left my aunt and didn't see her sitting up. Like an idiot, I had immediately panicked and didn't even think to walk over to the truck and look down or all this could have been avoided! I felt so bad but managed to gather everyone up and thank them for their time. They all got a hoot had a petting Ginger and didn't mind helping at all!",

Him and I started chatting about people who work at town hall in the next town over. I had mentioned that my grandmother had worked their for 40 years and I mentioned the last name of my grandmother (for the sake of this post i\u2019m just gonna say the last name is Smith).\n\nHe told me that he has relation to the Smiths also so him and I started digging into how we are related. \n\nI asked him if we could call his father or mother and he told me his father had passed away when he was young. I asked him what happened if he didn\u2019t mind sharing and he said he really doesn\u2019t know, no one will tell him which is okay because he doesn\u2019t really want to know anyway.\n\nSo we keep digging, we tried calling a bunch of our family members but they didn\u2019t answer the phones, except for my aunt.\n\nMind you we are in the car at the moment and my phone is hooked up to the speakers so anything anyone says on the phone can be heard by everyone in the car. \n\nI get in touch with my aunt and I ask her how we are related to his side of the family, she basically told me that my great grandmothers sister is his great grandmother. So all in all, pretty far line down to be considered close cousins. \n\nMy aunt keeps talking and she asked me why I asked? I told her that my coworker and I found out that he\u2019s somehow related to the Smiths and we were trying to see a connection. She asked me what his name was and I said (for the sake of this post we will refer to him as Bob) Bob. I completely failed to mention to her that he was in the car with me at the moment. She says, \u201cOh, his father unfortunately hanged himself a few years ago\u201d\n\nI tried to mutter her out of what she was saying but failed to do so and Bob heard everything. I saw his eyes widen and what seemed to me, pale. I just told my aunt thank you and hung up the phone completely embarrassed that he found this out in not the most ideal way. \n\nBob said to me \u201cWell that explains a lot\u201d I didn\u2019t want to pry so I just said yea and i\u2019m sorry. He didn\u2019t really say much after that and he left. Whenever I see him at work now it\u2019s really awkward for us and I think it really messed him up. I feel so bad but not sure what to do as I don\u2019t want to bring up his fathers death at all.\n\nTL;DR\nTried to find out how me and my coworker were related (whose father passed away and doesn\u2019t know nor doesn\u2019t want to know how he died) and my aunt accidentally blurted out that his father hung himself without knowing I was on speaker.\n\nUpdate: Saw everyone\u2019s advice this morning and decided to talk to him. Gave him a ride home again and talked about it. He said he was kind of happy finally knowing about it because it put his mind at rest. Told him if he ever needs to talk or anything that he can call me up or whatever to talk about it. He thanked me and then we bs\u2019ed for like an hour about whatever. Feels good to have a cousin that I have stuff in common with too, never really had one that I got along with.\n\nAlso, saw some comments referring to him saying he didn\u2019t want to know about his fathers death and the immediately after I said we kept digging. We kept digging about the relation, not his fathers death. Just to clear that up.",

So I did send him a message and ask him (we had the same acquaintances but not the same group of friends so it was very awkward lol) and we both asked our families about our ancestors. \n\nThe locations were very close too, but up until our great grandparents, our family lines remained separate. So it was very bizarre but all in all, we were both stuck at the same generation with no more info so we laughed it out and started calling ourselves \u00ab\u00a0cousins\u00a0\u00bb because we figured out we were related to a degree. Nothing more came out of this, and the subject was dropped.\n\nFast forward to this month. My aunt (mom\u2019s sister) committed suicide, everyone is completely and utterly destroyed, but we try to survive this shitstorm. My maternal grandfather gives my mom some old ass pictures from the Porter family (his late wife\u2019s family) including pictures of my great grandfather, who vaguely reminds me of someone, but *who*?\n\nYou guessed right : T, my uni friend. My mom tells to investigate again, which in hindsight, was a shit idea because everything seemed a bit off about this. \n\nBut I did, and sent him the picture. This is where this starts getting wild. My friend, laughing at the time, literally loses his shit and tells me my great grandfather is the spitting image of his father and brother. Cue to seeing pictures, and yes it\u2019s totally the same face. This is astounding. But still, how is that possible ? They are apparently no related in any way.\n\nAt least *officially* - so I start joking about how the family may have had some cheaters or brothers in law sleeping with their sister in law or something. Of course, that was a shit joke and we could just be related higher up in the family tree or something.\n\nHe laughs a bit too, but later I got some news that he kind of asked around the family and this stirred some old shit and everything was very awkward at home. I tried to get some information, but he started to answer very coldly and then not at all.\n\nI still didn\u2019t get to the bottom of this story, but apparently I\u2019ve created a nuclear blow in their dirty family secrets. \n\n*oops*\n\nIf people in your family look alike people you know but no one seems to be able to make an official connection, maybe just ignore it lol.",

            "I would definitely talk about the moment you guys shared, it is awkward primarily because it hasn't been discussed.  This guy discovered something heavy and might need someone to debrief about it.  Like it or not, you are the most suited for that (save possibly his spouse or something like that, but you are still really close to the situation).  \n\n\nThere is a lot of shame around suicide and maybe it is causing him emotional turmoil because you found out a \"secret\" about him.  He might benefit from knowing that you are supportive of him, don't think there's something strange or shameful about his family history.  It might seem irrational to be ashamed of a parent committing suicide, and it is; but that doesn't mean that people don't feel that way and need help sometimes.",
            "He needs to be reassured that you are not judging him or his family. He needs to know he has nothing to be ashamed of and that you don't think any less of him.\n\nSuicide is a brutal thing that not only robs you of precious people but it leaves you with the knowledge that the person made a choice to leave. Of course they were in a terrible mental state when they did so and we find a way to deal with that.\n\nBut other people can be so cruel and judgemental. In some circles it still carries a certain stigma about it that can really add to the burden carried by those of us left behind. \n\nIt's a terrible irreversible decision that leaves scars across the generations. It's a decision that is made usually by a person who themselves is in great mental agony. They convince themselves they won't be missed, or they are unlovable, worthless, stupid.. and they leave behind an aftermath of pain and destruction.\n\nPlease assure your workmate that you value the connection you have found together. You don't think any less of him and you are there i]f he wants to talk. Maybe you can help fill in the gaps of the man he missed growing up with and maybe just maybe a lot of good will come of this.",

        "selftext": "so this happened yesterday, and I've yet to see what the results of my stupidity are\n\nIt is important to know that I was suicidal a year or so ago. I still have depression and anxiety though. Also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.\n\nSo for my English class, I required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. I decided to do the \"3 stages of life\" one, but instead of the classic \"Birth, life, and death\" stages, I made the stages of my life \"Bliss, Pain, Unknown.\"  For Bliss I wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. For pain, I write about how depressed I got during high school and how I wake up everyday and think about how badly I want to die. Then for Unknown, I wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after I die. I said I was looking forward to my death too. Once I finished, I submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because I was right up against the deadline for submission\n\nSo fast forward to me, in my English class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to \"peer review\" each other's essays. I read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. The people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (I never said I would kill myself, and I have no intention of doing so, but I did say in the essay that I was looking forward to dying, and I guess that made them think imma kill myself)\n\nSo now im just sitting there thinking to myself \"shit I just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone\"\n\nSo now im pretty sure that my teacher's gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I accidentally wrote a suicide note and turned it in for my English essay assignment, and I had to read it out loud in front of a few of my classmates.\n\nEdit: y\u2019all thanks for all the support, I really appreciate it! I\u2019m at school right now but when I get home I\u2019ll read all your comments.\n\nEdit 2: again, thanks for y\u2019all\u2019s support it means a lot to me. Also, thank you to those who showed me that LongBeachGriffy video that really made me smile a little bit. If anything interesting happens regarding this story, I\u2019ll be sure to update yall\n\nupdate: nothing interesting happened. my teacher handed the assignment back and she wrote just a generic \u201chang in there it gets better\u201d message",

It's so you can verbally process, and then maybe they ask a couple questions that you get you thinking about it from a different perspective.

I wrote how when he was really little he found his dad's gun in the closet and accidentally killed his little brother, after that due to mental health and parental negligence he became a bully and eventually got killed when a kid he bullied shot him at school.

It may be writing or talking.\n\nSometimes people will be worried for you.

I've never really been able to get a grasp or control over it, despite years of seeking help from family members, therapy, and medication.  I would probably say the last year or so has been a little bit more manageable, but it's a constant and daily effort to not focus on the relief that death could bring. \n\nContrary to what my previous statement might sound like, I'm not suicidal, and I never have been.  Although I've spent several consecutive years riddled with mornings wishing I had died in my sleep, I'm glad that I had never considered suicide as an option. \n\nI hope you continue to get healthier mentally and further away from the idea of suicide.  But, I really don't think you should feel bad or self conscious for expressing these ideas in your paper (assuming it didn't carry a blatant message of advocating suicide), and I feel that the reaction your peers gave was a misunderstanding. Either by some miscommunication either on your part or there's.\n\n I share a similar disposition towards death in the sense that  while it may seem like a dismal and morbid end to most, it doesn't have to be feared or viewed as unhealthy to think about, as long it isn't actively pursued or taken into your own or anyone else's hands. \n\nI found that relieving myself of the fear of death allowed me to focus on my mental health and helped me work on becoming happy while I'm still alive .  And, it reminds me to give myself a break from the path of self ridicule that my anxious and depressed mind soft often wants to take. \n\nTo wrap it up, I think it's perfectly healthy to have such an unconventional view on death. So long as it doesn't encourage you or others to carry it out. \nI hope this helps to relieve yourself of some of the worry.

The news had recently broken that someone had been badly injured on an amusement park ride, and the ride had some name like \u201cThe Death Machine\u201d or something equally ominous and I found it amusing that people were so excited to ride something with a scary name and then surprised when someone got hurt. So I made this comic strip about a family who went on a ride called \u201cThe Suicider\u201d and are promptly decapitated, and how they were excited that the ride lived up to their expectations.

            "Oof. Yeah that sucks. I get where you're coming from. I'm not depressed or suicidal in the least, but life (to me anyway) is just waiting around until death. I've never really been a person with goals or dreams, I've just always seen myself as someone renting time for a bit, so what's the point? Since I've had children, I'm only worried that I'll die before they all are able to remember me at least some. Once they're old enough for memories then I feel like I'll have succeeded in life and whatever happens, happens.\n\nAlthough, if you're suffering through depression, you should absolutely talk to someone. It's one thing to view life as a waiting game without much point, and something completely different to spend every day in pain. There's no shame in needing mental health help (coming from someone who went to speak to a psychiatrist while deployed in Iraq, many soldiers view it as a weakness when it's not).\n\nWho knows, you may find an amazing doctor who talks you through whatever you're struggling with and give your life a purpose.\n\nBest of luck though!",

After highschool he went to university to get a double major in engineering and physics, he climbed some of the world's tallest mountains, he would become a member of the fire service and save countless lives, and he would go on to become a father.

I've always loved creative writing and I'm quite good at it and my teacher was the headmaster so being the sort of teenager who was unnecessarily hard on herself and absolutely existed on good comments and getting As, I thought here's my chance to shine and absolutely went to town on it. \n\nI worked on that thing for hours, every single night, and produced 36 A4, single-spaced, typed pages (I went through a whole ribbon typing it), and submitted this highly unlikely story blaming JFK for the death of my protagonist's disinterested beau's brother in the Vietnam war. It was fuelled by a random, teen obsession with the 60s and everything peace man and flower power, a recent viewing and, obviously, a completely new and exciting insight surrounding the events of the assassination, a burgeoning interest in politics and fear of The Man, and looking back, my own sexual awareness coming about. I was in love with Michael Stipe, and listened to Automatic For the People over, and over, and over the entire time. \n\nAnyway I wrote the thing, went out and proudly bought a folder for it and proudly handed it in. I got a Headmaster's Commendation (the highest recommendation given at my school at the time, and available to those who weren't taught by the headmaster, but still) so I thought I'd kind of made it, really- I would definitely be an author, this was definitely my area of expertise, and the thing itself was some kind of precocious masterpiece. Other teachers mentioned it to me, and I must have visibly glistened with pride. \n\nI uncovered it a couple of years ago and re-read it, and it's basically porn. She's constantly spurned while she watches this guy's muscles while he's tending horses and when he speaks to her, his voice is \"like cream down her back\" (oh god, the cringe, I could turn inside out), I chose New Mexico despite knowing nothing about it as the setting, so there are constant references to massive cacti and how stiff and tall they stand, there's a scene where he tries to drown himself full of thrashing and groaning and finding strength against the pull of the river, the eventual kissing scene I have blocked from my own memory... I mean, I could die. And I was so proud of it. \n\nI can only assume that no one ever read it in its full glory due to the ridiculous plot, the single-spacing, the sheer volume of the thing, but that it was skim-read, at least, and it's goriest portions passed round the staff room and it went down in school staff lore as the only soft-porn novel ever submitted as actual coursework, and for that I will forever be ashamed, and a little bit proud.",

After my dad jumped out to help him, I sat in the car not really feeling anything. It wasnt really shock or me freaking out, I just felt apathetic. So my dumbass decides to put that as my 10th point in my presentation. \n\nLater I present my project to the class and everything goes fine up until the last point, about me being apathetic. Once I finished that point, I looked at my teacher and she looked really freaked out because of me and then when I looked around so did some of the students. I think in the end they thought I was a serial killer in the making or something so it was uncomfortable.  After that nothing happened but I really thought someone was gonna report me thinking I was a troubled child.",

We communicate in English, but naturally we have begun slowly learning each other\u2019s languge. As I learn more and more words and phrases, I like to put what I know already to use and speak to her family in Slovak whenever I can (they speak English as well, so I don\u2019t *have* to do this).\n\nWhen I learned that \u2018na obed\u2019 is their equivalent of \u2018for lunch\u2019, I was making a lot of stupid jokes by prepending random words that I know to this construct. I mostly made this \u2018jokes\u2019 to her and her sister. However, this one time I saw her mother preparing some seeds for the birds they keep in the living room. Having previously learned that \u2018bird\u2019 is \u2018ftak\u2019 in Slovak, I thought this was a perfect opportunity for me to present my knowledge of the language.\n\nSo I asked her, smiling: \u2018Obed na ftak?\u2019\n\nThen this genius idea crossed my mind to make a stupid joke: \u2018\u2026or ftak na obed?\u2019\n\nMy gf\u2019s older sister burst out in hysterical laughter, shortly followed by her mother.\n\nIt would have been good for me to know that \u2018ftak\u2019 is also common slang for \u2018penis\u2019, meaning I have basically enquired if she would like \u2018dick for lunch\u2019.

But in the silence I said the only 2 words I could remember. \"Ti sobachka\" (spelled wrong I'm sure) which is literally \"you little dog\". Not proper grammar by any means. She looked at me, in English \"you call me a dog?\" then bursted out laughing. I had never seen the woman laugh before that - apparently it had been some time since anyone saw that.\n\nAnother time in church someone sneezed and I responded with \"Slava ti\" which isn't the usual way you say \"bless you\" when someone sneezed in Ukrainian I guess but I picked up Slava from church and thought why not.

No biggie, but it meant I had to borrow my dads truck to go to work today. Now my dad has a newer pickup with a Bluetooth radio, so I synched my phone up, put on some music and went to work. \n\nLater, once I went home I decided to have some \u201cme\u201d time and watch some \u201cspecial video\u2019s\u201d. Around the 4th video when I was really getting into it, the audio suddenly cut off. Puzzled, it took me a few seconds to realized the horror of what had happened.... My dad turned his truck on to go check the mail and was greeted with a full volume, near orgasm, porn moan when he did. \n\nWhen he got home, I was standing in the kitchen and awkwardly made eye contact with him and died a little inside. All he said was \u201cwhat the fuck son\u201d. \n\nTL:DR- I borrowed my dads truck and synched my phone to it. Went home and watched porn and my dad was greeted with the sound of a moaning porn-star when he started his truck\n\nEdit: words. ",

            "I have done something like this. I was listening to music in my the living room with a Bluetooth speaker. Went to bed. Next morning decided to have some me time. Pull up a video and don\u2019t hear any sound for about 5 seconds then I hear laughing coming from the living room. My roommate and his gf were watching tv in the living room.I instantly made the connection that the porn audio was coming out my Bluetooth speaker and exited the video. I didn\u2019t have me time knowing they knew what I was up to. I just came out and told them \u201cI\u2019m man enough to say that\u2019s my bad.\u201d We had a good laugh. ",

This was in the 90s, so it was an old 486. I had a folder on the C: drive that was full of porn images. All this crazy shit that some kid had lent to me on a floppy disk. Some of it was gross stuff like scat, even. No idea why the kid loaded that  all on there. But in that time, boobs were boobs, so, whatever.\n\nWhen my stepfather was selling the computer some years later, he decided to clean off the hard drive, I guess. When I walked into the kitchen we had this conversation:\n\nSD: \"Hey so I was cleaning out the computer and I found a folder on there...\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah uh... that was something a friend gave me, Sorry.\"\n\nAnd that was it. No ratting to the mom. Nothing. Ended there.\n\nOver two decades later, I got a call from my mom. She was typing something into Internet Explorer, and it auto-filled to an adult site. She was asking me if spyware could cause that to happen. I could hear my stepfather in the background insisting that was likely. At that moment I knew things had come full circle. \"Yep,\" I said, \"that's totally possible. Malware can auto-direct to adult sites and it will auto fill like that. You should download MalwareBytes and scan just to be save, but I think that you're gonna be OK.\" And a little while later I sent my stepfather a text that said, \"Nice weather today!\" followed by a huge amount of blank lines and then \"To enable inPrivate browsing mode on Internet Explorer, use CTRL-P.\"\n\nWe haven't spoken of that since.",

I didn't expect anyone to see this to be honest. \n\nSo my mom called me the other day and said that she is gonna go get divorce papers and I was so happy for her. Her husband is a horribly jealous douche bag and the marriage has been falling apart for years and eventhough she isn't a great person either it really sucks to see her so unhappy.\n\nI am really exited so I call my friend who I have been talking about this before and start the phone call by saying \"Guess who's getting divorce papers tomorrow!\". There's a really awkward silence and I have no idea why. My friend doesn't say anything and after a while is like: \"are u ok?\". I am so confused at this point. Until I realize. Wait.. I am married. SHE THINKS THAT I AM GETTING A DIVORCE? HOLY SHIT.\n\nI scramble to explain myself and everything is fine now but I am absolutely mortified.

        "selftext": "Technically, yesterday I fucked up and today I am abundantly aware.\n\nI'm in quarantine after testing positive, and my mother currently lives with me, so I'm confined to a single 7'x9' room in my apartment. Needless to say, I'm running out of ways to occupy my time pretty quickly. Well, yesterday it happened; I lost all smell and taste. Weird, but at least it gave me something to do! I promptly drank black coffee, then moved on to greater challenges and ate an entire black licorice candy (anise is the devil's flavor) with no effect. Then I had an idea! What about spicy food?\n\nNow, I'm definitely really white, but I'm not 'jalape\u00f1os in chili is too spicy' white. So I hopped online and went to my favorite Thai restaurant. I figure this'll be a 'last hurrah' of sorts after I use my new superpower to kickstart the second half of my diet. For their green curry, they had a spice scale of low, medium, adventurous, and native Thai. While I did briefly consider 'native Thai,' logic got the better of me and I went with 'adventurous.'\n\nIt was the weirdest experience ever. My entire body was sweating - my *eyeballs* were sweating. I could tell it was spicy and tell it was painful, but in this weird removed way where it didn't really matter. I also couldn't taste a damn thing. The only sensation I had was this sort of numb physical pain and a small voice saying, \"I think pain means you're supposed to stop?\" At this point, my edible kicked in, and I've been locked in a single room for five days with five more to go and this is by far the most exciting thing I had going on, so I doubled down. Ate the whole damn thing, amazed the entire time at my new abilities.\n\nHere we are the day after, and my delicate New England tummy is paying for yesterday's ego trip. My apartment only has one bathroom, and I have to coordinate trips with my mother so as not to put her at greater risk. I flew too close to the sun, folks.\n\nTL;DR lost sense of taste from Rona, got bored and high, ate crazy spicy Thai food, now everything hurts.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards! And for reminding me that I can\u2019t taste any pie right now. Not even Thanksgiving pie.\n\nSecond edit because some people don\u2019t have good reading comprehension: not only did I get delivery (hence going online) but my mother (tested negative) is the one who picked it up from my building foyer and brought it to my door where I, while wearing a mask, picked it up and brought it inside my room because I\u2019m *quarantined in one single room in my apartment for 10 days.*\n\nAnother edit: guys, this is nuts! My most popular posts are of my cat and I get crazy excited when he gets, like, 2k likes (my baby is a star!). Thank you for reading and I\u2019m glad so many people got a chuckle!

I normally enjoy spicy food, so i started out by just eating an apache chili. 80 000 scoville, couldn't taste a thing. Went on to try 1/4 of a habanero, which is normally way too hot for me to eat raw. No sweat, no reaction whatsoever. It was time to go for the big league game.\n\nSo, i cooked up a chili sin carne with ten apache chilis and 1.75 habaneros. Normally, this would straight up erase my tastebuds from time and space, yet all i could feel was a slightly warm sensation on my lips. I ate two big bowls of it, and felt none the worse for wear. \n\nUntil the day after.\n\nNot to provide too much detail, you could say that my ass felt like it was spewing acid and fire.

Beforehand i wasn't even able to be in the same room with one. I had decided myself i didn't want to be afraid anymore. I actually went from a dog-phobe to a dog lover. \n\nThe same goes for bees, which i had a traumatic experience with when i was young, where one got stuck in my shoe between my foot and stung me. The visceral reaction went away for dogs.

        "selftext": "This just happened a couple of hours ago. I am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. So I am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special Christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. I also had to sing a solo before the message, which I was *very* nervous for. \n\nI picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. I even painted my nails to match. \n\nThe first service went smoothly... but when I got home, I noticed I had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *Great*, that\u2019s probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. So I was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. I took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. I also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so I wouldn\u2019t sweat next time.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was running a bit behind, so I put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. I got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. Someone asked if it was too windy for me. We\u2019re in South Florida, so I had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. \n\nUnfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. I grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. Everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which I figured was due to my tardiness.\n\nWe started with a hymn... That\u2019s when I realized I felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress I was wearing. I worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. I could not see past my belly easily, so I leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...\n\nThe sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. There they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. Still on my legs. And the whole audience sees them. How the freak did I not notice, and how did I get on stage without anyone telling me?!? \n\nI rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. I couldn\u2019t even run off afterwards and hide, because I had to sing a solo immediately after that! On the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...\n\nTLDR: Changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. Unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because I\u2019m huge and can\u2019t see my legs. ",

Sorry I cussed at you, mods. Twas rude of me** \n\n\nSo, my brother is an officer and recently told me a story about a naked homeless man breaking into someone\u2019s home and taking a nap on their couch. So obviously the first thing that came to mind was to hide in his attic fully nude and wait for him to get home so I could give him a good scare. \n\nIt took a lot longer than I expected and I live in Texas so attics are exactly a comfortable place to hangout. After about 30 minutes I decided it was an awful idea to continue and a safe idea to go get some water and clothes. \n\nOn my way down the attic stairs I heard a loud scream. It was his girlfriend who I never heard get home. She said all she saw was bare ass and thought it was a homeless man like my brother had just encountered. Not wanting to get shot, I immediately started yelling her name and identifying myself. She slapped me a few times and told me to leave. My brother wasn\u2019t too happy but couldn\u2019t hide a smirk as he told me I\u2019m an idiot and lucky nothing bad happened (which is true). \nSo now there\u2019s a rule against me having keys to anybody\u2019s house. (This happened 2 days ago.). \n\nTL;DR; tried to sneak attack my brother from above but instead scarred his girlfriend for life.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve had fun with you guys, thanks for all the responses. Disabling replies now; can\u2019t keep up and getting the \u201cfuck your brother\u201d comments isn\u2019t fun so I\u2019ll just shush. Rather not have politics in the thread but I did it to myself the second I said cop, so feel free to discuss but keep it civil so it\u2019ll hopefully be conversation and not just arguing. Take care everyone!\n\n (Black lives matter. Police brutality exists. China fucking sucks. Donald is a terrible president. Etc etc. we all agree on most of these things. Loving my brother is not wrong, so bitch at me all you want. You\u2019re not helping anything by talking shit on a reddit thread though)",

But turned out her back door was left unlocked.\n\nWe ended up sneaking in super quietly trying to not laugh our asses off, we make it through the kitchen, dinningroom, when we made it to the hall way we were creaking the floorboards because its an old house. We hear her upstairs, were right around the corner from the stairs, she walks down a couple steps slowly and is like \"...h..hello??\" Then we obviously jump out and scare the pants off her, she's screaming and hOLDING A GODDAMN KNIFE. \n\nShe said she saw a \"person's reflection\" in the glass of the picture at the foot of the steps so she knew someone was there.

        "selftext": "This actually took place a couple of years ago.\n\nI had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. \n\nWell, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. \n\nBy the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded \"Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go.\" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. \n\nWell, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.\n\nI had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. \n\nMy boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.\n\nI look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. \n\nNow my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he's not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he's thinking. There' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.\n\nIn this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. \n\nI couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn't have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.\n\nIt suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. \n\nI could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.\n\nMy boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.\n\nHe finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. \n\nHe makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.\n\nWe all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.\n\nAs soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.\n\nTurns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. \n\nA year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.\n\nTL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.\n\n**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)\n\n**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the \"dumb shit\" angle. Yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. \n\n**Edit 2:** No my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although I get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. The usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. If he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. This, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  Not sure why some seem to be taking the \"he often does dumb shit\" to mean \"he often does completely insane things\", when I feel like I was making the exact opposite point. Oh well. Glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  Also, we all have our faults. I joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",

I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don\u2019t remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don\u2019t want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I\u2019d be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said \u201cwhat are the fucking odds.\u201d We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.\n\n* When did i learn i could do this?\n* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?\n\nand of course...\n\n* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?\n\nand..\n\n* Are you bi? Do you think it\u2019s kind of gay?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn\u2019t the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don\u2019t think I want to know the answer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there you have it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and no, I do not know if she\u2019s on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it\u2019s awkward but it\u2019ll all be okay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  Okay, I'll answer the questions.\n\nI learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNever done it for a crowd before, no.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(from the original post)\n\nSince everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts. No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the \"I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked\" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you \"with a friend who told you\" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that's for sure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2:  Guys, \"party trick\" is just a saying.   This is the only party I have ever done this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 3:  No, there are no videos or photos.  But if you live in LA I might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward.",

Finding *multiple* women who are of this quality, such that this scenario:\n>She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock.\n\nis possible, would be akin to getting struck by lightening while simultaneously winning consecutive lotteries.\n\nPerhaps this subreddit trends younger, and a lot of you just don't have adult dating/relationship experience.

        "selftext": "Full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.\n\nMy ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. He took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an Obon Festival, a special old school Star Trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! For his birthday, I resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. We had been together for \\~10 months at that point, so I thought I knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. [(Not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it's like)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeMo5o46rso)\n\nI had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and I loved it soooooo much. It was special to me and I was so excited to share it with him.\n\nHe was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. I kept hyping him up, saying \"I can't wait until the final surprise, I hope you love it! You're going to love it!\"\n\nWe got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and I led him in Belle-at-the-library-in-Beauty-&-the-Beast style. I still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. Finally, the moment of truth: I took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.\n\nImmediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.\n\nHe was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.\n\n\"Umm... are you OK, dear?\"\n\n\"I'm.... fine...\" he said with a classic Hide the Pain Harold grimace.\n\n\"You don't seem fine. Did something happen?\"\n\nHe looked ill and muttered \"why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them\". I must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. Before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting \"OH GOD, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR, IT'S IN YOUR HAIR.\" Before I could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling \"wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!\" It was chaos. Kids were watching him from their strollers. Some were screaming and crying. \n\nWhen I finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. I apologized profusely and he said it wasn't my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn't come up in conversation yet. I couldn't have known.\n\nWe just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, \"Let's just go home.\" \n\nIt took me months before I felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, I managed to screw that up too. (it's the Nightmare Redux: Thai Surprise in the comments)\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. \n\nEDIT: Sorry, I accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. Dang. I hope I cobbled it back together properly. \n\n1. Please don't be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. It's not his fault. \n2. I was really dumb and young in this story and I don't try to surprise people anymore (unless it's something they explicitly said they wanted). I thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre Fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. \n\nHe did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn't destroyed completely.",

Turns out she is petrified of winged animals and assumed they would be in cages.

        "selftext": "(This Happened a few weeks back, only posting now since the condition has finally cleared up.)\n\n\nI've just recently started getting back into the dating scene. Met up with a guy from tinder that I'd been chatting with for a few days for drinks. Things were going very well, there were no awkward gaps in conversation, we were both into alot the same things, he was really funny, and it didn't hurt that he was also super fucking hot and in shape.\n\n\nMaybe 2ish hours in he asked me if I had any plans afterwards. When I told him I was probably just gonna go home and watch Kenobi, he asked if I \"wanted someone company\" while I did. I said fuck yeah and we headed back to my place, where needless to say we did not end up watching Kenobi, or at least not very much if it before we dropped the pretense, started mashing lips together, and clothes started flying off.\n\n\nSomething to note about me is that I love roughness and love getting manhandled. I understand that's not for everyone, but that's what I like. This guy was very sweet, and very gentle with me, but at this point I'm very much into it and trying to get him to go harder. Spank me, pull my hair, etc. Finally he's got me prone from behind and I'm calling out for him to choke me, since I know it'll drive me over the edge. He's very reluctant, but eventually relents.\n\n\nI had expected him to just use one hand on my neck, but he ended up using his whole arm, kind of like how they do in ufc fights. It was very tight, but he was putting almost no pressure on it, so I could still breathe relatively normally. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's the best way I can think to describe it. Wanting it to be tighter I kind of teased him by saying \"C'mon don't be a pussy\" trying to be sexy but also letting him know to choke me harder. He obliged, and it was the tightest I've ever been choked. I could feel my whole body shaking as I started to orgasm, the next thing I knew I was jolting awake and gasping for air.\n\n\nIt's not the first time I've passed out from being choked, but this guy was urgently trying to get me dressed and to a hospital. I thought he was overreacting until he got me in front of a mirror and I saw that one of my eyes was filled with blood. Like imagine all the parts of your eye that are white are all just blood red. It didn't hurt, but needless to say it freaked me out pretty badly.\n\n\nTo wrap up this overly long story, I spent about 4-5 hours awkwardly explaining what happened to multiple nurses and hospital staff, explaining that I had asked him to do it and that he wasn't abusing me. Which I imagine was hard to believe given the appearance of my eye and the bruise starting to form around my neck. Long story short, the doctor let me know I had popped a blood vessel in my eye, and that while it looked bad, it was most likely superficial and would clear up in a few weeks.\n\n\nHe ended up driving me home, but ended up not responding to any of my calls or texts the following day. Found out he ended up unmatching me on tinder as well. So yeah, pretty sure I traumatized him and blew that opportunity at a relationship.\n\n\nTL;DR: Ended up asking my tinder date to choke me, ended up passing out and popping a blood vessel in my eye, had to explain that I'm just a kinky weirdo to hospital staff, and likely traumatized my date to the point he wants nothing to do with me.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to take a moment to update this post and clear up some things. \n\n1. I completely acknowledge that this situation was 100% my fault and I really do feel awful about what happened, but there's not a whole lot I can do.\n\n2. I had already reached out to try to make amends the day after the incident happened. As much as I would love to properly apologize in person for everything that happened, it's clear that he dosen't want to speak to me, so I'm going to respect his wishes on that.\n\n3. No, I'm not \"going to therapy\" because I have a kink and got caught up in the moment because I was horny, or for any other contrived reason you come up with .\n\n4. Please stop assuming I'm super into BDSM I'm really not. I just enjoy a little roughness and bring choked. I do appreciate the people giving solid advice though.\n\n5. He might have been reluctant to choke me, but he was still very much a willing participant. You can call it victim blaming or whatever, but some of you are very cavalier with your use of the word rape and sexual assault. \n\nWill update if I think of anything else.",

But passing out from being choked is dangerous, and it not being the first time for you really waves a red flag. That's not a normal thing to have happen repeatedly. It's a game so close to the edge, it's really not possible for the normal person to judge what's too far and what isn't. You can be dead in a minute.\n\nTo put this into perspective, over here in Europe, for a while it was in for school kids to strangle each other until passing out, just as a dare game. More than one kid died. It's a stupid game. Don't play it.",

This is a dangerous kink and indeed it\u2019s not for everyone and it\u2019s best to have a conversation before the choking. That way you will probably avoid situations like these. I\u2019ve made the mistake not talking about it before and people have gone waaay too far with it. Some by mistake and some saw it as a way to live out their creepy porn fantasy. Safe, sane and consensual goes both ways. He obliged but are you sure he was into it as well? Otherwise this is a little more then awkward.",

You could have died and he'd have spent the rest of his life in prison because of it. \n\nHave your kink, fine, but pushing people past their comfort zone is stupid in terms of your own safety when dealing with your airway, and just a giant dick move in terms of their comfort and emotional safety.\n\nI'd ghost you too, not just because I was scared of what nearly happened but because you pushed me past the point I was comfortable with and that's a shitty thing to do.\n\nHave a word with yourself.",
            "This should be posted on AITA because you are an asshole.\n\nIn many countries/states, you cannot consent to a crime and this definitely qualifies as one. That means that you opened up this poor guy to legal action by going to the hospital. You are both very lucky nobody at the hospital decided to call the police. In fact, they still might.\n\nIf you're going to engage in BDSM, understand the fucking law and communicate with your goddamn partner. Don't just spring this shit on him in the middle of sex and risk his entire life just for your kicks.",
            "Woah.. dude. You need to reevaluate how you communicate. You NEVER do hard kinks like that without communicating BEFORE sex, and your date had every right to leave, especially if you kept pushing him and he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it.",
            "That's some messed up shit you did.  If someone isn't comfortable with violence in sex don't pressure them to do it.  It's the same as pressuring them to do any other sex act, with the added bonus that if they don't know what they're doing they can seriously injure you or worse, which is a burden nobody should have to bear, not to mention the damage it would do to you.",

            "The fact this dude was visibly reluctant to perform a particular sex act and you admittedly verbally abused him and pressured him to do it is worth discussing. \nThis isn't a funny story, you're a giant red flag and I honestly cannot blame him for unmatching you. If this story had been written from a male perspective you'd definitely be under much harsher scrutiny.\n  \n  \nEdit in response to your edit - you pressured someone into a sex act they were not comfortable with. That is 100% sexual assault. You can call him a willing participant all you like but many people have been raped after saying yes. A yes is only a yes until it becomes a no, and it's common knowledge that showing reluctance is a derivation of no when it comes to sexual consent. Suggestions of therapy are sensible, not for your sexual preferences but for the fact that you seem fully comfortable with all of the above and your participation in such.",
            "\u201cHe\u2019s very reluctant but eventually he relented\u201d\n\n30 no\u2019s and a yes doesn\u2019t mean yes. You pressured that guy into doing something he didn\u2019t want to do. You sexually abused him and probably traumatized him. On top of that you made him think he potentially killed you or gave you brain damage, and made him look like HE was the abuser to a bunch of medical professionals. Plus, if you wanted to, you could turn the story on him and get him thrown in jail. Of course he is afraid of you. You are an abuser. And outside of that, you are just plain irresponsible for bringing breath play into a first time with a stranger.\n\nYes. I guess you could say you \u201cfucked up.\u201d You need to reconsider your approach to sex, and your respect for the feelings of others during sex. Regardless of how badly you want to orgasm, never ever let that take precedence over your partner\u2019s comfortability. You are not a safe person to have sex with. I hope you change.",

It\u2019s a balancing act and really shouldn\u2019t be done with a new partner (perhaps you recognize this now?). \n\nSecondly, it\u2019s scary to be a dude hooking up right now, even vanilla flavored.

Yes one night stands are fun, if both people are consenting to ALL activities and are getting out of it what they want/need/desire.                                \n* you used derogatory language and insults to get him to do what you want. Can you not see how wrong that is?                  \n* You didn\u2019t know each other! Consider your safety, you got very lucky that he was a nice, decent person and treated you with respect. He stayed to make sure you woke up.            \n* exploring kinks is a process, it involves sober discussion prior to doing anything. Everyone is allowed to opt out, have hard boundaries, say yes and then say no if they don\u2019t like it, etc etc.           \n* You flippantly make reference to blacking out and coming too previously. Do you know the physical damage done to yourself and what to avoid to make sure you do wake up? What if you hadn\u2019t? Or lack of oxygen to the brain caused a stroke or similar?                    \n\nKinks are fun and very enjoyable. You seem to have missed the part about consent and respect.                   \n\nI encourage you to learn more, maybe go to a registered event or similar (aka not a tinder hook up or random meeting in a hotel) to explore the finer points, read up there\u2019s plenty online and in Reddit.                \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to like rough sex and kinks it\u2019s another thing completely to traumatised people.",

            "Ok, what you are into is considered extreme edge play in the BDSM world.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even fit into the Safe, Sane and Consensual (SSC) ethos, it\u2019s outright in the Risk Aware Consensual Kink (category).\n\nRACK Players don\u2019t want their activities legalised.  RACK playing relies on both participants researching human anatomy way beyond the normal person.  \n\nRACK playing requires a submissive or masochist to accept that there is a small but real risk they\u2019ll die during a play session.\n\nIn return, the dominant or sadist accepts there\u2019s a small but real risk they\u2019ll kill their partner and go to prison for manslaughter.\n\nWe don\u2019t want our consensual activities to be legalised, because every one of them would be horrific forms of abuse without consent, and we want no where for domestic abusers or sexual predators to hide.\n\nRACK playing requires establishing a relationship of deep trust, and communication and relationship skills way above average, even if you only ever play with each other once, for purely sexual or kink purposes.  If a masochist is going to trust a sadist to stick to the agreed rules and to stop when they want them to stop; to not turn kink into abuse or rape, the sadist also needs to make sure the masochist was not left with hard feelings, or feeling abused or raped and going to the police with their cuts or bruises.\n\nA lot of predators hide in the BDSM community.  There are safety precautions (involving a trusted friend calling you during the date with prepared code words, you calling your trusted friend once you are safe back home afterwards) that masochists take on a first date that you didn\u2019t take.\n\nAny activity that creates bruises; cutting/knife play, burning/fireplay, skewering/needle play and any form of choking is categorised as RACK.  (Bruising goes into RACK because far too many people don\u2019t realise it substantially increases your chances of a blood clot detaching and travelling to your heart, lungs or brain and killing you)\n\nEven though rope play (tying someone to a bed up to elaborate shibari) is generally seen as SSC, you actually need to *research* to make it Safe.  If you do it wrong\u2026 and even if you do it right, the person who is bound may get permanent nerve damage, including permanent tingling or pain in a limb.\n\nIf you do shibari wrong, you can easily cut off blood flow to a limb for over half an hour. You need to research/learn attend a class to know what a tied limb with and without blood looks like.\n\nThe choking in otherwise Vanilla porn is *fiction*.  \n\nAsking someone who doesn\u2019t know about RACK to choke you is pretty much abuse: you were flirting with sending him to prison and you didn\u2019t even seem to know that or have thought that through.\n\nIf you ever want to be choked during sex again, please never do it without exchanging Soft and Hard Limits with your partner.  *ASK* your partner before sex if they are into SSC or RACK.  If you can\u2019t do that before sex, choking needs to be 100% off the menu.\n\nPlease go to r/BDSM advice for some good books for beginner kinksters, or websites with great anatomical information about choking and how to reduce the risks of brain damage or death.",
            "There's a wrong way and a right way to choke somebody. This isn't it. I would really recommend making sure your partner knows how to choke to avoid any potential injuries. Choking injuries can be very traumatic to the throat resulting in a rupture of your trachea and major swelling that can cause other complications including difficulty breathing and be even fatal. Choking that causes someone to pass out is especially bad, such as if you fall and whack your head on something, or you vomit and aspirate because the person doesn't know what to do. Of course, you can also choke for too long.   \n\n\nNot trying to scare anyone out of being into this kind of kink. But you really, really need to be aware of risks and have a game plan, especially if you're going to be this rough with it.

All from doing something he didn\u2019t even want to do in the first place, that he was goaded/pressured into by you. \n\nThink about how he must\u2019ve felt in the hospital. Getting side eyed by nurses and doctors, having his image and reputation be called into question likely forever now by that group of people as they stare at him to determine if he\u2019s an abuser, his innocence not even really being believed after your most adamant declarations of the truth. All it would\u2019ve taken for him to end up in jail/prison, would\u2019ve been you simply not waking back up, or the nurses deciding you weren\u2019t telling the truth and involving the police. Think about how many times it went through his head: \u201cI could\u2019ve killed her. What have I done?\u201d\n\nThink about how betrayed he must\u2019ve felt by you. \n\nPeople are being harsh on you because you\u2019re being extremely cavalier about what could have been (and truthfully still might be) a cataclysmic event in both of your lives. If nothing else, you need to put in writing everything that happened, how it is *entirely your fault*, and truly apologize. Not just for scaring him, but for violating his boundaries. For implicating him in what easily could have been your death. For having his character questioned in that hospital. For not respecting him, and thus putting him through what may have been one of the most traumatic moments in his entire life. For being selfish and thoughtless. For ruining rough sex for him for probably a long time. Affirm his character. Proclaim that he *is* kind, and good hearted and caring and all the things you\u2019ve now made him question about himself. Do right by him, even if he doesn\u2019t respond. \n\nSo, get a clue and get one fast before you die and ruin another innocent person\u2019s life.",

I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It's a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBtw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She's thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That's significant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone on the \"real world\" advice. It does suck, but that's the way it goes, I suppose. My boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. He firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. He made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they DO NOT want to lose me as an employee. Apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn't happen. They are going to merge me into another area so I can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.  ",

They need to keep high quality, technically skilled people available for those spikes, even if it means that the person might be slightly over-employed during other periods.\n\nConsider using the extra time to study for something like a certification which could be related to the work you do.

No, don't do that, they said, we don't want to risk messing it up. The website is important. We have it all backed up on Jaz drives, I said. No, just do it like this and we'll eventually get it done. We, as if anyone else in the company was doing any of this work.\n\nTen minutes later, I had downloaded a text editor with said feature and applied all the changes.

            "I disagree. You screwed up by constantly pestering your supervisor signaling that you have nothing to do. Often these people try to find ways to save money. So cutting your hours by about 50% changes your work status for the company from full-time to part-time. It also allows them to stop covering insurance for you. And your supervisor can get a nice bonus or perk and a nice line on their resume stating they cut costs.\n\nSo, you apply for \"partial unemployment\" since your hours and wage were cut significantly. \n\nWith your spare time, you could had looked for things to do such organize a troublesome inefficient filing system, or study for a certification exam, or pretend to \" look busy\". In 6-sigma there is a concept called [DMAIC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMAIC?wprov=sfla1): Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control. Always look around to see what you can improve and go for it. That would had been a better approach to your spare time. This would make you a better employee - if you can prove your worth and be a \"self-starter that takes initiative\" you can do no wrong, especially if you can save the company money.\n\nInstead of thinking the other person a fuck up, consider yourself overqualified for the position. This was an ideal position to lever yourself into a better position. Now your  employer will expect another rockstar, like you, and will have unrealistic expectations for future employees.\n\nMy wife went to undergrad for history overseas. When she came back she found work as a secretary for an academic lab. She became more interested in the science and so along with her administrative tasks she learned and took on more responsibilities related to the labs such as being responsible sample storage. She made great connections. She eventually went to grad school and became an analyst herself. In this case, she had spare time to look around and saw what she liked.

Not only are you making her aware that your job doesnt need close to 40 hours to fulfill, but you literally are a nuisance in reminding her of it.\n\nMy personal recommendation, keep yourself busy. If you finish your work tasks early keep something available and on hand to look busy with if you need, like an open tab of an email you composed and are about to send. If possible find other things to do on your own, if your supervisor wanted to micromanage your work schedule you would know it.",

Fom a business perspective, why should they pay you to be there, if you are not doing what they hired you to be there for. Most manager/admins aren't interested in improving their workplace or company, and will find you asking for things to do, to be tiresome and annoying, instead of helpful (which is what it really is). Most working ppl are content with doing the minimum requirements of them, and this includes management. When it's management, it can even make them feel inferior to see someone below them who is working harder than they do. \n\nBest advice I can give (I am the same as you @ work) is that if you are ever bored, take the initiative to just /do/ things. Clean up the desk, sweep the outside area, clean the break room, dust something, defragment a computer, etc. Respect to a fellow go-getter who hates being bored. If you have free time, improve the workplace for yourself and everyone. No one will tell you to stop, as long as the regular work is done. Good luck, guy. <3",

You supposedly were talking to yourself/not paying attention so you don't really know when she came in.\n\n-The detail about your funny voice \"always making you laugh\" seems strange, not saying it's impossible but it's kind of strange to do and a strange detail to include. The number of times I actually laugh at myself doing weird stuff are pretty low, especially if it's a habit/mannerism that I do often, at most I'll just grin or won't react at all.

Call it stereotypical, call it our customer base being old people with very little to do (and in the case of men VERY little to do), but that's how things were. Unfair, but I was a lad and didn't like that one bit. So one day I decided, to the stunned astoundment of my fellow workers, to start, continue and end a call while doing a female voice (yes, I can do that, or rather, I could.

I noticed a small red bump at the base of my penis, no way it was an STD related thing. Haha virgin Redditor. and I never let it touch public toilets. Also was at the top  left of the base\n\nAnyway I noticed it and thought it was a weird thing that just happens and left it alone. Fast forward a couple months and it's getting bigger, I employed my normal strategy of \"nah it's fine\" however a couple of days ago I noticed it's big and red. I looked it up and found out penis pimples or ingrown hairs are not uncommon, but this thing was big. If this sized pimple was on my face I would have popped it a long time ago. But this was more sensitive. \n\nI finally resolved to pop this fucker, it hadn't gone away for months and it clearly wasn't going to now. I was ready for the whole shebang, shave to make it easier, find a needle and sterilize it under a flame, have a box of tissue in hand, etc. \n\nIf only that had happened... As I was thinking of where to find a needle in my house I had to take a shit. So I do and then the thing fucking pops while I'm looking at it. I was actually a bit relieved that pus came out so I could be sure it was a pimple. But after I got the white pus out and it was blood, I realized it was still pretty big. I push onward and kept squeezing, after another layer of blood came out there was ANOTHER layer of pus. THEN an ingrown hair.\n\nWhat penis God did I piss off to deserve this??\n\nIt was still pretty big so I kept squeezing and a fucking third (albeit smaller) layer of pus came out. I kept squeezing even though it was pretty small and it was just blood coming out. The bleeding stopped quickly and it didn't hurt that bad somehow, I'm now waiting to see if it will go away. If not I'm going to a doctor. Also not going to fap for a few days, don't want want to reopen the wound and become a bloody wanker. \n\nTL;DR penis bump turned out to be a triple pimple and an ingrown hair, had to popped it before any prep work could be done. Hopefully not infected.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards lol. The bump has gotten smaller and I'm still applying Neosporin regularly, thanks for the tips y'all",

            "Hi there. I just went to Korea over the summer with my wife! Unfortunately we ended up on separate flights because we left/returned on separate days. \n\nNot sure how much your husband has traveled before. I was absolutely DREADING the flight (4 hours to San Fran then 12 to Seoul for me) but I actually had a wonderful time and the trip itself went great. \n\nSome tips:\n\n* 1) Go to Walgreens and pick up some Meclizine. It's for motion sickness and is available over the counter. It's like Dramamine and definitely can knock you out, but I never felt like it caused me to drag like Dramamine did once I woke up. Both flights this knocked me out for a good 3-4 hours. \n\n* 2) Go to Amazon and grab a comfy neck pillow. I got this one. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWFYCSG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\n* 3) My flight had plugs but I also picked up this cheap battery in case my headphones died. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005X1Y7I2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\n* 4) Get an Audible subscription. The first month is free so you can cancel. I recommend Red Rising. It's a good one and it occupied a lot of my time to listen to.\n\n* 5) Get a cheap surfacebook and buy Civilization 5 or 6. This alone took up a ton of my time. \n\n* 6) The flight showed good movies to take up some time. I recommend downloading the flight app BEFORE you board. My flight showed Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and a couple other good ones on the main screen, but you also have the option of a netflix-esque list of movies and shows on your phone/tablet.\n\n* 7) The food was absolutely terrific (for a flight meal). Hot and delicious. My flight had a baked chicken dish with rice and steamed carrots. Was really tasty. They actually served us 2 hot meals and 2 snacks. Besides these, definitely consider grabbing some snacks. I like simple peanut butter crackers.\n\n* 8) On that note, every time you are offered water, TAKE IT. It'll give you a good reason to move around and go to the bathroom. If you can find times to stretch your legs, go for it. And it has the added benefit of helping to avoid blood clots. \n\n* 9) If all else fails, my flight had free beer + wine. That alone should help him manage!\n\nShouldn't be too bad overall. Like I said, I was so dreading the experience and actually my flight overall went super well. I'm totally open to it now in the future, where before I thought I would do this one trip and not fly so far again for a few years. \n\nGood luck!",

I just haven\u2019t had a chance to write about it until now.\n\nThis is going to be a long one, but I feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).\n\nI\u2019m a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. To put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one I\u2019m enrolled in is a one-year program. So right of the bat, I\u2019m completing two years\u2019 worth of coursework in one. Secondly, I\u2019m now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. I always thought I had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what I\u2019m used to, and I still question all the time whether I\u2019m actually good enough to be here. Thirdly, I\u2019m not so great at handling stress. I am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but I\u2019m not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. And since that\u2019s all I can afford right now with my insurance, that\u2019s the best I can get.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019m stressed out all the time. And midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. Now, three of those papers weren\u2019t so bad. They took a while to write, but at least I knew what I was writing. Paper number four, however\u2026 Guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. This paper fucked me like I\u2019ve never been fucked in my whole life. And I\u2019m in an English-related field, so believe me, I am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (To be fair, we had from mid-August to mid-October to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) Now, if I were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, I\u2019d end up with a dissertation. In the limited space I have, I can\u2019t fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when I tell you it was *hard*. Yes, even though I\u2019d spoken to the professor about it a few times. And it was worth about a third of my grade.\n\nAnyway, this big bastard was due on a Monday, so I brought myself to the library on Friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. I tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, I *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). Now, at this point, it\u2019s not that I was losing willpower or energy. No: the problem was that I was freaking out. I wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *You\u2019re going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck\u2026* You get the idea. And then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; I *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely even hold my pen. My neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. And then.\n\nAnd *then*.\n\nI\u2019ve Googled this and haven\u2019t really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. But I\u2019ll recount the sensation as I experienced it. All of a sudden, I felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. I can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. My entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs\u2026 and lady bits. There I was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.\n\nI came before I even knew what was happening. It wasn\u2019t some screaming, thrashing affair, but I did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. And yes, people *definitely* noticed; I was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. I don\u2019t think I was obvious enough that anyone would conclude I\u2019d just had an orgasm in the library, but still\u2026 clearly *something* had happened. I packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.\n\nAs I said, I haven\u2019t really found a thorough explanation for this (though I haven\u2019t been searching too intensely). I have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. Mostly, though, I\u2019ve been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. For my part in this research, I state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.\n\nAlso, I got a 78 on the paper. But my professor assures me it won\u2019t end up tanking my grade.\n\nTL;DR: I got so stressed that I came involuntarily in my university library. Also, I may have masochistic tendencies and don\u2019t know who I am anymore.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.\n\nI'd just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: I did not procrastinate on this assignment. I completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. Given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time I could give myself to do it. The paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because I was so confused and stressed out. Normally I never put off things until the last minute. It just sort of happened this time because I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nSecondly, I am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. I recently told my therapist that I'd like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance. Hopefully, we'll be able to work together to figure out some solutions that work for me. Again, I'm very grateful for all the advice and input! I'm really glad I could make you guys laugh. You all have made me laugh, as well!",

            "Mild stress and anxiety can inhibit ability to orgasm, but extreme stress/anxiety can cause an adrenaline release on a scale that where is it possible to push the orgasm button. It is the same reason why people sometimes have orgasms while being sexually assaulted, because the adrenaline spike makes it happen.

It becomes a kind of a \"need\" more than a \"want\", and it's usually fairly quick and not even that pleasant, but yeah -- it makes it possible for me to keep working.  Oh, and I don't even need to touch myself to get to that point -- a little muscle squeezing and rubbing against my jeans, and boom.

So don't worry about people thinking you had an orgasm, and people freak out and have anxiety/panic attacks a lot during finals and such, so no big deal tbh. \n\n\nIt took me a long time to realize when people in a room stare at you for something, they are usually just thankful it isn't them, they don't judge you, if anything they feel bad for you \"freaking out\" over finals, like \"damn, she must've forgotten something was due in an hour\" kinda thing. \n\n\nDon't dwell on it, it just makes you feel worse about it.

Think about it from an outside perspective, how would you see someone if the same had happened to them? Some stranger making some weird crying noise, during finals, probably looks horrified, pretty understandable in my opinion.

I wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: You\u2019re going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck\u2026 You get the idea. And then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; I wanted to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely even hold my pen. My neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. And then.\n\nAnd then.\n\nI\u2019ve Googled this and haven\u2019t really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. But I\u2019ll recount the sensation as I experienced it. All of a sudden, I felt a massive rush of blood to my lower body. I can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. My entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs\u2026 and lady bits. There I was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.\n\nI came before I even knew what was happening. It wasn\u2019t some screaming, thrashing affair, but I did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. And yes, people definitely noticed; I was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been silent up until that point. I don\u2019t think I was obvious enough that anyone would conclude I\u2019d just had an orgasm in the library, but still\u2026 clearly something had happened. I packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.\n\nAs I said, I haven\u2019t really found a thorough explanation for this (though I haven\u2019t been searching too intensely). I have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. Mostly, though, I\u2019ve been finding articles about how stress and anxiety inhibit orgasm in women. For my part in this research, I state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.\n\nAlso, I got a 78 on the paper. But my professor assures me it won\u2019t end up tanking my grade.\n\nTL;DR: I got so stressed that I came involuntarily in my university library. Also, I may have masochistic tendencies and don\u2019t know who I am anymore.\n",

            "I had a similar experience a few months ago! \n\nI was fairly fresh out of training at a new job, and was working on a self-driven project that involved rewriting a training manual. I was trying to reach a goal of having a certain amount typed up and finished by the end of my work day, which would have been 6pm. Basically, I was incredibly stressed out because my new boss seemed to be observing my progress with increasing (although quiet) impatience throughout the day, and I really wanted to impress him! \n\nThe tasks I was trying to complete seemed to stretch on and on, and I was becoming frustrated with my pace of progress as the hours continued to pass. My new boss silently lurked by me every so often, eyeing my progress for a while before wandering off.m without a word. As the end of my scheduled work day came and went, I continued to work in intense anxiety. \n\nWhen the office door opened, the sound startled me so much that I jumped noticeably. I immediately tried to play it cool, hoping to hide the frazzled state I was in. My new boss strode in and began, \u201cWell throwaway, ...\u201d\n\nI was instantly in a panic. For whatever reason (very little sleep the night before?) my brain jumped to the immediate conclusion that I was in trouble. New Boss was /disappointed/ in me and my agonizingly slow progress. He had come to let me know how thoroughly unimpressed he was. This panic knocked the figurative wind out of me, and I was immediately filled intense shame. The brief silence that followed, \u201cwell throwaway, ...\u201d stretched on for what felt like minutes, and I felt a quiver. I orgasmed almost immediately (but completely silently, somehow), and it was one of my most intense orgasms ever. It took everything I had in that moment to not moan out loud or shudder in an obvious manner. New Boss continued his sentence: \u201cwell throwaway, I tried to wait you out, but you haven\u2019t left. I\u2019m going to get going\u201d.\n\nIt turns out that he was hardly waiting around to shame me for my ineptitude - he just wanted to beat traffic.\n\nWeird,huh?",

I\u2019ve got to beat this record, but I really don\u2019t want to get in trouble. She yells out my name and looks at me angrily. But I gotta keep going. And right as I\u2019m about to finish my last lap, something inside me exploded.

I justified it by saying it\u2019ll save me time from having to go out and get girls IRL blah blah. And also I kinda thought it\u2019d provide some company while I\u2019m home alone lol. \n\nI was looking at these $3,000 dolls and almost made the purchase but found a cheaper one for just around $1k. I couldn\u2019t justify spending $3k knowing that there would be a high chance I\u2019d regret it.\n\nIt came in a big box, I hauled it into my bedroom, it ways about 30kg.. I underestimated just how much that weighs. So I sliced open the box and started removing the packaging and I could see it\u2019s little fucking toes poking out and I was like\u2026 oh shit\u2026 here we go. Kept removing the packaging and of course I grabbed the tits as soon as I saw them. They\u2019re okay, but nothing like the real thing ofc. \n\nI pulled the cold corpse of a doll out of its box\u2026 it didn\u2019t have its head screwed on.. so I unwrapped the head, plonked that on.. and it\u2019s a half decent looking thing. Better than I was expecting tbh. I wasted no time sticking the electric warming stick up it\u2019s pussy, waited a few minutes, dumped it on the bed and.. well, we had a play. \n\nNgl\u2026 it\u2019s better than a hand or pocket pussy but believe me, once you \u201cfinish\u201d\u2026 you now have to wrestle it\u2019s cold body, clean what needs to be cleaned (in this case I unscrewed it\u2019s head and basically force fed it water in the sink lol). I hadn\u2019t yet thought\u2026 where tf do I store this thing. It\u2019s about 160cm tall\u2026 so I plonked it in my closet on a cabinet wrapped it in a blanket and Jesus Christ.. it looks like a corpse.. literally. I now have to walk in there every day to be greeted by a cold wrapped up corpse when I need to grab some clothes. The heck do I do with it, it\u2019s corpse or bye bye $1k. \n\ntl;dr: If you aren\u2019t actually THAT lonely and only getting a sex doll \u201cout of curiosity\u201d, there is a very big chance you\u2019ll regret it.",

The other thing is that the skin is flimsy. One of the fingers broke off easily and you need material to repair it. Not to mention the \"bones\" of the fingers are twisted pieces of metal that bend easily but can also break off. Most of the nails fell off and the head frequently falls off. \n\nI know when/if I move, I'll eventually have to figure out what to do (I kept the box which was just cardboard) and it is admittedly embarrassing to have lying around when the maintenance crew come around. In that last instance, I have to just place a bunch of blankets over her and hope that they don't think I'm keeping a dead body around.\n\n\nThat said, I don't regret it.

Parents caught us in the middle of something that looks extremely awkward from the outside, like a weird game? No, god no. If a god is out there, clearly I haven't prayed enough because holy fuck. The things I'd do to take this back.\n\nTo preface this, me and my mom are quite close. We talk a lot about topics most people can't with their parents from masturbation to marriage issues. My girlfriend knows I'm quite open about a lot of stuff, like the fact that I watch hentai and jerk off almost excessively. Yes, you can reach this level of openness with your parents. I'm not anywhere near as close with my dad, but my mom (and some younger siblings, who cares) was the only person home at the time. What my girlfriend didnt know is that me and my mom do not under any circumstances discuss our kinks or fetishes. My girlfriend did however know I like to crossdress(among some other stuff.)\n\nSo my mom picks us up, gf and mom meet eachother and talk about some stuff. They're just casually chatting and then my mom makes a joke about me having panties in my drawer. I shrug it off with some comments about how I do you know, adding to the joke. We are laughing then my girlfriend starts saying \"Well uhm yeah you know how he um... yeah does that and stuff\" and variations of it for what felt like the longest 5 or so seconds of my life. I would love to see the look on my face as she basically told my OWN MOTHER that I crossdress for sexual pleasure. She didn't explicitly say, but it was heavily implied by context, and the fact that I instantly started panicking, the look on my face and body language would have given it away. My mom is a smart person, and she definitely would've known.\n\nTLDR; Invited gf to house, she told my mom I wear panties sometimes.",

People insulat them with some elastic foam and \"aluminium\" (something reflecting infrared and looking like aluminium, usually silver and gold).\n\nThen you expose more or less of pipes to have more or less heat.\n\nIt's not ideal, but much better than opening your window.\n\nBy dissipating heat outside, you are taking it from those further down the line which us uncool. Also, if there was complaints, owner may have to \"go full steam\" and increase the bill for everyone.\nOn top of that, your bug problem!\n\nSo, that worth your investment. Not only for you, but your community!\n\nAnd if you are lucky, you may have some words with the owner. Maybe they can even participate financially or gice you pointers on how to do the insulation. \n\nThere is probably a neighbour already doing it!\n\nAlso, if your radiators are in a parallel circuits, the system **may** accomodate a change in volume. Meaning you may be able to install valves. Owner should be able to help with that.\n\nIt's even possible that there is a bypass already in place! (pipe forking with a valve on it).",

I relented, but told her it was up to her to get me into the bar and order at the bar for us so I didn\u2019t get in trouble for not speaking Irish. She agreed happily and we headed out that night. \n\nSo we get to the bar, and she tells me when it\u2019s our turn to speak to the bouncer, just say \u201cdia dhuit\u201d, which means hello, and she\u2019ll chat away to distract him. Our plan goes off without a hitch, and we\u2019re in! I turn, ready to ask my friend to order me a drink, to find her lost in the eyes of a boy she\u2019d met a few nights previously. Not wanting to get in her way, I just gently shook her shoulder, and we have a conversation as follows. \n\nMe: \u201cHey, how do I ask for an Orchard Thieves in Irish?\u201d \n\nFriend: \u201cOh, uh, Orchard Thieves... le do thoil\u201d\n\nI nod and leave her to it, and make my way determinedly to the bar. The bar man comes over and says something in Irish I can\u2019t understand, so I panic, and just shout out my order. \n\n\u201cLe do thoil!\u201d\n\nThe barman returns a blank look. I take this as him not having understood me, and decide I need to be more clear. \n\n\u201cLE. DO. THOIL.\u201d\n\nThe bar man cocks his head, and says something that I again, don\u2019t understand. Now fully panicking, I decide to just keep repeating myself in different inflections until he gets me. \n\n\u201cLe DO Thoil? LE Do Thoil? Le Do THOIL?\u201d\n\nEventually the barman interrupts me. \n\n\u201cJesus Christ girl just speak English. What do you want?!\u201d \n\n\u201cJust an Orchard Thieves!\u201d\n\nThe bar man walks away, muttering, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say so?\u201d \n\nEmbarrassed my friend had put me in this position, I marched up to her and yanked her off the boy who she\u2019d been chatting up. \n\n\u201cWhat did you tell me to say?\u201d I demand. \n\n\u201cHuh? I told you how to say Orchard Thieves please?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah well, clearly the way you say it is wrong, because the barman had no idea what I was saying.\u201d\n\nMy friend looks at me suspiciously. \u201cPzych, what did you say, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said le do thoil. And I said it a bunch of ways as well, so there\u2019s no way I got the pronunciation wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d my friend responds. \u201cYou said JUST le do thoil?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah!\u201d I replied, indignant. \u201cThat\u2019s what you told me to say!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I told you to say Orchard Thieves le do thoil! Le do thoil means please you eejit!\u201d\n\nAnd then it dawned on me. Of course you don\u2019t translate Orchard Thieves- it\u2019s a brand name! So that meant that I was just repeating, in varying tones and levels of panic, \u201cplease please please\u201d to this poor bar tender. \n\nI am, indeed, an eejit. \n\nTL;DR: I misunderstood how to ask for a drink in Irish, and ended up just repeating \u201cplease\u201d to the poor bartender with varying levels of panic.\n\nEdit: for all those people trying to correct me to say it\u2019s meant to be [Gaelic](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.unitedlanguagegroup.com/blog/gaelic-vs-irish-whats-the-difference%3Fhs_amp%3Dtrue)",

I do love singing tho, especially when I think I\u2019m alone. \n\nCurrently I am staying in Croatia and there\u2019s a small town nearby with a tiny tiny church. Me and my girlfriend went inside and there were amazing acoustics inside. (The type where you can sing great operas or horror movie soundtracks) \n\nI decided to firstly sing the Halo theme song and it sounded great. \n\nWe went outside and decided to grab a drink before leaving the town, but on our way out we walked past the church again. I begged me gf to go inside again so I could sing a song from the Hobbit (misty mountains) and decided to record it. My girlfriend was embarrassed and decided to stay outside whilst I sang at almost the loudest I could and I think it sounded amazing. (I haven\u2019t listened to the recording because I\u2019m too scared to). \n\nAfter I finished the song I went outside of the door and at that moment I noticed that the church was across the street from a restaurant. A restaurant filled with probably 50/60 tourists just STARING at me. \n\nAll. Of. Them. \n\nMy girlfriend was standing around the corner with the biggest grin ever saying that a lot of people were recording and laughing at it. \n\nMe being a person with incredible anxiety issues (yay for therapy) decided that the best option was to just... run away. Not looking back a single time. \n\nIt was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life and it gives me shivers everytime I think back. \n\nTL;DR found a church with amazing acoustics where I decided to sing a song from the Hobbit, but accidentally sang for a lot of people that were across the street.\n\nEdit: [here\u2019s the video of me singing](https://streamable.com/7cg7di)",

I know it's sometimes hard to reconcile this with how you might feel, but even if you were as bad you seem to think, you're probably never gonna see any of those people again except your girlfriend and this will probably just be a funny story you two have of your time in Croatia.\n\nIf you embrace this, you'll have a funny memory  that'll bring you far more joy than the suffering of the embarrassment.\n\nEdit: also I can't speak for all of those people, but hearing people sing for happiness always makes me happy, so you've probably made a few of those tourists day and definitely brought a smile to mine just from hearing it. If nothing else, take some joy from that.",
            "That's honestly not a fuck up if I were there I'd probably be like god dang that's the bravest person I ever saw I sure as heck wouldn't sing in public like that and would have been inspired all day",
            "Not sure there's anything to be embarrassed at. You've given those tourists some thing they will actually remember, either as an amusing anecdote or as something they enjoyed. Sure it was odd in the moment, but no one was hurt and you got to enjoy yourself too",
            "Post the audio!",
            "You enjoyed it while it was happening yes? And you will never see any of these people again? Enjoy the memory. Think of it like this, you gave 50-60 other people a memory too; one that will make them smile for years to come. Lean into it bro!",

            "I hope that OP sees this so it makes him feel better.\n\nI proposed to my now fiance almost a year ago. I did it in an incredibly cheesy way by greeting her at the door when she got home from work. I was all dressed up, flowers in hand, house nice and tidy, and our dog (her entire world) had a very basic 3D printed box tied around his collar with ribbon, and the box had the ring box in it. She came in, I gave her flowers, and then got the ring, did a short speech, and proposed. It. Was. SO. CHEESY. I'm no romantic, I just wanted to make it involve her/our dog. She fucking loved it, but I was so embarrassed that at one point I just sat there rubbing her arm during my speech. I'm blushing just typing this. I've never watched the recording I took of it because I'm too nervous. This has given me the courage to watch it with her later.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is don't feel bad about doing something that brings you good feelings because that's all that matters!\n\nUpdate: I just watched it and cried and also died of embarrassment, but so happy I watched it. Thanks for the unknowing motivation OP!",
            "That wasn't a fuck up. That. Was. Awesome.\n\n\nSeriously, I LOVE hearing people sing in public. It makes me happy. I bet a lot of those people felt the same way.",
            "Myself and my girlfriend are both professional musicians. We have played to many different types of audiences and also have witnessed hundreds of performances of varying levels from passionate amateurs to polished professionals. \n\n10/10 times, people much prefer listening to music coming straight from the heart rather than something that has been perfectly executed. It is a clearly audible difference and I guarantee that the restaurant customers absolutely loved it. Music making is an incredible thing and I promise you with absolute certainty that you made the day of several people sitting in that restaurant. They will have loved it.\n\nEdit: Just listened to the video of your singing - you have a lovely soft timbre to your voice that is very soothing for the ears. Together with the ringing acoustics amplifying your lovely overtones, I bet that it would have been very pleasing indeed to anyone that was within earshot.",

Consider looking up \"diaphragm voice support\" for a starting point.  Find a good vocal coach if you want to push your vocal boundaries without hurting yourself.  Good technique is never strained!\n\nYou're untrained, but seriously, you sound great, and music belongs to everyone!  I would have loved a free concert with my meal!",

            "I personally think this is great.  When I was much younger i worked in timeshare housekeeping.  Often when i cleaned the guests were not there and on Sundays was checkout and i had the bldg to myself.  Back then I had a cd walkman (90s) I would listen to.  So anyways one Sunday i belt out an entire song, I was into it man.  I was 15 and the spray bottle became a mike and I sing the entire song at the top of my lungs and I hear clapping behind me.

            "A real story! Thank you!",
            "Sir, let me tell you 2 things. \n1.\tI sing all the time because it makes my heart feel good, lifts my mood and makes whatever I\u2019m doing more enjoyable. For YEARS I was too afraid to sing out loud because my parents would shame/bully me when I sang at home or in the shower (I come from a family of musicians, but also abusers). I had to sing in choir as an elective in high school and my parents told me that if I didn\u2019t mouth the words instead of singing I would just embarrass myself and them. My choir teacher wouldn\u2019t let that fly (obviously) so I skipped our final concert and ended up with a D in the class. Flash forward a few years my college dorms. I was in the shower, positive that I was alone on my hall because everyone was supposed to have moved out, so I belted out a song that I love (gravity by Sara Bareilles). Turns out there were 3 people who were still not moved out of the hall and they heard every note. One of the girls was a very talented singer so I was mortified. Here I was in a towel, ready to cry from shame and embarrassment at the sight of them when she turns to me and says \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you sing, you have a nice voice. It reminds me of Ingrid Michaelson.\u201d Wait...what. I didn\u2019t really believe her because of many many years if conditioning, but that was the beginning of a lesson I needed to learn and that\u2019s this\n2.\tPeople are always going to judge you one way or the other, but their judgement shouldn\u2019t change how you live your life. If you want to sing, sing as much as you want. People will either love it, hate it, or be indifferent, but that happens with famous musicians too. You don\u2019t know how many of those people stopped to listen because they enjoyed it. Maybe all of them for all you can guess. Also your voice is fine. The only issue I maybe hear is the same I hear in myself and that\u2019s a lack of confidence, experience and maybe breathe control. Keep singing my man. I enjoyed it.",
            "you were told people were recoridng and laughing. well people laugh out of joy. youre conditioned to feel it as ridicule on instinct, but, i guarantee you many people who heard this absolutely enjoyed and and love it.",
            "Those acoustics must've been something else.",
            "Actually badass, dude.   \n\n\nCroatia is a beautiful place too.",
            "I like your singing. Practice! C:",
            "Never feel embarrassed about singing man!  It\u2019s a great way to express yourself and like any skill you will get better the more you practice",
            "Sound person here. First, your singing was fine. Second, you were not singing close to loud-at all. So if there were people outside across the street...if they could hear you, even it\u2019s it\u2019s reverberating , it would never be louder than your singing. So I\u2019m guessing they heard a quiet, ghostly singing and were more intrigued than anything. \n\nKnow what I mean? I\u2019m sure they heard you, but I bet it was way less intense than you\u2019re imagining.",

            "my question is why the girlfriend didnt tell OP about the crowd outside :( especially if some of them were laughing at them.",
            "Hate to say it but I think your girlfriend was projecting a lot onto the diners.\n\nIf I heard any singing coming from an old church anytime, anywhere I might laugh in a \"how cool is that!\" way, but I'd love it. They might have been smiling or laughing because it was unexpected, but I think she was projecting her embarassment or dislike for your singing onto the folks at the restaurant. I would have clapped. You probably didn't hear them over your anxiety, though, sadly, or because of projection assumed it was mocking or sarcasm.",

            "I appreciate you're embarrassed by this, but honestly I think your Gf should be embarrassed about her behaviour. Hear me out. You chose to do something that brought you JOY. So much joy that later in the day you decided to go back and do the thing again.\n\nPeople were probably stopping to listen and record because it's fucking cool that a church can carry acoustics like that.\n\nYour GF should be ashamed for telling you that people were LAUGHING at you. She should be embarrassed for focusing on her perceptions of their opinions/reactions, rather than appreciating that you found joy in something and followed your heart here. I think she's a major asshole for choosing to focus on something other than supporting you. She puts her own needs first here.\n\nWho gives a shit if you didn't sing that great? I don't think it's that complicated to appreciate the impressive acoustics of a space and think it's cool than to forgo all of that and jump straight to, \"wow you sing like shit and people were laughing at you.\"\n\nHave you ever seen something so cool that you kinda chuckle a bit? Perhaps those people weren't laughing AT you at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just went back and listened to the audio, you sound fucking amazing. That church is cool as hell and you sang the perfect song to show off the acoustics of the space.",

            "Own it! You were feeling great!  I once butt dialed my husband while in my car singing at the top of my lungs. It was 3:00 in the morning I was on my way to work, he was sleeping, so it went to his voice mail.   I can't carry a note.",

            "Hey, OP, first of all: you're not bad, my guy. Don't sell yourself short.  \nI'll be splitting the rest in parts.  \n1. I get how you felt. I'm anxious as \\*\\*\\*\\*. It used to be worse, to the point of hindering my everyday life and almost being crippling (hell, I just came back after typing this huge wall of text, and thought of not hitting comment because I started getting anxious). There is one piece of advice that I received some time ago, that I keep repeating until I manage to get a hold of myself, and it is something I wish everyone would hear every once in a while. **The world doesn't revolve around us/me/you**. The people at the restaurant might have been looking at you at that moment, and, yes, one of them might have disliked your singing, but that person probably went on with their day, and forgot all about it by dinner. I get that, as anxious people, we're always concerced with the \"what ifs\"... The thing is, other people also have their \"what ifs\", their concerns and anxieties -- but 99% of the time, we're not at the center of it. We should also try not to put them at the center of ours.\n\n2. I've been taking singing lessons for a couple of years now, and, listening to the recording, there's a tinge of uncertainty... Something between a \"how should I tackle this note?\" and a \"what if someone hears me?\". As many people have already pointed out: when you sing, just sing for yourself. Don't think too much, just enjoy the music you're making and try to forget about everything else; let yourself the rockstar for those 5-odd minutes. You enjoy singing, and you're clearly able to hit the right notes when your mind's not wandering. You have at least some skill, so work on convincing your audience and yourself that you own it, and go ahead and kill it.\n\nP.S.: Singing has become a big part of how I'm getting better mentally, so I figured I'd share some tips and tricks for a fellow anxious singer. If you don't read this or are fine just singing for the hell of it, it's all good. If you end up trying any of it, I hope it is of some help. Anyway. Some are things I picked up from my lessons, others I found out through trial and error. (I'm not sure if you've ever taken lessons, so a couple are kinda beginner-oriented)  \nP.P.S. I *might* have gone too far...  \nP.P.P.S. Yes, I definitely did.\n\n\\- Before anything else (and this is the biggest tip I could ever give you): remember to always respect your voice. As a rule of thumb, if you feel your throat 'tingle', or if your larynx gets tired, stop singing and rest. Tingling means you're forcing yourself in a way that may harm you if you insist on it (using the wrong technique to apply distortion, fry, etc), so rest and recover. A tired larynx means you've hit your limit, which is partially good, because that's part of how you can develop your range and volume if done properly; however, try to rest between long karaoke/practice sessions, as the muscles in the larynx need time to rest and adapt.\n\n\\- High notes are dangerous beasts. They can sound wicked, but are just as capable of ruining your voice if you push yourself too much on the higher end of the scale. This is doubly true for opera, due to the pressure applied on vocal apparatus as a whole. If opera is your thing, always be mindful of the range you're going to be singing in... Too much pressure on the higher register can put you out of commission for a couple of days. Also, more on this later, but remember to use your diaphragm, not your throat for volume and pressure.\n\n\\- Try to keep the muscles in your torso taut, especially on your chest and back, even while breathing out. This will help you a lot with keeping your neck and throat relaxed and stable.\n\n\\- There are loads of vocal exercises on YouTube and Spotify... Try to find your vocal range and go from there. Remember that you can almost always go higher than you think if you use your diaphragm correctly, but also that it also pays to be careful. Slowly build your up the scale, don't try to tackle the high notes right from the beginning.\n\n\\- If opera is your thing, one of the easiest ways to learn by yourself is to sing as if you're mocking an opera singer. Just remember the thing about high notes and pressure.\n\n\\- A trick for placing your voice in an opera style, which I learned from [Malinda](https://youtu.be/UtEa_Vu9vs8?t=455), is this: first, warm up using the DVBT (Darth Vader Breathing Technique). Just breathe in and out a couple times like Darth Vader; it helps lower your larynx into a position more conducive to propagating sound. Second: when you're actually singing, imagine as if you're trying to sing towards a little crown on the back of your head.\n\n\\- Sing as if you were sitting down, talking to a friend, relaxing over a glass/cup of your preferred beverage. That is one of the best mindsets for singing. It's much easier to be a rockstar when you're just talking to a friend. (Try not to actually practice while sitting down, though. It's harder to use your diaphragm and you can develop bad habits if you're not used to controlling your abdominal musculature.)\n\n\\- Humming to the tune with your tongue resting on your palate is a great way to hit the right notes and place your voice correctly.\n\n\\- Try to sing with the tip of your tongue pressed against the back of your lower front teeth. It helps maintain a clear passage of air, and allows notes to carry their sounds better. \n\n\\- Avoid using your throat to sing loudly (compression). It takes some getting used to, but try to use your diaphragm to give volume and push your voice out. That way you put less stress on your glottis when you want to sing more aggressively or with more volume. It is also one of the safest ways to approach things like vocal fry, distortion, or rasp. If you do it right, when you stop pushing your diaphragm, your voice should be at the volume of a normal conversation, regardless of how loud it gets when you're going crazy.\n\n\\- If you want to try your hand at distortion, watch out for where you feel the raspiness. If you feel it behind your jaw or below your ears, be careful. This means you're probably compressing your glottis too much in order to strangle the sound, and you might end up hurting yourself and losing your voice if you keep at it for too long. A well done distortion will be felt closer to your nose or the front of your palate, and can be done, to an extent, without using too much volume; in fact, most of the volume should, once again, come from your diaphragm pushing your volume up. That said, there are proper ways to use glottal compression, but it takes a great deal of technique to do it without hurting yourself.\n\nAnd I've already gone on way longer than I thought I would...  \nTime for the awkward goodbye!",

Don't discount that.\n\nPractice singing that song and go back and record it again next year. And then the year after that. Make it a tradition. Sing more from your diaphram. Nail it. Own it.\n\nI'll be waiting for next year's performance.",
            "Dude, that was pretty good. No reason to feel bad if you were enjoying it. If other people laugh, let 'em. You do you, as long as you aren't hurting anyone or putting others in danger. You obviously did not, so you are golden, man. Keep on singing!",
            "Dude! That was awesome!!!",
            "Awesome! Don\u2019t be ashamed, your singing isn\u2019t laughable. They were amused because you were so excited.",

            "Me and my girlfriend took a trip to [Nidaros Cathedral](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaros_Cathedral) this summer and while inside, we heard a beautiful sound, almost angelic. A woman was sitting with her friends on some chairs and were singing. I\u2019m not a religious guy, but hearing her voice, standing in that old cathedral, in these 2020-times, was a such a relief. I hope I never forget that moment.",

            "You felt embarrassment.  Notice you didn\u2019t die. And got lots of love on reddit. And tourists noticed and enjoyed. Do what you want to do and screw everyone else. If you aren\u2019t hurting or aurally assaulting them, sing!  This is how you improve",

            "After watching the Misty Mountain singing, I really really want to hear you do the Halo theme.

Not looking back a single time.\n\n\"Aww dang man, I hope you're doing alright now\"",
            "I 100% unironically think that it sounded very good!! Definitely not something to be embarrassed about. The parts that aren\u2019t fully on key, don\u2019t even deviate enough to sound bad. It all sounds very warm and comforting :)",
            "You know how to have fun. What is there to be embarrassed about?!",
            "It\u2019s actually not bad. Your voice matches the tune and melody. I had to rewatch the dwarves singing it.",

Obviously that church acoustics brought you immense joy, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have gone back. Don\u2019t let anyone take that joy away from you. It\u2019s okay to feel embarrassed, but just remember the joy in that story too.",

            "Professional (former) singer here - this is so charming! It has a raw vulnerability that you don't often hear from more polished performers. I totally get the anxiety aspect (as someone who has it themselves) but consider that this was actually a really cool moment.

Kudos to you for trying something new and being brave - and being willing to share it after the fact! :)",
            "It works.  I would love to see you work with a voice coach and come back to us in 6 months.

            "Good on you man! Especially for then posting the video! I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to sing in there even when it was empty! The acoustics were good in there and you wanted to sing so don\u2019t worry about anyone else, the main thing is that you did something you wanted to do and enjoyed yourself and didn\u2019t let the anxiety stop you!

            "Idk if this makes you feel any better, but if I were there I would have been so happy for you. \n\nNot because you felt embarrassed, but because you went and sang your heart out despite not being a great singer. You had fun. For that short period of time, you didn\u2019t care\u2014you just wanted to sing. \n\nI admire that. And, quite frankly, I\u2019m a bit jealous.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a bathroom at the local tennis court with amazing acoustics and I\u2019ve definitely gone in there just to sing loudly.

In the early 1990s a friend and I embarked on a tour of Europe for a two-week vacation (no tour company involved, just a Frommer's guide and a Eurail pass). We'd made our way to Lucerne, Switzerland, and were taking a cable car ride up Mt. Titlis. The car made this kind of rhythmic thumping noise as it climbed up the mountain (maybe the cable needed oil?), but for some reason the sound reminded my exhausted mind of *The Jeffersons* TV theme song, and I started singing it softly (or so I thought). I'm no great vocalist, and my traveling friend even less so, and I was surprised when she chimed in with the responsive \"movin' on up...\" We stopped half way through and laughed but other (non-English speaking) passengers on the car shouted \"No, no, go, more!\" and clapped their hands. We started over and finished the song, and while my friend was a bit embarrassed I was emboldened by the \"more!\" requests so I started singing the theme to *Gilligan's Island.* Many of the other passengers joined in along with me.",

            "Dude they probably weren't laughing cause your singing sucked just so bad. They were probably laughing because of the situation itself, you thought you were alone and your girlfriend wouldnt come inside and so you sang at the top of your lungs and didnt give a fuck, that's awesome and very funny to witness, especially when they saw your face when you came out and realized there were a big group of people all listening to you.\nJust because people are laughing at something involving you doesnt mean they were laughing to make fun of you.  You gotta lighten up and learn to laugh at yourself and with others. I would have taken a bow to them and just ran with it, they probably would have given you a round of applause.\n\nEdit: just watched the video, honestly dude, coming from another singer, you dont sound bad in the slightest! You've got a great tone to your voice, I would just let it out and sing loud if you want to, I've learned nobody gives a shit. I sing to myself while I'm walking around stores, not very loud mind you so that I dont disturb anyone or look like an attention whore, and nobody gives two shits.",
            "Kinda disappointed the video is just him recording the church inside while he\u2019s singing. I was really expecting a recording from outside of how his singing coming from inside sounded. Then running away.",

            "bruh you did amazing! you shoulda stayed and charged them",
            "That's not a fuck up. That was great and it would be amusing to hear that coming out of an old church and stopping for a second the figure out why it sounds so familiar and then realizing \"some bloody genius is singing the theme to the Hobbit in there!\"\n\nGood job!",
            "With a little training your voice will be incredible. But what I just heard was VERY nice. If you enjoyed it, who gives a damn about tourists. Good for you singing stranger.",
            "That sounded awesome dude",
            "Holy shit I do the exact same thing, with those exact same two songs",
            "I think the audio sounds great, nothing to be embarrassed about! Excellent story too haha",
            "I see how this could be embarrassing, but you\u2019re not even bad. I don\u2019t know why they were laughing though. Maybe the thought of some random guy singing is funny? I dunno",
            "That was a actually pretty cool.",
            "Upvote for Misty Mountains, that was actually pretty good my dude",
            "I once had a very close friend who couldn\u2019t carry a tune in a bucket but, when he sang, he put his all into it. It sounded horrendous but, the feeling it gave me to see him expressing something that gave him so much joy, gave me joy. I never said anything to him about his singing because I loved knowing that gave him so much pleasure.he wasn\u2019t trying to be something he wasn\u2019t. He was expressing who he was and what he felt and that was a beautiful thing. I\u2019m sure you are the only one distressed by your performance. You don\u2019t know how many smiles you brought to complete strangers that day. To be able to do that while you were just having fun should bring you joy as well. You keep singing as much as you want and never let fear of ridicule stop you. You do you and let other people see the joy it brings you. The world need more of that.",
            "Should have walked out and just said \u201cwow, have you heard that guy?\u201d \nWhen you walk out they can only assume it was you singing. That was your fuck up.",
            "Honestly dude,, you sounded amazing! I would take what you have and train your voice because you have serious potential guy",
            "Tbh I would have loved to witness that. You probably gave a lot of people a hilarious memory.",
            "I'd be waaaay too embarrassed to sing in a room like that, even alone, so big props to you for going for it with confidence (especially for someone with anxiety!).  I listened to your audio and I think it's lovely. Singing for the love of it is quite an attractive quality in a person.",
            "Bro, you sound great",
            "Nah you sounded good man",
            "Take it from someone who does embarrassing things ALL THE TIME, just remember that they will never ever see you again, and that they probably forgot about it by dinner. We do things we think of all day and all night, just imagining how other people are laughing at us. But honestly people are so preoccupied with themselves that they forget about other people pretty quickly",
            "The tourists fucked up by not joining in. I would have joined at the chorus and really give them a voice to laugh at. A few missed notes is nothing to be embarrassed about.",
            "Your recording sounds amazing",
            "You should've just taken a bow and left. :)",
            "The most embarrassing moment of your life, so far.",
            "You have a nice voice, you just need to work on your pitch a bit. Nothing to be ashamed about!",
            "Fuckin own it man. That\u2019s awesome. You\u2019ll never see any of those people again. I bet you were great",

            "Dude that was incredible! Own that!",
            "Reminds me of that scene in [Toni Erdmann where the dad pressures the daughter to sing at a party](https://youtu.be/pzQ8c7suff4)",
            "Your singing isn\u2019t bad at all, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.",
            "Yo real talk the only problem I read and Heard was little confidence the music was great my guy and I 100% believe u can still improve",
            "wow amazing story and memory forever!",
            "Not a fuck up.  You had more courage then I would have.  You are (to me) a hero.",
            "That is more like an epic memory to me.",
            "Totes not a fuck up. They got dinner and an awesome show!",
            "Hey man, you\u2019re never going to see any of those people ever again. They got a good story, you got to sing and enjoy yourself. Let it be positive for everyone!!",
            "That sounds soo good. Hope you enjoyed it :D",
            "We really need to close the loop by finding one of the bystanders who recorded it.  I would have been so excited to hear random LOTR!",
            "Not a fu. You sounded great.  Be proud of that!!!!!",
            "some wholesome TIFU right here",
            "Dude thats not a fuck up at all. As long as you had fun, thats all that matters.",
            "If I encountered this unexpectedly whilst dining, I too would have laughed...but out of sheer glee.  That would be so awesome and unexpected to experience. You brought many people happiness, and I am sure they were not laughing to mock, but rather laughing with enjoyment. Also, this is one of my most favorite songs! Great job OP. -A former incredibly serious singer.",
            "Not a fuck up \n\nYou were great",
            "My go to song, when faced with amazing acoustics, is the Tiger Song from the Hangover.\n\nMe: \"What do tigers dream of, when they a little tiger snooze \"",
            "This would have made me So happy if someone did this while I was eating at a restaurant. You're not always perfectly on note but you definitely have a great quality to your voice that's a blessing to listen to. Thank you so much for sharing this, it really made my heart smile.",
            "Its not that bad of a singing you know",
            "What are the odds you'll see any of those people ever again?\n\nFuck em. Let em judge.",
            "Sounded pretty good to me!!",

            "Dude, you had good tune. You are not nearly as bad as you think. Honestly with a few breathing exercises and techniques, you could probably be a decent Karaoke singer (with the right song of course).",
            "You actually sound pretty awesome... absolutely NOTHING to feel bad about. You had fun & sounded great, good for you.",
            "I got chills from hearing you sing!",
            "You should have looked at all of them and bowed deeply.  It sounded pretty good to me. I don\u2019t think I could remember the words.",
            "You just gotta ownbit and  laugh. Stopbeing so insecure, leave that stuff up to the women",
            "OMG. I would have thought (and think) this is most adorable thing ever. I recently discovered I like to sing.. and sometimes I sound decent. I find songs I think I do well with and sing often. Do what makes your heart happy. Those folks are probably shocked they never thought of it before. I bet someone else ran over to sing too.",
            "That sounds good not a fuck up :)",
            "Listened to the recording and I loved it! It doesnt need to be perfect, I enjoyed listening to someone doing something he clearly likes doing! \u2764\ufe0f",
            "Embrace it, don't fight it.\n\nLife's short, and it was honestly kinda cool. It's going to be a cute memory that you have with your GF",
            "Aww situations like this should be used to alleviate those fears you have! You sang your heart out and that's the WORST thing that happened? I mean if you were truly bad someone would have stopped you! You obviously have a desire to sing and I hope nothing stops you from now on, friend. Go for it!",
            "Gotta tell ya....when the time comes that YOU can look back on the moment and SMILE and feel GOOD about yourself, it\u2019s FREEING! Not giving a crap about what anyone else thinks makes your life so much fuller. I can promise you this....you felt good while doing it and that\u2019s what matters. So, when you\u2019re ready, try to switch your thinking....and build that inner confidence, because once it\u2019s there, hold onto it! It\u2019s incredibly liberating! Don\u2019t even know you...but damn proud of you for doing it!",
            "This is awesome and you sound great!\n\nNow I feel like my family/friends and I should practice a go-to song we all have for just this type of occasion! Maybe we'll start simple, like a round of Rose, Rose, Rose Red.\n\nWhat if we all practiced like 3-4 songs and could drop-in/join someone if we ever heard them being sung!?\n(Some of my friends were in choir together and break into beautiful song at random moments.)",
            "not bad.  I thought I was gonna hear a frog singing.  but this is not bad",
            "You can actually sing lol this is awesome not a fuck up.",

            "Dude, you actually sound good. I don\u2019t think people were laughing at you as much as you think.",
            "it ain't cancer, sounds like people enjoyed it. props to you sir",
            "I wouldn't say this was a fuck up OP, though I would say you're girlfriend probably shouldn't have pointed out that the restaurant was laughing as they recorded you.. Thats most likely what heightened your anxiety and lead the flight instinct. You've got courage and it shows in your voice. You're not a professional but you're not a terrible singer either, if you enjoy singing then do it! Make yourself happy and forget what the world says. Easier said then done I know, but keep my advice in mind please. One day you'll be able to sing without a worry\n\nAnd if you truly love singing and want to sound better to feel more comfortable with it, try singing coaches or look up choral lessons on YouTube! I did chorus for 5 years and I never sounded better. It's been about that long since I used those techniques and I sound like a dying cat now lol",
            "In my opinion, if people were laughing then it\u2019s not that embarrassing. If people were pissed or horrified THEN you should be embarrassed. I\u2019d say if anything you were at least charming",
            "It\u2019s fine to be anxious or nervous but you sound great! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fuck up at all",
            "They're tourists. You'll never see them again. Besides, it sounds like they heard you and didn't see you. Laugh, laugh, laugh at your FU!",
            "You probably made their evening! Sometimes that can be incredibly difficult, but you put a smile on the faces of many people, and enjoyed yourself at the same time.",
            "OP, I heard the recording and you seriously crushed it! It sounds so good I almost wish I could have done it too because the acoustic's really were on point. I'm sure people only recorded you because of how awesome you sounded so dw, chin up!",
            "What a Chad you are to post a vid of you singing despite your anxiety. I\u2019d give you an award just for that but I\u2019m broke so have my praise instead.",
            "Sounds great!",
            "Not bad for an acapella performance.Gotta practice the higher notes.",
            "I saw the video and I thought you actually sounded great!",
            "Honestly, you have a really nice voice, you just missed a few notes. No big deal, you can get some lessons or there's probably youtube videos that might be able to help you hit notes better. \n\nI really feel your pain, though. I like to sing along to songs I know well - so long as no one at all can hear me. I'd actually die on the spot if this happened to me. But I have a shitty, awful voice and don't think I can hit notes worth a damn, so...",
            "i mean its not bad tbh they probably just thought u were a bit of a wierdo",
            "Fuck if I was there I would have joined you!",
            "That's so wholesome",
            "It wasn\u2019t really that bad. I don\u2019t think I would have laughed.",
            "Awww I watched the video and you're super cute, don't even worry about it. You don't have anything to be embarrassed about, it was really endearing and a great memory. Cheers.",
            "Your singing is actually relaxing! I wouldn\u2019t be so harsh on yourself I enjoyed listening",
            "Your voice was very well suited to that song and you sounded lovely!\n\nI have a decent singing voice but not one that lends well to singing loudly. Which, of course, is the most fun way to sing.\n\nSo, I was serenading our macaw with his favorite song, The Copacabana. Loudly. Enthusiastically. We live out in the country so I never had to worry about neighbors.\n\nI finish with a very dramatic \u201cDONT FALL IN LOOOOOOVE\u201d, inhale, and hear clapping noises coming from the front door. I run down the hall and see my godfather laughing so hard he was propping himself up against the frame and his daughter was hiding her smile with a clipboard and guiltily said \u201cI told him we should let you know we were here!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of my very favorite memories, and I guarantee you will be a favorite memory for a bunch of the people there.",
            "Not AFU, you enjoyed it and had an amazing time. Really, I admire people who follow their passions and do things they enjoy. I would rather have someone sing off key with a smile on their face, than play a flawless violin solo with dead eyes and a frown.",
            "Dobro Sam se nasmijo lmao. Zao mi te je iako ne razumijem Kako nisi skuzio da si u krivoj zgradi??? I btw Koji je to grad?\nEdit: lol pa ne pjevas tolko lose ajde razvedri se",
            "Wasn't bad at all. Acoustics in there were amazing tho! I probably wouldn't have been able to resist either.",
            "This \u201cF-UP\u201d made my heart happy. I\u2019m sure it made the spectators happy too!",
            "I was thinking of another kind of private concert #smh",
            "choir kid of 5 years here to tell you that your voice really isn\u2019t awful :) a few notes were off/a little shaky which all really can be chalked up to anxiety and not enough practice. if you love singing, chase after that feeling! you have a wonderful voice.",
            "I don't think it was a fuck up. But for the sake of argument...\n\nIt was an _epic_ fuck up. An entire church and 60 people? Dude, I always tell people that if they gonna fuck up, to really go for it, preferably with style. You got all of that right and then some.",
            "Sounds like you should have taken a bow, not run away dude lol",
            "Dude, that video was fucking awesome. I got shivers. Do not be embarrassed.",
            "If you were single and there were good looking ladies there, you'd have to fight them off with a stick.",

All classes are being delivered online due to the pandemic and as such we log into Microsoft teams to participate in our lessons.\n\nI logged in this morning for a group tutorial, all was well. Then I had a 30 minute break before my next class. Statistics this time round. In this 30 minute break my gf decided we should participate in some extra curricular activities if you know what I mean. So wham bam we got it on. Time was against us and whilst I managed to achieve the intended result she was somewhat lacking. Had time been on my side, and I was a better lover, I would have facilitated the equal achievement for my partner. However as previously stated I was required to study some statistics.\n\nThe lecture started and my partner continued next to me in the bed while I some what distracted tried to continue my studies. She achieved a spectacular orgasm with the full on porn sound effects, fantastic.\n\nMy lecturer tried to stifle a laugh. Then to my horror I saw I was not muted. Fuck. I think it was unmuted when I made the teams window fullscreen.\n\nWe valiantly carried on as if nothing had happened and my WhatsApp group exploded with comments. This has gone well.\n\nOn the bright side the lecture is recorded so I can relive my moment of shame at my leisure. Fuck stats.\n\nTL:DR\n\nManaged to unmute my mic whilst my partner orgasmed loudly next to me. In an online class.\n\nEdit: I have reviewed the class. Whilst it's hilarious I cannot post the video, or audio, without seriously breaching the uni social media policies. You can clearly hear other students and the lecturer's voices and its not on to broadcast that. I have broadcast quite enough.",

        "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nThis story begins three days ago and concluded yesterday morning.\n\nThis is the most exciting shit that has happened to me in weeks, people. \n\nI have, despite loving the outdoors, never been stung by a wasp, bee, etc. I have no problems with insects, hell I\u2019ll pick up a spider, but the pointy asses I\u2019m not a fan of (bees are cool though). \n\nSo I wake up and head to the bathroom to take my morning shit, I open the door and hear buzzing and notice Satan himself has decided to pay me a visit and is flying about my shower curtains. \n\nI immediately noped out of there and begin brainstorming how to kill this bastard. \n\nI had determined that the point of entry was my window as it was slightly ajar, I seal the weak point and prepare to suit up. \n\nI then spend the next 20 minutes putting on multiple layers of clothing, 2 pairs of socks going on top of my pants, 2 sweatshirts, sweatpants, a shirt around my head and face \u201cturban\u201d style, a beanie, winter gloves...you get the point. I was impenetrable save the slit where my eyes were. I grab \u201cThe Executioner\u201d which is a glorified electric tennis racket and was ready for war. \n\nI slowly open the door to do some recon and see that little jerk was chilling on the ceiling vent. Close the door, grab The Executioner, take a deep breath and reopen the door. \n\nThe enemy has since taken up a more tactical position behind the lights above my sink...clever. It turns to face me and opens its wings up, ready to kamikaze my ass at a moment\u2019s notice. It can smell fear, and probably the gallons of sweat I\u2019m excreting from being in enough clothing to brave Mt. Everest. I\u2019m fucking hot and shaking. \n\nThinking on the fly (hah puns) I grab a shirt and throw it at the winged heathen to try and flush it out of it\u2019s position- success! Or so I thought. \n\nIt tumbled down for a moment before regaining control and I shit you not made a beeline (more puns) straight for me and in a panic I slam the door shut. My mom is telling me I need to close the vent in my bathroom otherwise It could get in and then the whole household would be compromised. \n\nUnderstanding the stakes I muster the courage to open the door one more time only to discover that in my haste I have lost all visual of the enemy. Gone. After closing the vent I spent the next 10 minutes, still sweating balls, clearing the bathoom looking for that little shit. Couldn\u2019t find it. I was convinced that it made it\u2019s way into the ventilation. \n\nAll hands on deck. Code red. I close every vent on the second floor in every room and the vents in the hallway. I meticulously check my bathoom once again, under the sink, between the shower curtains, trash can, nothing. There\u2019s nothing more I can do.\n\nI spend the next two days afraid of my own fucking bathroom, carrying The Executioner with me like Jesse Pinkman and his pistol in El Camino. It must be in the vents, and so there it shall die.\n\nI awake yesterday morning to take my morning shit, the first time that I didn\u2019t take The Executioner with me and when I exit to go lie down in bed again I\u2019m greeted with a familiar sound emanating from the window blinds next to my bed. Then I see it. \n\nThat skinny waisted, stabby assed, flying fucker flew under the radar and remained in hiding for TWO DAYS until I was UNARMED and then makes a move. It was in my room. Skulking. Lurking. Waiting. I see it fly behind my bed. The Executioner is on my nightstand. I\u2019m without armor and in nothing but briefs. \n\nOn some wild west cowboy shit ready to draw, I make a move for The Executioner and backpedal to a central position where I can wait for it\u2019s next move. Mano y mano, bitch. \n\nI wait 5 minutes before deciding that I\u2019ve had enough. I flank around the perimeter of my room and with one hand open up my window nice and wide, hoping and praying that I didn\u2019t just invite the whole wasp cavalry to make a grand entrance into my bedroom if it decides to release attack pheremones. \n\nIt must\u2019ve been behind my nightstand and felt threatened by my arm because it flew out and landed right on my forearm and before I could swipe it off and electrify that flying syringe it delivered me a painful parting gift. I freak out and trip backwards before it flew off out of my window.\n\nWindow shut. I lick my wounds. The vents are opened. The war is over, but casualties have been sustained. Honestly, that little asshole deserves to live, so long as it never returns. \n\nTL; DR A wasp spawns in my bathroom. I failed at killing it. It disappears and remains hidden for two days before reemerging. It takes my sting virginity and escapes and I definitely didn\u2019t pussy out\n\nEDIT: FUCK YOU WASP I GOT PLATINUM! A couple pics of the possible yellow jacket nest we now gotta deal with, plus my \u201carmor\u201d and the heathen himself: https://imgur.com/gallery/exXFOhK\n\nEdit 2: The culprit was a single paper wasp. The nest in the first picture is a possible yellow jacket nest, entirely separate, like some fucked up level 2 on the horizon after surviving level 1.",

            "My first wasp sting was when a wasp was hiding in my covers for whatever reason. I was lying in bed watching something, ready to go to sleep. I feel something brush against my leg. I lift up the covers, brush down my leg, have a good root around for it and come up empty handed. I figure maybe it was just my imagination. I forget about it and go back to watching Youtube videos. 5 minutes later I feel a sharp sensation in my leg. Now at this point in my life I'd never been stung by a wasp. I was a little startled. I jump out of bed in a panic. I figure the wasp is still somewhere inside my mess of a quilt so I just start wailing on it. Attacking it likes it's some sort of light-weight punching bag. Honestly in the end the sting wasn't as bad as I expected but stinging me in my room while I was just wearing a pair of boxers that really teed me off.",

            "I love how you took an otherwise unremarkable event and turned into a thrill-ride, nice work OP.\n\nI have a similar story involving a wasp and my daughter's (3 year old) bedroom. Hate those little bastards. I finally chased it out of my daughter's room, but lost it as it zipped down the hallway and into my bedroom. Seriously tried for an hour to find this little fucker, never could.\n\nSure enough, I get out of the shower one morning in the days after (our ensuite bathroom is attached to our bedroom and we don't generally close the door), and I can hear buzzing.\n\nThis is good, I'm still sorta wet, buck-ass naked, and I have no weapon. Fuck it, I grab a hand towel and wrap it around my fist intending to smash the wasp to a pulp. Shockingly (it's not shocking at all) it's faster than I am and evades my first attempt. Now it's mad. It's zipping around and I'm trying desperately not to lose site of it, but I do. Now I'm mad, too, and kinda scared. I'm buck-naked in my own fucking bathroom wildly turning my head trying to find this little shit before it gets me.\n\nNope. Lands right between the fingers on my exposed hand and stings me. Fuck. First time in my life, the initial pain isn't horrible but then again I probably have a fair bit of adrenaline pumping through my veins by this point. I swat it away and pounce on it with my still-toweled other hand, and that's the end of that wasp, but not before it got me. Bastard.\n\nEdit: some grammar.",

We were about 2/3 of the way through and made our last stop for gas. Once we\u2019re back on the road for about 20 minutes, I turn to look at my mom and see a wasp in her hair. At this point we were on a 2-lane highway with no option to pull over. I\u2019m like \u201cMom. Don\u2019t freak out... but there\u2019s a wasp in your hair.\u201d We didn\u2019t have any appropriate weapons with us, so all I\u2019m trying to do is get this thing off her head. I don\u2019t remember what I used to try and just brush it away but it did the trick. Unfortunately we lost sight of it. A few minutes later I spot it on the window of the seat behind me. In a panic my mom and I try to get it out the window, but when you\u2019re going 65+ mph that\u2019s obviously not going to happen. We lose sight of it again. No idea where it went. We hoped by some miracle it was out of the car. Then I spot it. He\u2019s literally just chilling on something in the trunk. We keep an eye on him for the next TWO HOURS before we can pull over somewhere. He didn\u2019t move an inch. We pull over, open all of the doors and the trunk, flick the little guy out of there, run around the car to close the doors, get back in, and peel out.

            "I once had a wasp colony set up shop in an outdoor wall behind the siding next to our fireplace, and there was some small hole through that allowed them access through the fireplace knto the house (not the chimney as it was closed, this was lower down and must have been some shoddy construction on the house).\n\nWell before we discovered that, my wife and I would come home day after day to 10+ wasps around the living/dining area, buzzing around like idiots. Luckily somehow they were kind of slow and dopey so they were mostly easy to kill. It was a bit of a nightmare but thankfully most of them didn't go far and mostly hung out around the living room, like your dealer that comes over with friends and never wants to leave. This went on for days before we discovered where they were coming from.\n\nEventually we saw a couple fly out from the fireplace in front of our eyes, so I taped and plastic sheeted the whole fireplace area but still some of the sneaky bastards would get in. I dont know if they were slow because it was the end of summer coming to fall time or what, but at least I could kill plenty of them and not be too worried. Eventually I kind of figured out where to spray-and-pray where the nest should be, and eventually the rest must have died off due to fall temperatures. Still, that would be a nightmare for someone afraid of (or worse yet, dealthy allergic to) those little stinging bastards..",
            "Ugh, I hate those waspy pricks! When I was 17 I took my 8yr old nephew for a walk around a fishing lake looking for toad spawn, he stumbled into a wasp nest and we both got stung dozens of times, I was grabbing wasps out of the air around him, to protect him, which meant I had stings covering all my exposed skin (I was in a vest and shorts) from not protecting myself, My body went into shock and had to be hospitalised for a day (no lasting physical damage though) but I now have a totally irrational fear of a single one of them! If they fly near my children I feel like I need to protect them with my life! As a result, my kids think I\u2019m crazy as they\u2019ve all had a wasp sting at some point and think it\u2019s no big deal....

At the end of the summer we always have lazy hornets coming in to the house after feasting on the fermented apples from the orchard and I\u2019ll quite happily pick them up and escort them outside, despite them having a much greater potential of damage than a wasp!

Then noticed more. Then realized there were DOZENS. \n\nI had just returned home from a work trip. It was nighttime. I went into my bedroom, stripped off my clothes and I got ready to shower. Then I heard buzzing, looked down and saw one. Shit, I thought. I swatted at it, thinking I would smoosh it and move about my evening. Nope. \n\nI slowly realized the number of them inside my room meant they were living in there, and had been for days. I have never gotten dressed so quickly. I ended up leaving my house for the night and calling a pest control company first thing the next morning. \n\nThey sent out a wildlife biologist to handle it. He determined that a colony of yellow jackets had made their home in between the brick exterior and my bedroom wall. And this tiny hole around my window sill is where they had gained entry to my room. They are attracted to light, which is why they started stirring and flying around when I got home and turned on my ceiling light. \n\nThe biologist sprayed outside \u2014 in the tiny holes in the brick \u2014 and inside my house. It was June, but I was wearing several layers including my winter coat. He was suited up in the full-on beekeeper garb. Despite that, and all his layers of clothing, he got stung numerous times. MIRACULOUSLY, despite spatting at them while naked, I got stung zero times. \n\nAnyway, after he treated, I had another work trip, so I was gone for 3 days. When I returned home, I had several hundred yellow jacket carcasses to clean up. \n\nSo, you know, check for holes and make sure those fuckers aren\u2019t living inside your walls.

(I have also been bit by a fire ant on the bottom of my foot, wasps are worse imo)\n\nTurns out one of the wasp fuckers got inside without me knowing, and stung the shit out of my elbow as I crushed it to death.\n\nI didn't sleep in the tent that night.",

        "selftext": "This happened earlier today.\n\nMy partner and I stopped in at a pet store to buy food and litter for our cats. This pet store is part of a chain that works with rescue agencies in our area. Each location has an 'adoption centre' where cats who are deemed ready for adoption are kept.\n\nAnother detail: My partner has a sister whose name we shorten to \"Kat\". Kat has long volunteered for one of our local rescue agencies to foster cats, which are then brought to the various locations of the pet store chain in question. So we'll stop by the adoption centre to look at the kitties, and sometimes they look familiar. That's right: sometimes we see Kat's cats in the adoption centre. Of course, she takes care of so many at any given time that it's hard for me to keep track. But when I recognize one, I get pretty excited to see them ready to find humans of their very own.\n\nBack to today: The pet store location we're at has the adoption centre nearer to the front of the store than most other locations, and so I went to look at the cats while my partner stood in line nearby. Then I see them. Two sister kittens who are eerily familiar; I remember one of them because of her name, and the other one because she looks like a younger version of one of our guys. I look up at my partner, and I ask VERY loudly:\n\n\"Are these Kat's? I think these are Kat's!\"\n\nI look at him, and he's just staring at me with a very concerned look on his face. Confused, I continued, a little louder:\n\n\"Seriously, I think these ones are Kat's!\"\n\nAfter a pause, a look of understanding comes to his eyes, and he just shakes his head. I then look at the other people in the line, who are also staring at me. Then I realized that, without the necessary context, it looked like a 30-something year-old guy who wasn't entirely sure what cats looked like, and that I was excited to maybe be able to identify them. \n\nI return to the line up and just silently wish for death. When we make it out of the store, my partner tells me that even he wasn't sure what I was talking about at first, and was wondering if he should bring me to a hospital, before he understood what I was trying to say.\n\nTL;DR: I stood pointing at cats in a busy pet store, asking my partner if they were cats. Many strangers looked on in confusion.\n\nUpdate: Can now confirm, they were definitely Kat's. Also, a big thank you for the awards. I've never gotten any before!",

As the pictures suggests, you could \u201cconnect\u201d a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going already... In my not-so-clever mind I wanted to see if I could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. I remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. Then with my other hand I grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **SNAP** I fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were Hulk Hogan and Goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. \n\nHulk and Goldberg held their grip while I screamed in pain. I tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick I just couldn't.\n\nTo my absolute embarrassment, my Mum and Dad rushed into the room and had to pull Hulk and Goldberg from my dick.\n\nThis story is still brought up at Christmas dinners to this day.\n\nTL;DR: Got Hulk Hogan and Goldberg action figures stuck to my dick via magnets and had to get my parents to remove them.",

My boyfriend wanted to see if he could feel the magnetic goings-on if he held them on either side of his dick. Being that these were industrial grade magnets, they immediately wanted to snap together, and they snapped his skin with them. \n\nIt was just a pinch of skin (he's circumcised), but he was screaming in agony. It took me forever to get the magnets off because they were hard squares- there wasn\u2019t a good way to get any leverage to pull them apart. We just had to slowly pull them off of him... which took a little bit of his skin with it.\n\nHe made us promise not to tell anyone, but he did wind up cheating on me junior year with that whore Cassie, so it\u2019s all good.",

We were prank calling people and I would stick the phone in my pants (don\u2019t know why I thought that would do anything). We did this a few times until I felt the part of the phone that slides clamp on to my foreskin. I ran into the bathroom to try to take it off, but had no luck and started panicking. I was crying because I thought it would never come off and had to get my friends stepdad to help. I still have a bit of a scar on my penis because of that...",

We've received the Star Wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the Stranger Things intro sequence, you get the idea. Well this time I get a link to a subtitled North Korean news broadcast, link [here.](http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/NORTH-KOREA-POWER-BILL) So naturally I send my roommate the money via Venmo with the subject \"North Korea is best Korea.\"\n\nWithin seconds, I get a notification in the Venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by Venmo's compliance department per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. There is a 48hr hold on the payment and I'm required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. It's been about an hour and I've already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as \"Can you not??\" \n\nIt would seem that [there is a list](http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on Venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. It's been a fun morning.\n\nTL;DR: Paid power bill with subject \"North Korea is best Korea.\" Got flagged per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. Still haven't been able to pay the power bill...\n\nEdit: Here's the Stranger Things one he did for us last month: Removed as it had our actual names on it\n\nEdit #2: And the Star Wars one: https://brorlandi.github.io/StarWarsIntroCreator/#!/AKrfBcVlS4JDf-QEeKBw\n\nEdit #3: Despite all this annoyance, Venmo is still really useful and I'd recommend it. Just avoid funding rogue states and terrorists while you pay for mundane items. It's hard, but I'm sure you can manage. \n\nEdit #4: They let the payment go through. At least their CS dept is pretty quick on these things. I hope that video made someone's day at Venmo. Now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. My monthly payments to the KGB and ISIS are late...\n\nEdit #5: Removed Stranger Things link due to personal info issues.\n\nEdit #6: Looks like the link to the vid in question is currently kill. Not sure if hug o' death or what. Meh, just keep F5'ing. What could go wrong?\n\n**Edit #7: Link is no longer kill. Be gentle.**\n\nEdit #7: Obligatory \"Thanks for the gold kind stranger\" or whatever edit.\n\nEdit #8: [Proof for the doubters.](https://imgur.com/DQuGYwr)\n\nEdit #9: No mirror for the link available. My roommate whipped it up at his office and we don't have a local copy of it. Hopefully the reddit hug ends soon enough for people to be able to view it. Sorry :(",

            "Haven\u2019t seen anyone explain what was happening behind the scenes. Looks like Venmo is doing an OFAC check on all transactions.  They are likely using a third party app/api to do the check.  They would supply all the info from the transaction (name, address, bank location, description, etc...) along with a sensitivity setting.  The software checks all the info against stuff that is prohibited.  In this case it would have flagged it on \u201cNorth Korea \u201c.  The app/api returns the hit and some info on why it hit.  \n\nVenmo then would be required to \u201cseize\u201d the money until someone checks the transaction and either confirms the hit is legit or not.  Someone at Venmo who is tasked with that check is personally and criminally responsible for making sure that happens.  They are on the hook if they allow a transaction to proceed that is deemed illegal and they should have known.  \n\nSo they have to look at the transaction and say yeah or nay.  In this case Venmo probably sees a shitload of these in a day.  So they probably just automatically ask for documentation before even having a person look at it. Once they get that they will almost certainly allow the transaction to proceed.  \n\nIt can be damn inconvenient for people.  For instance when I tested I used Cuba Gooding Jr. And Osama Bin Laden.  Cuba would hit and Osama would not.  No one thinks CGJ is a terrorist but all payments to or from him would hit (at the time).  Osama was a terrorist but the name was too common to cause a hit.  Now if you actually tried sending OBL at the time it would have hit for another reason (country, fi, etc...).  \n\n",

        "selftext": "This happened yesterday and also english is not my first language so apologize if there are any grammatical error. Info I [21M] and my cousin [24F]\n\nI know this is the most cliche story but whatever I just wanna share. I was staying with my aunt for a week as a mini break because my class has already ended and i just need to finish a final project for my grade. Me being horny af because of exams and such these past month haven't had the time to properly relax and releive myself which leads to rock hard morning wood every morning. \n\nThat day I woke up but haven't fully regained my consciousness so I was still half asleep. I  had a huge urge to pee and I said to myself \"fuck better take care of this or I'm gonna have self-induced golden shower.\" I got out of bed and hurried to the bathroom. When I wss really near the bathroom I had this bright idea to pull my pants waistband down and let it spring into action, for efficiency sake so I could go back to sleep asap. I barged right in and there she was, my cousin, fully naked both hands on her hair and me boner in hand. She was surprised as she has that deer in headlight looks on her and so did I. Now this is where I fucked up. We both froze, and we just looked at each other, scanning each other. As I was still half-asleep I thought to myself \"fuck she is hot!\". Until I snapped back to reality and realized it is her that all this time I was looking at. I pulled my pants up and immediately closed the door all in one smooth move as I said sorry multiple times. I ran back to my room in panic as I try to compose myself. When I'm back to my senses I forgot that I had to pee so I used the other bathroom (the bathroom that this incident happened was closer so I used that one) and went back to my room.\n\nI'm fucked and I'm just glad that we both just froze and she didn't scream or something as it might've caused a scene. A bit of background my family is conservative, and this is especially true for my aunt family's and my cousin in particular. And I never thought of her other than a cousin. She is just a very kind, wholesome and fun person so we hang out a lot. And now I don't think I could look her in the eye. Fuck I feel so guilty.\n\nThis kind of thing has never happened to me before. I mean I have barged into my mom and my distant cousin in the past but it was nothing in my opinion as I always immediately apologize and close the door. The thing is I could remember that incident with her crystal clear, like every detail. God I'm so fucked.\n\nI haven't met her since but my aunt has planned dinner for all of us tomorrow so its only a matter of time\n\nEdit 1: both bathrooms have locks on them and I have checked the one where it happened that it was functioning properly.\n\nEdit 2: words and formatting\n\nTL;DR Hurried to the bathroom half-asleep boner in hand to find my cousin fully nude and we scanned each other like xerox as her nude is imprinted in my consciousness.\n\nMini Update: \nSo this morning she went to the room I'm using to let me know that breakfast is ready which to my head feels unusual. I went to the kitchen area get my food and sat with her in living room watching tv. As I ate I noticed something is different with her, she wasn't upset or anything but her vibe has changed. I don't know how to describe it tbh. We chatted a bit and I tried to come up with as many random topic as possible because I didn't want her to discuss what happened as my aunt is still in the kitchen area which is right next to the living room so she could hear everything. Finished my meal asap and excused myself back to my room. Throughout the day up to this point as I'm writing this she seems to kinda noticed me whenever I'm around. I don't know whether it was real or it was just in my mind. \n\nI haven't had any proper talk about it with her. Yes, we usually lock the doors. Yes, I rarely knock. Objectively speaking yes she is insanely hot, like she has the ratio to summarize. I don't think I'm gonna go forward with this and I'm definitely don't wanna get kicked out just because of this. I plan to talk to her tonight after dinner.\n\nUpdate: \nDinner went well I think. My aunt is also normal so I assume she hasn't talked to her about the incident. We generally just talked about the protest, covid and stuff so there aren't anything worth of mention. I did noticed throughout dinner the way she looked at me was.. attentive, like she was looking at me more than usual. I can't confirm really as I was more focused on the foods because it was so good. \n\nAnyway dinner was done and I planned on going to her room afterwards when she is by herself. I must say I was really nervous at this point. I went there and her door was open and I could see that she was drawing something (her hobby is drawing so it is normal). I asked her that I wanted to talk about something. She said \"Sure\" while gestured to sit right next to her. For additional context in her room there is also a couch, a medium size one for like 2 people. I sat there and she was still fixated on her thing. I then apologized for what happened while stammering a bit because I was still nervous. When I was done, she stopped drawing and I looked at her face and she was blushing, I guess. I don't know really but I think there was a bit redness on her face. She just said \"Oh, okay\". Dead silence. I guess I must've zoned out beacause I expected more response from her and I was like \"That's it? Really?\". When I snapped back I asked her what did she draw this time to shift the topic because the situation was really awkward. It was about herself and proceed to make jokes(SFW) about it to break the ice. We both laughed for quite sometime as I try my damndest to lighten up the mood. After the mood is back to normal and we were done laughing I said to her that I have to do something. \n\nNow this the part that gets me. She then leans in and gave me a hug which really suprised me as she has never done it to me before. So I hugged back as I thought it would be rude to leave her hanging. It wasn't a tight hug I think just a normal hug. When were done she said \"I knew you'd feel the same\" with a big smile on her face. I have no idea what she was referring to as my mind was still surprised. So I blurted out \"Of course I would\" In which I then immediately excused myself and we said goodnight to each other. \n\nTo this point of writing I still can't figure out what we were talking about because there was so much thought in my head that I wasn't really focused on the conversation itself. Tbh I don't think I wanna know what she was talking about. I just hope that was just some random shit and it was enough of an explanation and everything is clear so I can get this over with.\n\nFinal Update: Since some people requested an update. I left this morning and as I'm writing this I'm already back at my place. I tried not to think much about what happened as I didn't want to open a chapter in my life with this direction. I also didn't have anymore serious talk with her. The only thing of interest is that we spent yesterday watching the entire season of Netflix's The Witcher. I suggested it to her because I'm huge witcher fan and she hasn't seent it either and really intrigued in it. We already planned this way before the incident so there is nothing weird about it. We watched together on this couch-ish-bed thingy but I was too focused on The Witcher so I barely pay any attention on how she was with me. As I said I played all this safely because I didn't want to jeopardize my relationship with her. I also blocked all kind of thoughts of her in that direction, iykwim. That was it tbh.",

I'm like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.\n\nthe sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes I heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because I couldn't concentrate if I was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.\n\nthis went on for over a month.\n\none night I was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).\n\nand of course there was that motherfucker again.\n\nI did not think. I got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.\n\nso there I was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, I didn't even bother to put my shoes on.\n\nso there I was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.\n\nas I approached the door I could hear a lot of noise in their house. I ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.\n\nso there I was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise \"like a falling bouncing ball\" coming from that apartment.\n\nshe tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.\n\nI still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it's been a month and I'm starting to go crazy.\n\nshe says she doesn't know where the noise might come from. There is nothing at home that can make a sound that I tried to mimic.\n\nyes, I imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.\n\nso there I was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until I say, without much thought, \"wanna go see it?\"\n\nso there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.\n\nand of course, nothing happened.\n\nI apologized to everyone, I took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.\n\nthis was last week.\n\ntoday a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. I was hysterical.\n\n\"ARE YOU HEARING THIS\"\n\n\"yea...\"\n\n\"I can no longer with this noise, I think I'll have to move house.\"\n\n\"it comes from your warmer ...\"\n\nso my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: I'm retarded.",

Up for 2 days to get my self so tired that I just simply shut down. It lasted about an week and after it was gone I was so happy that I could sleep again.

Finally I fell asleep, and of course told my mother next morning, but she didn't think much of it. I didn't hear the sound for the entire day. The next night, when mom kissed me goodnight in my room, I heard the sound again, and so did she, and got a little paranoid.

            "This reminds me of when I was living in an apartment on the 2nd floor and the room below mine always had this loud fan going. It was a fan on the ceiling, so me being above them I heard it through the floor. It sounded like a damn generator and would cause the floor to vibrate. Let it be known I had no idea it was a fan at the time, I thought they had some weird machine going at night. Trying to fall asleep was impossible. This went on for about a week. There were times when I'd lay on the floor with my ear to the ground, taking in the sound and accepting it as my reality. My boyfriend thought I was crazy even though he could hear it too. He didn't think it was as annoying as I did apparently. \n\nOne night, after hours if slowing descending into madness, at about 2 in the morning I started stomping on the floor to try and get them to stop. At one point I heard them yell \"stop!\". No, you stop! I kept stomping until I heard a knock at my door. Okay, so they've come to chat, let's have a damn chat about that damn machine. I opened the door, hair wild, bags under my eyes, baggy clothes, and it was my upstairs neighbor. Apparently she could hear me stomping from upstairs, and I told her of this massive generator the people downstairs had going for hours into the night, and how it made a sound like this *imitates low humming sound*. She gave me a look and said it was probably their ceiling fan. \n\nCompletely embarrassed but still wanting the folks downstairs to know how loud and unbearable it was, I left them a note of apology and slipped it under their door the next day. Couldn't even show my face to them, I didnt want them to know who the crazy stomping lady who lived above them was. On the plus side I stopped hearing it after that.",
            "My apartment does this as well when the heat gets turned on.  Although when I first moved in, occasionally there would be a loud \"crack\" that was so loud that it shook the wall.  Sounded like someone fired a cannon right next to your ear.  This would go on at 40min intervals all night for about a year before the landlord actually heard it herself and fixed it.",

(it was like midnight). This  woman didn't know what the hell they were talking about so when they came to me I was like, he must be under the bed or hiding in the bathroom. I was completely sure that the noise was coming from upstairs.\n\nThe next day she posted a message in the elevator, I could tell she was pretty angry about what happened the night before. That night the show started again, about the same time, so I walked upstairs and put my ear next to her door. Silence. When I came back to my floor I kept hearing the noises so I went door by door in the building, putting my ear.... I finally found it.\n\nThere was this man in his 50s that was living with his mother (she was so old she couldn't leave the bed). He was getting drunk every night and getting mad about his own mother (he was pretty messed up I once had to carry him into his house, he was so drunk he couldn't stand still but that's another story). Sadly the cops wouldn't do anything since they need to be there when the noise was taking place and that noise had to be louder than X to be illegal.\n\nIn the end the poor old woman died and he stopped doing his thing. I don't know if he keeps drinking since I don't live there anymore.\n\nTL;DR: I sent the cops to the wrong house, waking a woman and her little daughter at midnight.",

Cold and hot water pipe runs, going through the same wall, just beneath me, all mortared into the wall where it passed through. I was speechless. I'm not even sure you're allowed to do that. The pipe simply couldn't expand freely due to temperature changes from the hot water running through it.\n\nI almost went insane trying to investigate this source, and I 100% agree on the sleep deprivation torture.

        "selftext": "Ya so this fuck up happened the summer before Covid but I think that statute of limitations are up so I can tell this story.\n\nMy wife and I went to her colleague's wedding. I'm not a huge drinker and I didn't really know anyone, so my plan was to grab some sort of cold refreshing beverage, find somewhere to post up, and nurse it while I got really stoned and did some people watching. Which leads me to *my drugs*. \n\nOn the way to the wedding I stopped at a dispensary and picked up a reusable vape pen thing. I'm a pretty traditional smoker. I go to the place and buy an eighth and smoke it in my ancient bowl over the course of the next month or two. I'd never had a pen before. I was just like \"I'm going to a wedding and want something that won't make me sleepy or mentally handicapped\" and the young woman at the counter handed me the thing. \n\nAs my wife was driving us over, I tried it out. I also don't smoke very much at any one time, and have a hard time with anything like joints or bongs etc. When I do smoke these things, they hit way too hard and I cough like crazy and hate myself. So I took a very small hit, noticed it hit *really hard* and thought \"well that's because you think everything hits too hard.\"\n\nBadabing badaboom, I'm at the reception standing in line to grab some drinks from the bartender and notice the tip jar. Realizing I don't have any cash, I'm like \"dude do you have venmo or something?\" (I know, lol) and he's like \"ahh don't even worry about it man it's no big deal\" but I'm a service industry vet so I wanted to find a way to tip him because I know it's gonna be a long night and a lot of people won't tip.\n\nSo I'm like \"alright man well, if my wife has some cash I'll double back over...but uh, in the meantime...if you party...\" and I show him the pen. \n\nHe's like \"oh for real? hell ya dude.\" And proceeds to take an *enormous* puff on this thing. \n\nWithin seconds he was doubling over and coughing uncontrollably, it was incredibly loud and in under a minute he was down on his hands and knees behind the bar puking in the grass. Still...kind of no harm no foul...until he gets up and puts all of his weight onto a tumbler glass that was sitting on the table he used to help himself up. Cutting his hand open...so...so badly. \n\nAnd then something very interesting happened. Something that had never happened before. I started vomiting at the sight of the blood. \n\nSo naturally this is pretty disruptive, and the groom who just so happened to be nearby, comes over to see what's going on *and fucking faints* the second he sees this guy's hand. Smashing his head on the bar/table on the way down, his face taking the table cloth and everything on the table down with him.\n\nTotally unmitigated disaster. Both of them had to go to the hospital and the bride was understandably super upset and screaming at the caterers, so I decided \"well, it's been a good life\" and began to march over to explain to her what happened when out of her mouth comes a series of very specific slurs directed at the owner of the catering company. I didn't get a single word out of my mouth before she said \"fucking sue me\" turned on her heel and told her people to just round their shit up and go. \n\nCue major shitstorm. Everyone is fighting with everyone, and almost all of the guests left. I told my wife what happened on the drive home and she said I should call the catering company and apologize, which I did, and the owner laughed for about 30 seconds on the phone before saying \"well, whatever, fuck that bitch.\" \n\nSo...ya. \n\nTLDR: Don't smoke a lot of weed, got the bartender way too high causing a chain reaction of vomiting and fainting that led to a racist outburst ending a wedding.\n\nedit - I actually think it was a wine glass",

            "The bartender reminds me of a story about my ex brother in law... It would make a good TIFU if it was about me..\n\nSo my ex brother-in-law was a security guard at one of the most prestigious country clubs in Palm Desert. Bill Gates has a place there. He worked graveyard shift with my uncle for years. They don't really call off unless it's a big thing, and even then there's no guarantee there is someone to cover.\n\nSo my BIL has the flu pretty bad. But he couldn't get covered, so he shows up to work that night anyway. A little while into their shift, his stomach starts hurting pretty bad. Not wanting to throw up near the entry gate/guard station, he runs over to his vehicle. He starts puking. We're talking projectile vomit here. The problem is, he has the flu BAD. So, as I heard it, in the middle of puking, he somehow manages to get his pants undone and drops them so he doesn't shit his pants. Apparently my uncle is concerned and goes to see whats going on with my BIL and check if he's alright.\n\n\nNow imagine this. You hear noises that can only be described as demonic and haunting, as though a person is very painfully being contorted to have their head spin around their body multiple times while every joint snaps in the opposite direction and limbs are violently being torn off. Somewhere in this nightmare there is a human-like groan of pure pain and helplessness that's crying to be put out of its misery.\n\nThe noises are coming from the other side of a pickup truck. It middle of the night with low lighting and all you can make out part of a shadow from under the truck, and fluids.\n\nYou come walking around the truck to find what resembles a grown man. On all fours. You now have a visual to go with the noises, and as the figure makes eye contact with you, projectile fluids begin excreting, not just from the mouth, but also from the anus. As you watch this shit show unfold in front of you in slow motion, you also realize that this does not appear to be the first uncontrollable release of simultaneous projectile fluids, and you begin to comprehend that this is in fact a grown man dressed like a security guard, pants below the knees, on his hands and knees, vomit spewing from the mouth, diarrhea spewing from the anus. And he's now making eye contact with you. Because you cannot look away. No matter how mortified you are, there is nothing that is going to take your focus off watching this being puke and shit himself into the underworld. You actually would not even be surprised if he started levitating and his head started spinning at this point. You almost are expecting it. And in that brief slow motion moment of eye contact, you can hear the the desperate pleas of a man who is now watching you watch him undergo what can only be described as a reverse exorcism, watching a demon trying to escape this human body from any exit it can find.\n\nSnap back into real time, and my uncle just says.. \"you good?\" to which my BIL replies with a thumbs up. My uncle then goes and waits for BIL on the other side of the truck. My BIL finishes up and comes back around the truck and the silence is broken only with the words \"I think I'm good to drive home.\" He gets in the driver seat and just drives away. My uncle is still standing there, unsure what the hell he just witnessed. I don't remember the details of an incident report that were written up about it the next day when someone happened across the mess, but from what I understand, no further humiliation was brought about. Well, until now. \ud83e\udd72\n\nIf he could learn to perform this trick on demand, he could probably retire after a string of performances for the world's wealthiest.

This happened last night.\n\nSo I (30 m) flew home over the weekend to see some family. We have all had covid recently so not too worried. Ive been working from home for the last few months so I put on a few pounds and I had to get a new belt before the trip. Anyways last night I was running late for my flight home and I'm doing the mad dash through the airport. I get to security and start doing that whole song and dance. Taking the shoes off, jacket, laptop out of my bag, then I remembered I have my new belt on. I undo the buckle and try to pull it all the way out of the loops, doesn't budge. It's too stiff and new. So I assist it out of the first few loops, then I give it a tug again, nothing still stuck. All the while of course, the TSA agent is waiting on me, along with the huge line of people behind me anxiously waiting for their own strip tease act. Irritated, I give the belt one more hard tug, and it WHIPS out of my pants and slaps the man's ass in front of me. You know how the lion tamers will pop their whip for show? Or the boys on the locker room will pop each other with their towels? I just did this to a man (with some gusto, I might add) that I do not know. He was actually a pilot in his uniform. He whips his head around to look at me with shock. TSA agent is cackling, I'm standing there with my mouth open stunned. I apologized profusely and he was understanding. Then we stood awkwardly next to each other for probably another (long) 10 minutes. Anyways, I think we were both grateful to get out of that line..\n\nTldr: I pulled my belt out of my pants with gusto which resulted in me slapping another man's ass with it.\n\nEdit: Wow guess I need to add that covid was 3 months ago and we are not contagious anymore. Yes I am aware that you can get it again, but from what I've read chances are low, this soon after having it. I was visiting my dad who is leaving the country for 4 years. I wouldn't have traveled otherwise. Sheesh.",

We get out off his car and are getting pumped up for a good time.\n\nHe says something along the lines of \"LET'S DO THIS!\" and then slaps my wife's ass. Everybody froze.\n\nMy wife is staring at me terrified both about what happened and what she thinks I'm gonna do. My jaw is on the floor. He immediately saw the insanely stupid thing he did and turned white as a ghost, stammered a ton and proceeds to awkwardly slap MY ass because honestly, how the fuck else do you recover from something like that? To this day my wife and I still laugh about it. \n\n\nBefore anyone rages:\n\nNo, he wasn't hitting on my wife. Yes, I'm sure. It was more along the lines of how football players will slap each other's asses (not that that isn't weird) I knew the guy, we almost died in a car crash when I was helping him move.

As someone who has a high sex drive, this was a tall order, and despite the incredible bruising and pain of the first two days, I found myself absurdly horny. My wife enjoyed my pain immeasurably and teased me a lot my whipping out her boobs regularly, knowing I was powerless to do anything about it.\n\nSo Friday morning, things were still a bit tender, but I had decided that the surgeon clearly didn't know anything and that the Internet, which said \"whenever you feel up to it\" was a more reliable source of info. That morning while my wife was taking our daughter to school I decided to take my dick and balls for a test ride.\n\nEverything was going really well, and I'd gotten all set up at my wife's desk and was making it a really special wank (just the right video selection, lube etc), and just as I came, everything started to go wrong.\n\nFirstly, a week's worth of jizz, some weird clear liquid and a little blood from my op came gushing forth, overwhelming my poorly prepared fold of toilet paper  that normally suffices, spilling everywhere, including into my wife's net fabric chair cushions. Simultaneously, my balls start to ache like hell.\n\nBy the afternoon my balls had swollen up and every time I stood up it was like someone was pulling strings attached to rusty knives somewhere in my crotch, and my balls generally felt like they'd had a good kicking. This persisted for about 5 days, and now on Thursday they are just about back to normal.\n\n\nTl;Dr, jerked off before the doctor said I should after a vasectomy, jizzed cum and blood everywhere and made my balls hurt like hell for nearly a week. Listen to your surgeon/doctor!\n\nEdit: to answer the most common questions - \n\nmy wife thought I was an idiot, but is a lovely woman and was mostly concerned for my nuts' wellbeing... But only because she doesn't know about the chair.\n\nThe chair, and my balls, are all fine now. \n\nYes I'm gross, I know. \n\nI love Cannibal Corpse, and yes I'm aware of the song.\n\nThank you everyone for sharing your vasectomy stories, many of which had me in stitches (no I didn't have stitches before you crack a joke about that)",

She then tells me, \u201cI [the girl] can\u2019t wait to tell you I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Okay. Weird. Maybe the nerves. Understand we had no booze at this point. I think she\u2019s just nervous. Great.\n\nA few minutes later she\u2019s telling me about her parents who live near the Wisconsin/Minnesota boarder, and we are in the Chicagoland area. These parents show up\u2026 and sit down with us. YET, THEY LIVED IN THE GREAT WHITE NORTH. So I\u2019m against the wall of the booth with her dad sitting next to me. She\u2019s across from me. Her mom next to her. Shit. Okay. Guess I\u2019m paying for their meal too. Double date. Great.\n\nMom and Dad tell me they\u2019ve heard a lot about me yada yada (how much could they know?) they talk about what it\u2019s like working for a vocational school. So I start freaking out as I\u2019ve only said I\u2019m a school admin, nothing more, not where I work. I say it\u2019s great, but I\u2019m looking to go back to the middle school or elementary next year.\n\nDad says he can\u2019t wait to have a son in law like me. Mom says she can\u2019t wait to have me marry into the family. Awkward. They were drinking. So I give them a pass.\n\nAwkward evening continues. Yada yada get to know you shit. We start leaving and I picked up this chick, so I\u2019ve gotta drop her off; Grandma raised a gentleman, you know? Figured I\u2019d do that and dip. Nope. We get back, parents park next to me. Fuck. Invite me up. Mom said she baked a great pumpkin pie earlier today.\n\nWell shit. I love me some pumpkin pie. Decide fuck it, might as well get something out of this night. Had some pie. Truthfully, some of the best pumpkin pie I\u2019ve ever had. I try to leave and they weren\u2019t really letting me by giving me more pie or starting a new conversation topic. Best friend (one who told me to start dating) calls. Asks what\u2019s up. Took the call in the bathroom and she comes up with this plan: I\u2019m going to go pick up my friend \u201cEddie\u201d (because she thought I shouldn\u2019t use a girls name) with his flat tire. Great. I got an out.\n\nShe says she needs to walk her dog (annoying shit. Yapping dog. Rubbing his ass on everything and dragging his ass across the floor. Very poorly trained). Fuck. Fine. Come with and walk me down. Mom comes to. I\u2019m standing there trying to leave as chick takes her dog for a shit. Mom says it\u2019s nice to meet me yada yada. And says \u201cI\u2019m so glad [daughter] found you. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be able to settle down since we\u2019ve had her committed three times.\u201d And walks away. Wtf. Bomb dropped.\n\nI\u2019m panicking now, sweating a bit. I turn to get in my car and chick is right there. Hugs me. Tries to kiss me. Yada yada. Tells me \u201cI love you, and can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d \n\nMe: great\u2026 gotta go. You know\u2026 friend needs help. \n\nI get in the car, this chick is in my rear mirror and she\u2019s calling me. I pick up and she said \u201cyou didn\u2019t say you love me!\u201d\n\nBest friend calls, \u201coops. Hang on important call\u201d and picks up. Tells my buddy this. she\u2019s laughing her ass off. I\u2019m scared shitless at this point thinking headlights in my rear view mirror are her. So I start speeding for the highway. \n\nIm speeding away. Get pulled over. Cop asks why. I tell him EVERYTHING. Takes a good 5-6 min to get him to understand. He noticed I have Wisconsin plates. All he says is \u201cBro\u2026and gives me great advice: never put your dick in crazy.\u201d Thanks brochacho. Cop feels sorry for me and escorts me to the highway. Great. Freedom.\n\nChick texts me. I try to ghost her. Now, I left out an important detail. I went on a school night, wearing spirit wear with my school logo; once you know the name it\u2019s hard not to find as I\u2019m the only type of school like this in my county. I go to my boss the next day and tell him. Says I\u2019m a fucking idiot for wearing my work shirt. Laughs his ass off about the whole situation. Asks if I blocked her. Shit. That\u2019s a good idea. So I do it. Tells me I\u2019m a fucking idiot again for not thinking this through. \n\nShe figured out where I worked. And starts calling my desk. Asking when we are going out. Leaves a message says she wants to be engaged by the time she\u2019s 30 (which was weeks away, literally the next month, since we went over birthdays). At this point I\u2019m freaking out. I have an SRO (school resource officer) in my building. I tell him what happened. Gave her name. He told me he\u2019d take care of it if she came by. But also told me to move my car to the back (gated and can\u2019t see, dudes a saint and it was a great idea).\n\nChick shows up asking to see me. Security tells her I don\u2019t work here. She gets snotty with the SRO. Gets escorted out. Calls my desk phone pleading with me to give her a chance. Finds my sister. My best friend all on Facebook. Tells them we are soulmates. I tell them to block her ass. \n\nChick was crazy. Got her to calm the ef out when I told her I\u2019m going to report her for harassment to her licensing board (all bullshit, no idea if that would do anything).\nAnd that kids, is the story of how I met your mother. \n\nKidding. But damn was I scared of dating for a bit.\n\nTLDR: went on a date with a therapist. Almost ended up married again.",

Also the same reason you might've seen tone indicators around the internet more often lately, they're just a more convenient and straightforward way of making it clear what you mean without having to play social guessing games.\n\nSituation sucks, sorry this happened to you.

        "selftext": "TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nEnjoy my fuck-up story, oddly enough for this sub, it did happen yesterday. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe and my girlfriend exchange nudes frequently. They never leave our phones/computers and we trust each other on that. I like to mess around in photoshop as a hobby and often times I use my gf's nudes for practice. Change the lighting, remove/add things in the background, sometimes I edit her into a playboy cover for a laugh. A few days ago I bought a new laptop, as my old one died some time ago. I installed photoshop on it yesterday and wanted to mess around with it. I found some tutorials online about photoshop tattoo removal and decided to give it a try. Seeing as I had no work the next day, I also decided to get high. I gathered some pics of my girlfriend and went to work. \n\nMy girlfriend has a big tattoo on her upper chest (covering her collar bones and the upper part of her boobs), two smaller pieces on her hips, one between her shoulder blades and some smaller ones on her legs and arms. When we met she already had all the major ones and she did two more while with me. It has never bothered me, I thought her tattoos are cool. But before falling for her I never imagined myself to be with such a heavly tattooed girl but I hadn't really thought about it since then.\n\nNow, I edited the pictures, starting from the smaller tattoos and evencually getting rid of the big chest one. I followed a tutorial and made a damn good job in my opinion. I ended up doing three pics and when I was admiring my work I got very... Well, I got hornier then I ever had in my life. \n\nI've always considered my gf's body to be a 10/10. That combined with her wonderful personality made me fall in love quick and hard, and I didn't even think to wonder how she would look like if she didn't have the tattoos. Well now I know. And to me she would look infinitly better.\n\nI regret using photoshop a lot last night. She obviously can't get rid of the tattoos. Not only would it be horribly expensive, but also she really loves them. Also I don't think it's my place to even ask that. She's also a tattoo artist and scheduled to have a \"half a body\" tattoo done in two or so months by another artist who she's a great fan of. I won't ask her to skip the tattoo. She's very excited about it and has been saving up for a long time. I was never particularly happy that she was getting it, but I was just glad she was excited and again, it's her choice what she puts on her body.\n\nNow I realise just I don't like tattoos on her. I thought a lot last night and realised the signs were there, but for some reason it has never occured to me. For example when we chatted about her tattoo plans I asked her not to tattoo her tummy too soon because I like how soft it lookes on it's own. She would say in that a few years I will have a wife covered from head to toe in ink and I always laughed it off because I didn't want to think about it. I also had a shameful realisation that I've been enjoying sex a lot more since we started to do it doggy style. The one tattoo on her back usually get's covered by her hair so you can't see any tattoos. \n\nI'm kinda freaking out. As I mentioned, my \"favourite parts\" of her  body are the ones with no tattoes on them, that being the back and her waist. The tattoo she's getting is going to go from her arm, down her side and down the leg. Which means it will be pretty much impossible to not see. I'm really ashamed to say I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her when she does it. I'm afraid to even bring it up because she has horrible body image issues and I'm scared she would be really effected if I said I'm worried about her getting the tattoo. I also know with the way things are going (her becoming a tattoo artist and such) she is going to get more. \n\nI deleted the pictures this morning. They give an ultra boner but the worst moral hangover ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR\n\nI removed my gf's tattoos in photoshop and found out I'm much more attracted to her without them. She's getting a body-long piece done in two months and I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her as I am now.",

            "I've been with my wife since we were teenagers, far before any tattoos. Fast forward ten years and she is now covered and also a tattoo artist and body piercer. Stretched ears, face piercings, you name it.\n\nMe? I used to want to cover myself as well, and I have quite a few, I was also very pierced up but she's blowing me out of the water in our \"race\" to be covered in ink. I kinda lost interest/ haven't known what I wanted to get for about 5 years now and all my piercings are long gone. \n\nShe's getting another big ass piece in August. I can't wait because even though I kinda lost interest in tattoos on myself, I love hers. We had a talk and I told her pretty much where I didn't want her to get any mods, basically I want to see an ass not a tattoo, same with titties and face. She was cool with it and agreed and has told me a bunch of times \"if you think I'm going too far let me know and I'll stop.\" \n\nIt's all about communication, man. That's the secret to long relationships. Communication.",
            "Hey OP, I\u2019m gonna throw my take at ya. I\u2019ve been reading the comments and there seems to be two camps: looks don\u2019t matter if you really love someone, and looks and sex are a foundation to a relationship.\n\nI think both of those things are true because I\u2019d like to point out that there are always more attractive people out there than your partner. There is always someone with a prettier smile, a smaller waist, less tattoos. But is YOUR gf your person? Does she get you? Does she make you feel like you don\u2019t have to be anything you are not? Do you feel loved, accepted, and that you can rely on this person if shit hits the fan and they will be there for you? These are things that are important to a lasting relationship. Is she as hot as someone else without tattoos? Probably not. But is everything else she offers worth walking AWAY from? Only you can decide that. \n\nIs being attracted to the person you are dating important in starting a relationship? Yes, very much so. Ask yourself: do you suddenly think she\u2019s hideous or ugly? Or can you compromise that she\u2019s gonna be as physically attractive as someone without those features (tattoos) but she\u2019s still a wonderful person and the person you wanna be with.\n\nMy advice: take a break from weed for a few days. Really ask yourself the questions that need asking and reflect on how attractive you find her as she is, right now. Maybe she went from a 10 to an 8 for example. Can stand to spend more time with someone who is an 8? Or maybe she is now a 3 and there is nothing else redeeming about the relationship. Then you will have your answer.",
            "Part of the reason why I ended my previous relationship as because I realized that I wouldn't want to be with my SO if she gained too much weight or cut her hair in a way that I didn't like.\n\nDo you know why I felt okay with breaking things off? Because I realized that these things wouldn't be a problem for me if I was with someone that I truly love. I was only in the relationship for the sex. It was shallow as hell and I needed to stop wasting her time.",
            "OK, OK, now Photoshop her entire body to be covered in tattoos. Like head to toe, no  skin left in sight. \n\nBecause it could be worse, right?",
            "Oh dude... This one is a pickle that none of us will be able to advise on, although you're not really asking for advice just airing the FU.\n\nPersonally, once that realization has kicked in I'd be wondering whether to just knock the relationship on the head and move on. You're boyfriend and girlfriend, there's no signed contract at the moment. If you live together this will be harder but it sounds like you can't cope with the journey she's on so it might be best for you not to be along for this ride which is going to cause you a lot of displeasure in the future.",

            "Am I the only one here who finds the idea of photoshopping your partner's naked body to be an insanely bad idea?",
            "She's a tattoo artist. Either you learn to like it or you move on. I think she is going to have a strong opinion on this one. Her tattoos probably mean a lot to her and I think it'll sound pretty insulting if you tell her she looks better without them. Odds are if you bring it up she's probably going to break things off.",
            "So, basically, you like your photoshopped version of your girlfriend better. You should probably not tell her this.",
            "THIS!!! Yes, this hits it really well.\nI can understand and sympathize with making a FU like this, and wishing things about your gf were different\u2026 At some point everyone wishes things about their partner were different (from character to appearance) but this is an excellent opportunity for you to analyze where your head and heart are, and whether they are truly invested in this woman for who she is as a person, or for who your dick thinks she is.\n\nLove can overcome physical appearance, and things like tattoos.  Love is how humanity and society manage to survive tragedy, war, violence, and unspeakable hardship.   Our dicks merely ensure reproduction. \nBe wise, and good luck",
            "I couldn\u2019t imagine being in happy, faithful, loving, and committed relationship with someone who loves and adores me and every flaw I have and getting hung up on tattoos I knew about because of a photoshop session.

            "Are you the sort of person that never changes their mind? Or do you have a realisation every few days?\nI've known both types. The first are annoying as rigid, the second are annoying as inconsistent.\nPoint is are you likely to change your mind in a few days knowing yourself?.\nOr do you accept this is how you see her now and that will not change?\nPersonally I'd leave it a couple of weeks and see if feel any different. Perspective is a wonderful thing.\n\nAnyway,  hope you figure it out. \n\nIf you break up please don't say it's because you no longer find her tattoos attractive..... Can say you're feeling more friends than lovers perhaps but don't leave her feeling she was less attractive to you. That'd be shitty. \n\nDo people still use the term \"lovers\"? Well I just did and it felt weird... you get what I mean anyway..",
            "If it's that much of an issue for you, think about life without her.  Would you want to move on?  If you think you'll be ok without her, maybe you should call it a day.  If you think you'd be happier with her, including her increasing amount of tattoos, stay with her, but if you do, you have to accept your decision and not hold that decision against her in the long run.  \n\nYou must be in a difficult position right now, but I guess this brings something in the back of your mind to the front, which you need to address and move forward from.",
            "Hey man, you know she's gonna age too right? \n\nI'm not saying that what you're feeling is meaningless, but I will say that if you have a relationship in the future with someone without tattoos, they mightn't be immune to change either.\n\nMove on if you think that's best, but don't forget to look at yourself too.",
            "It is wild to say \u201coh I think my SO would be hotter if they did X\u201d and then jump from that to \u201cI am not attracted to my SO because I hypothetically could be even more into them\u201d You don\u2019t need to be into every part of someone to be attracted to them, and they don\u2019t need to do things to make themselves the perfect image of what you want. \n\nAlso, never photoshop your SO\u2019s nudes to see if you can make them sexier . Like, even if you enjoyed it and it didn\u2019t make you regret anything, you say your SO has body image issues \u2014 what if she found out? saw them? Why would you do that?",
            "In general I think photoshopping to change or 'improve' the appearance of a significant other is not a good idea. This is like if my partner photoshopped me to have bigger muscles and less body fat, and then lost interest in the real me because I didn't look like the edited version.",

You didn't fall in love with her tattoos, you fell in love with *her*. There is absolutely nothing wrong with being turned on by an image of your wife you've never seen before, it actually makes a lot of sense. You know her with ink, seeing her without ink is special, it's new, it's hot, it's exciting, maybe even a little forbidden? \n\nI think you might be over-analising and making this a bigger deal than it has to be. Relax a little, the world is not on fire. Have you talked to her yet?",
            "I feel like you may feel more attracted to her without tattoos, because it's something new, something exciting. There is a reason why people use bedroom costumes or experiment in general. I think you do not need to worry about the tattoos. You should think how to bring excitement to your relationship again.",
            "To all of the comments about physical attraction being like an obvious requirement:\n\nThat won't last your relationship.  If them becoming less attractive makes you not want to be with them, then you want to be with an object not the person.\n\nIt's not that it doesn't matter it's that over time it doesn't matter.  Will you want to fuck the same person in 20 years or in 40 years or are you only thinking about now?  Imagine having sex with someone who's 68.\n\nIf you're only thinking about now then you're not actually thinking about having a long term relationship you're just thinking about fucking.\n\nIt's hard to argue that you can truly love someone so long as the primary condition for that love is that they make you horny enough.  No one is that hot for that long in anyone's mind enough to put up with all the other struggles that's involved in dating marriage etc.",
            "Let me get this straight. \n\nYou used Photoshop to edit your girlfriend into your ideal woman, and now you're upset that she's not your ideal in real life. \n\nI suggest counseling, and never touching Photoshop again.",
            "I'm not going to mouth off about how shallow OP is because physical attraction is a big part of why you stay with someone regardless of what a bunch of lonely fools on Reddit would argue about. On the same note, if you find your girlfriend more attractive ***without*** tattoos and she's getting a half-body piece done, you're seriously going to have to expedite either your acceptance of her appearance or your break-up monologue. Good luck, OP. Seriously.",
            "If your only attraction to her is physical then your relationship is already doomed. \n\nLooks Fade and you should always be able to love her for who she is, not who you'd like her to be.",
            "I\u2019ll throw my two cents in; I don\u2019t think she\u2019s right for you. I think she deserves someone who embraces her how she is and/or on deeper level, and you deserve someone you are truly attracted to on all levels.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 12 years. From age 18 to 30, she\u2019s had all kinds of different looks; from all American girl next door kinda vibe, to pink hair and piercings and tattoos, to being a professional looking mom. There\u2019s been times when she aggressively hit the gym, times when she hasn\u2019t. Through all of these looks, I have never once not been deeply attracted to her. I\u2019ve always found her to be beautiful and sexy, even when she doesn\u2019t. The reason is because I\u2019m in love with her. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m a better person, or that you\u2019re shallow, or that you don\u2019t love you girlfriend. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve never thought that my wife would be more attractive if she changed xyz, and thay I take it as a sign that you need to keep looking if you\u2019re this shaken by the tattoos.",

            "Some things I think need to be digested and figured out for yourself...\n\n* Physical vs personality - which do each weigh in your brain for your partner, but more importantly why? Why is this this tattoo thing a sudden threat for a *deal-breaker*. If she was a 10/10 before, did she drop to an 8 or 9? or did she drop to a 3/10 somehow after just this one revelation? If it's a 7,8, or 9, why is *that* a deal-breaker for you? I would think if it dropped low enough like a 3, there's maybe something more there that we aren't seeing or that you don't realize yet.\n* Is this something that will go away or will it stay with you? To me, on the outside, it sounds more of a lustful discovery that you're fixating on, (that's fine to discover that about yourself) but it is something that you won't ever move on from or is it something that is taking over your brain because it's simply something you don't have? (Kind of like the whole 'the brain wants what it can't have' type of thing).\n* How is your relationship itself doing? Outside of this instance, are you two actually doing good mentally, emotionally, and physically? Is there something within the relationship making things more appealing to think about what you don't have with this girl?\n* **Most importantly**, how are ***you*** doing in general? I looked at your past posts and comment history and I saw you've been going through some stuff, at least over the past year or so with mental health and depression(?). Sometimes those things can play a role in your reasoning for different situations. Whether it's irrational thinking, numbness to situations, or maybe downgrading your positive regard for things you appreciated more before.\n\nI think a lot of people make assumptions on reddit and also read into things to project from their self experiences, but I hope you can look toward the 'why' for the reasoning on what your brain is telling you and where your fears and concerns are coming from.\n\nIf it's simply a matter of genuinely not being able to do a relationship with someone who has tattoos because you don't like it, then that's okay if it's truly what you want for yourself...but don't fuck it up for the sake of your brain going through a moment, if that's what it is instead.",

            "Let me preface this by saying that I\u2019m heavily tattooed and my partner is not tattooed at all. I always wonder if he would prefer me without my tattoos but then I realize he wouldn\u2019t be with me if it mattered to him. \n\nSo even if you perceive the tattoos as flaws now, we all have physical flaws that *shouldn\u2019t* diminish our partners\u2019 love. It\u2019d be great if my bf had Aquaman\u2019s body but he doesn\u2019t and I\u2019m not going to leave him (a wonderful, caring man) in search of it. So either (1) you love her enough to support her passion for body art and accept her tattoos; (2) you feel that your superficial ideal of a flawlessly attractive partner is more important than a loving relationship; or (3) you are subconsciously falling out of love and her perceived flaws look more prominent to you now. But remember, we all get old and saggy and wrinkly eventually so this is a good time to decide if perfect appearance outweighs a solid relationship or if this is a sign that your relationship isn\u2019t as solid as you thought\u2026",

This is why sex is often better and more frequent early in a relationship.\n\nSo basically, it's not that you're necessarily turned off by tattoos- it could easily be that seeing an alt version of your girlfriend is just really exciting to you.

        "selftext": "I\u2019m using a throwaway account as i\u2019m guessing what i did isn\u2019t exactly legal. I\u2019m sorry if this is long, i\u2019ll include a TL;DR at the end. \n\nIt didn\u2019t happen today but 2 years ago, i was living with a roommate while i saved for my own place. My roommate was lovely (for the most part) but her little brother was always staying with us. Her brother was lazy, never did any chores at all and had pretty much turned the living room into his own personal bedroom without ever paying a cent in rent. As unbearable as that already was, he did the most annoying thing that any roommate could do which is stealing food. \n\nHe was CONSTANTLY stealing my food, pretty much everyday. It started with him just taking ingredients like flour or coffee which i didn\u2019t care about but eventually he started stealing snacks and even took my leftover meals a few times. Eventually i got sick of this and confronted him (I knew it was him because my roommate was a vegetarian and he wasn\u2019t). \n\nI confronted him a total of i think 3 times and every time i did, he would deny it or just laugh it off, blaming my forgetfulness or my boyfriend (who happened to be celiac so most of the things that disappeared were off limits for him). This drove me insane to the point that i eventually just bought my own fridge and put it in my bedroom. \n\nAs you can imagine, this did not stop him. He even took coffee creamer from my fridge and left it on the counter to spoil. This led to me screaming at him to leave which made my roommate furious (turns out she wasn\u2019t as nice as i thought) and he was back in the house 2 days later. My landlord was a jerk and i knew that asking him to deal with RM\u2019s bro wouldn\u2019t work however i did ask to install a lock on my bedroom door but he said he would only let me do it if i payed a fee. He was only asking me to pay something like $30 but i thought that was insane and refused.\n\nNot wanting to piss off the landlord anymore, i decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew that my roommate\u2019s brother was allergic to strawberries however i didn\u2019t know how severe this allergy was. I also knew that he absolutely loved buffalo wings (because he\u2019d taken them multiple times before) and later that night, in blind rage, i decided to make some buffalo wings with... a secret ingredient. \n\nSure enough my plan worked and i got a call at work from my sobbing roommate. She was in the back of an ambulance with her brother because he\u2019d had an extremely severe allergic reaction. At the time she cussed me out for putting strawberries in buffalo wings and not warning anyone but what her brother failed to tell her is that he\u2019d snuck into my bedroom to steal them. Once i told her this, she calmed down a bit and was just frustrated. I didn\u2019t tell her that i\u2019d done it on purpose but i\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve put 2+2 together at some stage. \n\nHer brother was okay in the end although i did find out that he would\u2019ve died if she weren\u2019t home at the time. He never came back to the house after that and I only saw him one more time before I moved out two months later. I feel incredibly guilty that i could\u2019ve cost him his life over some food but at the time, i thought the allergy was fairly minor and i\u2019m sure he\u2019s learnt his lesson about stealing food now. \n\nTL;DR: Roommates brother persistently stole my food, even breaking into my room to do so. I made buffalo wings with a special ingredient and he nearly died of an allergic reaction.\n\nEDIT: Some people are misinterpreting the part about the fee for the lock so i\u2019d just like to clarify. My landlord wanted me to pay him $30 so i could buy my own lock and install it myself. He said the fee was for potential damages to the door or something similar.",

Even if they only have minor symptoms at first, there\u2019s no warning for when the next time won\u2019t be minor.

I've never seen anyone in my third world country being allergic to any food.\n\nEdit: Ok I understand this allergy thing now. Maybe I will be allergic to some foods/fruits that I've never been exposed too, like Avocado which is not cultivated or imported into my country. The thing most people are saying that kids in my country die due to allergies and we will never know. Wrong. Without the examination of bodies and without the clinical results of the dead whatever they die from, it is illegal in my country to bury them without a doctors report on what was the reason of death. Although my country is developing but we have proper labs and healthcare.\n\nYou guys made an important point. The immune system depends on the things that we have been exposed too. This also proves a point that people in my country don't care much about corona SOP's (I do and you should too) and have lower death rate than the developed countries. Because they have a better immune system due to the exposure to bacteria and germs since their childhood.",

Then the nurse will come in and make sure that you filled out the information correctly on your collection cup  \n\\- No, there is no needle to the ball sack involved with IVF.  At least with our clinic there isn't  \n\\- \"I went through IVF and never did this.\"  Well I don't know how your process went but with me I've had to provide several analysis collections along with semen cultures.  I'm most likely going to have to provide more once our cycle starts  \n\\- Thank you everyone who is wishing us success in our journey with IVF.  It's been a very stressful last 7 months.  Especially with COVID and trying to schedule all of the appointments.  \n",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn't happen today, but I was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought I'd share.\n\nThis happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. This meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who I'll call H) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn't specified which one (important later).\n\nSo one day H invited me over to watch a film after school. When I arrived I said hi to her parents then went upstairs with H to her bedroom to watch the film. This is where the fuck up slowly started. First of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when I visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn't want to be disturbed by her parents. Then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. We really didn't think much about either of these things.\n\nAnyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. Now this is where I really fucked up, I was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. H found this really funny so I continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. At some point during this time I heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. Some more important information to know is that H is asexual (meaning that she doesn't experience sexual attraction and doesn't want to have sex), and her parents don't know this about her because she doesn't like to talk to them about that kind of thing. This means that I constantly forget that most people don't know this about her.\n\nAnother 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. We thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. H shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. We were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. H picked up the paper and it said \"we're going to get McDonalds for dinner do you want anything?\".\n\nWe were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. Then it dawned on me and I turned to H and asked her \"Do your parents think we were fucking?\", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell I had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. We had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, I had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... Not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. Also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn't know which one it was, and didn't know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.\n\nWe immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. When we went downstairs to say what we wanted from McDonald's her parents couldn't look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. After the McDonalds I left and H spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that I had a boyfriend (which her parents didn't know about). I think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. Luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.\n\nTL;DR Went round to a female friend's house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... Now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open.",

And she may be asexual, but it is very unlikely and I would hate for her to miss out on some of the best parts of life because she kept her mind closed to any sexual attraction.

            "Typical self-centered teen synopsis of their experience.....Maybe the OPs parents were acting weird because of something completely unrelated to their behavior. There are a few details in the OPs story that stand out from the rest of the story that may lead to a far much greater discovery of her home life, parents, self realization, you know, coming to age type shit!!! I will simply share a couple observations I  had that I believe carry far more water than the short-sighted OP teen shared in her post.  A few that standout to me are the parents behaviors, a nonchalant creeping by the door,  \"soft knocking at the door\" followed by an awkward slip of paper underneath the door, and the biggest tell of all, McDonald's for dinner!!!  This behavior pf her parents did stand out to the OP as she stated \" We thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room\". Now the mere fact I lost my train of thought , I will just say, that maybe, just maybe the OPs actions/behavior inside the room that night wasn't the true cause of  the parents awkward behavior. Its my opinion and belief that the parents decided earlier in the month that they were going to come home early for a relaxing evening of eating edibles and streaming their favorite Netflix series. Then as a result of eating too many edibles, getting too high, falling victim to the paranoia seeping in they began to start feeling really guilty for their actions, I mean they're parents after all, great parents for that matter. It was then when they realized they were hungry, but McDonald's was the only most delicious thing they could think of! Seeing how great of parents they are, and knowing how much OP loves her Mickey D's didn't want to leave without asking her if she wanted any, but they couldn't just barge in and ask, they were too high, OP would know if they were high and that wasn't good. So they decided they would do a bit of reconnaissance first (creeping by the door), then when it was all clear they would simply slip an easy peasy note under the door asking if you wanted any McDonald's thinking you'd simply oblige and they'd be in the clear to head out on a McDonald's journey of food love, and once again being the heroes they once were when you were a little tot. Well that was their pot stricken minds plan, obviously it worked out much differently than planned. Moral of the story, Teach your children well, Their father's hell did slowly go by, and feed them on your dreams. The one they picks, the one you'll know by. Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry, So just look at them and sigh and know they love you.",
            "I once accidentally went on a gay date and didn't realize it.  I was in college and a friend asked me to go to dinner with him using the excuse that one of his elective classes wanted him to eat out at a foreign restaurant.  Knowing this guy for years prior, I agreed thinking to myself that we would grab some food and possibly hang out.  We ended up at a really nice place and he came dressed up.  Me being oblivious still didn't realize this was a date until he started asking me if I was dating anyone and what my interest were.  The rest of the evening was quite awkward and I never hung out with him again.  This was in 1991 and I to this day have no clue what happened to him.  We were good friends growing up, and looking back I was probably a bit embarrassed about it and didn't want anyone to think I was gay.  I spent the remaining time in college avoiding him.",

        "selftext": "I received a very panicked call yesterday afternoon while I was sitting at my computer in my boxers sipping on some of that pod coffee. \u201cHi, is this Marmalade Recording Studio?\u201d\u2026\n\nFor background, I\u2019m a self-employed audio engineer who mostly records local musicians out of my apartment studio, and potential clients, and as you\u2019d imagine, are usually artists or bands who want to record their music. However, every so often I get other requests, such as recording audio for a local radio commercial, or being asked to improve recordings they have done themselves, such as in today\u2019s case\u2026\n\n\u201cHi, is this Marmalade Recording Studio?\u201d. Its 4pm and I am not much in the mood to record any new clients but he proceeds to inform me he is outside the studio right now and just needs me to clean up some audio he recorded on his phone. I tell him that he can email it and I\u2019ll return it the next day, but that wasn\u2019t going to work with Joe here. He sounds desperate as he explains, \u201cI have been suspicious that my wife has been cheating on me with our neighbor\u201d. He proceeds to tell me how he started an audio recording on his phone, hid it in his bedroom, and left for work. When he returned later the phone had recorded nearly 6 hours of audio. He got back in his car and sat in his driveway for a minute, composing and preparing himself, connected his phone to Bluetooth and began playing this recording, while \u201cdriving around aimlessly\u201d. He says he thinks he is \u201chearing his wife moan\u201d and potentially a male voice is in there as well and needs to the audio improved so he can be sure. He lives two hours south of me and said he got off the freeway and googled recording studio and I was the first one that popped up. Jeez, I can\u2019t say no. I tell him to stay I\u2019ll come meet him outside and we\u2019ll get this audio cleaned up a bit.\n\nJoe here seems like a good enough guy, though very emotionally distraught. I\u2019m filling up a glass of water for him before we sit at the computer. He\u2019s just giving that stare at the wall, that mindless stare, and I lead him into the studio room. He airdrops me the audio file, and sure enough it\u2019s 6 hours long. My immediate thought is I\u2019ll clean up the audio and I\u2019ll see in the waveform where it gets\u2026louder. He is just sitting there in disbelief. A few minutes later, after making the most awkward small talk he asks me if anything is going wrong in my life, laughs, and clarifies that it\u2019d make him feel better knowing someone else is going through a hard time.\n\nI\u2019m really feeling for this guy and noticing a few loud parts looking at this file. He interrupts and says he can\u2019t listen and asks if I can just send him \u201cdefinitive proof\u201d that she is cheating on him. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything long, just maybe 15 seconds. That\u2019s probably all I could bear to hear\u201d. I tell him I\u2019ll return something tonight and that I won\u2019t charge him because, well how could I?\n\nI make myself a drink after he leaves and I get another phone call. This time from a potential client who wants to discuss recording his band. These are my favorite calls and guarantees good money. 9 songs is the plan and after our call he sends me a demo of one of his songs. Pretty good stuff, kinda bluegrass style. Simultaneously, Joe sends me a text thanking me.\n\nI hit play. It\u2019s mostly nonsense, the TV is going, randomly I\u2019m hearing a little girl in the background (he told me I might since they have a two year old daughter) . But after sometime I stumble on something, I\u2019m thinking this might validate his suspicions. It sounds like a woman, enjoying herself, along with a guy grunting. There it is.\n\nI send him this clip and I don\u2019t know what to add, so I just text, \u201cI think this is what you\u2019re looking for\u201d. I sit back down and continue my drink, loading up the song I was working before Joe called me in the first place.\n\nTwo hours go by and I get a call, and it\u2019s from Joe. I am hesitant to answer because I don\u2019t want to work anymore on this infidelity jam and I am not so much in the mood to be a shoulder to cry on, it seems to be a recurring issue in my line of work. But I answer. \u201cHey, are you going to send me anything tonight?\u201d, he asks. I\u2019m a bit confused and tell him I texted him a while ago. He checks his phone and says he didn\u2019t get anything from me. My heart sinks, I know I sent that audio to someone. I tell Joe I\u2019ll send it right over. I\u2019m dying to get off the phone to figure out who received a 15 second audio clip of screaming infidelities. Dammit. I sent it to the bluegrass guy. This guy sends me a cool demo and I replied with sex sounds. I decide I should probably follow up that text and I write to him saying \u201cwhoops wrong person\u201d and I am just laughing my ass off, thinking that might smooth things over. I proceed to send the audio over to Joe. Then I remember Joe is likely going to be crying himself to sleep tonight. Bluegrass guy never responded and Joe wrote back 10 minutes later saying \"thanks\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr: a bummed out dude secretly recorded his wife banging another guy and asked me to clean up the audio and send him a short clip from the recording. I accidentally sent that recording to a potential client who never responded after I said \u201cwhoops wrong person\u201d.",

            "I use to work at Starbucks and would often work night shifts. One of the shifts was called a \u201cprincess shift\u201d which basically maintained lobby register, clean all the dishes for the night and taking out the trash. \n\nWell one night I was working I rang up two customers who were really touchy. Like they couldn\u2019t keep their hands to themselves in the lobby but I didn\u2019t think much of it. After I rang them up I gathered all the trash and headed outside. Meanwhile I notice the couple making out in the truck parked right in front of the store. \n\nAgain didn\u2019t think much of it so I start heading towards the dumpster which is super dark out and not lit very well. As I approach the dumpster a man in panic comes in front of me. The first thought that came to mind was great I\u2019m getting robbed. Man tells me \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you and I just want to ask you a couple questions.\u201d He than asks if I noticed a couple inside and I tell him about the couple I saw and eventually tell him they were very touchy. He goes into a panic state and starts mumbling to himself. I realize that this guy must be her SO. He heads towards his vehicle which is right in front of us and opens up his driver door and reaches in for something and I give him a look in horror thinking he\u2019s got a weapon. The first thing that came to mind was that he had a gun and was an extreme jealous type. He flips on his car light and two little kids are sleeping in the back. My heart broke looking at this poor broken man and I give him a hug and tell him that I\u2019m sorry. Last I saw of him was the truck drove off and he followed them shortly after. I finish the garbage run and return inside to tell the two girls Im working with what just happened to me and they both look horrified. \n\nSide story:\nI tell my gf at the time the story of what happened and I promised her I would never cheat on her. Months later I catch her talking with another guy. Gave her a second chance but broke things off shortly after. Nows she\u2019s having that mans baby.

        "selftext": "I decided to get tested to see if I could donate my kidney to my wife of 6 years. We have two kids together (4f,2m). My wife got sick just after our son was born and now is in need of a kidney transplant. We checked with her relatives and none were a match or a viable doner.\n\nLast week I got tested. I knew it would be a long shot so I decided to get tested to see if I could donate. I got a call the other day saying that I was a match. The doctor then said something about wanting to do additional testing due to some information from the HLA tissue test results. I didn't think much of it and agreed.\n\nThen the results came in I was shocked and confused. He explained that because of how DNA information is passed down through generations a parent to a child could have at least a 50% match. Siblings could have a 0-100% match. It was rare to have a high match as husband and wife. I asked what does that mean.\n\nHe said that my wife and I have an \"abnormally high match percentage.\"\n\nLong story short were related. No I'm not kidding. I was put up for adoption before I was born. Placed into a family that moved across the country. I knew I was adopted but we didn't have any I formation about my bio family. It was a closed adoption.\n\nI met my wife by chance 8 years ago. I was on a trip from work and she was working at the sight I went to. We worked together for a week. We exchanged numbers kept in touch. I was sent back there 3 more times that year and each time we became closer. I was given the opertunity to be transferred out there in a new higher paying position in a different department as hers the rest is history.\n\nI don't know what do do moving forward but I know it may be wrong. She is my wife and the mother of our kids. This post is probably going to get removed but it is all true.\n\nTL;DR: Wife of 6 years needs a kidney I got tested and we have an abnormally high match percentage for being husband and wife.\n\nEdit: look at name. All of my family is from my adopted parents. My parents adopted me 2 minutes after I was born. Their name is on my Birth certificate. They have not told me anything about my bio parents and don't have any info.\nHer family is not a match as stated above most of her family has low match potential or can't donate due to medical or other reasons.\nI am 2 years older than my wife. I do know that my wife was born when her parents were late teens.",

            "Hello, I am a clinical laboratory scientist working in a histocompatibility and immunogenics lab aka transplant lab. I do the testing to find out if recipients and donors are matches through genetic typing, donor specific antibody testing, etc. What the doctor is talking about is likely haplotype mismatches. When doing HLA typing, we are looking at haplotypes for the class 1 and class 2 genes you receive from each parent. When we are comparing a non biological donor to a recipient, there can be a few haplotype matches due to population frequency, or no haplotype matches. When comparing a biological donor to a recipient, like siblings, they have a 50% chance of being haploidentical. Parents are always haploidentical to their children.This analysis tells us how likely organ rejection could be. So if you are haploidentical to your wife, you are biological siblings. If it's only a few haplotype matches, you could be cousins, or potentially not related and it's random assortment (you got lucky). But I can't say what the answer is without seeing the haplotypes myself. I also want you to know that it is possible that that doctor is talking out of his ass. Transplant medicine is a very new science that is still being developed today. Some of the doctors that I work with are extremely knowledgeable and know way more than me about this science. Some of the doctors that I work with, I frequently wonder where they got their degree. So don't blindly trust this guy, you should probably see a geneticist for confirmation.\n\nEdit: TL;DR: You might be biological siblings, you might be cousins, or the doctor could be wrong.\n\nEdit2: thanks for the gold!",

            "I personally would let it go. The taboos against close relations becoming sexual partners serve two purposes. First, it lessons the number of birth defects caused by inbreeding. Second, and more importantly, they play a role in protecting vulnerable people from sex with relatives, often by coercion. While that occurs, it is not sanctioned .  On average, birth defects from close relations producing offspring are very low.  Neither you nor your wife were coerced into a relationship and you did not know each other as children.  You might want to talk with a genetic counsellor  for more information. However, on the personal level, I don't think you've done anything unethical.",

            "just do a 23 and me test or something similar and see what comes up. honestly, no need to change things now. you're both adults, you both love each other, and there's no reason that the info needs to change anything fundamentally between you two. it only benefits your family- you can now use the info to fill in your medical history and give your kids a chance to know their extended family.\n\nthis type of thing happens between donor conceived children sometimes, there are resources out there on how to handle it. i'd def recommend looking for something like that to help you guys navigate this info.",
            "Unless your directly related (brother-sister), the chance of anything being off with the kids is pretty damn low. That stuff usually happens due to a build-up cousin marriages etc. through the entire family tree, over generations. Obviously that\u2019s different a bit if your somehow very closely related.\n\nI\u2019d personally never be able to hide something like this from my spouse. Now that you know this my personal opinion would be she deserves to know. I think these redditors that think it\u2019s some sort of \u2018white lie\u2019 to hide this information are wrong. I recommend you both get fully tested to see how closely related you are, and take it from there.",
            "No no no. Seriously. Stop for a second and listen. You are confusing two very different things:\n\n1. HLA matching. These 3 HLA \u201cgenes\u201d serve important functions in the immune system and the more of the 6 (3 genes x 2 copies as we have 2 chromosomes/copies) you match, the lower risk of your body rejecting the transplanted organ.\n\n2. Genetic relationships i.e. heritage, blood relation, paternity, etc. \n\nStrangers can be anywhere from 0/6 to 6/6 HLA match. Yes, it is not common to have a high match, but it does happen. That is part of the matching algorithm with the deceased donor transplant list so obviously matching does occur.\n\nI would recommend you and your wife do ancestry.com, my heritage, or 23andme testing BEFORE you assume you are related. There is no way your doctor did this kind of testing to see if you are related.\n\nI hope this makes sense.",

            "OP: when your kids get older, advise them to get pre-conception genetic testing. You can do it whenever, whether or not they have a partner yet. It\u2019s a good idea for anyone in the world to do, as everyone is a carrier for at least one genetic disorder. Most are recessive and rare enough they never find a partner with a matching gene (so no problems). Because you and your wife are related there are slightly higher odds that your kids are at least carriers of something. Assuming no other incest in the family (so this is simple rather than complex consanguinity), the odds aren\u2019t particularly bad, but still worth noting. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to reveal anything to your kids when you advise them to do this testing; just say you might have some history of genetic diseases in your birth family and it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.",

It might be *the most likely* explanation (edit: though, actually, I think it's probably a distant second), but that doesn't make it *anywhere close to being likely* unless it's actually impossible without it being due to blood relation.\n\nLook at it this way: maybe there's a 90% chance that any given people with this high of a match are siblings. That doesn't mean that you two are a 90% chance to be siblings, however, because the conjoined probability of you two having that high of a match *and* being long-lost siblings who happened to be married is extraordinarily low thanks to the sheer improbability of the latter portion.\n\nIf you can have an abnormally high match as not-siblings, then the combined probabilities of the other possibilities are likely far higher than the possibility of being straight-up siblings or anything near that close. If, indeed, it's possible to be entirely unrelated and still have an abnormally high match, then the OVERWHELMING likelihood that you are not related easily outweighs the rarity of not-siblings having a match like this. This strikes me as a doctor presenting the correct information without the proper statistical analysis, and I hope you don't take their word for it without further genetic testing. \n\nI think this is the Prosecutor's Fallacy, even?

I found this nice video and started\u2026 uhh you get it. Just a dude being a dude to some futanari. \n\nLiterally right as I\u2019m about to finish wanking, my fucking father comes in to tell me breakfasts ready. \n\nI don\u2019t know who looked more traumatized and in shock. \n\nAnd when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any fucking worse, I came. I fucking came all over my keyboard. It\u2019s like we were both paralyzed with fear. He left a few minutes after standing still in fear, disappointment, and sadness. \n\nBreakfast was as awkward as it gets when you catch your son jerking off to futanari rule 34.\n\nThat was about as awkward as it gets when you get caught jerking off to anime chicks with dicks. My dad was in the military so he\u2019s pretty tough and will probably get over this. However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat. \n\nI fucking hate myself and want to die. My friends are gonna bully me so hard if I tell them, and yet I feel like I need to confess about what happened. I think I can take being bullied by Reddit.\n\nTLDR; Got caught watching hentai chicks with dicks, and I might get disowned.\n\nEdit 1: Hey guys I got banned from Reddit and can only update posts. I removed the bi thing. My reasoning at the time was a girl who has a cock is pretty bi. I mean I\u2019m attracted to girls and guys so a girl with a cock seemed pretty bi to me but I\u2019m kinda wrong since straight people can also like futa.\n\nAlso fuck off you degenerates I\u2019m not sharing the sauce. It\u2019s a hardcore pounding video on nhentai. The girl has pink hair. I send you on a mighty fap quest to find it.\n\nDad got pissed and yelled at me. Mom cried. Life is awkward and I woke up to over 20k upvotes. Dad even threatened to kick me out. He\u2019s a pussy though and didn\u2019t do it. We had a talk. He\u2019s seen weirder shit but he was surprised to see his own son like weird shit like futa and hentai. Mom might\u2019ve disowned me but at this point I\u2019m too numb to care.\n\nWhoever gave this a wholesome award is going to hell.",

I am usually really good with people...but...\n\nI delivered pizza to a house like I have done a million times.  As I walk up to the door, all I can smell is pot, and can hear loud music.  I figured it was a party.  I knock, and there was no answer.  I knock louder.  This massive dude with hair down to his ass answers and yells at me for knocking too loud.  I apologized, and went on my way.\n\nNext weekend, I see the same address come up, but unit \"B\" (it was a 4 plex type thing).  I walk down the concrete steps to unit \"B\", and knock on the door.  This tall bald dude answers.  I ask him if he knows the guy upstairs, and told him the asshole upstairs yelled at me for knocking too loud.  He looks at me puzzled, and says \"I know, that was me, I bought this 4 plex\".  The dude shaved his head.  From hair to his ass, to bald.  I didn't recognize him at all.  I instantly died on the inside.  I apologized and went on my way.\n\nNext weekend...same address.  Remember those concrete steps I mentioned?  When I walked down them, the loop on my pizza bag got hooked on his mail box that was hung on the fence.   It ripped the mail box clear off the fence, and flung it down the stairs.  It actually bounced off his door when it landed.  He opened the door to see me looking like a deer in headlights, frantically pointing at his mailbox (which was bent and twisted now) and trying to explain that I really didn't mean to do it.  I gtfo as quick as I could.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext weekend...oh no....same address.  I delivered his pizza successfully this time.  After he paid I nervously said \"Hey, I didn't even insult you or wreck your property this time\".  He laughed, said \"good job\" and handed me a $5 tip.  That was the last time I ever saw that dude.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR am the worst pizza delivery guy ever.",

I said \"after some serious consideration I don't feel like I could live the rest my life without regret knowing I turned down such an amazing potato, i was wondering if i could still accept your offer?\" With the biggest smile he said sure and ran to grab the potato. He handed to me, I thanked him and went on my way.\nAs the door closed behind me i heard what sounded like an entire crowd errupt into laughter, cheering and celebration. I could even hear people jumping up and down. I knew accepting it would make his day but I didn't realise it would make mine.\n\n Definitely no regrets about accepting the potato.

I legitimately had all these thoughts at once. Then a light bulb! My knife! \n\nI said, \u201cWhat are you gonna do with that pig sticker f*cker?!\u201d and I lunged at him. He turned and ran.

He was an engineer in between jobs. You would think to an engineer delivering pizza would be easy. But not for this kid. He lasted one day.\n\nHis first screw up... He had a large delivery to the high school across the street, around 8 large pies. It was a windy day. He gets to the HS and parks his car. He takes the pizzas out and puts them on the hood so he can shut the door. It was soo windy that the wind blew all the pies off the car. Pizza was everywhere on the ground in front of the HS. We had to remake the pies and re-deliver it. Okay so one mistake, it happens. \n\nHis second screw up... He had to deliver a $550 catering order. We load up his car, crack a joke saying \"Don't put the food on the hood of the car.\" He gets in the car with all the food and drives off. We get a call. It's the new delivery kid...\n\nThis guy gets to the house and can't get the food that's in his car. I don't know how he managed to do this but the kid fuckin locked his keys in the car along with the food! So now the people who ordered are like wtf the food is sitting in the car getting cold.

First one was my fault, I got lost and showed up 30 minutes late. \n\n2nd one was a lady who watched the clock and freaked out because she got her order 31 minutes after placing it. Ignoring the fact it was New Years day, I was the only driver, and had 4 deliveries before her. \n\nBoss gave her a free pizza and told me not to worry about it. \n\nWe had a driver's list of customers known to be cheap bastards. These customers repeatedly ordered and never tipped. I delivered to one of them, noticed he had a huge Snoopy Santa on his front lawn, and as usual no tip. \n\nI went back to the store and commented on it to my fellow drivers. As we were all a bit surly from working on Christmas, we decided that it was time to attain justice. \n\nOne of them was a young fellow who mentioned he had a pellet rifle at home he could swing by and pick up before his shift was over...\n\nThree of us piled into his car after work, picked up some beer, and drove over to Snoopy Santa's place. As I was the guy in the backseat, I shot Snoopy four or five times and we drove off. We toasted Snoopy Santa's demise with a beer and we all went home. \n\nBuddy of mine drove by early the next morning and texted us all that Snoopy Santa was well deflated.\n\nJustice Attained? \n\nI dunno. \n\nFelt good though.\n\nTell you what tho, delivering on the Auburn vs Alabama game day, HOLY MOLY...

I then started swinging across the city on web fuel. When I was swinging though, I saw some stupid kids walking infront of a big black truck. Naturally, I yeeted the pizza onto a balcony and then saved their lives. I proceeded to scold them for being stupid zoomers, but then some random white dude tried to take my pizza, so I had to get it back and keep moving so I didn't dissapoint the Joe's Pizza brand. \n\nI arrived at the destination after inconspicuously changing in a cleaning closet like all normal men do.

        "selftext": "This happened this weekend. I'm (35m) not exactly the kinda guy who gets invited to baby showers very often. But it seems like everyone I know has matured about 10 years in the past 1 pandemic year. So suddenly, friends are getting married and pregnant, and so on.\n\nOne such couple, I've known for close to 10 years, has a baby girl due in July. Awesome for them. They are both pretty scholarly folks, with degrees in English. One is an author and one is a copywriter for a brand.\n\nSo when their baby shower invite said \"instead of a card, please bring a book so that whenever we read it, we'll think of you\" I *assumed* it meant they wanted to grow their already extensive library (I mean I was also getting them a baby gift). So I bought them, what I felt was, a deeply moving novel.\n\nAs my partner and I are driving out to their place, she says, \"I got them 'What tree am I' it's really cute and has pretty pictures. What book did you get them?\"\n\nSuddenly, a light goes off. I look at her blankly and ask, \"You got them a kids book?\"\n\nShe puts her hand over her mouth in disbelief. \"Oh my god. Yes. It's a baby shower. You get them kids books. You know... for the baby. Why? What book did you get them?\"\n\n\"Well, in my defense, 'The Bone Clocks' by David Mitchell is very captivating. And if you read it out loud in the right tone of voice, the baby probably won't even mind the horrific details about the Iraq war, genocide, murder, gender issues, or death cults.\"\n\nNeedless to say, it seemed a little out of place next to, \"S is for Salmon\", \"Why do I love you\", \"Goodnight Moon\", and \"Irish Fairy Tales\".\n\nI was also reminded that a 600+ page novel may not be a priority for new parents. Whatever, mine had the best critic reviews on the back.\n\nEDIT: I definitely wasn't expecting this big of a response, so a few updates:\n\nI'm genuinely humbled by everyone's stories here. My TIFU is less that I gave this book and more that I feel I committed some unspoken social faux pas, in that the spirit of the event is about preparing the parents for the child's needs and I didn't pick up on that and instead gave *them* a gift of a book (thinking it was a direct substitute for a card). But hearing from a lot of people that this would actually be a welcome gift makes me comfortable that maybe the faux pas is superseded.\n\nAs for the response, I wrote below: *I think the ultimate conclusion will still play out for a bit. But the immediate conclusion was, my friends were appreciative of the thought (they thought it was cute that I was thinking of them). Some of the guests were very confused and gave me the \"wait, who is this guy\" look. And other guests who have known me for a long time gave me the \"Yeah, that's typical \\[mykreau\\]\". So I guess, my TIFU was on brand. But I did get to at least explain it to the couple afterward and they laughed their asses off about how it unfolded. And I explained that they had an actual baby gift in the mail waiting for them. So I'm not a total monster.*\n\nMy partner never got upset at me about this. And she didn't shame my FU. She thought it was funny and said it gave a window into my personality.\n\nAlso, thanks for some of the additional book reccos.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTIFU by buying my friends a huge, dark, complex, adult novel for their baby shower instead of a kid's book.",

I would get mom care baskets with anything not baby related that made my life easier after delivery (as the birth employee, not expecting people who haven't given birth to know all of this stuff, I certainly didnt and I'm sure I'm missing some partner related gifts but I did not experience that either)  No holds barred guys, I gifted heavy flow pads, toss away undies, belly bands for c sections or natural birth, nipple and crotch creams, soft bras, bra pads, alcohol, sex toys (for no pressure masturbation because after your first you can feel like your body is a stranger to yourself let alone your partner) chocolate etc. I'd get something for their partner too, that was always wildly different depending on the guy. Then after the shower I'd stay and help pack up, whatever it seemed like they didnt have enough of or really needed from their registry/personal experience I would order or buy and send over without flair and whenever possible anonymously.\n\nI get invited to all the baby showers now, I win the dont say \"Baby\" game everytime and I talk to mom about how shes doing, and the weather, and the price of gas....",

Usually when my fianc\u00e9 and I start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. \n\nLast night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must\u2019ve been having a good dream). I was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. It was all going per usual, he was done, I was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. My eyes were closed and I was not being very quiet. Right as I was about to start my journey back down to earth I feel a long wet tongue on my face. Open my eyes, my GSD is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. \n\nLet me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. I pushed my dog away and my fianc\u00e9 just burst into tears from laughing so hard. \n\nTL;DR we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. My GSD snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. \n\nEdit: I can\u2019t believe the most popular Reddit post I will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! Also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win? \n\nEdit 2: GSD (German Shepard dog) for those of you angry about this, thank you for commenting and bringing my karma up even higher. Also for those of you confused about the whole process, just because my fianc\u00e9 was finished doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t help a girl out. ",

Realizing it was her dog I immediately screemed like a school girl saying her dog had licked my balls. I lost all urges I had and just wanted to go smoke a cigarette. So I go to grab my shoes to go outside and the dogs while outside the room had chewed up my shoes to the point of even puting them on wasnt going to be possible. I then had to walk back into the room and ask if I could borrow some sandals and a ride to a store so I could get a new pair of shoes. "

        "selftext": "Today I present to you my lifelong fuckup. I'm a 19 year old guy, I own a penis, and I've never cleaned it properly in my life. \n\nSo, today I was taking a piss at my job, and I noticed a small yellow fragment at the top of my penis. I wondered where it came from, the only logical answer was the inside of my dick. So I peeled my foreskin back, a little further every pull, and when I got right to the edge of my glans, I found the place it originated from. \n\nMy penis was covered with a yellow, clay like substance. At first I thought it was normal, but then the smell hit me. I realized what had happened. When I was younger, my dad told me that to wash my dick, I should pull the foreskin back. And I did, or so I thought. \n\nI have always washed my dick by pulling back the foreskin just slightly (until it uncovered just the tip of my glans). I thought that was just fine and I never really thought anything of it. \n\nI have also been sexually active while this shit was probably in there, but never more than once with the same girl. Weird coincidence. \n\nAnyway, I'm realising all this while still standing at the urinal at work. I tried to peel the loose pieces off, and they let go pretty easy. The biggest pieces are still stuck to my dick, it looks pretty much like they're continents. I put my dick in the sink and turned the faucet on, hoping I could wash the big plaques off. I couldn't, my dick was sensitive as hell and the pieces are stuck. \n\nI'm about to go in the shower and peel at it with q-tips and my fingers until it's clean, and I plan on washing my dick better in the future. I hope that what I've accumulated right now doesn't lead to any serious issues. \n\nTL;DR: haven't washed my dick properly in 19 years, but I wasn't aware. Now my dick has a crusty smegma layer that I'm going to have to peel off.\n\nEdit: I just stood in the shower for 20 minutes getting bits and pieces off. Most of it is behind the hood so to speak, and I can get that lose quite easily, however, some of it is on my glans and I can't get it loose for the life of me. I nearly fainted for real when I tried to scrub it off. Anyone know of a method to get it off?\n\nEdit for all the other guys that have made the same mistake as me: I've done my research on this phenomenon now, and pretty much all the trustworthy sources I've read say to do the following:\n\n- wash daily with mild soap (for the rest of your live)\n\n- don't use cloth/q-tips/hands to scrub it off, just keep washing with soap daily until it's gone\n\n- if it doesn't get cleaned by washing with soap: go to doctor\n\nEdit: why the fuck are so many people asking for pictures. I thought I was the nasty one here.",

When one hour had passed, we walked back, paid and turned around, opened the wrapping and started looking at the pictures. The first picture was like a smack in the face, my husbands erect penis. Next one was me, naked and him doing naughty things to me.  \nI could feel them looking at us. I felt like I was shrinking into the grund. I could not stop looking at the pictures while slowly realizing what I was looking at. I could not keep calm, so I just sprinted out, took the pictures and left my husband there.

We figured we would take a few of the disposable cameras that still had some photos left on them with us on the honey moon.  Well, one night of over indulgence we got back to our suite after a fun night of partying and we came up with the great idea to take sexcapade pictures with one of the cameras.  Work up the next morning mortified....and vowed to never get it developed.

            "A long time ago when chemical photo processing was the norm, I worked in a custom photo lab.  The racy images that many places would not print, we did, so long as it was legal.  \n\n\nOne time we had a lady that was having us custom print a 16x20 color portrait of her nude from about mid thigh up.  She was very particular that the color of her head hair, pubic hair and nipples be precisely correct.  The problem was that the carpet did not match the drapes.  I had made a test print (4x6) so she could approve the colors.  I thought it was dead-on, as we held the photo up to her shoulder and the head hair was an almost exact match.  I was only about 3 units of magenta off, where most people have trouble seeing a difference when there is a 10 unit change.  She said the hair was acceptable, but the pubes and nipple color weren't quite right.  At her suggestion, she came back into the studio area and presented the appropriate reference materials.  I went back and ran another test print, where I made the required custom color adjustments to those specific areas, then we compared again.

Stuttering he said that he had VERY private and VERY embarrassing photos to develop and insisted that he stays around to see the process to make sure none of the photos end up in the wrong hands during development.\nWhen done the owner quickly scanned the deck to make sure all photos developed correctly, as they usually do for QC, and she noticed some boring vanilla home porn. The guy started panicking, so she just looked at him and with a smirk said:\nSir, judging by these you have no idea what 'private' or 'embarrassing' means.\n\nWhen we continued talking she mentioned, without detail, animals, priests, nuns, gore... that was back in the 90's in a very conservative and catholic country. She said that after a few years of owning the store it was almost impossible to shock her",

I once printed a blurry out-of-focus penis for an athletes Mother because she didn't know what it was. I took a vote in the lab if we should print it or not (Because she was an awesome customer) and it was really out of focus, flash burned... it would have been legit to say \"Sorry, couldn't\". The look on her face when she realized what it was... sigh.

They probably don't get rolls of nudes like that anymore.\n\nI'm going to bet the best thing out of the whole experience was watching your mortification and running... that'll be a laugh and humour for them forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake care, thanks for the trip down memory lane.",

            "As someone who worked in photofinishing for years, you can rest assured that these people have seen it all. It may amuse them for a minute, but its pretty old news that couples get naughty and take photos ( alcohol is usually involved) I knew people who did this regularly, without a thought. Dont be embarrassed by being \" normal\" and having a good relationship with your spouse. The funniest part to the workers was probably your reaction! Go back, I'll bet you'd be welcome",
            "I worked in a photo lab in the later 90s and early 2000s. Before the digital cameras were cheap enough for the average joe. The amount of homemade porn being printed was insane. Everyone that worked there for more than a month did not give a crap about it, it was just normal.",

I worked at a store that developed film and we developed rolls of homemade porn pretty much on a daily basis.  When I first started it round catch the attention so far as \"whoa, check this out\" or \"ugh... I think I just puked a little\".  After a very short period though, you just stopped noticing.  Unless of course there was something especially crazy or nasty, or unless it wound up being someone you knew.",

Everyone was laughing especially my partner who then shouted,\" you best sort your vibrator out love\".",
            "Oh no!  What will people do if they know you had sex with your *husband*?  So naughty!  ;). Just kidding. I have similar stories but it was that my parents would keep the same roll of film for months because they were stingy with pictures and then only developed them when there was a coupon. So once I was really excited to get pics of a trip I took with my friends in high school and flipping through the stack trying to find them, I instead get an eyeful of my mom on all fours wearing some kind of fetish gear.",
            "A friend of mine used to own a photo lab back when film was mainstream. Oh, the things people print... Trust me, your DIY porn shocked no one at that lab, except maybe the rookies. \n\nPS: One of the regulars of the aforementioned lab were a couple of very kinky swingers. They were in their 80s...",

It didn't seem like an odd request really but the place was on her way to and back from work but out of my way so in hindsight I should have known something was off. \n\nImagine my surprise when the sweet little 75 year old man that ran the place took me aside and asked that next time I dropped off such personal photos to let him know so he could cover the machine. I apologised and told him I had no idea what was on the film as 8t wasn't mine but I could tell he didn't believe it (my sister and I look a lot alike).  Once I was in the car I opened the envelope to find 2 dozen picture of her grinning with her boyfriend's fully erect penis and nothing else. Who even needs that many dick pics?!?",
            "you took porn photo's of yourself with film... then stupidly misplaced the self made porn... forgot about it, found it later and then develop it?\n\nshit you did that all to yourself. HAHAHAHA",

            "In HS I worked at a drug store one summer and the person that worked on the film printing station told us they'd see naked pics all the time, and most were of folks she'd wish she hadn't seen in the nude. She said it took a couple of months for her to just be blase about it.\n\nthis was before cellphones had cameras in them.",
            "I was afraid this was gonna go... another direction. I'll speak vaguely for your sanity, when I worked at Walgreens in the photolab years back, we had to get cops involved with a customer's photo orders on two occasions, because the customers had brought in illegal content. One of them was, according to the customers, film from Grandpa's attic they had found while cleaning up.\n\nThe phrase \"I found old camera film laying around\" always brings up some squicky memories.",

Your negatives, if they were properly cared for, are capable of providing much better scans of your archive photos than your prints will ever give you.  Slides also will give wonderful scans.",

And one night of fun can turn into a nightmare. \n\nI had a case of a boyfriend (now ex) who filmed us having intercourse with his laptop camera and I just caught it by chance and immediately made him delete it right away.. Our relationship didn't end very well, at all, so I'm glad he didn't had that video.\n\nMany states and countries don't have proper laws that protect people from this sort of crime. \n\nRemember people, better be safe than sorry.",
            "We used to develop pics at my old job, one day I get a call from this one cute lady telling me her pictures should be ready but that no one should look at them because they were personal.  We practically ran to the drawer to check.  It was of her wedding shower and she had her boobs out but that was it.  We tried not to show any emotion that we knew anything when she picked them up, I could see her scrutinizing us all closely.  I so wanted to complement her but held back.",

        "selftext": "So about 2 years ago, I was still living in my strict religious parents' house and the only way for me to find a place to have sex was to use my dad's office. My dad owns a small advertising business so on some weekends, I'll use the excuse of needing better network and needing to concentrate to get the keys to the office and have the girl meet me there. I know he and his staff never come to work on the weekend.  \nSo I was with this girl at the time and she was freaky af and asked if I had ever made a sex tape. I had, but as a gee, I knew the correct answer at that point was no, and once I said that, she pulled out my phone and placed it somewhere and we started to get freaky. I jerked off to it a couple of times after that at home (still my parent's house) before it became stale and I hid it and never really got back to it.  \n\n\n2 years later and I'm now living in my own house and I have a girlfriend who's out of town for a few months. I was telling her about the sex tape and she didn't like that I still had it and told me to delete it. I decided to give it one last jerk off before deleting it, so I hit a blunt, plugged in my headphones and started watching like I had done a couple of times years before. It was late at night. I started to beat myself off, listening to this girl moan over the background noise of a movie we were playing to mask our noise... till I heard a deep voice (we'll pretend my name is Manny) in my head say clear as day \"Manny why? Why??\"  \nI jumped out of my chair. My door was locked. No one was in the house with me. I was panicking. Was this my conscience talking??? Is my girlfriend a witch??? Is this because I'm watching a video she doesn't want me to watch?? I'm panicking as hell becuase it fucking scared me how clear the voice was. I wanted to watch the video again, but I honestly was too scared so I walked around the house for a bit, just to let the highness fade, in case that was what was responsible for me hearing voices.  \nOnce I was a little sober (still very shaken up) I decided to start the video from the beginning but to focus this time. So I sat in my chair, dick in my pants (it definitely had no interest in rising again), headphones on, studying this video like it's my finals. While listening, I noticed that while I was blowing her back out, there was a little ruckus in the background separate from the direction the movie sound was coming from. My ears perked up. It was a conversation in the background. Someone had opened the office door\n\n\"Oh the lights are on. Is Manny in the office.\"  \n\"I think so, the TV is on.\"  \n\\*some silence  \n\"Oh my God! Manny! Oh my God, why?\"   \n\"Why? Manny? Why??\"\n\nFrom the voices, I could tell one of them was my dad. I can only imagine the other person was my mum but I can't confirm because it was a bit further back. I have no idea what they were doing in the office that day but they definitely walked in on me, their good little boy, fucking a girl like an animal. And from the audio, they seemed to have stuck around a while after that (weird). This girl and I were absolutely lost in our oxytocin world, completely clueless that we had spectators.   \nI must have missed it all those times I jerked off to it because I never jerked off with both earphones on in my parent's house (always gotta be alert) and the TV noise just drowned the background sound then.   \nThe coincidence is still baffling to me because I would have never found out if this girl hadn't suggested we make a sex tape. My parents definitely never mentioned anything to me about it. A lot of shit started to make sense because that was around the period where they clamped down on my freedom (which eventually led to me leaving the house) and started becoming hostile to me.   \nThe hardest part was explaining to my girlfriend the discovery I had just made. \"Hey babe, you won't believe what I found in the sex tape you told me to delete\".  \n\n\nTL;DR: Watched a sex tape years after making it only to discover that my parents had walked in on me having sex while I was making it.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks to Reddit, I now have the image of my dad being there with someone who wasn\u2019t my mum to do the same thing. Unlikely though because the person would have to be very familiar with me to have the kind of conversation she was having with my dad. No such person. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m a trash person for watching it again while with my girl. For context though, I\u2019m a sex addict who hadn\u2019t gone two days without sex in about a year till I quit cold turkey to start a relationship with someone who I wouldn\u2019t be able to see for about 4 months. It didn\u2019t seem like a smart decision seeing I was bound to fail, but I made it because I lucked out with someone who truly truly understands me. Sorry to disappoint the few of you hoping she left me. She didn\u2019t. And when she sees this, I hope she knows I\u2019m forever grateful to have her.",

He just stood there for like a split second, and we both froze. His only words were: I\u2019m going to get your mom, I\u2019ll be back in fifteen minutes. Then he walked out to the car, and drove off. Dad never called me gay, ever again",

        "selftext": "I actually fucked up 8 years ago, but time has worn down my pride enough that I'm willing to finally share this story with the world. \n\nIt was recently suggested to me that I leave my Christmas tree up a little longer in order to further enjoy the cheeriness it brings to the living room. This is an easy thing to suggest when you haven't seen the things I've seen. When you haven't done the things that my boyfriend and I have done. You see, when you have one year when you leave your tree up until May, that experience changes you. It changes Christmas forever.\n\nWe have always used real trees as opposed to artificial ones, which means they need to be disposed of after the holidays. Back when we lived in an apartment they had a small window of time when you could leave the tree by the curb and they would haul it away for you. Unfortunately we missed that window, which turned into weeks and weeks of pretending the tree just... didn't exist. Sure the ornaments came down, but the skeletal remains of Christmas stood in our living room as a monument to our evasion of basic responsibilities. \n\nOne day, in late February or so, we realized we could be having friends over for dinner. We thought, \"Oh my god. We can't let people know we still have this tree!\" So we did what any logical couple would do and we hid it in the closet with a white blanket over it. You can imagine how terrifying it was in the beginning when you would get up to use the restroom in the middle of the night and see an 8 foot tall Christmas tree ghost looming in the doorway.\n\nI don't know what the final straw was. Maybe it was the storage space we were losing by having a massive cloaked Douglas fir in our closet. Maybe it was that we missed using the blanket that had taken on a new purpose in life. Whatever it was, we knew we couldn't avoid this issue any longer. The problem of how to dispose of the tree still existed. We couldn't leave it at the curb, and we knew wherever we took it, it was going to leave a breadcrumb trail of humiliation straight to our doorstep. \n\nThat's when the saw came out.\n\nInto the wee hours of the night we carefully disassembled the tree until it was compact enough to fit into a cardboard box. By 2am we were covered in sweat and sap, but we were able to stealthily discard the box in a nearby dumpster. On that day, we vowed to never again let the disposal of the Christmas tree become an episode of Forensic Files. \n\nAnd now my shameful past is out in the open for the internet to enjoy. Happy New Year, all!\n\nTL:DR - Holiday procrastination took a turn for the worse when my apartment became botanical Dexter scene. Also Happy New Year. :)",

I drag that brittle ass tree to the front of my driveway along with the nice green healthy tree. Left $40 in the envelope and hoped they would take both.\n\nI can't imagine what they thought when they saw that year old Douglas fir next to a \"fresh\" one. Maybe they used it to make a fire?

            "Me and an ex did exactly the same thing a few years ago!! We weren't supposed to have the tree in our apt in the first place so we snuck it inside in the middle of the night.

            "Hahaha oh my gosh I can 100% relate to this. My girlfriend and I got a Christmas tree last year and she insisted on getting a real one too. I like the smell of pine and I enjoy real trees so I was keen! We live in an condo on the top floor (fourth story). \n\nLong story short, our tree was dying and we missed our window of disposal. We live next to a field and that field has a decent sized wooded area. Without much thought I decided to throw it off the balcony, into the field, and drag it to the woods. \n\nUpon landing nearly all of the needles fell off. Not to mention I missed the gap of the fence separating the condominium property and the field. I run downstairs and chuck the tree over the fence and drag it to the woods. It\u2019s a snowstorm and there\u2019s literally 2.5 feet of snow in said field so it\u2019s exhausting and cold therefore I\u2019m rushing. \n\nAfter the deed is done I check out the view from my place. The landing spot of the tree looks like a crime scene; a literal outline of the tree in needles directly below my unit. I look out to the field and all you can see are footsteps to the forest seemingly dragging something. Mind you, all the needles fell off already so it looks like someone took a body out there and left it in the woods.",

People, especially those closest to me, definitely had their opinions on the matter \u2014 why is it still up!! \u2014 but it made me happy and that was that for me.  I think my refusal to quit the merriest season around had more to do with growing up with some rigid traditions/expectations that I won\u2019t get into RN.  When it\u2019s all said and done, I have no regrets.  I love the whimsy of it all and although I\u2019ll likely take it down this year (and next and so forth) there may come a year where me thinks I wants to keep it up and that will be just fine.  \n\nPS had some wine in honor of NY sooo apologies if I\u2019m rambling (this being a note to the maybe one person who is reading my comment lawlz).

(Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)\n\nSo lets preface this. There's an episode of Two & a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. \n\nSo I'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend Mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. We see that fateful scene and Mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. \n\nTwo things before we proceed:\n\n1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.\n\n2. While it's apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I'm allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.\n\nKnowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I'm going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.\n\nSo my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says \"get to scooping\" while he laughs in my face\n\nOnce He's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here's where my fuckup begins:\n\nI drink coffee often, so I'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.\n\nActually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It's VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn't get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I'm thinking \"I'm choking on lava\" and \"I really hope I don't die because of the one time I eat peanut butter\"\n\nIn my suffering I finally stammer out \"Take me to the ER\" and his face Immediately changed\n \nI go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I've got some pretty severe burns.\n\nFlash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I'm still in constant pain. I can't taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.\n\nFML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you'll end up like me.\n\n\nTL;DR: Got dared to drink melted peanut butter. Slammed it down to avoid Taste. Hot peanut butter is Basically Napalm and Hot PB + Mouth = Second Degree Burns.",

Thermal conductivity in terms of BTU/(feet - hour - degrees F) is 1.82 for glass, 0.09 for paper, 0.06 for Styrofoam. The conductivity of plastics varies depending on the materials: for polypropylene and polycarbonate, the thermal conductivity values are 0.69 and 0.35, respectively.\n\nHot Drinks and Insulation\nPaper, glass, plastic and Styrofoam are common materials used in containers holding hot beverages. Considering containers of the same size, a glass container is the least effective for keeping a cup of coffee warm. Though not commonly used in the United States, using elegant glass cups for serving coffee or other hot drinks is common in Austria, Spain and India.\n```",

I'm winning towards the end of the game but she gets a touchdown to put the game within 2. She does an onside kick and recovers it with literally two seconds left at the end of the play; I'm starting to sweat that she somehow pulls off some miraculous Hail Mary and wins. She ends up selecting a field goal and I'm feeling relieved; the wind is against her and it's a 60+ yard field goal (for non football people, the record is 64 yards). She nails it perfectly and wins.\n\nI jump off the couch and am yell: \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU JOKING? THIS IS BULLSH\\*T! I'M GOING TO F\\*CKING KILL YOU!\" She's cracking up laughing and I start tickling her. She runs into the bedroom and I yell something like \"YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME! I'M GOING TO GET YOU!\" I tickle her maybe 1-2 minutes more on our bed as she's cracking up/crying/yelling stop, but totally OK and within our normal boundaries of fun. We stop and she tells me she needs to get ready and starts heading into the bathroom to put on makeup.\n\nBy this point, maybe 5-10 minutes later, I've changed clothes, and am watching some TV when I hear a very loud, confident, series of knocks on the door. I open up, and SURPRISE, it's two police officers: one man and one woman.\n\nMale cop: \"Good evening. Do you know why we are here?\"\n\nMe: \"I think so, and you're never going to believe me, but I can explain.\"\n\nFemale cop: \"Is there a woman in this apartment, may I speak with her?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I am sure my wife will be willing to speak with you, she's in the restroom around the corner getting ready for dinner.\"\n\nMale cop: \"what do you think we are here for?\"\n\nMe: \"I think one of my neighbors probably heard me yell at my wife and chase her into the next room as she screamed. In reality, it was a tickle fight after she beat me in a video game.\"\n\nMale cop: \"A tickle fight. Uh-huh. And what did you yell at her?\"\n\nMe: \"I said I was going to kill her, but it was really a joke, I promise, really, all I did after that was tickle her for a minute or two.\"\n\nMale cop: \"Where did you plan on going to dinner?\"\n\n(Feeling trashy saying this as someone who is suspected of spousal abuse) Me: \"Hooters. We are meeting friends at Hooters for wing night.\"\n\nMale cop: \"May I take a look around?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nHe searches around, finds a broken vase in our recycle bin and asks about it. About 3-4 minutes later in what felt like an eternity, the female cop comes out and says: \"what did you hear?\"\n\nMale cop: \"Tickle fight.\"\n\nFemale cop: \"Tickle fight.\" She belts out one or two chuckles.\n\nMe (weight of the world off my shoulders)\n\nMale cop: \"alright, well, thanks for letting us come in and investigate, you know it's just our jobs and we have to take this kind of thing seriously...\"\n\nMe: \"yes, yes, I totally understand and am not mad; just have to repair a relationship with our neighbors who think I beat my wife now...\"\n\nAfter they left, my wife told me the cop she spoke with was begging her to admit it that I was hurting her and she was covering her bruises with makeup, more like \"hey, you're safe now, we got him, you can tell me the truth.\" I get why they do this, but thank God my wife was insistent and confident in her speech that I was not in fact beating her.\n\nWe hadn't met our downstairs neighbors yet at that point, just a friendly wave out the door on the way to work each morning, but met them a few weeks later at a pool party the complex had. After some small talk, I just broke the ice and said: \"hey, just so you know, I think you guys must have called the police on me a few weeks back. I appreciate you called the police - I can understand how from your apartment, you just heard me yell 'I'm going to kill you!' followed by two people running followed by screaming. Just so you know, it was a tickle fight and nothing else. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Ultimately, you guys did the right thing.\" I got the feeling they were a little skittish, but overall grateful that I told them that. We remained on friendly terms but lost touch after we moved out of that complex.\n\nTLDR: Wife pulls off an unbelievable video game upset on me; I yell at her and a tickle fight ensues, COPs come and I have to convince them tickle fight =/= real fight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits:\n\n1. I am off to bed now but will try responding more tomorrow.\n2. Yes, I know the title of the story raises eyebrows and makes people interested to read more. That's the point of a good title in my opinion and I've seen this technique used many times on this subreddit. \n3. Thanks for all the love - before this, I think I had gotten 2 awards ever. \n4. I am pretty thrilled with reddit right now - definitely thought there would be a lot more trolls than there were. \n5. Thanks for all the advice on dealing with police. In my opinion, there are times where I think it's time to be a little bit more argumentative with them and times when it's probably in everyone's best interest to cooperate and defuse the situation. I think I smartly chose the latter in this case. FWIW, this occurred in a major urban area in the U.S. and I think it demonstrates that cops, as a whole, are generally pretty professional and genuinely just interested in making their communities safer. Without wading into politics, yes, I recognize that police reform is required in the U.S. and support many of those efforts too. ",

Absolutely.\n\nGF was wearing shorts, no makeup, hair in a bun, and clearly was just watching TV while ironing. All in all, it took 5 minutes. In hindsight, I believe they believed me almost immediately, because me and the GF were not questioned separately, nor kept in different rooms to prevent us from 'getting our stories straight'. Still, I hope they figured out which couple was fighting in the building.",

One of the girls was batshit crazy. Literally needed mental help. My poor bf had moved in to the house and was only there for about 2 months when this incident happened. He's a very laid back, albiet, clueless guy most of the time.\n\nThe crazy roommate just had insane mood swings. She also had no sense of personal space. There HAS been instances of her knocking on my bf's bedroom door because she needed to talk to someone (this was like 3 weeks after moving in). All her talks were just her crying over her ex bf and how he made her get an abortion, etc etc. If he didn't open his room door, she would sit outside of his door for a while and loudly cry. Then she'd start singing a happy song about horses. She def needed help. Mental issues aside, she was also very self absorbed. It was always about her and her needs.\n\nAnyway. Crazy roommate and other girl (she was almost the complete opposite of crazy roommate. Super chill, down to earth, clean and super respectful of boundaries) did NOT get along. They had a loud argument one night and the cops got called. \n\nBf said he heard some of the argument, \"I am SO TIRED of your crazy shit, crazy roommate!! You are f***ing batshit crazy!\"\n\nBf heard loud banging on front door downstairs and yelling \"POLICE, OPEN UP!\" He went downstairs to open the door since both girls were occupied with each other upstairs.\n\nBf has this surprised blank look on his face. \"Uhh hi. Can I help you?\"\n\nCops: do you know why we are here sir?\n\nBf: uhh not really.\n\nCops: we got complaints from the neighbors of a domestic dispute at this residence. Is there a female in the house?\n\nBf: oh. Uhhh ok. Yes. I live with 2 girls.\n\nHe let the cops in and they asked him what he was doing and he said \"i was trying to sleep...\" they didn't believe him until they went upstairs and interviewed the two girls and his sane housemate said \"no, he wasn't involved. It was just me and the other girl. The neighbors might've confused my deep voice with that of a man's.\" Sane roommates voice is def not a typical girl's voice. Its a little deeper (kind of like Miley Cyrus).\n\nWe think back and laugh at all the craziness he had to deal with for those 2 months... the crazy roommate eventually got forced out by the landlord. Her mother picked her up. Not sure if she got counseling. Hope she did. But it was def peaceful after she left.",

The problem was that the SEVEN cops responding to the call did not see the cat run out and I did not register the fact that all of the people around my door were cops. All they saw was me running out at full speed the second the door was fully opened yelling \"Stop motherfucker! Stop!\" One of the poor cops coming up the stairs last managed to just catch sight of the cat before I turned the corner and stopped to look back which caused me to run right into him and almost send us both crashing down the stairs. By the time I got the cat and got back upstairs my boyfriend was cuffed and the cops were trying to get him to admit to beating me. I felt bad after but the situation had me laughing so hard at time that I could hardly explain what had just happened. That damn cat almost got us both shot.

My partner, who was a foot taller than me, was topless and sat on top of me pinning me with his arms as I squealed and giggled.

            "My grandparents were avid birdwatchers and they would drive their Winnebago to Arizona from the upper Midwest in the spring and then spend a couple months driving back and getting to see all sorts of migratory birds. \n\nThey were also fiercely competitive double solitaire players. That\u2019s where you each have your own deck of cards and set up a solitaire game, but you instead of just having your own 4 Aces to stack on, you can also stack on the other person\u2019s. So you sit across the table from each other with the 8 possible stacks in between you. Towards the end of the game, it can get really intense as you race to try and get rid of your cards before the other person. Lots of slapping/pounding the table sounds. \n\nSo my grandmas and grandpa got to the campground and found it was a little more crowded than they usually liked. They generally tried to get a campsite that was kind of secluded but they ended up with neighbors on both sides and the sites were pretty close together. They got settled in, had supper, and were relaxing with their nightly card game and a martini. The weather was nice so they had all the windows of the camper open. Now my grandpa was a kind wonderful man who was 6\u2019 1\u201d with a deep imposing voice. My grandma was a 5\u2019 4\u201d lady. They start their card game and it\u2019s particularly fierce. Cards are flying and there are thuds of hands furiously stacking cards on top of cards. It\u2019s down to the wire and my grandma just sneaks her last card onto the pile as my grandpa\u2019s hand comes down with his last card. She wins! They always play at least best 2 out of 3 games so grandpa still has a chance to be the victor of the evening. And so he bellows \u201cWOMAN! I WILL BEAT YOU!\u201d and pounds his fist on the table. And she begins to laugh so hard she sounds like she is crying. And then they realize what has just occurred and how it must sound to their campsite neighbors who are 10 feet away. Grandpa said they got up at the crack of dawn to pack up and get out of there as fast as possible so they wouldn\u2019t have to see anyone. Grandma said she actually was a little disappointed that no one did call the police on them. \n\nAlso when I was 3 years old, my mom, brother, and that same grandpa went on a little weekend Winnebago adventure. One morning before we were going to go to a restaurant for breakfast I had been outside and was going to go back into the camper. My mom told me to wipe my feet and I was being a brat so I wiped them in a very exaggerated way. My mom was bending down to tie her shoe at the same time and I accidentally kicked her square in the temple with my heavy orthopedic toddler shoes. Immediate black eye. I cried because I felt guilty. So the restaurant patrons saw a imposing 70 year old man, two small children (one with the red eyes and snotty nose of a child who has been sobbing), and a tiny mid-30s woman with a fresh black eye walk in. Poor grandpa said if looks could kill he would have been a dead man.",
            "This reminds me of when I heard the neighbor yell \u201cWhat the FUCK do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d late at night while I was watching a movie. It seemed so angry and aggressive, I waited a moment and then it followed with \u201cBAD DOG\u201d. That was it. Phew",

They're there for domestic violence, but if they see weed, a gun, an unpaid parking ticket, anything remotely suspicious you're going to jail. They can talk to your wife outside. Never give the police more information or more access than they are legally allowed.

            "Around this time last year my wife got home from work on one of my days off, and found me in the next room playing a video game. I had just bought it and was explaining the concept of the game and what you do. I know she doesnt really care but she indulges me by listening and watching for a bit. Somehow, during this ted talk I was giving her on the game, her phone in her pocket started a recording. Her phone recorded about 15 seconds of audio, which was mostly quiet, muffled noise. The one thing that you could make out pretty clearly was me saying \"beat your ass\" in reference to me describing a boss I was preparing for.\n\nSo then someone while she was walking around the house, the audio clip was sent out to maybe 6 of her coworkers in a group message they have together. Twenty minutes later a pair of cops show up at the house and want to me and my wife separately. We had to spend the next hour trying to convince these two guys that I wasnt beating the shit out of my wife. And I looked like an unemployed loser the whole time because I was in pajamas. We couldnt even hesr the recording, so we couldnt even explain what happened. My wife was in tears trying to convince these guys that I dont hit her. \n\nI get it, I understand why they do it, but we have never felt more sick to our stomachs than that afternoon trying to convince cops and coworkers that I dont abuse my wife at home. Still not sure if some of her coworkers believe us.",
            "> After they left, my wife told me the cop she spoke with was begging her to admit it that I was hurting her and she was covering her bruises with makeup, more like \"hey, you're safe now, we got him, you can tell me the truth.\"\n\nYeah fuck that shit.  Cop pulls me and my wife over one night on our way home, literally a half block away from our house because my \"taglight was out,\" (real reason: I had the audacity to be driving a black sports coupe with mildly tinted windows in my neighborhood after midnight).  Cop pulls me out of the car while his buddy goes around and starts asking her all the same questions: \"Is there anything you need to tell us?  Are you sure?  Is there anything happening at home?\"  Pissed my wife off more than me that they would automatically make those assumptions.",

Also, throwaway because I don\u2019t want my grandkids to find this one day. \n\nMy longtime girlfriend had just completed her time of the month, and we were ready to engage in some heated sexual activity. We\u2019re both going through rather busy times in our life right now, so sex doesn\u2019t come as often as it should, but enough to fulfill our needs. Now, the past few weeks I\u2019ve been helping (doing) my GF do homework for one of her online classes. Because of this, she realized she owed me and decided to pay me by way of sexual favors. Unethical? Maybe, but I\u2019m not complaining. So, she begins to initiate foreplay and start to enjoy one of the better blow jobs of my life. She does her thing for a while and I stop her a few times before I hit her with that high fructose porn syrup. After edging a few times, I decide to return the favor and go down on here. I do my thing, she does hers, and now back to me. Well, by this time we\u2019re about an hour in and she starts to get tired. I finally comply with her and prepare to unleash my homemade protein shake. However, because I have delayed the inevitable for so long, she is taking breaks every few licks of the tootsie pop. The next four events happen all simultaneously. I let my lover know its time, she comes up for a breather, my Johnson flops down on my stomach (I\u2019m on my back), and I treat myself to a very salty penis colada. It. Was. Everywhere. A catastrophic and life-changing event. I, and nor should you, ever take those cum shot compilations for granted. Those girls are troopers. \n\nTL;DR \u2013 I was edging during oral with my girlfriend. She got tired and took a break. I climaxed all over my face. \n\nEdit: Man y'all are wild.

        "selftext": "\nThe following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.\n\nMe and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.\n\nBecause we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. \n\nWe went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.\n\nI awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.\n\nThe worst part was that I couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.\n\nA painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.\n\nSitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. \n\nFor all you sickos:\n\nDimensions: Difficult to say. Closer to Randy's first record attempt than I would be comfortable disclosing.\n\nCourics: I don't know, I forgot to contact the European Fecal Standards team for verification. I would say more than one, less than four.\n\nColor: Dark. I drink a lot of coffee.\n\nTexture: Like a sock filled with broken marbles. \n\nTL;DR Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. AMA\n\nEdit: I'm sorry Reddit, I didn't take a photo. I wish I did. I wish I could go back in time and fix this...wait, no I don't. I don't want this to turn into a Reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no I will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. Sorry. I also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.\n\nFor all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. My girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. Thank you all for the advice. She and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. How nice...",

So I took one anally and waited 15 minutes.. nothing happened.. a bit of liquid came out but nothing else. So I popped another.\n\nI never want to hear my guts rumble in the way they rumbled then because the next thing I knew, I felt the most encompassing urge to just SHIT, I mean.. it was primal, it was compelling, it was overwhelming.

            "When I was 18 my girlfriend at the time was finally ready to have sex. I, as one might expect of a 18 year old, was excited. Neither hell nor high water was going to stand between me and my final destination.\n\nI get ready for the night, trim everything up, shower extra well. Unfortunately there was also an issue. I have a digestional disorder that sometimes cause my shit to become large and quite solid while still inside me. I wasn't aware it was a treatable problem and, in fact, just thought everyone had to deal with the equivalent of anal kidney stones. I bring this up because I had a mighty one which had been loaded into the gun for several days.\n\nLet me set the scene. Her parents are away. We have her house to ourselves. She was always a little kinky so she demands we do it in her parents bed.\n\nI walk in to a candle holocaust. She's been working on this all day apparently, and its as bright as high noon in there with the lights off. Which is good, because she proceeds to do a sweet, sexy little dance for me. At 18, she was AMAZING. For those of you who never experienced a female at that age, I pity the fool.\n\nNow I'm sitting on the bed, watching this dance. I smile and tell her how good she looks. Unfortunately, most of my attention is focused on the dull throbbing from my sphincter and the large amount of intestinal discomfort associated with not dropping duce in days. But somehow I still get hard and we go to town.  She starts out on top, then we switch. I bend her over the bed, and I even smack her ass (a ballsy move at the time, but she loved it). Due to my built up distraction, I last for what seems like FOREVER. She can't stop moaning and telling me how good it feels, and then she says what every man wants to hear \"I want to make you go in my mouth.\" I **** love women.\n\nSo she goes down on me. She was always average at best in the head department but at least she tried. She pops my **** out of her mouth long enough to look up at me and say \"tell me if you like this\". Then I feel it.\n\nShe stuck her finger up my ass.\n\nMy brain hits the panic switch and every muscle in my entire body locks up tighter than a three year old virgin. But its too late.\n\nI take a massive, PAINFUL, PAINFUL shit, all over her parents comforter.\n\nNo, you aren't understanding. I mean large. Huge. IMMENSE. Take your largest shit and multiple it by forty-two and you'll have an idea of what flew out of me.\n\nAnd gents, when I say flew, I don't mean \"I pooped.\" I mean \"projectile\". I mean \"hurricane force winds hitting an umbrella stand\". And due to my condition, it comes out as a large, dark brown, smelly harpoon.\n\nI know it hit her. I didn't see it. She ran screaming \"OH MY GOD OHMYGODOHMYGODEEEEEWWWWWWWW\" but I always imagined that, due to her position, it hit her right in the chin. Or at least the tits.\n\nI would like to say I got up to go after her. But I heard the bathroom door shut and I just lied there. The smell hit me after a few seconds. It smelled like someone rolled a cat in shit and threw it into a tire fire. I looked down and saw, to date, the largest bowel movement I've ever heard of laying on the bed. Then I noticed the blood, and when I did, I noticed the pain.\n\nApparently the fact that it was so large caused it to rip my ass a little bit (thought I was bleeding from the inside. This little doctors trip the next day is what taught me of my condition). There was a small pool of blood where my ass had been. A final reminder of the exact place and moment I lost my virginity. I will treasure this memory for all my days.\n\nI grab my shit with my hands and go to the downstairs bathroom. I throw around 1/3 into the toilet and flush, fearing any more will clog it and only add to my already significant woes.\n\nI stand there, holding 2/3's of my biggest shit of all time, feeling a trickle of blood flow down my leg, trying to ignore the sharp pain stabbing my rectum. I find myself wishing I had a photo of this.\n\nAnyway, I finish flushing my baby, clean off my hands, jam toilet paper between my cheeks (I skipped the bandaid) and went upstairs. I could hear my girlfriend sobbing from behind the bathroom door. I decided not to say anything to her and just keep moving. The smell in her parents room was abysmal. Its like when you take a shit and walk out of the bathroom you think \"hey not so bad today,\" but then you walk back in to grab your magazine and go \"HOLY SHIT!\". It was one of those moments.  The scene is burned behind my eyelids for all time. My life. My shame. My very first time smelled like a pile of dead babies. I quickly got dressed since the heat from ten thousand candles was making the room feel more like a port-a-potty. I was aware enough to grab the comforter on my way out and drag it downstairs to their washer. Also the top and bottom sheets since the blood had leaked on through all the way to mattress. Still no sign of the GF but at this point I considered it a blessing.\n\nI jammed in the washer with 3 loads worth of detergent and set it on spin, knowing that not even the hand of God would save these linens, let alone Tide and Snuggles.\n\nThen I left. I avoided my GF's calls for days until she came to my house. We had a long talk about what happened. Talk being synonymous with \"breaking up with me because I shit on her\". And it was all over. She promised not to tell a soul and I don't THINK she ever did. She was probably as ashamed as I was about the whole deed. But I will always this happening as the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me.",

I think what happened here is that your body had trouble adjusting to a diet with higher fiber content than its used to, and you didn't drink nearly enough water to ease the process.\n  \nSo, if you're open to some advice, drink about 3 liters of water a day (6 500ml water bottles, or 8 full drinking glasses) and take in more *soluble* fiber with your diet, because that's the kind that keeps things moving while insoluble fiber makes your poops bigger.

            "I'm truly sorry. As someone who has been suffering from the effects and after effects of an anal fissure for over a year, I can tell you that this will likely be the worst period of your entire life. You literally just ruined it.\n\nIt's not the horrible itching and burning that gets you in the long run - it's the intense muscle spasms which result from your anal tissue being exposed to air. I'm talking curled up in a ball on the floor sobbing from the purest agony that you've ever felt, like someone is wearing brass knuckles and just punching you square in the asshole. If you're lucky, the spasms will subside as the fissures heal, (and I'm assuming the doctor prescribed you a particular cream to use to help in that regard) but if you're like me, you may end up developing something like a muscle memory, where the spasms continue even as the fissures heal. In that case you'll probably be needing surgery. Lateral internal sphincterotomy is the name of that procedure, and even that may not fix the problem completely. \n\nI ended up needing over a month to get back to work after the procedure. The recovery was awful and painful in its own way, and the spasms persisted even after the incision and the fissures had fully healed. I tried nerve blockers and steroid shot procedures which were not particularly effective. Pain killers, muscle relaxers, none of it seemed to make a difference. I ultimately went to physical therapy, where through pelvic floor exercises and anal massages using medically prescribed dildos, my condition began to improve. Even to this day though, I'll still get a small spasm here and there, and I've experienced more minor fissures every couple of months. My physical therapist said some people live with the condition their entire lives.\n\nSo yeah, that's what you could be looking forward to, OP.

I'm really close to the store and im like FUCK I cannot make it home so i plan in my head how I'll get in the store and run to the bathroom, however, the bathroom is all the way at the back of store and its a pretty big store, at this point my brown baby is crowning and im in tears because i know as soon as I stand up I will loose it all, literally and i don't wanna shit myself in my car - god that would never smell right again!\n\nAnyways, at this point I am sweating, crying, panting, doing the fucking labor breathing exercises knowing its about to happen and im speeding through the parking lot planning to just pull behind the store and go in some bushes but low and behold all of the delivery trucks are there delivering their bread and god knows what else, now im really panicking and figuring at this point I don't care if someone sees me because all I can think is getting this creature out of my body.  I fly past the trucks and to the side of the store, this area was pretty desolate, at least i hope, I jump out of the car, rip my pants down, and squat over the grated storm drain and I kid you not, instantly I let loose and had the biggest hugest shit in all of my 39 years. At this point I didn't care if anyone did see because I was feeling so relieved. \n\nI finish in like 20 seconds and go to stand up but realize I have no tissue or wet wipes so I have to pull my pants up and drive home sitting sideways so my poopy pants don't touch my seat.

Just before we arrived my belly started rumbling.  Really rumbling and making some audible noises.  I knew it was going to be bad.  We finally make it to the parking area of the lake.  The semi-rustic bathrooms there were locked because of COVID.  So I am beginning to panic a little.  We drive around a little bit to see if there is an out of the way place for me squat.  We end up seeing some very rustic and dilapidated wooden outhouse type structures.  At this point I am thinking I may just have to make it work.  I run up there clenching my butt as hard as possible.  I open the door and there are needles all over the floor, broken whiskey and beer bottles.  And it is the most foul smelling place I have ever experienced.  So that is out.  By this time, my stomach has actually readied itself because of seeing a bathroom of sorts.  Sort of like driving home needing to poop really badly and when you turn the corner, see your house and it kicks into overdrive?  All I can do is run behind the outhouse and squat down.  I keep wet wipes in my purse thank goodness.  So I shit in the woods like a bear and leave a massive pile behind the outhouse.  \n\nI feel SO MUCH better walking back to the car.  It\u2019s just intense relief.  All is good.  My son took a picture of me walking back to the car holding my wet wipes.  We had a good laugh.  Texted my husband and told him the story.  End of story.  \n\nTwo days later I started having intense itching on my lower buttocks.  Then it travels down my thighs.  Then it pops up on my calves and ankles.  I freaking got chiggers on my butt and legs by shitting in the woods.  The chiggers lasted for over a week.  It was miserable.

We live in a single entrance apartment on the second floor. So you open the door and there's stairs immediately to get up. Here is my advice. Never run up the stairs when you have to shit that bad. The up and down continuous motion shook the shit up like a dirty martini in my asshole and I lost all control of the clench of my asshole. I felt it come out when I was half way up the stairs accompanied by a large shart sound. Like a tuba. I walked slowly to the bathroom the rest of the way feeling the weight of the shit in my pants, trying to hold it up so it didn't fall down my legs. When I finally made it to the bathroom and took down my pants it just all fell out over the floor. Ruined a bathrug completely. Pants were beyond saving but my pride was definitely worse. I am a grown man and I shit myself... Hard. I'll unofrtunately never be able to forget it. Didn't even hide it from my girlfriend and she's still with me so I guess that's what love is.",

We were in the Mojave desert doing a month long training exercise. One fine sunny afternoon our convoy stopped, and I really really had to poo. There were no restrooms in the middle of the desert so I grabbed my E tool (a mini shovel used for more than just diggin) and sprint to a \"private\" type area and dig a hole. I don't poop outside a whole bunch so the whole squatting to shit concept freaks me out bc I feel like I'll just shit on myself. So I'm in a crab walk style position shitting in this hole I dug when out of fucking nowhere comes a very very very low flying attack chopper. It was so close to the ground I could see the look on the pilots face as her and I made eye contact as I'm shitting in this hole with my whole junk just up in the air for her to see.

En route to drop off some guys food, and right as I get out of the car to walk to his door I can feel something brewing quickly in my stomach. I clinch my cheeks, handoff his food, and waddle back to the car.  I am about 10 minutes away from home or any bathroom, and as I'm driving through the neighborhood to leave I can I have about 20 seconds to make a decision: shit in my pants in the car, or get out and squat somewhere. I chose the latter.  I pulled into the closest parking lot just to get out of the road, parked in front of a building, squated against the car, and relieved myself.  It wasn't until after I was done that I had realized I had pulled into a church parking lot, and the building I was in front of was the entry steps to the church doors.

Of course the bathrooms at the welcome center weren't open at this hour, and it was leaking out of my butt by now. So I found an area where there weren't many trucks and let loose. My fiance had to back up a few times so the smell wouldn't leak into the car. Once I was done I whipped and he drove off. He drove straight into my pile of doom.

So I go skiing and I always throw snacks in the car for the way back.  I just raid the kitchen and throw whatever I find in the car for the 3 hour drive home after a heavy day of working hard.   So I'm coming home and munching down dried apricot after dried apricot, I must have had half of a bag of these things.   Once it hits me it goes from \"I should find a bathroom\" to \"code brown\" in about 5 minutes.\n\nI'm screaming \"no\" while punching the ceiling in defiance of my bowels opening up on the car seat.   I take the nearest exit and there's nothing.  Just a residential waste land.  I'm googling gas stations, restaraunts,  anything I can see on google maps.   Then it dawns on me, I'm right next to a state park.   Basically the right side of the road, across from houses is all residential.  Since it's winter time it's already pitch black at like 6pm.   So I pull the car over in front of a chained off state park entrance bust out of the car onto some sort of a grassy slope and take go to town on whatever surface that I can't even see.  I sort of waddled down the hill while going just because I had some fear of leaving a concentrated area (or maybe I was afraid of falling in it, I can't remember).

My mom had a friend in the area, so i figured I\u2019d stop by to see if she was there. But when I arrived at the house, I didn\u2019t see her minivan, and I guess I was too shy to knock on the door and ask to shit at my mom\u2019s friend\u2019s house.

I don't know how I knew, but he was in the same condition; I sped up and passed him back (as it was a one holer), and we raced all the way to the service station.  I got there first, ran into the bathroom and dropped my load flushing about 10 times.  The guy outside started beating on the door after the 3rd flush hollering to get in.  I finally came out, and while his car was still parked my mine, he must have had to run off into the woods.  Now, you got to go when you have to go!  I stopped on a Turnpike in New Jersey once, and ran up into the woods for the same reasons.",
            "This was me a few months ago. Side of the road with a clunker car that doesn\u2019t tell me when my car is about to run out of gas. Stranded on side of highway was where my brown crusade came. Thankfully I had napkins but it was super weird to have to do it over the railing into a forest drop off. That was the last straw before getting a new car.",

            "Years ago when my oldest was a toddler she would race me to the bathroom whenever I needed to go and try to use it first.  Each of the three bathrooms had a small step stool in front of the sink and another at the foot of the toilet.\n\nThis one day I was dealing a stomach bug that was passing through our family, I was the last to get it.  Myself and the toddler were into the house from the garage when I felt the gurgle and twist and i. My gut gut and lunged towards the tiny half bath.  My little one darted between legs and I tripped on her and the step stools smacked my face into the wall and let watery stool flow all over the bathroom and my toddler.  \n\nShe was fine and excited that daddy had pooped on the floor.  For years she would tell people about how daddy had diarrhea all over the floor.  She recently wrote about it for a writing assignment.",
            "I\u2019ve had some close calls over the years, but two days ago was one of the closest.\n\nMy daughters and I had a surf lesson scheduled and I woke up late. Drank some coffee to wake up and was able to go a little before the 45 min drive.\n\nBut then, we got stuck in traffic about 15 mins away and the cramps began. I was in the middle of a semi panic attack when I saw a gas station.\n\nI whipped into the parking lot and as I was walking towards the building my daughter got out and said she had to go too.\n\nWe walked into the gas station and asked where the restroom was and the clerk said it was out of order, but we should try the fast food restaurant down the road if we really needed one.\n\nThe restaurant was like 100 yards away and I was speed walking with my ass cheeks clenched  the whole way. \n\nWe got to the restaurant and the door was locked. I knocked and a guy came to the door and said  they\u2019re not open. I said \u201cplease, my daughter really needs to use your bathroom\u201d, which was code for \u201chelp...\u201d The guy went in the back (I guess asking a manager or hiding from what was inevitably about to\nHappen ) and I didn\u2019t see him again. \n\nThen I spotted a cafe, so my daughter and I headed that way. I asked where the bathroom was and they pointed us down the hall. I went into the men\u2019s room and there was  one stall out of order and one occupied.\n\nAt this point I was starting to feel like the universe wanted me to shit my pants. \n\nBut I said \u201cnot today universe\u201d and instead of shitting myself I went into the women\u2019s restroom with my daughter in one stall and me in the other. \n\nShe was cool, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll talk to her therapist about it one day.",
            "I once was shopping at Marshall's and felt it come on quick.  It was painful so I asked for the bathroom but it was downstairs in the food court.  I ran down there.  The food court was closed so no one was down there.  First, the bathroom door wont open.  It turns out it was motion sensored and I finally moved to the right place.  Then, I run to the stall and that fucking thing is also sensored and it takes a minute.  I then shit so much I fill the damn toilet and more is to come.  It is also sensored and I cannot find a button.  I have to stand up like I am leaving the toilet with my pants at my ankles to get the damn thing to flush.  I sit down, finish up, wipe.  I get to the sink and they are also sensored.  Damn thing only lasts like 3 seconds and you have to remove your hand and move it back.  I go to leave and the damn sensored door wont open.  \n\n\nMost frustrating shit ever.  Will not go back to that store or shopping mall.",

I don't remember what I ate that morning, but as I'm making my walk to work that day, I let go what I thought would be a completely harmless fart. It was a hot summer day, so I explained the way the greasy feeling between my cheeks as just a little bit of butt sweat. Only the feeling got worse. I finally got the nerve to reach back and feel the back of my shorts, and unfortunately, I was immediately able to feel a pliable clay like substance under my shorts. Cue the full-blown panic, as I contemplate how I am going to get into my workplace without leaking anything down the back of my shorts. But even if I made it in I would still have to go into our locker rooms to change into my uniform, probably sans underwear, and also get rid of said underwear without anyone noticing. I ducked away into a nearby alleyway and used a spare undershirt that I had in my backpack to reach into the back of my shorts and clean up some of the mess I had left behind. Disgustingly, I got some on my hands in the process, and realized there was no way my charade would last to get into work. With shame in my eyes I turned back to return to my car and started formulating a plan B. The closest Target was about 20 minutes away. I called my job and told him I was having car troubles, but I would be in as soon as possible. Made my way to Target, and purchased brand new underwear, shorts, and a package of clean whites. Also some new undershirts. As soon as my purchase was made, I proceeded directly to the nearest restroom and promptly change into my newly purchased attire. The shorts were salvageable, so I folded them up and tied them up into a plastic bag, I had already disposed of the soiled undershirt in the alley. The damaged underwear suffered the same fate in the Target restroom.\n\nThis is the first, and maybe the only time I ever share this story.",

        "selftext": "I live near a smaller airport and I help out at the local Turkish community center.  I\u2019m white but I go to a free dinner they do every other Thursday and it is amazing, so I chose to volunteer every once in a while.   Set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. I\u2019ve met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.\n\nSo last week, I was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from Turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. I was told she knew little to no English and I wasn\u2019t the first choice to go get her, I was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. \n\nThey give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. Whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, I set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.\n\nI pull up to the international gate and immediately an Eastern European woman standing all alone. I get out with my sign that says \u2018Demir\u2019 and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. Last name? Check. Eastern European? Check. Not much English? Check. can\u2019t believe my luck!!\n\nI pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the Turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  About 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. She calls someone and frantically speaks in Turkish. I\u2019m thinking she left something on the plane or at home. I felt bad but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it at the time, I was driving in the freeway.\n\n10 minutes later, I\u2019m off the freeway and a cop passes. He immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and I pull over. At this point I\u2019m freaking out and when I turn around, I see the lady has Uber out and upon further inspection, I\u2019m not the Uber driver.....\n\nThe cop tells me to get out and I am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. My head hurts from the slam against the ground and I\u2019m fully aware of the kidnapping situation I\u2019m in. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in Turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  I ask him to use my phone to contact the Turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. \n\nLittle did I know \u2018Demir\u2019 is one of the most common surnames in all of Turkey. So when the lady(her first trip to america) see that I have her name, she figures I\u2019m the Uber driver ready to pick her up. She knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. My heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real \u2018Demir\u2019 pulls up. \n\nAfter a discussion that I\u2019m not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. I am in disbelief as of to what just happened and I definitely sweated through my entire outfit. We get back to the Turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. Everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. I got drunk drunk. \n\nTL;DR by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. First names count, people!!!\n\nEdit: detained, not arrested. Also, talking with Turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. Eastern is too white, middle is bad in America, so most of them just say they are from Turkey.",

Good news; I'm better now and I laugh about it. I was better back then too.\n\nAlso worth mentioning I'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.\n\nSo back to the fuck-up, a short story I was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. I bet you can see where this is going.. So I start drafting the letter and before I finish it with the dating and stuff I get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so I get out saying very little to my mom.\n\nAfter leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *Shocker* I left my phone at home. (It's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare I take it with me unless I'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees \"my\" suicide note.\n\nShe gets scared and calls my dad. Soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. I walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. After a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but I felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.\n\n\nTL;DR: Me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking I killed myself, I show up eating ice cream and get scolded. Generally felt terrible\n\n\nEdit: wow a lot of you want to read the horrible piece of fiction I wrote back then, I can't find the original story but I'll try to rewrite from memory in the morning!\n\nEdit2: ah yes the good old severe suicide ",

She tried to wake me up but she knew I worked late the night before so she just borrowed it. While using it she finds a few of the notes and I later wake up to a really intense semi-intervention.\n\nI couldn't convince them that they weren't suicide notes but notes where I was saying goodbye due to thinking I was dying (haha). I just didn't want people to wonder what happened if I did and I wanted to give a goodbye/love ya to everyone.\n\nThat was an odd time and years later (a couple months ago) I'd finally seek help for my issues.

I have stolen the real candy and intend to eat it as soon as I can. - R.A.B.* \n\nMy nephews get a kick out of it and everyone around laughs and the egg gets left at my parents house, where for the next four years it just kind of floats from place to place. \n\nSo one saturday afternoon my wife and I are shacked up in bed doing the nasty, phones turned off for the occasion... the whole nine, and my door fucking flies open so hard the knob almost embeds in the wall behind it. I turn to see my dad with a horrified look on his face holding a tiny little scrap of paper. The scrap of paper was so small and his vision isn't the greatest so all he really made out was, \"I know I will be dead long before you read this...\" and, \"R.A.B.,\" before he sprung into action and tried calling me. He couldn't through to me so he tried calling my wife. He couldn't get through to her either because we each run businesses and get like a hundred calls a day so we turn our phones to silent when we fuck.\n\nAnd that was how my dad walked in on me getting rimmed...

The only person she was having difficulty with was her sister who stole her boyfriends in high school (and would sleep with them when my roommate wouldn\u2019t). She was jealous that I was getting asked out and she wasn\u2019t.

I did not blow her off. I did not look at it as a cry for attention. I gave it the attention that any note like that deserves.  I immediately contacted the RA for help.

            "While my user handle still says UIUCsenior, I graduated a while back. But during college had my own experience of going through depression.\n\nOne thing, I always feel extremely lucky about to have an amazing friend for a roommate through that period. At the worst of it all, nothing seemed to be going right for me and I just kept sinking into that dark bottomless pit. I went from being someone who couldn't tolerate passive smoking to being a heavy chain smoker(multiple packs a day). I just didn't want to get out of bed for anything. The state of my room was miserable, me almost living in my bed, only getting up to shower, delivery boxes littered throughout the room and empty packs of cigarettes spread across my bed. My grades dropped from a high of 3.6 to 2.6 within a semester. I remember wanting to sleep as much as possible to just fly by through each day.\n\nMy roommate was a gem of a person though, not only did he recognize I was depressed but made me realize that fact as well while I was in denial. He would literally drag me out of bed every day for every meal and insisted we go out to eat or cook something but no more deliveries. Made sure that if I am drinking it's only if we are going out, never to get dependent on that to numb the sadness. Also, made sure that we went out every weekend to meet people. Him and I were in the same major so would register the same classes on the same schedule and drag me to lectures with him and made sure that I did my assignments while he was doing his. Even sit down and talk to me at great lengths and making me realize each aspect of my life that was causing my depression and helped me out of it. While I was never suicidal, I was on a pretty self destructive path and he helped me get back on track. At a point when I had stopped talking to anyone I remember we would sit down and talk for hours at end.\n\nA true friend in my opinion, experience and belief is way more helpful than any psychiatrist or psychologist.

        "selftext": "I (M, 33) live in Quebec, Canada. Here the official language is French, but almost everyone speaks English too.\n\nThe other day I was shoveling snow on my driveway and my neighbor (F ~35) was there too, removing snow from her car.\n\nWe share a driveway and we are very friendly. We always help each other and exchange gifts. I really love having them as neighbors.\n\nTheir family configuration is: mother, two daughters, one son and a father. But dad and mom are divorced. So on this day I finally met the father.\n\nSo he approached me talking in French, and I kinda can speak French, so I tried to maintain the conversation in French to be respectful. He said \"my daughters said you are a very good neighbor (mes filles m'on dit que tu est un tr\u00e8s bon voisin)\" or something along these lines. \n\nI replied: merci! Elles sont tr\u00e8s bonnes aussi !\nI thought that meant \"thank you, they are very good too!\n\nAgain, my French is very limited. \n\nThat actually means \"yes, they are very hot too\"\nOr \"very good to f*ck\"\n\nHe started speaking English, and we had a pleasant conversation.\n\nWeeks later I watch a video about the worst mistakes you can make in French. This was #1.\n\nSo now I know that I said to a Muslim father that they daughters and ex wife are hot.\n\nTL;DR: my French speaking skills suck and I said to a man that his ex-wife and daughters are hot when I'm trying to say that they are very good (elles sont tr\u00e8s bonnes, if you speak any French).\n\nEDIT 1: some people from Quebec sent me messages saying that this is a \"France french\" expression (or metropolitan french). That is a relief, but not that much. Because I guess they learnt French from France, because they are from Lebanon.",

            "That is what it would mean if you were in France, but no one would interpret it that way in Quebec. \"Bonne\" only = \"Hot\" in France. It's a common expression over there, but not here.",
            "As a french Quebecer, it\u2019s not as bad as you make it out to be. \u201cElle est bonne\u201d is mostly used by French people, not french Quebecer, to mean that she\u2019s good in bed.",
            "Looks like that\u2019s just Metropolitan French slang. You should be good since I\u2019ve never heard that sentence used in that context in Quebec. He probably switched to English because of your accent and figured it would be easier to communicate with an anglophone in English.",

            "Nah mate, you're good.   \n1. It's more of an argot expression than Quebec joual.    \n2. knowing you are Anglo, your neighbour will take what you said literally.      \nHe may chuckle to himself later that you called his daughters \"hot\", but that's it.",

            "Qu\u00e9bec Francophone here. If you really said \"elles sont bonnes aussi\" it doesn't mean \"hot\".  you told him they are \"good\".",
            "If I've learned anything from French it's that you should always be overly specific, if there is room for a sexual misinterpretation, the French have done it. \n\nSee, my first day as an English assistant:\n\nFrench teacher: \"oh is that the new spanish assisant over there?\" \n\nMe: \"oh yeah, I can introduce you if you want?\"\n\n...is what I thought I said, but it turns out you need to say \"je peux t'introduire _\u00e0 lui_ si tu veux\" (I can introduce you _to him_ if you want), because \"je peux t'introduire si tu veux\" means \"I can penetrate you if you want\".\n\nETA the most annoying thing about this mistake is people going 'well if you speak _latin_ it's perfectly obvious' like I haven't just told you a story about how dodgy my high school language teaching was...\n\n\"Ah oui elles sommes tres bonnes voisines aussi\" is probably a perfectly normal sentence.",
            "you're right tho. elles sont tres bonnes does mean they are very good. I'm from Quebec Canada as well and that doesn't mean they are hot at all. I don't know who told you that but you didn't say anything out of the ordinary so this wasn't even a Fuck up. French is my first language and I can assure you 100% you said nothing wrong.",
            "I speak french, and this is the first I've heard of this.  Pretty sure it's just slang.  Bonne means good.  That's all.  You said \"your girls are good too\".  That's it.",
            "If you are such close cool neighbors just tell them you think you realized what you may have said and you've been feeling bad about it. Also that it is not what you intended. Just don't offer them any alcohol or swine as an apology gift next.",
            "\"Bonnes\" literally means \"good\" (fem. pl.), and your use of it in this context is fine. It only has the idiomatic meaning of \"hot\" (actually short for \"good in bed\") in France (mostly around Paris?), not Canada, and even in France it's a double entendre. In context, it wouldn't be offensive in France either, they'd understand it as you intended.",
            "My friend and I were talking and the conversation eventually leads to kids.\n\nMy friend says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed but my daughter has turned into quite the attractive young lady.\u201d\n\nI say, \u201cHow the fuck to I respond to that without you throwing a punch? Yeah your daughter is hot!\u201d",

I simply avoided looking that way because\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to be a creep. \n\nMy son made friends with the kid next door to us and one day, as we were pulling out of the driveway, my son spotted his friend and said \u201chonk at him\u201d I obliged and let out a big \u201cYEAAAAHHHH!\u201d And then promptly looked across the street at the 17 year old girl, sunbathing, but now sitting up with her sunglasses down. \n\nI pretty much had to move at that point.",
            "Haha that reminds me of when my friend, who is English, went to the US. His sister had sat on a wet bench, and when she stood up an American guy said to her \"your fanny's wet\" and she was shocked until my friend explained to her that in the US, fanny means bum. In England it means downstairs lady parts.",
            "Hey, native Qc french speaker here, you're good.   \n\n\nIt doesn't have that same connotation in Quebec french. Most of the videos or lists that you will see online are about metropolitan (parisian) french, or international. Very rare to use the expression of someone being \"bonne\" in this way.  \nThis confusion could come up in writing, but in person, I can't see him interpreting your comment wrong, because if you wanted to actually convey that meaning, you'd be giving a specific look at the same time, one that says \"if you get what I mean\" (an eyebrow raise, for example).  \n\n\nBilingual people can tell exactly what you're trying to say, and we don't specifically try to interpret your wording in a bad way ;)\n\n  \nDon't be too embarrassed, Qc francophones are very used to awkward phrasings from non-native french speakers, and if english is your first language, he knows exactly what you were trying to say, since he could tell from your accent that you were using a word-for-word process of mental translation, and that you meant good in the english sense.  \n\n\nIf he switched to english, it was just because he felt your struggle, and wanted to make the convo easier on you, not because you necessarily said a weird thing. If you want to practice french in bilingual areas of Qc, you kinda have to specify to people that you want to practice, but if the goal is to communicate efficiently, we switch.",

Well this one has tge same issue as its english counterpart, I wonder if its the Americans or the French who first took its meaning to a new level.\n\n\"Baiser\" either means to kiss or to f*ck depending on if you use it as a verb or as a noun.\n\nAnd the list goes on. Even native french speakers can do the mistake, and they will laugh about it so i doubt the father will get offended by it.\n\nAs a side note those videos are clickbait, \"never say that  to a french person\" but what they don't tell you is that french natives know how confusing their language is so they will probably get the message and either laugh about it or ignore the mistake.",

This story reminds me of something similar that happened to me (well im a female, but you will see what I mean).  Many years ago i worked as a waitress at an upscale hotel in the timeshare dining room (this means I served the same pple for a minimum of a week).  So I had a gorgeous busboy who happened to be very tall.  Anyways, so the hotel had a \"Caesar's night\" once a week where the waitstaff were all required to wear togas (they were (supposed to be) knee length.  So my Busboy forgets his toga this one night that was Caesar's night.  We managed to find him one but as he is very tall it was very short...so, im in the hutch cutting up bread when he comes running up to me nearly hysterical, saying, \"omg Snowflake813, please please you have to take care of my duties w table x for the rest of the night!!!  Please!!!\". He was only like 16 at the time.  So, turns out that while he was pouring coffee over the shoulder of an eighty-something very well to do woman, his balls fell out onto her shoulder for the whole table (,10+ pple) to see!!!!  And he said she def felt it...and smiled!!!  Lol as I said he was gorgeous and he prob made that woman's whole week lol but he was undertandabky mortified and refused to go anywhere near that table for the rest of the week.  Lmao",
