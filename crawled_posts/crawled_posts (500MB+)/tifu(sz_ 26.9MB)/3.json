        "selftext": "This is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.\n\nAlso: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.\n\nFor background: At some point in my childhood, I developed pin-worms. In the interest of science, I must admit that I don't know for certain that I had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that I had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.\n\nI'm afraid that I don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all I remember is that as a young child I walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and I don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.\n\nFast forward a decade and a half: I am living on my own. Single. Re-Acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone I am still close to refers to as \"She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\". I don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....I had worms. My butt was beyond-normally itchy. Sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. The confirmation came when I showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.\n\nI hoped they would go away. I showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. But every morning, I would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.\n\nI was horrified, but I made an appointment at my local clinic. When I told the nurse over the phone that I thought I had butt-worms, she was \\*extremely\\* skeptical. She said it was \"highly unlikely\", but they would do tests.\n\nI went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in Sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly South-East Indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.\n\nI was already frustrated, but I waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. Later I drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before I would get results.\n\nIn the meantime, I remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.\n\nI would like to say that as a liberal American male, I wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that I did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, I dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what I had done.\n\nNow to add: I had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. We had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; I wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and I found ourselves showering. My hand drifted down to my butt-crack and I realized I \\*NEEDED\\* to share my story with her, despite fears that I would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. So I spurted it out: \"Uhm, so yeah, I...uh...think I have butt worms....\"\n\nShe was so practical about it. She asked to see. I pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.\n\n\"See,\" I said, embarrassed. \"Worms.\"\n\n...\n\n\"That's toilet paper\", she replied.\n\n\"W...what?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said, nonchalantly\". \"That's toilet paper.\"\n\nEverything fell into place. About a month ago, when finances got tight, I swapped my normal TP roll with Dollar Store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after I wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.\n\nMy relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . My shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.\n\nTLDR: I spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because I bought cheap toilet paper.\n\nPostscript: Shower companion and I just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary.",

            "My daughter had pinworms.  I could have told you that wasn't your problem.  For one thing, they don't look like croissants.  They are very thin white worms.\n\nSecondly, they don't hang out in your butt crack once you wake up.  They will crawl back up your butthole (or cooter if you have one and they're in a hurry) once you wake up and start moving.  The only way to see them is to check very quickly after waking, like a minute or less.\n\nWhat they do is live in your rectum most of the time, but when you are asleep the come out and stick eggs all over the outside of your butt.  The eggs are what itches.  You scratch your butt, the eggs get transferred from fingers to mouth, and they hatch inside your digestive system and live in your large intestine. \n\nThe best way to tell if your kid has pinworms is to wait until they are sleeping, and then stick some scotch tape to their butt then peel it off.  You'll see little white worms wiggling on it. \n\nI had never heard of the garlic up the butt cure.  What you should do is take an oral medication that I think is available OTC and then wash all their bedding and clothes, to get rid of the eggs.\n\nIf you have an itchy butt, keep some tape by your bed, when you first wake up, use it to catch the worms.",

Turns out, each bean in that burrito later on turned into a tiny, super-loud, body-shaking fart. Furthermore, those farts didn't show up until after we had playtime and I had fallen soundly asleep.  \n\nSo, he's a night owl, and was awake in bed, next to me. And each time I farted, it would wake me with a start.  I would jump a little, look up and ask him what was going on, not realizing that I had farted. He would stroke my shoulder and tell me it was nothing and I'd fall back asleep, only to wake myself again with another unfamiliar bean-powered fart.\n\nA couple weeks later, he worked up the nerve to tell me what actually happened, worrying I'd get upset about it.

One doctor must have just said Fuck it, and told me I had anal herpes, probably because I was \"overly promiscuous\" as he put it. Another doctor told me what was happening was my fault and I needed to stop \"it\", now before it gets bad. He told me I needed to eat and stop being anorexic. I remember thinking, wow, I'm not right but not really sure how to stop, \"it\". Sex was embarrassing so I didn't really have it, even after I had another doctor tell me it wasn't anal herpes.

The doctor was very skeptical... and an idiot. He only knew as much as google told him when he left the room. He used the scotch tape to grab a couple white croissants. Then he came back and said \u201cyup! I think you got it.\u201d So he prescribed me some sort of drug. I went to the drug store and they told me \u201cwe don\u2019t have this\u201d. so I went to another drug store where they informed me this drug isn\u2019t made any more and that there is a $12 over the counter medication for worms. I took that and finally felt better. But then every month if I got the slightest itch I would look and see all of the white specks down below. $12 more dollars down the drain. $120 dollars later I wondered why they kept coming back. Then I decided to look deeper at the white specks. And behold it was only toilet paper remnants. All that money for a cure for left over TP and a good night sleep. Looking back I think the first time really was worms, I\u2019m not sure how many times they came back though.",

Part of the job involves putting in placeholder text and links since I'll be told \"We need a link to this resource but it's not available\".\n\nThere's an unspoken agreement that if I'm not given an actual link, I will link to random things; sometimes it's a viral video, sometimes it's an anime meme, and sometimes it's music videos to what I'm listening to. This is just for the draft so it doesn't matter and usually just gives me something fun to add on. For the past few months, I've been working on a large campaign of flyers to promote a program to my neighboring area of half a million people and at the time. At the time, I was listneing to a lot of 80s new wave and decided to see if anyone is actually testing that the QR codes and shorteners work that I directed everything to go to Rick Astley; figured if anyoned checked it, I'd get an email commenting on it.\n\nTime goes by, the official links are the last to be given to me so I add them in, send everything to my supervisor to approve before going to the printer to have 5,000 copies printed of each variation. My work with the project is done and now it's up to others to start putting them while I move on to the next project; that was two weeks ago. This morning, I get pulled into a zoom meeting with the other department heads and their bosses. They ask me about the link and I tell them I checked the QR code and shortener before sending it for review and if there's a error to look at the printer. I even pull up the finalized versions and verified it works. They get more serious and say that the printer wouldn't replace the links with a music video, thinking I screwed up or just did it on purpose. Turns out that the posters and fliers had been put around the county in local businesses, bus stops, out lobbies, etc and emails started to come in. I'm more surprised that anyone actually used the QR codes or links to begin with.\n\nAfter getting grilled, thinking I was going to get fired, I forwarded the email I sent to my supervisor with the final versions of the graphics and they went to the correct links. The best we can figure out is that since there had been dozens of versions over a few months that someone along the chain of command mixed up an earlier version that included the Rickroll link when placing the order; no one wants to take blame for it.  We're currently in the proces of retrieving everything and debating on having stickers printed out to cover the links or pay to have everything reprinted. Even though it wasn't my fault, I'm now suppose to use dummy links and QR codes that go to an image of a tree; my time of adding random music videos has been halted.\n\nTL;DR: TIFU by an early version of a multi-city promotional fliers got sent to the printers that contained  draft links to \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley instead of the correct version and was only discovered after they had already been put up across the area.\n\nEdit: Hot damn! Didn't expect my 4am \"I need to take a break from my workload\" post to take off. Thank you all for the awards and assuring me that my placeholder methods are genius!\n\nFront page edit: Since this is making the rounds on design subreddits and discords, might as well plug [my portfolio](https://shorturl.at/ctMO8) in the event I get fired and need a new job.

            "Honestly props for making good enough content that people actually use your QR code. Your IRL SEO is nice.",
            "Designer here, I often have to put dummy QR codes in printed pieces because the websites they are being linked to aren\u2019t up yet. Here\u2019s my suggestion. Make one QR code in Illustrator and create a custom PANTONE color that is made of 100% magenta. Call the color \u201cFPO QR Code\u201d. In the middle of the QR Code write \u201cFPO\u201d in big letters. This negates the dummy code content from working and tells everyone it\u2019s not a real code. For non-designers/printers, the industry uses the letters FPO as \u201cFor Placement Only\u201d.\n\nBy using a custom PANTONE the printer will automatically see that their file is creating an extra print color (normally just 4, CMYK, your custom color makes 5), and if they don\u2019t, when it gets ripped to negatives the worst that can happen is you get a blank area where a QR code could have fit. They likely will call you when the fifth color is noticed.\n\nUse this dummy QR code for all projects.\n\nFor the so inclined, draw a box around the QR Code that gives the code some buffer space. Set the box to the same \u201cFPO QR Code\u201d custom PANTONE but choose 0% opacity. It will appear white, but to the computer it\u2019s 0% the custom PANTONE*. Now you can use the dummy image over top of images and it will knockout the background as you design. You\u2019ll have to do this to the real QR code when you make it though.\n\nNote, if you are printing digitally the custom PANTONE might convert to CMYK, check your print screen when doing so, if \u201cFPO QR Code\u201d still shows up in your color channels you know there is a dummy QR Code still in the piece somewhere. Find it, replace it, and then do the final print.\n\nSorry if this is wordy, hopefully it helps someone out there.\n\n*Regarding White, unlike your printer at home, White is in fact an ink color and it can be tinted from 100% down to about 5%. Visibility at 5% is dependent on the darkness of the substrate. White is used quite often on snack food clear plastic bags as the first color(s) before the rest of the colors go on top. You also see it used when the substrate is brown cardboard.\n\nOoh, another example where custom PANTONEs for notes and manufacturing would have saved the day [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/NotMyJob/comments/jwxn7k/finished_the_packaging_boss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) from today\u2019s r/notmyjob",

I worked at a brewery/cannery bottling things like beer or arizona tea products. One evening I was testing a batch of arizona tea for sugar content and found it was only half as much as the specification sheet called for. So I told the workers to add more sugar. This is exactly what my job is supposed to be. I had done it many times before. That was fine, etc. etc. \n\nNext day I get called into my supervisor's office saying I \"screwed up that batch of tea.\" I showed them the results of the tests (done in triplicate), showed them the excel sheet I used to do the math (which was provided FOR me on a shared drive), and that was that. I had done everything exactly correct. Well, turns out that my supervisor had written the specification sheets, and FORGOT to change the sugar content number on that particular (new) tea to what it was supposed to be. \n\n\n**Wanna guess who got fired?**\n\n\nWhen they asked me what I think went wrong, I also may or may not have said \"Well I think the person who wrote the specification sheets should have been a little more careful since those are supposed to be taken as law for literally everybody in the plant.\" \n\nI said this to the supervisor who wrote the specification sheets before I knew they wrote the specification sheets.\n\nThe funny thing is that it wasn't even my shift at that time. This ordeal started in the last half hour of my shift, and I stayed over to help the other guy (who was coming on to his shift) to deal with it. It was HIS call in the end, not mine. I just suggested \"well this is how much sugar you'd need to add if you decide to add the sugar.\" (Mind you, this calculation was CORRECT.)\n\n**Wanna take a guess as to why he wasn't fired?**\n\n(Hint, he was related to the supervisor.)",

A while later a few of us headed out to explore- I went and met up with a friend who lived in the area and ended up having a few drinks.\n\nEarlier while I was out, I had got a text from my wife saying that she was switching our room with her parents\u2019 as ours had a balcony while theirs didn\u2019t, which her dad wanted so he could smoke (and that she was going out for dinner with her mom). Anyway I saw it, said ok fine, agreed to switch keycards with him once I got back. \n\nA few hours later, I was a bit drunk and my friend dropped me back to the hotel. The text had completely slipped my mind and so I headed to the room with the balcony where her parents were staying and, thinking it was ours, went right in.\n\nAs I went in, I heard the shower running in the bathroom and, feeling promiscuous, I decided to give who I thought was a my wife in the shower and little surprise. So I stripped down (completely naked) and, seeing that the door was slightly ajar, decided to barge in. So I did. While also announcing quite loudly, \u201cDaddy\u2019s home!\u201d. \n\nThe sight that lay before me is one that\u2019ll be stuck in my mind forever- my father-in-law, naked in the shower, looking at in a mixture of disbelief, confusion and- mostly- anger.\n\nI froze, and for a second we just stood there in silence, which was soon broken by him shouting- \u201cWhat the FUCK (my name)\u201d. \n\nAt this point my flight response kicked in and, as fast as I could, rushed out, dressed faster than I ever have before in my life, and ran out the room. \n\nSince I don\u2019t have the keycard for the other room and sure as hell am not going back to ask for it, I\u2019m now sitting at this cafe outside the hotel. I\u2019m waiting for my wife to get back from her dinner as I don\u2019t really think I can explain what just happened over the phone, if I can explain it without dying of embarrassment at all. So yeah, the family brunch tomorrow should be interesting...\n\nTL;DR: Switched hotel rooms with wife\u2019s parents, got drunk, accidentally went into their room, barged into bathroom while FIL was showering\n\nUPDATE: My FIL told my MIL and my wife, and both of them pretty much died of laughter. He also isn\u2019t too upset, just told my wife to tell me I know \u201cwho daddy is around here\u201d, who promptly relayed this message to me. Currently with the wife in OUR room, trying to get the aforementioned image out of my mind and avoided the in-laws at all costs. Also would like to clarify I did NOT know what promiscuous actually means, I swear...",

Wasn't sure how I felt about that but the wife ended up on full bed rest because she had preclampsia (sp?) and it ended up being very helpful. But I digress. About a week into the visit the eife and I are going to shower so I coukd take her to the doc. I went first. I'm taking a shower when in walks the MIL thinking the wife was in the shower. We had a clear glass shower door and she was at the sink and hadn't noticed that it wasn't my wife in the shower like she thought. Since there isn't anywhere to hide I'm standing there with the dilemma of deciding if I face front and display the dick, turn around and display the ass, or go profile and display both. Before I could decide she turned towards the shower and just stood there for three or four seconds confused. When it dawned on her that it was me and not my wife she literally said \"Oh shit!\" and hightailed it out. When I finished up and went out to the living room all three of us busted out laughing. I wasn't sure how she'd react because she could be weird about things like this but she thought it was as funny as I did. Every now and then it would come up in conversation and we'd all get a good laugh.",

My family (wife and daughter) and I went for a Disney world and beach trip last month. We stayed at the condo with my mom and her new boyfriend, which is quite awkward in itself. I think he means well but he is an extremely awkward person. \n\nAnyways cut to the morning the day after we arrive at the condo. I woke up sick and everyone went to the beach without me (or so I thought). My mom had some medicine for me before she left and all was good until I needed more. I\u2019m looking around for it and decide to check her bedroom. As I\u2019m searching, the bathroom door opens suddenly and there is my mom\u2019s boyfriend fully nude standing right in front of me. Probably one of my most awkward moments ever. I said \u201coh shit sorry (his name)\u201d. He says it\u2019s ok worse things have happened (yeah not what I was thinking at that moment).

        "selftext": "So first of all, I'm an 19 year old guy and everyone involved in the butt competition was between the ages of 18 and 20. Alt-account as I don't want my friends to know my actual reddit account. TL;DR at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo  it al started around a week ago when some girls in my friend group came together and started drinking. They started boasting about their butt and next thing you know they wanted to do a best butt competition. I wasn't there so I don't know details but we were send a message in a group chat. Rules were simple, if you wanted to join you just had to send a pic of your butt to this certain girl who would present them anonymously to  8 guys and they would all vote for the picture of the best butt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, I thought it would be funny to join, but I knew that they wouldn't take it seriously because my ass is naturally extremely hairy. So I did the most logical thing at the time. I shaved it. I took the shaving equipment I normally use for my face, switched the knifes and went ham. Well this is were the first problem came in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stupid person I am didn't lock the door. My mom walked in on me shaving my ass. She just awkwardly wiggled away and I turned extremely red. She didn't say anything, so I thought she would just ignore it. Well she didn't. She started googling. That evening, she asked me to come to the dinner table to talk. My father ran away so I knew it would be bad, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe wanted to talk about *intercourse safety in a homosexual relationship*. Keep in mind, I'm not actually gay. She was extremely well prepared. Highlights of that evening were practicing with a condom and a cucumber, the dangers of gay sex without lube, and a brief summary of objects I should definitely not put in my butt (such as lamps and beer bottles). She would not listen to any of my denying and would just say: \"its okay, Your dad and I still love you\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought the worst was over so I send a picture of my shaven butt to the girl that was collecting them. 2 days later the 9 pictures of all the contestants were send, all without any distinguishable features, to the  8 boys. So one thing you should now is that I do have quite a good butt. I got pretty good genes in that aspect and I've been skating since I was 14. I now skate around 60km a week and skating is  an incredible way to get a firm round butt of decent size. You can probably see where this is going. I won with a total of 5 out of 8 votes. 1 picture got 2 votes and 1 got 1 vote. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fallout from this was not that big. Some of the more prideful girls wanted to start some drama, but they didn't want to admit their butt lost to a boy, I didn't talk a lot with them anyway and Covid makes drama a little more difficult, so that was simply ignored by most of us. Our mix-gendered trip to a lake when lockdown  would end did turn a guys only trip as some of the girls suddenly didn't really feel like going and the rest didn't want to go to a lake with a such a one-sided girl/boy-ratio. I do want to say that most of the girls did think it was hilarious on some sort of level and the one that didn't are famous in our group for being extremely prideful. It is, however, extremely awkward to talk with most of them as they now look at my ass quite frequently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't stop with this by the way. I was gaming with my friends today and we started talking about the butt competition. We kept it anonymous which butt was from what person and the people that voted didn't know who won yet and I did not know who the guys that voted were. Well, the guy I was gaming with happened to be one of the people voting. He said he couldn't chose between two and so he started masturbating and voted for the one he came on. I said something along the lines of 'that's gross AF'. He than said something like 'You would understand if you saw the butt and than proceeded to send the picture he voted for via snapchat. It was mine. I didn't tell him, but I now have to live with the knowledge that a good friend of mine came on a picture of my shaven ass.\n\nEdit: Alright, this became a lot mor popular than I thought it would be. I'm happy my awkward life is amusing random strangers on the internet.\n\nFirst a little update: the guy has probably seen this post and recognized it as he just sent me a text which states 'sorry'. Nothing more. He wont answer any texts, from me or my friends. I'll try again tomorrow.\n\nYes, my mom is a great person. She was raised in an extremely strict catholic household. She stayed a catholic (going to church twice a week) but never wanted her kids to feel forced to be anything their not.\n\nOne thing some people seem to misunderstand is that my butt is extremely incredible to win against cheerleaders, actresses and models. My friendgroup exists out of the d&d players, the art kids, and the alternative crowd. Even though we have some incredibly beautiful people here, we were never the jaw-dropping popular crowd. Which is okay, as we always had fun.\n\nI AM NOT A DUDE WITH A BRAZILIAN WOMAN'S ASS.\n\nalso thanks for the medals and the tips for caring after my shaven ass. I didn't think about aftercare until you guys said anything.\n\nAlso, I'm not posting pictures of my ass so that thousands of strangers can see it. Sorry, but I'm just not risking it.\n\nEdit 2: Fine, you guys win. You know how many requests I've got for butts? Way too many. Absolutely abnormal. I don't want my bare ass to end up on the internet so I'll make one wearing something were you can see the shape of it tomorrow. God damn perverts. For now I'll go to sleep.\n\nEdit 3: So first the updates. My friend said he is actually straight. He still a little quieter than usual, but he can see the joke. Hope it thought him not to masturbate to random people.\n\nMy mom loves you guys. I told her the whole story (minus the part about my friend cumming). She thought it was funny and said that she believed me to be bisexual for a long time and thought that me shaving was me getting ready for butt stuff. She wanted to have that talk for quite sometime.\n\nSome people don't understand how the competition was played. The girl I send my picture to was not a contestant but more of a referee. She sent it to 8 guys that were not a part of the friend group and told them that these were of a few of her friends amd they should pick out their favourite. Later she send the results. It was a complete coincidence that my friend was a voter.\n\nThe TIFU continued by the way. My ass is itching. Like a lot. Dammit.\n\nLastly: You know what, I'm not going to send the pictures. Some of you guys are absolute beast. WTF. In the time that I was sleeping I got multiple messages from old man between the age of 50 and 70 talking about what they would do to my ass. I do not want them or any of the other disgusting people to have pictures of my butt. \n\nAdd to that some people that have been spamming me for complete nudes. Just because you are anonymous does not mean you can be a disgusting pest.\n\nIf it was for the laughs it would be okay, but some of you actually scare me. 1 guy even found my main account. How?\n\nI feel truly sorry for the girls on this platform as I completely understand why anyone would delete their account. \n\nSorry, to all the people that were just curious or thought it was funny, but I'm just not comfortable with it anymore. I hope you understand.\n\nTL;DR: Shaved my ass and entered a butt competition, made life awkward with my mom, a few of my female friends and 1 male friend.",

Some people suggested I post this here as well, so here goes. \n\n\nThis story has four characters ; my husband (28m), me(27f), mother in law and father in law. \n\nEven though husband and I are Indians, we\u2019re from different states. He\u2019s from North India and I\u2019m from West India. MIL thinks I don\u2019t know their native language. Thing is,I do understand it. I\u2019ve picked up a lot of words and phrases from hearing my husband speak and and from songs etc. I understand enough to comprehend. \n\nWe could be at dinner at my in laws house and the conversation would go like this : \n\nMIL : *switches to her native tongue and makes some  remark about me.* \n\nHusband: *defends me in native tongue. Asks her to stop* \n\n\nThis used to be very funny to me because these people thought I did not know what they were saying about me and I found his mother\u2019s remarks very Indian mother-ish. Nothing offensive really. \n\nFor example, she\u2019d say to my face that the food I cooked is tasty but then switch to her native language and go,\u2019 There\u2019s so much salt in it. Is your wife trying to give me a Blood Pressure problem?\u2019 Sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face. \n\n\nFew days back, we were face timing with my in laws and my MIL says something in the native tongue. This is where the fuck up happens. I wasn\u2019t paying attention and I thought she spoke to me so I replied in the same language. Now, I didn\u2019t even know if I could speak it since I\u2019d never really tried. I thought it was more of a \u2018I understand but I can\u2019t speak it\u2019. If the \u2018surprised pikachu meme\u2019 was real, it would be the expressions of my husband and his parents. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget how their faces looked. I wish I could\u2019ve taken a pic. \n\n\nMIL has been sugary sweet to me. She\u2019s been sending all these \u2018good mornings\u2019 and \u2018hope u well\u2019 texts to me.I hate this new MIL. I prefer her subtle way of being fake than her obvious way of being fake. I feel like I lost a super power. I won\u2019t get to hear MIL\u2019s running commentary about me. Those were entertaining af. I looked forward to family dinners just for her taunts which she thought I couldn\u2019t understand. I really fucked up bad by slipping up.\n\n\nTL;DR didn\u2019t tell my husband that I could understand his language, had fun while MIL taunted me in the said language, lost this superpower now.",

            "So I saw this on \"AITA\" and had a good hearty laugh, because that's AWESOME.  I literally tried to imagine the \"surprised pikachu meme\" on an older woman's face. \n\nWhat I will offer up to as a consolation, is that although your MIL is currently sweet as peaches, she'll find a way to work around it.  \n\nMy own MIL speaks English (as do all of US, so no excuses for loss of translation).  And yet, for years, I perceived small slights from her that my husband never picked up on.  Not big things, not offensive things, just small comments that flew so far under the radar that no one ever caught it but me --- and I can honestly tell you that I adore this woman, and she adores me, but her darling son will always be first, and will always be right, and a lot of her comments reflect this.  Sure, I get it, most of the time.    But it upset me on a regular basis, and I had a couple of arguments with my husband over this small thing over the first couple of years.  \n\nAnd then one night, we were all together and something was said and I cocked my head up as I registered whatever it was she said; and saw my husband sort of reel back in his chair AS IF HE ALSO HEARD IT.   He did HEAR it.    So now, probably 45% of the time, he finds a way to intercede on my behalf, and the other 45% of the time, he backs me up with whatever my rebuttal is.  The remaining 10% is for when I make absolutely no sense, even to myself....",
            "I don't know why non white people take that risk.  White friend married an Asian girl who was born in the US.  She also speaks Cantonese.  They have a favorite \"asian\" restaurant they love going to and the workers talk about them all the time, \"Oh she lucky, she got a white man\" and such.  His wife knew the whole time, as she can clearly hear them talking about them.  Finally they put an end to it.  She trained him how to ask for chopsticks in Cantonese.  They brought the food out, gave her chopsticks and handed him a fork....which almost seems racists or at least insulting.  Queue up his moment and he busts out some Cantonese and asks for chopsticks.  All the workers were dead silent and never talked again.",

In fact, you'd like it if she does have diet concerns like too much salt in the food, because you care about her health, and you don't want to make her sick, or make her feel she has to eat something she doesn't like, because it's overseasoned for what she prefers. \n\nYou can always start putting out a set of seasoning shakers - get plain salt and pepper shakers, but clearly label \"salt\" \"pepper\" \"cumin\" \"hot spice\" etc for whatever spices can be added to finished dishes. (I know some are better when cooked in the sauce etc) You can also get a set of \"individual serve\" crockery where you can bake things in individual servings and go from oven to table in the same dish - then you can make grandma's with a mark or something on the crockery, so you know that one is the \"less seasoned\" one, and everyone else's is \"full spice style\".\n\nJust a couple thoughts for trying to make grandma feel that you welcome her, even if she does get a bit cranky because you have her son.",

            "I love this whole post, but I understand the feeling of fucking up. My family spoke tagalog, something that I did not understand when I first met my extended family. Within a few years of lessons from my cousins, watching shows and films with subtitles, and living with my non English speaking grandfather, I was pretty good at it when I visited. The pronunciation is very different to English, which is my first language, so I never tried to speak in Tagalog. I just silently understood. I would hear them talk about me and not realise I could understand, but as an insecure 11-12 year old I was really upset and I decided I wouldn\u2019t admit to knowing what they said. I\u2019m 25 now and while I\u2019m out of practice, I plan to be fluent next time I see them in 2021.

I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. \n\nI pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as \"sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch\". \n\nThe blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.\n\nI had no clue. \n\nI went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. \n\nIt was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. \n\n\nThis was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions. \n\nNSFL\n https://imgur.com/3nge8Nm.jpg \n\n\nEDIT- I want to clear up: I'm naturally, very pale person, I was at high altitude while on and in the water. I do not blame anyone but myself for this. Whether expired or I stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. I should have been careful with making sure the things I use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. \nI agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, I just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. \nThis isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. \n\nI'm not planning to sue anyone although I appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. \nI just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! Be safe! Skin cancer is a real danger.\n\nTL;DR- Sunblock expires.",

            "Here's what you should also know: **If your sunblock has expired, you're not using enough.**\n\n[From skincancer.org](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/ask-the-experts/how-much-sunscreen-should-i-be-using-on-my-face-and-body): \n> It is very unlikely that you\u2019re applying too much sunscreen \u2014 most people don\u2019t apply enough, which is why undesirable sunburns and tanning can occur despite sunscreen application. To achieve the Sun Protection Factor (SPF, which protects against the sun\u2019s UVB radiation) reflected on a bottle of sunscreen, you should use approximately two milligrams of sunscreen per square centimeter of skin. In practice, this means applying the equivalent of a shot glass (two tablespoons) of sunscreen to the exposed areas of the face and body \u2013 a nickel-sized dollop to the face alone. If you\u2019re using a spray, apply until an even sheen appears on the skin. Remember that sunscreen needs to be reapplied every two hours, or more frequently after swimming, heavy perspiration, or toweling off. \n\nIf you're only wearing a bikini or swim trunks, on a long day at the beach you might need to use an entire tube (100 ml/3,5 fl oz) of sunscreen that day. For regular use, it should last a week or two max. Sun screen can be used up to several years after purchase, but it should never last that long - unless you just got released from a bunker or something.",
            "So after 3 years SPF 100 turns to SPF 0?!\n\nThat can\u2019t be right. I\u2019d expect the sunblock to degrade a bit, but it looks like that product just didn\u2019t work.",

There will be a seal saying it is CS on the bottle or you can Google brands that are certified safe.",
            "I've been using expired sunblock probably all my life, and luckily never experienced a burn. I would assume it depends on the type of protection and composition.

            "I'm surprised nobody here is giving actual tips about sunscreen use. From my experience around the people I know, nobody seems to know a fucking thing about sunblock and I noticed two mistakes in this post alone (other than not knowing it expires.)\n\nFirst of all, using sunblock above SPF 30 is extremely redundant. SPF is not a linear scale, so SPF 100 is not twice as effective as SPF 50. SPF 30 already blocks 97% of UV rays, and increasing to SPF 100 will only give you 98% protection (while also costing way more). Even SPF 15 blocks 93% of UV rays, but i personally use SPF 30.\n\nSecondly, I'd highly advise avoiding any sort of spray-on sunscreen. I understand it's \"convenient\" but hardly anyone uses it properly. When people use spray-on sunscreen they typically spray each area of their body for approximately 2 seconds, however, to get the full protection of the sunscreen you would actually need to spray each area for 6 seconds. When people use spray-on sunscreen they vastly overestimate how much protection they are applying.\n\nI see many many people here being shocked about the expiration date and throwing out 5-6 year old bottles. If a bottle lasts through the summer, let alone two summers, you likely aren't applying enough sunscreen when you're outside.\n\nI have other advice I usually give, but I just wanted to talk about the mistakes I read in this post that nobody seems to be confronting. Stay safe in the sun people, sunburns are no joke.",
            "Pharmacist here. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. That looks really painful. About sunscreens, general rule is 12 months. After that, no protection is guaranteed.

I trip to the ER because it was brain-scrambling itchy, followed by a brand new nurse who missed the vein (possible due to me trembling like I had a nerve disorder) and had to stick me 8 times to get an IV started. That was 20 years ago. From my neck to my swim trunks (I'm a dude so no top to protect me) looked like your pic. As of now someone can come up and pat me a little too hard on the back and I wince in pain. Makes me wonder if I screwed up some nerve endings in my skin somehow.\n\nMuch love, OP.

I was getting ready to leave and thanked her for talking, she looks at me and says \"uh... Aren't you going to ask for my fucking number?\" Duh!!!  \n\n2. Girl I really liked at a restaurant kept asking me about my plans, and always responded \"I've never tried that, but I'd like to\" or \"I used to do that all the time and enjoyed it\". One of my buddies is like \"dude, she only talks like that to you, ask her out\". Finally I worked up the courage. She said something at lunch that was like a no brainier. I brought it up to my buddy and he laughed and said \"go ask her\". Went back at dinner time to ask her out... She was gone. And it was her last day. Never saw her again.  \n\n3. Current girlfriend, after our first real date, suggests we should get a cheap motel because I have a long drive and look tired. I suggest I will be fine, but she insists. So I start going to the office, and she says real quick not to pay extra for two beds. I'm like \"it's only $5 more\" and she looks at me like I'm a moron. Ok, only one bed. We get to the room, she takes a shower, and I lay down in bed fully clothed taking off only my shoes. She walks out of the shower in a towel and asks why my pants are on, I say \"I didn't want you to be uncomfortable\". She removes the towel and tells me she won't be the only one naked. Sounds good to me... But I still don't touch her. After like 2 minutes, she asks \"do you have condoms\", I respond \"a couple in my truck, why?\" She is pretty shocked at this point, and says \"do you like me? \"Yeah\" \"do you want me?\" \"Fuck yeah\" \"then go get the God damn condoms\"   \n\nA few other stories like this, but those were some of my most humorous screw ups, though 1 and 3 turned out alright.",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account because some of my friends/family know my real one\n\nThe lottery winning took place back in August 2014. Mike and I were married in October 2014. It wasn't a fortune, but enough to make a difference. After taxes it came out to right around $480,000. Most people would be over the moon, but I panicked. I didn't want our life to turn upside down because we had extra money now.\n\nI was still legally single at the time, and so I was able to accept it anonymously without the need to tell anyone else. So I didn't. Tell anyone else. Not a single soul. Not my husband, my parents, siblings, best friends, etc. Only the state and federal governments.\n\n(My husband has a tendency to spend on things we don't need and that aren't going to benefit us in the long run so I didn't want our money to blown quickly on stupid stuff like cars and clothes.)\n\nI opened a new bank account with a national credit union and put the check in. Got started with a financial advisor (Keith), who guided me into investing in local businesses and real estate. And that's that. It's been sitting there since, just growing.\n\nFlash forward to today. I'm doing dishes getting ready to start making dinner, and my phone rings. I can't get to it but figure I'll call them back. Then I get a text. No big deal. I'll get to it in a minute....but husband came into the kitchen and glanced at my phone to let me know who text me and called me (which he always does if my hands are full).\n\nIt's Keith. He called and text me to let me know my account just hit $1 million after one of the energy companies I invested in soared recently.\n\nMy husband is stunned. Has no clue what to even say, staring at me until he says \"we have a million dollars??\" I was so flushed but finally just sat him down and explained the situation. He's clearly mad at me for never telling him. Asks if my family knows, and I tell him that no one knows except the IRS and Keith.\n\nIt took him a few hours to finally be able to really talk to me.. at the end of the silence he told me he's proud of me for investing into our future but he needs a few days to clear his head because he feels like I hid a huge part of \"myself\" from him.\n\nWe might just need to take a vacation now.\n\nTL;DR I won a lottery in 2014 and never told my husband until he learned that I grew the money to a million today.\n\nEdit: I already have people messaging me asking if they can have money. Jesus. This is why I didn't tell anyone!!\n\nUpdate! My husband and I just spoke on the phone for about an hour. He told me he's staying with his best friend/coworker tonight but that he's not angry. He agreed he would have spent the money on dumb things if he'd won it and is happy that I put it away. Little less happy that I didn't tell him about it for so long, but he said he doesn't care and doesn't want this getting in the way of our marriage.\n\nUpdate!!!: Hello! Jesus I didn't know this would blow up so much. I've been at work and talking to my husband Mike all day, basically laying down some ground rules for the money moving forward. He will not tell anyone (didn't tell his friend!) and we will only dip in for emergencies and pre-discussed things. A few people asked in the comments how much we make a year, I guess to see where we'd be without this money. I currently make around 60k and Mike makes more at around 85k. So to all the ones saying I \"starved him\" or \"made him scrounge\" that is not true lol. We make a good amount.\n\nI have no clue how to post all of the screenshots of the clowns in my inbox, but I'll try to put something in the comments!!",

He might do just that, but morally this is all kinds of weird. If you were marrying the man, you've known him far longer than august of that year, correct? So if you had that level of trust.... ? Why hide it? From the guy you wanted to spend your life with? It poses a lot of questions that you actually didn't trust him etc. And I think that's what he has the most issues with. You hid that.. what else could you be hiding etc. You kept it a secret for so long. What else could you be keeping from him without him ever finding out. Etc. etc. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut good luck. I hope you guys are able to work it out.",

There\u2019s times I may have worked a bunch of OT to pay something off when I really hadn\u2019t needed to.\n\nThat said, I would probably get over it once I was satisfied that you weren\u2019t planning to leave me or running some illegal side scheme.",

It didn't help that up till that point I was paying for the majority of our shared expenses. And there was a further revelation that she'd surpassed my income too.\n\nIt took me a while to get over it and I still harbour a bit of resentment now. But it seems that she does feel guilt about the whole thing and since then has picked up more expenses of her own accord.",

            "Well, if your spouse is gonna surprise you with something, it could be worse than the fact that they are a millionaire. But I have to say, don't keep secrets from your spouse, except what you got them for their birthday. This is certainly nothing to break up over, but it creates a feeling of inequality, like you know what's best anyway so you don't include him in the decision process. At the beginning of our relationship, my wife told me that her car insurance didn't allow other people to drive her car - a lie. She did it because she didn't want me to ask her to borrow her car for festivals, because she was worried her car could get damaged. When I found out I was pretty hurt that she thought I would respect it if she told me she wasn't comfortable with it. Moral of the story, be honest with your partner, and if they don't respect your feelings and decisions, they probably shouldn't be your partner to begin with.",

But considering the fact that you said you were \u201ctechnically\u201d single when you won, makes me doubt the credibility of this story.

Sorry if I sound a little harsh but:    \n     \n\nEveryone keeps saying how OP did the right thing by keeping it from their husband and how smart it was, money (!) wise.     \n    \n     \nMany people have a tendency to spend too much money. That's why when you marry someone, you usually make sure you can communicate with them well enough and trust them enough not to be spending YOUR half a million dollars without your consent. Damn, find an agreement, TALK, maybe sign something if necessary but don't just straight up lie to your partner.     \n    \n    \nIf my partner would've kept this from me, I would not trust them for a very long time and question whether we were compatible. Because money affects our life together greatly and changes a LOT, if they don't talk to me about it that's a deal breaker. My money is our money and the other way around and we agree on how we're spending and splitting it together. And if they actually divorced me then - as some are suggesting - because they wanted to make sure I don't get a dime, well thank God I dodged this bullet.\n    \n    \nAlso: OP, you don't seem as if you actually believe you fucked up, you defend and explain yourself, you're just mad he found out. So honestly, this is a \"TKFU\" from your perspective because Keith fucked up. But okay, congratulations for making a very smart decision money wise. I hope it's worth a damaged marriage.",

The episodes continued on-and-off, sometimes on vacations in Foreign Countries. These were not pleasant experiences.

        "selftext": "As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...\n\nSunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.\n\nAs I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.\n\nI got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.\n\nI woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I'm not a big fan of, and napping.\n\nI woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, \"enough is enough.\" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.\n\nI went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn't let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. \"It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!\" (Dave Chappelle voice)\n\nThe Dr. came flying into the room and said, \"Hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!\"\n\nMy life stopped. \"A stroke? I'm 29? How could I have had a stroke?\" I couldn't comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.\n\nWhat happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, \"couldn't believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking.\" She told me, \"usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.\"\n\nAs I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.\n\nMy parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I've had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!\n\nThe first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.\n\nBut wait...there's MORE!!!\n\n6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).\n\n6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.\n\nI awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV's had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.\n\nThe surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn't see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.\n\nFast forward, to October 2, 2017.\n\nMy vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.\n\nI could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don't remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, \"how'd this guy get in my bedroom?\"\n\nI was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).\n\nI did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...\n\nI was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.\n\nWhat this means for me now is I'll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I'm a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I'm not happy about it, but I don't let it change my outlook on life.\n\nI refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I'm out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.\n\nI tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I'm begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don't be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.\n\nI thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health\n\n-ZK\n\n(TLDR: Had a stroke at age 29, almost died, had brain surgery, recovered, went back to work only to have a seizure my first day back caused by the stroke and am still awaiting return to work)\n\n[Edit: Here are some pics of when I was in the hospital and the recovery of the incision.]\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Enbwl3S.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PzvMaWb.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7IVzKyD.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ri55Sk2.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Zri1BB5.jpg",

Went home, ibuprofen and a hot shower and went to bed. Woke up the next day and it was still there. \n\nFelt like bad indigestion, but higher up in the middle of my chest. Figured it was a bad pull and went to work. By 930 it came and went but the last one spread to my neck and under my arms and almost put my on my knees. Rushed myself to the hospital only to be put in an ambulance and sent to a cardiac equipped place. \n\nIve never know fear until I was wheeled into an operating room with 5 people standing around a table waiting for me. Scared the shit out of me. The doctor went in through my wrist, an hour later I was done. Between the fentanyl and the relief from the stent I felt great.  I won the genetic lottery with that one. \n\nListen to your body people. If it isn\u2019t right go to the damn doctor. That\u2019s what they\u2019re there for!! ",

            "Dude, I'm a doctor, I'm at ICU right now and let me tell you a case that its here.\n\nA guy 19 years old had a bad headache, went to the ER, they found an arteriovenous fistula (which had not ruptured). He goes home, sees a neurosurgeon later, which request surgery to correct it before it bursts. The medical insurance company drags its feet and takes about 3 months to greenlight it. Just as it's greenlighted this poor lad has a massive bleeding stroke and is in coma(he's just barely waking up but will probably end up in a persistent vegetative state), breathing by respirators(mechanical ventilation as we call) ever since, this was 3 months ago...\n\nSo take what the guys at Stanford said seriously, you were much more likely to be dead or in coma, find solace and gratefulness in that, see the cup half full, not half empty.",
            "Sounds very similar to story of my wife. She had brain aneurysm that ruptured while we were engaged in foreplay and doctor mis-diagnosed that, she bled to brain for 24+ hrs, had complications (subsequent stroke), lost speech, partially lost vision in one eye, was 18 days in critical state, etc.. all of that was almost 10 years ago, when she was 25 (6 months after our wedding). Now we have 2 sons (7 and almost 2). It took some time, but she recovered, although she still has minor problems with memory. It was fucked up time (like all her problems were not enough, I had nervous breakdown) but we managed to get through it and we enjoy life.\n\nWhy I am mentioning this - stay positive, it helps a lot.I wish you good luck recovering. And keep in mind, that you managed to fool death, so whatever problems life brings you they will probable fade compared to what you already went through.",

            "Since it's a disorder caused by a stroke and not epilepsy, is there any chance of controlling your seizures with medication? I have epilepsy that is able to be medically controlled, so just thought I'd ask.",
            "I'm so glad you're okay! I have similar story to share that further emphasizes DO NOT HESITATE when you feel something is very wrong. \n\nMy dad was around 67 at the time, we were vacationing in Florida (we're Canadian). He suddenly woke up with a massive headache. Unlike anything he had felt before. My dad is a complete workaholic. When he's not in Florida he's working 12hrs 5 days a week as an Optometrist (he's his own boss and makes his own hours...... I know, he's crazy). So when he complains of pain I know it's serious. He took his blood pressure and it was something like 180/120, which at the time I had no idea what that meant (I'm in nursing school now). I googled it and realized it was almost considered a medical emergency, and I was begging him to go to the hospital. He had travel insurance but he didn't want to go through the hassle of getting it sorted out and was scared they might not cover the cost of his hospital visit. I didn't know what to do so I sort of forced myself to cry. Part of it was real because I was scared but part of me knew if I acted dramatic he would feel bad and go just to make me feel better. \n\nFrom here, his story is pretty similar to OPs. He had a CT scan done, we thought his headache could be due to his sinus issues. He gets TERRIBLE sinusitis that he actually had surgery for this year. We expected that was what the CT results would show. We were wrong. The doctor told us he had subdural hematoma (a brain bleed) and needed to be transferred by ambulance to another hospital. They were surprised he was still functioning normally considering he technically had a hemorrhagic stroke. When he got to the other hospital, they did a neurological assessment on him and found he had absolutely no deficits or signs of a stroke (minus the bleeding). The doctors were all extremely confused as to what caused this. My dad had previously slipped and fell and hit his head on his friends driveway a few months prior. He was rushed to the hospital and had scans done but there was no bleeding. Turns out, some veins were damaged and it took a while for them to burst. The doctors kept asking if he had experienced a head injury previously but we were terrified the insurance wouldn't cover his surgery because it would be technically due to a \"pre-existing condition\". The doctors eventually blamed it on his sinusitis, saying his repetitive sneezing could have blown a vein. Rare, but technically possible.\n\nThe next day, he had an emergency craniotomy where they stopped the vein from bleeding and suctioned out the excess blood in his brain. He made a full recovery because it was caught in time. They said if he had waited any longer his condition would have deteriorated and he could have died. PLEASE never hesitate. I know it's hard in the US because some people are uninsured, and it breaks my heart that some people can't afford care. But if something feels really wrong, please get it checked out. If not for yourself, do it for your family. The horror my mom and I would have gone through had my dad not gone to the hospital would have been unimaginable.",
            "Holy shit, this is terrifying. Can you describe what exactly your head pain felt like? \n\nI suffer from migraines and tension headaches and sometimes I have headaches come on abruptly and seemingly at random, and they feel different from normal but eventually go away. A part of me is decently paranoid I'm suffering from a brain tumor or stroke at times like that.\n\nI'm glad you survived and are doing okay. I love your positivity. When is your wedding?",
            "Not only this, but if you think they aren't correct, insist on more tests. Around Christmas time last year, my grandma started having headaches. She shrugged it off, because she got headaches sometimes. She just took it easy. Come to find out, she had been having them since before Thanksgiving. \n\nI was out of town, and my mom took her to the ER and they said she had a sinus infection. She started getting wobbly on her feet and complaining of pain in her neck. My mom took her back, they said she had a pulled muscle in her neck. By the time I got back from my vacation, she couldn't walk. I know no sinus infection and pulled muscle does that, I've had plenty of them. \n\nIt was so bad, I decided to take her to the ER. Only problem was, she felt fine when she was lying down, but she got nauseated as soon as she'd sit up. She was physically unable to dress herself. By the time I got her out of her pajamas (I would have just went in my jammies, but she wanted dressed) and dressed, she was vomiting. \n\nThere was no way I was getting her to the hospital, so the ambulance came to get her.\n\nCome to find out, she had stage IV small cell lung cancer. Two tumors in her brain, one in her lungs, and one on her pancreas.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer is very fast and aggressive, but responds very well to chemo. If she had said something when she first started having symptoms, she may have been able to get treatment. By the time she spoke up, it was too late. She went from able to walk, to unable to walk within a weeks time. She lost control of her bladder not long after that. She lost her ability to feed herself within two weeks of being diagnosed.

            "I did the opposite as you... never had a migraine before... and a couple years ago, I had a bad headache come on mid afternoon, and popped some ibuprofen, but it did close to nothing.\n\nBy that evening, i was in so much pain I was sweating. Basically a stabbing pain going from the back of my neck and into my jaw... up the side of the jaw into my left eye socket. My left arm felt numb and I was dizzy it hurt so bad. Basically like i imagine the brain freeze from dry ice would feel like.\n\nI work construction too, and I have dropped a 100lb door on my foot (decided not to wear steel toes that day), split my nail open with a missed hammer swing, and cut my finger down to the bone with a Sheetrock razor. I usually just hop around like Yosemite Sam for a few seconds, grab some paper towel and electric tape, wrap it up and head back to work. This pain was far more intense and different. \n\nSo, I go to the ER right away, especially due to the numb arm. They rush me back, and the doctor looks at me, shines a light in my eye and says it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a migraine. How he could tell this by looking at me for two minutes is beyond me... He gives me a 600mg Naproxen and sends me home. Schedules a scan at my regular doctor for the next day to be sure. I go, No clots or other signs of stroke. \n\nI had started using a nasal pot and it inflamed my sinus cavities and caused a migraine. \n\nIt was a $1,000 ER visit for 2 minutes of his time and a prescription strength Naproxen.\n\nI felt like such a dumbass for thinking I was having a stroke, and having to pay $1,000 for an ER to be checked for 10 minutes that I would have hesitated to go again for a similar issue. \n\nI guess I\u2019m saying don\u2019t feel too badly. I definitely understand why you wouldn\u2019t go, and I\u2019m really sorry it turned out the way it did. If anything, reading your story makes me feel less guilty about heading to the ER, and perhaps more likely to be safe than sorry if it crops up again but something feels worse. \n\nHaven\u2019t had a migraine since I stopped using nasal pots, so keeping my fingers crossed. \n\n\n",

You need to step outside yourself and ask, \"If this were happening to (person you care about), what would I have them do?\"  Answer that honestly and you'll make better decisions.\n\nI had about 57 varieties of blood clots in my lungs and lungular region, and decided I didn't want to go to the ER.

            "Yeah, recently diagnosed with stage 4 hodgkin's lymphoma after dealing with 7 months of a confluence of symptoms that never were bad enough for any red alert hospital visits. It started with just general shitty fatigue, and then progressed into some pain in my back and right hip. It was months of orthopedic doctors, physical therapy, being told they aren't really sure what's going on, a general sciatica diagnosis and then me figuring well shit, I guess this is just sciatica and it fucking sucks.\n\nWent to my gastroenterologist for something unrelated about 6 months into this, and lo and fucking behold I'd gone from about 6 foot 1 and 170 pounds to 135. I was blown away naturally, I'm a 25 year old who figured he was reasonably healthy. Blood tests  initially were normal, and they continued to take more. Eventually my white blood cells were high as hell and the doctor ordered a cat scan on my head, chest, and pelvic region. Turns out I had sclerotic lesions, or tumours over most of my spine and pelvis.\n\nAlso, at this point the pain I was in was also approaching pretty much the worst I'd ever experienced. Agonizing, excruciating spasms through my muscles, deep throbbing bone pain.\n\nSo then that ends up with me having to get a bone biopsy, which my experience with my first one is probably relatable to your angiogram as the medication that was supposed to put me into a twilight sleep did *literally* nothing to me in the pain I was in, and was fucking excruciating itself having to get your damn bone drilled. \n\nHad to be admitted to the hospital after the procedure because I was tachycardic to the point of being at a hot 140 bpm normally fluctuating up to 160 bpm here depending on the pain.\n\nBasically spent two weeks there, at one point being on a drip of 4mg of dilaudid an hour with every 2 hour having to get 4mg push shots as well. I got on a cocktail of meds, and the initial bone biopsy didn't show enough information because some of the cells were crushed, so I went back down and got a dual biopsy from both sides of my illiac bones, this time giving me propofol, which worked a hell of a lot better then the fentanyl and versed.\n\nThen I got discharged after they were able to get me a diagnosis of stage 4 hodgkin's, which thankfully is still treatable *and* curable, even though it sounds scary and it's a garbage situation, I'm with you on the never giving up and staying strong and positive through whatever.\n\nFinished my first cycle of chemo a week ago, it's not nearly as bad as it could be, and hopefully in 2 months my first scan will be positive enough with the reduction of my cancer that I can continue with normal chemo instead of discussing alternative treatments.\n\nThe moral of all this besides just being mildly therapeutic typing it out, is that sometimes you just end up in a fucking shit situation without it really being your fault in terms of advocating for your health. Through my attempts to figure it out, life kind of delayed a diagnosis for awhile. Nobody would have thought a month or two in to order anything beyond X Rays for hip and back pain, so ultimately like the original story sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't, but always at least try to advocate for your health and sometimes it works out!

You gave your all to this profession and even when you have a serious medical condition, you're looking for ways to continue doing as much as you can in that field. You should be really proud of that.\n\nI do get how you get pride and enjoyment out of the actual physical work, but being willing to step aside for the sake of your health and others' safety is an admirable thing. And at 29, you seem to have already put so much into it and now you have the opportunity to see the other sides of it. It may not be the best, but it's great that you are taking the opportunity and having such a positive outlook on it. \n\nIt's especially remarkable that you're trying to do your share (and maybe more, by the sounds of things haha) of work rather than something like collecting disability.

You're right that objectively you should have gone sooner, but males have the idea that we need to be strong, stoic, tough and all that comes with that drilled into us from a young age by society. Although I don't work in the field, I feel like that's probably especially true in places like construction, where a lot of men pride themselves on being strong  and \"masculine,\" and shrug off injuries because that's what they're told men do.\n\nNow you know for the future, but for now you have your life, you have what sounds like an incredible fiance, you have parents who love you and you have a job that I'm sure you'll do phenomenal at.

My dad discovered he had epilepsy at the age of 43, while driving a semi with a 53 foot trailer on the highway.  He had his first seizure and took the truck (mostly empty) down an embankment.  He broke 5 vertebrae and bit a pretty nasty gash in his tongue.  It took over a year to recover from triple spinal fusion surgery, he couldn't have his class A CDL anymore, and his mental health took a pretty big toll because driving in some form or fashion was pretty much all he had done between 1985 and 2007.  He still had his non-commercial but was advised by the neurologists not to drive even his own car for a year.  He eventually got a warehouse job working for the same company but he was never even remotely close to the same again.

",
            "Thanks for taking the time to write your story and best wishes for the future. In regards to your closing point about you knowing your body more than anyone. 22yrs ago, about ten days after having my son, I was in a taxi that ran, very slowly, over a speed bump. I felt a sharp pain in my back but tried to ignore it as I was full of the joy of new motherhood. Over the next 10 - 14 days the pain became incrementally more intense. By this time I was in unbelievably excruciating pain. I visited my doctor's surgery frequently, called the maternity unit in floods of very desperate tears and even paid for a chiropractor, who I called in the middle of the night, again in tears and desperation. He was very kind, but sadly no good. Everyone kept telling me that it was normal to have back pain after childbirth and it didn't matter how much I pleaded 'This is not normal!'. My GP gave me weak painkillers and tried to get me to take antidepressants. I have to say, at this point the pain I was experiencing was so off the scale. I couldn't understand how I could experience this without passing out. I was also terrified! I mean really terrified. I then decided I had to take myself to A&E, as no one was listening to me. Yet another nightmare. I had to call an ambulance as I was the only driver in the house and my partner stayed home with the baby. The paramedics were kind, at first. Once in the ambulance they coerced me into lying down, even though I told them it was too painful for me. I'd spent the last couple of weeks sleeping upright on the couch to lessen the chances of my back going into spasm, as that, honestly, meant terror beyond my wildest dreams. When they moved me the pain began and I still don't know to this day how they couldn't see the pain and fear in my eyes! They eventually got me to the hospital, but of course, again I couldn't move. So they used a slip/slide board to get me onto the bed. My back crunched into spasm and I couldn't cry out because that would be too, too painful. After a short while (for the NHS) a doctor attended. She asked to examine my back and I refused. I did try to explain, how my back was still in spasm and that I was terrified. She just left the cubicle. A few hours later a nurse returned and told me I had been discharged... because I wouldn't let the doctor examine me. It was about 3am... Luckily a very kind friend came and got me home. This went on for six weeks and the pain just got worse and worse. Finally I begged /persuaded my GP to send me for an X-ray (I think he only did it to shut me up). At the hospital, after the X-ray, the lovely doctor asked me to lie down so he could administer morphine. I can't lie down!!! He then proceeded to inform me that I had multiple fractures in my spine and had advanced osteoporosis, in fact my bones where like that of an 80 Yr old woman and my spine was crumbling (they even threw in 'possible bone cancer) - I was 31 and had a six week old baby! In the long term the fractures healed (but with a lot of permanent deformity) and with the right care and treatment the osteoporosis has improved somewhat. But I have been left with PTSD, severe chronic pain, disability and a deep distrust of so called 'medical professionals'. But worst of all, a deep foreboding fear of what yet is to become of me. But finally, in the words of the OP, 'No one knows your body like you'. Trust your instincts. ",
            "Recognizing Stroke symptoms can save your life. I have a very similar story although it has a sort of plot twist ending.\n\nI was with my fiance in college about 5 years ago in her dorm room. We were sitting there talking right before finals when she asked me a question. \"Can you bite over your upper lip with your jaw?\" And I was like...yea, everyone can i'm pretty sure, what a weird question. She told me she couldn't do it but thought she could and couldn't figure out why. I told her that was weird. She started to talk about it some more when I noticed her speech started to slur. I got startled and pointed it out and once she realized she was doing it, she got confused and worried. I suddenly remembered what I read online and I asked her to smile for me. When she looked me in the face and only half of her smile was up, I knew something was wrong. I did another check where I asked her to stand up and put both her arms in the air and she could only put one arm all the way up and the other she couldn't pull up above her shoulders no matter how hard she tried.\n\nI immediately recognized the stroke symptoms (She was about 25 at the time) and called for an ambulance. It was the most intense surreal moment i've ever had. I've never had a moment like it. Her symptoms started to get worse. Her face started to droop on one side, and she said she couldn't blink and her vision was blurry in one eye and she couldn't feel much of that entire side of her face. So I kept getting more worried and worried until the ambulance arrived.\n\nWhen they got there, I kept my composure until she got into the Ambulance when I started to break down freaking out. Their immediate diagnosis was that it was an allergic reaction because she was reacting fine and her memory and thoughts weren't garbled or anything. She wasn't confused. I had to reschedule all my class finals and call her family. It was such a horrific situation to make those phone calls.\n\nTo kind of make a longer story short, what ended up happening was I rode with the ambulance to the hospital, the guy was really cool. Was just screaming and telling me how much bullshit cars on the road were and that they never move for ambulances. Funny stuff, kept me distracted from what was happening. I arrived at the ambulance and was told I had to go to the waiting room until she was stable or diagnosed and mainly until family got there to allow me to come in. I was in the waiting from for hours until her step dad who worked at the hospital came and sat with me to discuss what was happening. I then was allowed to go into the waiting room after a little while longer when I asked what was going on.\n\nShe didn't have a stroke, What she has was a rare condition called Bells Palsy. If my memory serves me right. It's caused by a sore or infection, viral or bacterial, that finds it's way up to your brain through weakened face muscles/bones and literally shuts off a front part of your brain. A literal disorder that causes stroke symptoms without the stroke. To this day, my anxiety gets the better of me and I still smile constantly to make sure it's not happening to me lol.\n\nBut a little update. 5 years later she's fine. She had to wear an eye patch over the effected side and had to use a cane and went to physical therapy to recover her senses and strength. Bells Palsy effects people different but most cases people make a complete recovery back to where they were. ONly in super rare cases does any of the symptoms remain permanent. She swears that she still has tasting problems (she couldn't taste or eat solid food for months) and that she's still missing some mobility and feelings in her body but you couldn't even tell she had it by looking at her.\n\nBasically I wanted to share this story because it did involve stroke symptoms to an extent. Don't ignore these symptoms. Call a doctor immediately. Recognize the symptoms like I did. If she had happen to have a stroke, I think my reaction and realization in a timely manner would have reduced many of the risks associated with not getting help right away. ",

            "I am so glad you\u2019re doing better now! I have the same kind of luck, except I get injured, not sick or go through something like you did. Unlucky enough to end up seriously hurt, lucky enough that it wasn\u2019t worse like it should have. A couple years ago, I had just gotten word that I had been rehired at a horse camp for the summer that I LOVED working at, only to loose my balance trying to get on a motorcycle one of my moms coworkers so generously offered to take me for a ride on. Broke my leg in four places and had my wrist crushed \u201clike styrofoam or a crouton\u201d as my doctor put it. Ended up in a cast for three months, costing me that summer job, but luckily I didn\u2019t need any therapy. Last summer I ended up getting hit by a suv doing 40-50 mph while I was on my bike. Driver sped off and I never got their license plate. Someone else (who was ironically an ER nurse) pulled over and checked me over for a concussion and graciously drove my sweaty bloody butt the 10 miles back to where I had parked my truck. I drove back to where I had left my bike, which had fared MUCH better than I did (frame was undamaged, but the fork and front rim needed to be replaced), drove to my grandparents house because it was the closest place I could think of. Once the shock started wearing off, I had a really hard time breathing, my right arm was swollen to an enormous size, my head was killing me, and my wrist was throbbing. Ended up at the hospital, where I found out I had three broken ribs (one was very close to popping out of place and puncturing my lung), the rest were severely bruised, there was a hematoma in my right elbow (hence the swelling), the headache and neck pains were whiplash, and my wrist was severely sprained. Both my primary care doctor and the er doctor said I shouldn\u2019t be alive, much less be able to stand up and walk away from that. \n\nAfter that, I will never not go to the hospital when something doesn\u2019t feel right. After such a life altering shitstorm you\u2019ve been through and the subsequent changes in life, have you thought about seeing a therapist? I\u2019m not suggesting that you need one, but I am very much the same way. Blue collar worker at an industrial waste water facility. If I don\u2019t go home at the end of the day soaking wet, covered in sludge, and covered in sweat and blood, I didn\u2019t do my job right. If I had that taken away from me, I\u2019d be really fucked up and in a really dark place. Losing that camp job did it to me and if I had to make such a drastic change like that now, oh boy. \n\nTake care of yourself and love every day you have. I\u2019ve come to appreciate everything in life, even the shitty days.",

Went to my mum's place to see if she can help (She is a nurse), she said \"Let's go to hospital, just in case\". When we arrived into hospital, we went to reception, and she just said words that nearly made me fall \"Possible Stroke\". Doctors, nurses, all came running out (keep in mind I was 21 when this happened), and me just standing there like a statue.\n\nResult: Ended up being something called Bell's Palsy.

            "When i was 19 i got to major blood clots in my lungs. Woke up in the morning having a hard time breathing,, but i didn't think any of it because i used sleeping pills which sometimes could give those symptoms if i topklasse them really late or if i didn't move around much during sleep. I continued my day but it didn't get any better so i went to my PCP at 3 pm. She took my blood pressure and looked really concerned and measured it again. My mom was with me and the doc looked at her and asked if she could drive me to the hospital tight away. I didn't realize what was going on until a doctor at the hospital came in with a ultrasound device and told me what they suspected. \n\n\nI was unbelievable lucky. I pretty much walked away from it. It could easily have killed me if a smaller clot traveled up to my brain. I also dont have any permanent damage.

I know all too well about the feelings involved.\n\nSimilar situation happened to me at the tender age of 13, when I was camping with family and friends during the summer of 2003. Pretty normal stuff- running around, playing tag. I noticed as I was running around that I kept dropping things out of my left hand, and my only thoughts being \"huh thats weird\". Fast forward later that day, and I'm trying to play my cousins Gameboy, and I noticed increased dificulty trying to press the D-pad- again, \"weird\"\n\nI ended up throwing up a bunch that night and telling my parents about it the following morning. They didn't seem overly concerned at the time, and told me they'd keep their eye on it. That was okay with me, as I felt fine.\n\nI ended up going to my cousins house that night, despite being overly uncoordinated, even joking with him that \"I must be having a stroke or some shit\". I wasn't wrong. \n\nThe following morning I called my parents to tell them I was having trouble putting on my jeans, as my left hand wasnt cooperating. My parents picked me up, and went we went straight to the local hospital. My visit turned into a two week stay, with multiple MRIs, CT scans, and an angioplasty. Turns out I suffered a brainstem stroke, leaving my whole left side affected.\n\nI could go into more detail, but I'm on my phone, and I only type with one hand. The effects are still lingering even after 14 years, but I've learned to live with them. As minor as they seem from the outside (I hide it well) they can still cause daily struggles, mentally, or physically.\n\n",

They are also harder to realize you\u2019re having because the normal signs of stroke such as facial dropping and limb numbness don\u2019t always come with a hemorrhagic stroke and often a head ache and fatigue are the only signs you get. If you get a sudden head ache that isn\u2019t normal and you just don\u2019t feel right CALL 911. It can save your life. \n\nAs soon as I read the word head ache and saw your age I was like \u201coh shit... this is gonna be a messy stroke.\u201d I\u2019m very glad it didn\u2019t end up worse for you. Kudos on your recovery so far. I\u2019m really impressed your language skills are at the level they are currently. After reading your description of the stroke I would not expect your language to be where it is. You are super lucky to be where you are today. I hope your seizures are getting controlled so you can continue rehabilitation and moving forward. I know it sucks that your life has changed forever, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s over. It sounds like you have a good support system to help you through it. Good luck on your recovery and keep trucking along with therapy. You will continue to get better for years to come as long as you\u2019re working for it (even if the doctors try to tell you otherwise after a year.) \n\nI\u2019m in my last year of graduate school to be a rehabilitation speech language pathologist so I kind of nerded out over this a little, sorry for the book of a comment! This internet stranger is proud of you though! ",
            "My brother had almost the same thing happen to him when he was about 27,i believe. One day he woke up with a head ache and the next thing we know he has a full on massive seizure.  The doctors told him the same thing they told you and he continues to struggle with pain from his surgery (something about the nerves in the incision not connecting right) and seizures. He's not able to work at the moment because stress gives him seizures and he's trying to work with his docs to find the right cocktail of drugs. You're not alone buddy!\nBest of luck! ",

            "Thank you for sharing your story. I'm not going to lie, I was in tears reading what you went through and some of the comments.\n\nMarch 1 my 37-year-old husband collapsed and couldn't move the left side of his body. I called my brother, who is a doctor, and he said to hang up and dial 911 immediately. We were at the hospital within 20 minutes. While the ER doctors were not sure that he had a stroke, he was given TPA, a drug that when given within 2 hours of having a stroke can drastically reduce the impact. We were moved to ICU for observation and were told by the neurologist on call that he likely had a seizure -- his symptoms were very weird, he would have an episode where he would start yawning, become drenched in sweat, and then completely lose the ability to move the left side of his body, but then after a period of time he would be able to move again. He had seven of these episodes and after the final one, he didn't regain mobility. It was only then that the neurologist started to take his case seriously and not assume that he was a drug addict. The next morning they took him for a CT scan at 7am and at 1pm we received the news that he did indeed have a stroke. NOTHING in life can prepare you for such news. I was in total shock and even now, 8 months later, I still can't believe this happened. \n\nHe was in ICU for about a week and then completed out patient physical and occupational therapy. Thankfully he's almost back to \"normal\" but suffers from severe depression. When our team of doctors couldn't determine the cause of the stroke, we were referred to Stanford. They were also unable to determine the cause.\n\nA long, happy, healthy life is not guaranteed. Tell the people you love that you love them. Be thankful for the time that you do have and make it meaningful. \n\nI wish you well in everything to come.",

            "Slightly different, but one of my siblings in-laws hit his head really hard. He was really drunk and either passed out and hit his head or stumbled while drunk. Woke up with a massive black eye and a splitting headache. Wrote it off as a hangover (or maybe he was too embarrassed) and didn't go to the doctor the next day. On the second day, he threw up and his wife said \"that's it, we're getting you to the hospital.\" By the time she got her things together to get out the door, he lost consciousness. He never woke up. He left behind a wife and two young children.\n\nObjectively speaking, the whole thing could have so easily been prevented, and to be honest, *should* have been. And, objectively speaking, it was negligent on their part to not go to the hospital. That's what makes the whole thing so tragic. The hardest thing his wife will have to do is come to terms with that fact. I say this not to rag on them or judge them (it's not my place, and it's far too tragic), but to show how vitally important to get to the doctor for head trauma. The margins are so small, the time is so short, and the consequences for oneself are life and death, but for the people one leaves behind, is the death *and* the trauma that they could have and should have done something. \n\nI'm glad you made it, buddy.

        "selftext": "My wife has very bad endometriosis and we\u2019ve struggled with infertility since we started trying to have kids about 6 years ago. We\u2019ve been super lucky to have 1 baby through in vitro fertilization and we are in the middle of trying for a second that way. \nThis involves a shitload of fertility drugs. One of those drugs is an estrogen supplement she has to take vaginally. \n\nInfertility really messed with our sex life, especially at the beginning. The past few years though, we\u2019ve worked really hard on getting that spark back. Thanks to IVF, sex isn\u2019t for baby making anymore, it\u2019s for connecting with each other and having a grand old time. So we get it on a few times a week and it\u2019s fantastic. Because of our fertility issues, this guy hasn\u2019t used a condom in 6 years. \n\nI\u2019m usually a pretty happy guy. The past few weeks though, I was in what has to be the worst mood anyone has ever had. I had a raging headache, wanted to cry every 5 minutes and had so much irrational rage about everything. My wife is obviously concerned and asks what the hell is happening to me. I\u2019m concerned about myself to and we try to figure out why I was in such a terrible mood. Then we finally realized our fuck up. \n\nShe has been taking her estrogen supplement before we go upstairs for bed where we usually have some sexy time a few times a week before going to bed. Since I haven\u2019t been wearing a condom my penis has basically been taking an estrogen bath several times a week and we think I\u2019ve been absorbing the estrogen through my penis. I\u2019ve been wearing a condom (boooo) for about a week now and I am pretty much back to my normal happy self. On a side note, I have a whole new understanding of the pure hell she goes through just to give us a chance at having another baby. \n\n\ntl;dr - my wife has been taking estrogen supplements vaginally and I accidentally took them penis-ally without realizing it\n\nEdit: wow I never had a post blow up this much. \n\nFor everyone going through infertility or dealing with endometriosis - know that you\u2019re not alone and it\u2019s awesome to be able to talk about it with others. Find a good support system even if it\u2019s strangers on the internet. \n\nFor everyone leaving mean comments, I\u2019m sorry if you don\u2019t agree with my and my wife\u2019s life choices. Try to have a little empathy and grace for other people when you have zero idea what they\u2019ve been through. Yes adoption is a fantastic option. We went down that path for 2 years through both private adoption and through the foster care system. I wish it was as easy as everyone in here seems to think it is, because if it was, we would have adopted a long time ago. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. We have a heart for the foster system and when we have the space we plan on fostering along with raising our own kids.",

            "This sort of reminds me of a story. I'm a vet and I once had a very sweet client with a pittie mix puppy that he absolutely adored. One day, he called saying his year-ish old puppy had attacked him randomly as he passed through a doorway and he needed to board him for a few days as he was rattled.\n\nThey come in and both of these fellows look heartbroken. Dad is crying openly and has bandages on his arm and pittie boy looks depressed and jumpy. Neither are the smiling pair we're accustomed to. We tell dad we want to look the guy over and run some blood work. Dad just wants his dog back to normal so agrees. \n\nWe observe this dog and he's not himself. Hyper, growly. We send off blood work which looks largely normal, but the change was so sudden, we still suspect a toxin. Ask dad repeatedly if he could have gotten into anything at the house? Nope, he knows not to leave things around a puppy would chew on. Any pills he could have stolen? Nope, dad was an athlete and pretty healthy. Is anyone in the household on any medication at all? Well, dad thinks hard and says that he did some semi-professional wrestling in his youth and because of some steroid usage now needs testosterone, but he doesn't leave it sitting around and takes it topically. \n\nLight bulb! Topically? Would there be any chance the dog has contact? Dad says, well, I put it on my upper arm and shoulder area before bed, and dog sleeps with me and licks my arm to wake me in the morning. We ask the lab to run a testosterone level and it's wicked high. Issue fixed, Dad puts the cream in an area the dog never touches, happy family resumes. It's actually been one of my most satisfying cases to solve.",

            "So I had a hysterectomy 3 years ago and right after the surgery, I needed testosterone to restart my own production of it. I still had one ovary but needed to supplement my own hormones by taking prescription hormones.  Well, my husband also happens to have low testosterone, so he started using prescription testosterone cream. So a normal woman's testosterone level is under 65 ( forgive me for I can't remember the exact measurements of how it's tested, I just know where my number needs to be) and anything over that isn't good for a woman. Where as a man, their range of testosterone can go as high as like 800+! So it's a huge jump in testosterone levels.\nWell, he had been taking it at night, right before we go to bed. We always snuggle and take time to talk and just hold each other before bed. Well, I'm on quite a few medications that require frequent blood testing to ensure that my levels are within normal range. So a month or two passes and I noticed that I was losing hair at an alarming rate. Everytime I would run my fingers through my hair I would end up with a wad of hair in my hands. I started getting so worried because I love my hair, it's curly and easy to take care of and I lost so much hair, it had to have been at least a third of my hair was gone. So this was a huge amount of hair that I lost! I got to a point  where I was scared to touch my head for fear of my hair falling out, that's how bad it was.\nI got so worried, I asked my doc for a hormone test, she agreed that the hair loss was worrisome. She suspected that I may have been taking too much of my own testosterone cream.\nWhen the results came back, I had double the amount of testosterone that I was supposed to have! It was all because he was applying it before we went to bed. So, he started taking it on the morning and I ended up quiting my testosterone cream and now my hair is coming back and everything's good. So please be careful with prescription hormones!!",

            "Boy, do I feel you... \n\nI'm a woman with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) and for anyone who doesn't know what that it is, it's essentially a hormonal nightmare. MOST women with the condition have a number of little cysts on their ovaries (contrary to the name, not ALL women with the disorder actually have cysts). This causes bad acne, male pattern hair growth all over the body, weight gain, a deeper voice, and usually just an overall increase in testosterone levels. I also started hitting puberty hella early, so my hormones have literally been out of wack since I was 10 years old. I was in middle school and growing a beard faster than any boy in my class. \n\nAt 17, my doctor tried putting me on a birth control pill to hopefully help balance out the hormones by adding in an estrogen supplement. That wasn't working, so I tried switching birth controls to see if we could figure out the right estrogen dosing (pill to patch, etc). Still no luck. At 22 I went to see an endocrinologist who put me on a spironolactone prescription (Hormone Replacement Therapy) which was about as useful as an ashtray on a motorcycle. He basically said \"sorry, you're just hairy\" as if the underlying cause wasn't still there. \n\nI'm 26 today, and still look/feel/sound like a Wild Beast, and have had absolutely ZERO luck with any medical solutions. While it may suck to have the physical effects of a hormone imbalance, the worst is undoubtedly the mental effects. The moods just never get better, and I am constantly a ticking time bomb. At this point, I've been painted over with the bipolar paintbrush instead of trying to correct my moods hormonally. Being a woman is WAY fucking harder than men can make it out to be (I don't want to sound *glad* for what you went through, but I am so relieved that a male finally experienced what it's like to want to cry for absolutely no reason, all the time. It really isn't our fault!)",

Home study and classes and possibly years of sitting on a wait list to have a birth mother pick you as the one. And many birth mothers have unrealistic ideals of the parents they want for their child. If you don't fit that little cookie cutter image you can sit on that list indefinitely. And foster care is hard. These kids are often seriously physically and mentally abused. They are often older kids. Some with extreme behavioral issues. Some are violent. They act out the things they have seen and have had done to them. And before I get shit I whole hearted believe that every child deserves love and a good home. But most families do nit have the training needed to work with these kids. They cannot handle them when they act out. And sadly many older kids get sent back to foster homes.

I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.\n\nWell the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can't find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn't think much of it.\n\nFast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I'm still nervous that I'm on a watchlist now.\n\nTL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.\n\nEdit: here's the investigator's card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. I covered up personal info so I don't dox him or myself. \nhttps://i.imgur.com/fFFw7CX.jpg",

        "selftext": "Ok So my daughter has this one guy friend since 6th grade, who has always been coming over to our place. I think in ninth grade she told us that he's gay, honestly never got the impression that he was.\n\n I mean sometimes you can absolutely tell when a guy is gay without even really knowing him. Anyways we went to  a little trip in the forest, usually when we go on such trips, my daughter takes one of her good friends with her. This time she wanted her guy friend to come with us.  \n\nWe had a great time in the forest and had planned to sleep over at a hostel. My wife and I slept in one room and my daughter and her friend slept in different rooms. I was ready to go to bed, when my daughter asked if she was allowed to, go out with her friend a little and just walk around in the area.\n\n It was already late but I said yes. I actually wanted to stay awake and wait for them to come back, but unfortunately I fell asleep. I woke up at 1am and wanted to check if they had returned safely. So I knocked on my daughters door, no response .\n\nI opened the door, she wasn't in her room and I started to panick. I immediately went to her friends room, knocked and there was also no response so I walked in. The room is kind of seperated , so when you come in you don't immediatly see the bed or anything, it's like a little hallway. So at this point I could already hear noises, not necessarily moaning but yeah noises. And I don't know why but my mind couldn't process this and I just went in further. \n\nI was standing there, it was dark so I didn't see them, naked. I kinda had a WTF moment and said eww what are you guys doing. Really didn't mean to say that.  My daughter screamed  that I should get out, and , I said I thought he's gay, and just walked away. This morning I woke up and both of them had gone home. I guess that means more quality time with my wife.\n\nTL;DR \nDaughter always said her guy friend is gay, but I caught them doing the nasty while we were on a trip, and they both went home.\n\nFor those of you wondering my daughter is 17 and her friend is 18.\n\n\nEdit: I just took a nap, and woke up to 19000 upvotes and so many comments, like I was wondering why is my phone vibrating so much. \n\nAnyways I'm still at the hostel with my wife . I was on the phone with my daughter , and she told me that he isn't gay. Y'all and guess what!!. They have been dating for TWO DAMN Years. ( In september is their 2 years anniversary, so 1 year and 10 months idk) If you do the maths, two years ago my daughter, was in ninth grade, and that's when she told us he's gay. Everything makes sense now. But think about it, they hid it for TWO GODDAMN YEARS.\n\n\nEdit 2: A lot of y'all have been asking why my daughter was hiding the fact that they were dating. She told me, that she didn't think the relationship is goint to last this long, and since the guy is sort of a family friend, they would have ruined it, if they would have broken up in a matter of a few weeks, but told us about the relationship, because then it would be akward for him to come over. 6 months in, they actually wanted to tell us, but it was always the excuse :,, yeah we're going to tell them next dinner\". My daughter actually pointed out all the hints they made, for us to figure it out on our own. I missed all lol. And her saying that he's gay, well  you guys know why. She felt like there had been too much lying involved, to tell us so yeah.\n\nEdit: Ok that's the last edit, I need to go to work. But the reason, why I'm not mad at her is, just think about it we've all been teenagers at some point and did atleast some sort of sneaky thing. I met my wife when I was 15, and my wife lied about going to a girls sleepover, but she always slept over at my place. So yeah that's our daughter she took our sneaky genes.",

We use to live close to each other and I visited her hime very VERY often to do homework, talk shit and pass the time. \n\nShe had a Wii so we would sometimes go play in her room (doors open) and whenever the mom got home she would go \"No being in the room, out!\". Her mom loved me to the point were she wouldn't let her daughter outside if it wasn't with me 'cause she trusted me, but you know... A guy and a girl alone in a room, I didn't \"like\" her like that but I get where her mom was coming from. \n\nTime passes, we graduate and I move out of the country.

I didn't know that myself! \n\nGuess how she found out? \nShe had a best (female) friend that used to visit her all the time, they would lock themselves inside the room and do all kinds of things!

        "selftext": "TL;DR: Got caught going to brown town on my wife by my 4 year old daughter because I didn't lock the door.\n\nThis happened literally 10 minutes ago. I'm dying laughing. My wife is mortified.\n\nMy wife and I haven't had a whole lot of alone time recently. Our 4 year old hasn't been sleeping well and comes to our bed to snuggle and sleep with us most nights. Tonight, after a few glasses of wine, we decide that tonight is the night. We tell our daughter to leave our room, and shut the door on the way out. I did NOT however, tell her to lock it.\n\nShenanigans begin. Now, I like eating my wife's ass. It's just what I do. After a few minutes of getting to business, my wife starts frantically hitting me on the head and shouting, \"Babe babe babe!!\" I look up from my wife's thighs and see our 4 year old, LITERALLY IN BED WITH US, laughing her ass off, and the first words out of her mouth are, \"Why is daddy sniffing your butt??\" I immediately extracate myself from the situation, roll over, and die laughing into my pillow.\n\nAbout this time, our 18 year old walks up to our bedroom door to check in on the situation. My wife and I, both clearly naked under the sheets, are dying laughing as our 4 year old reports to her big sister, \"I saw daddy kissing mommy's butt!\" Our eldest knows exactly what just happened and she herself starts dying of laughter in the doorway. A mixture of humor and terror overtake my wife, and finally she gives in and starts laughing her ass off. We eventually banish our little gremlin back to her bedroom and our eldest makes popcorn and goes back to her room.\n\nI'm lying here with my wife right now, laughing our asses off, drinking wine, and watching \"Veep\" for the 50th time.\n\nEdit: We are about 30 minutes out of the.... Incident. My wife is freaking out thinking what our daughter is going to tell her daycare teacher tomorrow. She keeps rubbing her forehead saying, \"I can't believe what just happened.\"\n\nEdit next morning: Haha, my wife (also on Reddit) is floored by these comments. Little one has not brought it up again... Yet.\n\nEdit again: You wanna eat ass? Read. Posted this as a reply to another post but probably good for the general populace.\n\nI agree, it's a weird concept. The first time I went all the way down was with one of my first girlfriends in college and of course we were both drunk as skunks. She was naked with that caboose in the air, and I thought \"Fuck it. Time to get to business.\" And... damn. Anybody who reads this, and I've said it before.... Eating ass isn't eating shit!!  Take your hand, make a fist, and lick the center. That's what eating ass tastes like. It tastes like NOTHING. It's just skin. If it tastes like shit... I'm sorry, you got a nasty woman who can't wipe properly.  I'm not trying to brag, but my woman is a fucking smoke show and will get it day or night.\n\nOk maybe bragging a little bit.",

Plus, we were staying in the bedroom right above my parents' room, and my mom was making comments about how noisy the new Pergo floor was up there and how she could hear *everything* before we so much as set our bags down after we got there. \n\nOne afternoon, my parents are gone and the boy is napping, and my wife and I go to the TV room for some privacy. She's on my lap, facing me, and we are going to town well enough that I didn't notice the door open until a tiny hand grabbed my ballsack while trying to figure out why it was bouncing around. \n\nI yelped, my wife yelled and almost knocked him over getting off of me, he broke down in tears... that was the end of the fun for that day.",

        "selftext": "Standard \u2013 this did not happen today. Actually a few years back.\n\nSo, when my then gf and I started dating, I discovered early on that she can be quite physical. In the sense that she likes to push, hold, punch even. Bare in mind she is not actually trying to hurt me, she is just playful like that. I found this both adorable and fun, so I played along.\n\nAnd here is the fuck up\u2026 If she pushed me, I would act like I had to balance myself, or if the bed/sofa was nearby I would fall onto it. If she held me, I would pretend that it was difficult for me to get out of her grip. If I pushed her and she resisted, I would pretend it was hard work, same with me holding her arms etc. You get the idea.\n\nI always assumed she knew I was playing along and not actually physically straining myself to compete with her strength. This went on for months.\n\nOne day, we were chilling on the sofa, watching a show when I realised, I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I need to shower and make a move, she decided this was a good time for a playfight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and \u201cstruggled\u201d to move her off me. A little more \u2018wrestling\u2019 took place, with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold/push me back onto the sofa. Eventually I decided I need to \u2018win\u2019 this little fight and get going. So, I got her onto her back, held her hands near her head and leant down to kiss her on the cheeks a few times and let her know again that I am running late.\n\nShe tried to move her arms and could not. Whilst struggling she grunted out. \u2018Why are you so strong today.\u2019\n\nI laughed (fuck up No2) and looked at her like she was joking.\n\nHer eyes went wide with comprehension and she stopped struggling. \u2018You are always this strong?\u2019 She asked, almost to herself.\n\n\u2018Come on babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you?\u2019 I replied.\n\nI then went to take a shower, got ready and as I was heading out the door, I noticed that she might have been a little glum. Me, being fully aware that I do not fully comprehend the mystery of female emotions, had no clue why she was upset. I did what all men do, I guessed. I gave her a kiss and said I won\u2019t be gone for long and that I can pick up her favourite Chinese on the way back. I assumed she was upset about me not spending the afternoon with her.\n\nNo reply. Fuck up No3 \u2013 I should have spent some time talking it through. I instead went on my merry way and had a great fucking time with my friends. She spent the next few hours brewing, simmering, seething, and of course overthinking.\n\nI came home with the Chinese and as soon as I put it down on the dining table, she sprung out of the corner and attacked me. It genuinely surprised me and I reacted by bear hugging her to my chest. She struggled with more force than she normally would and I just held her, I kept asking what was wrong. She gritted her teeth and said. \u2018You lied to me.\u2019 Eventually she stopped trying to fight me and I let her go. She then told me how she feels like I lied to her about our \u2018fights\u2019 and that really all the time I was laughing at her in my head as I pretended that she was actually winning.\n\nI tried to take the conversation seriously, but come on, how the fuck am I supposed to take this seriously. So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.\n\nA week later she broke up with me. FML\n\nTL;DR I pretended my girlfriend and I we were of equal strength.\n\nEdit 1. Haha this got a lot more attention than I was expecting!\n\nFirstly, there's a lot of she's so \"stupid\", \"crazy\" \"insane\" etc...it's a bit mean. Yeah, she reacted errmm drastically but overall she is a good person.\n\nSecondly, it's shocking how polarizing the comments are. There's a lot of comments along the lines of \"How the fuck did she not know\" and honestly loads of comments from both guys and girls about how girls can be surprised when they first realise the difference in raw strength.\n\nBig shout out to  [u/starbrightstar](https://www.reddit.com/u/starbrightstar) for her comment. It's one of the top comments, and rightly so.",

She Was dealing with addiction issues and had just about given up all hope.  She had been couchsurfing and hooking for drug money before she moved in with us.  She was actually shooting coke, which is probably more deadly than heroin as it's super easy to go into seizures and OD on,  She had been in the ER 3 times already in the last 18 months preceding this incident..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  We had gotten her enrolled in outpatient treatment and she had been clean for about two weeks when I came home one day and found her in my master bedroom trying to find a vein with a syringe.  She jumped up off the bed and tried to run to the bathroom and I grabbed her by the arm she was using to hold the syringe and jerked her towards me and i easily took the syringe out of her hands.  I then let her go and she just freaked and locked herself in the bathroom and started yelling and screaming and crying.  I called my wife and told her what was going on and asked her to hurry home.  My wife finally came home and after talking to her through the door for an hour finally got her to come out.  Now I have always been a big teddy  bear and am never violent but apparently she was terrified of me because I had so easily taken the syringe away from her while she was trying to fight me off.  My wife assured her that I would never have tried to hurt her but she was very wary of me until she finally got completely clean. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Later after getting clean she told me that incident was what tipped her over to really getting clean.  I asked how so? She said that she knew that if I could have fought her off so easily then she knew she would end up dead on the streets if she kept using.  She said she had physical fights with other men but had always managed to fight them off and run away and with me she was utterly at my mercy,  and that she would eventually run into someone else who did the same but was actually intent on hurting her.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood news is,  she just got her 5 year chip and has a good job,  and I'm still her favorite cousin!",

This year she had messed up her foot, and was wearing a \"boot.\" After I cut the tree down, I grabbed one of the lowest branches and start hauling it all by myself.

            "I had a similar situation. My girlfriend had been taking kickboxing and some minor self-defense type classes. I would always compliment her on her progress, and we would play fight as you talked about as well. Months of this went by. She was getting in better shape than she had ever been. Stronger than ever. One night we were heading back from a bar and walking back up to our apartment. She was punching me in the arm, and after a few hits to the same spot, it hurts. I asked her to stop. She said something like, \"I could kick your ass if I want.\" I told her that we would never find out because I wouldn't want to hurt her. \n\nShe pressed it and tried pushing me and provoking, still playing, but being very rough. I just grabbed her wrist and put her arm behind her back without much effort and she instantly deflated. She was very hurt at the rude awakening. We have had long talks since. It basically boiled down to how she understands a little more about why I get worried sometimes when she is out late alone or going to a rough neighborhood. That not all men are cool. It was a really sad talk to have. We didn't fight over anything. She just didn't realize the strength difference between her and myself. \n\nI have gotten really out of shape compared to when we first met and she didn't realize that I didn't really get much weaker, I just can't do as many reps of lifting or whatever as I used to when I was ripped. I am starting to come into that old man strength where you can lift really heavy stuff, but only like once and then you need to rest your back for a few days.",

About how she would always beat my buddy in wrestling.  How it was never even close. I figured he was letting her win, but didn\u2019t wanna out him for it. She did lift a lot of weights and was big, plus she came from a rough childhood so had a lot of pride in mental and physical toughness.\n\nOne day (early pandemic, we all lived together and had nothing better to do than get wasted at nights) we were all drunk and talking.  She started poking fun at all of us and saying she could kick our asses.  I let it go on for a while but she wouldn\u2019t drop it. She was challenging me to wrestle.\n\nI accepted and tackled and pinned her within about 2 seconds.  She blamed it on poor reaction and said she wasn\u2019t ready.  Ok, we go again.

Finally I just said okay I\u2019m going to hold your wrists and you try and get out. \nSeriously if you have a sister or a daughter I think it is a good idea to just demonstrate safely how strong men are in comparison. If girls are fortunate enough to never suffer abuse then they\u2019re only real gauge is the kinda fighting kids do when boys and girls are the same strength.

Around that time, I started learning Muay Thai as a hobby, so when she started getting punchy, I knew how to deflect the strikes.  This just frustrated her more, and she'd keep punching and punching.  Finally, I didn't just block a punch, I caught her in a wrist lock and stopped her cold.  \"OK,\" I said, \"This used to be cute, but you're taking it too far. I don't want either of us to get hurt, so let's agree that it ends now.\"\n\nShe agreed and fumed about it for a few days, but she stopped hitting me.

            "Had it happen a few years ago. I used to date a friend who was super competitive, and would try to wrestle me. She was a firecracker from a very small town, and had grown up with 2 brothers. She spent a lot of time hunting and doing outdoor activities with her family, so I guess she thought I was a wimp because I didn't. I mean, I'm a bit of a geeky person, I'm short and I'm not one of those super masculine guys. I don't really care for sports, but I played hockey and soccer well into my 20s, and I grew up chopping wood with my dad every winter, she just never knew that version of me. I look small, and I dress to complement my shape, but I've always been well over 200lbs. She was maybe 120lbs. Naturally when she'd try to wrestle me, I'd give in - she was hot. I may be a geek, but I wasn't an idiot.\n\nOne day she was being more brazen than usual, and was being a bit too lippy while she was wrestling me. I wasn't in the mood, grabbed her by the hips and picked her up over my head. She was shocked, and asked how I did it. I told I'd always been able to do that. She decided she wanted to test me and challenged me to an arm wrestle... it didn't work out for her. She was half pissy with me for the rest of the weekend, and I just laughed at her. Told I never once said I wasn't strong (relative to my size - I'm not as strong as a lot of my friends at the gym), and that the assumption was her fault. The relationship didn't last. I'm not competitive, and it became really annoying.\n\nAfter we stopped seeing one another, she started going to the gym with me, and for the first little while, she would try to match my lifts. She had a real hate on for not being able to lift what I did. It used to be kind of cute, but it got annoying fast.",

I realized I wasn\u2019t very strong, against men at least, and kinda made me more aware of my weaknesses.\n\nI dunno if maybe she was feeling that same mixture of feelings and plus you acting that way made her think she doesn\u2019t like you anymore.

One night,  she was teasing me about not being able to pick her up like the guy on TV did(she was a decent sized woman, definitely \"thick\"). We were watching TV from the dining room table while eating after work. I asked her to stand up, and she laughed. So I essentially deadlifted her up by the chair she was sitting in.

I'll do it myself!\" and left.\n\nWe both emerged and began accusing each other of pissing Mom off, and the fight was on! It didn't last long, and soon we both split up, still angry.\n\nHours later, my sister, who had beaten me in many fights in our younger years, came up and said \"Y'know, earlier after we fought, I was thinking that even though you're bigger than me now, I still held my own in that fight.\"\n\n\"Then I realized that no matter what I did, you never hit me.

We are not cheap, just saying.\n\nToday was all the same. Wake up, go to work, come home, and shower. But not even military training would've prepared me for what was about to unfold. My sweet himbo of a boyfriend is lactose intolerant. He does not care and continues to eat lactose and has the most gut-wrenching, eye tearing, vomit-inducing poops, and farts. Today it was a coworker's goodbye party and she brought a tres leches cake, which is a 3 milk cake. And him being the clueless man that would trade me for cake, he takes a HUGE piece. And it hit him hard. It hit him while we were showering.\n\nMost of us know that in the shower the smell after you fart is so much more intense. Now, this is where shit happens, literally. After being under the shower for about 5 or more minutes the tiny bathroom is filled with steam and my boyfriend while shampooing my hair exclaims loudly and lets out the longest, loudest stinkiest fart that I've ever had displeasure of experiencing and runs to the toilet, holding his ass.\n\nYou would think someone was cutting trees with a chainsaw because holy shit it was so loud my mouth dropped and I could TASTE the disgusting gas that was once a tasty tres leches cake. I started heaving and gagging which became worse after this huge man nestled on a tiny toilet dropped what you would think was a nuclear bomb. It was: Wet, loud, and smelly to the point of me almost throwing up on the spot. I instead rushed to the sink that was right next to the toilet that I kind of felt bad for, and started just projectile vomiting my breakfast, lunch, and the tres leches cake that will be gone but not forgotten.\n\nEvery time I inhaled, the absolute nuclear shit fumes hit me like an 8 wheeler and I kept vomiting harder and harder. This whole fiasco ended up in me almost passing out and my poor boyfriend who couldn't stop shitting his absolute blood, sweat, and tears out could not do much to help except shit more. And more.\n\nWe ended up taking separate cold showers and airing out the windowless bathroom by opening the bathroom door and the front door which gave us weird looks but I'd rather not die and have \"Death by poot\" on my gravestone.\n\nEDIT: Oh my God! I didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. The fart beast is now considering Lactaid... or a cork. Thank you for the awards! We are both doing great! And to the people saying he's rude or inconsiderate or farting in front of each other is gross, we are doing great in terms of our relationship and each other and have been talking about marriage. \n\nTL;DR: Me and my lactose-intolerant boyfriend took a shower together after he ate a milk cake at work and him shitting his soul out almost made me pass out.",

The backstory isn't quite as.....juicy.....but I have one intestine and have a difficult time passing gas while standing if I haven't gone to the bathroom recently. Basically fluids dont absorb as well for me so gas doesn't pass through. Well that causes issues for me after long days of work. So one day after coming home and going to the bathroom she needed to take a shower as well. So we hop in together and moving has brought the days gas down my shortened pipeline. Without the extra function of a large intestine, my stank can be particularly pungent. I don't really enjoy being cramped and bloated, so she was just going to have to deal with it. It wasn't something new to her after all. Well I  knew she would give me shit for making her smell it, but I did not expect her to get so worked up that she would start to gag. I started to feel much worse fighting off my laughter while she heaved up a second serving of the day's cuisine. Then I tried my best to comfort her while I started to feel squeamish myself as she full on vomited everything she had and fought through tears caused by my gas. She apologized profusely (as I had been doing sheepishly) for clogging the drain and was mad because \"it wasn't even THAT bad.\" So now I try to be more mindful of my farts, but sometimes there's still an \"Uh-oh\" followed by \"Nooo,\" \"DON'T,\" or \"Go fuck yourself.\" Her heart and my b-hole go out to you OP!\n\nShe still said \"yes\"",

            "I took a course in the pyschology of sex in gradschool. One thing I learned that always stuck with me is that sexual preference is very pavlovian. And by sexual preference I don't mean orientation, I mean specific things that lead to your orgasm. If you can only cum under a specific particular set of conditions it's because you're conditioned to it. This is sort of how fetishes begin to develop and the longer period of time your body is used to orgasiming under these conditions, the more they're reinforced and hard to break. This explains also why many men have no problem cumming from masturbation but have a hard time during intercourse (drunkenness and performance anxiety aside). The pressure, speed, and feeling associated with years of frequent and specific kind of masturbation is wholly different from what your brain is used to when it comes to sex.",

I was really happy that they went out of their way to cook for me. \n\nHowever when I took a bite I was in for a suprise. It was a cold omelette with horseradish Swiss cheese, sour raisins, and prunes. It was... disturbingly gross. I couldn't even swallow one bite. I really couldn't eat it.\n\nLater in the day, my roommate came by to ask how it was. I was mostly distracted with work so I just said that I was thankful he cooked for me. \n\nBecause he doesn't cook a lot, I thought that I wouldn't have to address the abomination and we'd just go back to usual. Well... He took the positive encouragement and has started expirementing with all kinds of wierd flavour combinations.\n \nThis morning I woke up to a garlic, cheese, and dried cranberries omelette and it was even worse than the first. I feel like I'm in too deep at this point. I don't have the heart to tell him that I don't like even like omelettes. I like plain scrambled eggs. \n\nTl;Dr- My roommate made gross food. I thought it was a one time thing so I gave positive feedback. Now my life is wierd wierd omelettes.\n\nEdit: holy cow. This blew up. Just sending love and good vibes to all. May all your food be tasty, and all your roommates be as nice as mine, but may they be much much much better cooks.\n\nUpdate: for everyone offering advice, the plan is definitely to communicate that this combination is\n... heinous, but in a nice and respectful way. I'm sure they would appreciate knowing what I actually like so that their effort is edible AND a really nice thing\n\nFinal update: we spoke, next day he made a plain egg for me. And I made tacos for both of us. So wins for all.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory \"this happened two days ago.\"\n\nI had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. \n\nAbout 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.\n\nWe would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn't been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.\n\nTwo days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.\n\nI waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.\n\nThe next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, \"before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?\" She was silent. I asked flat out \"did you sleep with him?\" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. So that's a win I guess.\n\nPlanning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn't told her yet. Still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I'm keeping my head up.\n\nTLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you all for the encouraging comments! They help so much more than I would've thought. Some of these really got to me, and reading that I should've posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. Most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a FU on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. Thank you all, so much! Going to read through and respond to as many as I can.\n\nEdit 2: I know that this post was meant to be posted in another sub, but thank you for being kind, and not focusing in on that aspect haha",

            "I've got nothing for you on the pain and confusion this terrible situation presents; that's a path you'll tread alone like many before you. I'm betting, however, that since you had the courage and clarity to post this here, you'll sort it out in a productive and healthy way. \n\nWhat I *can* say though is that this might have been much worse -- if she's cheating while engaged, she'll continue this into the marriage. Humans, after all, are social animals and we will (often) behave within the lines of what's tolerated. So I'd ask you to consider your life a few years down the road by adding in a child or two, a mortgage, the relationships with her family and friends and then imagine having to tear all that up once her multiple affairs are exposed. In addition to the pain you're feeling now you might have had an astoundingly complex legal and financial situation to cope with. (For example you may have had to pay alimony, or give up assets your money paid for, to a spouse who'd been cheating on you since who knows when.)\n\nDon't kid yourself: This is going to be hard and despite the encouragement of anonymous pixelated strangers like me and others, there will be times of anger, confusion and mourning. Confront it like a mature adult man, and be strong enough to ask for help or a willing ear when it comes. When and if possible pray (to whatever you believe in) and/or meditate the bitterness away. Because what would be worse than her betrayal is if this BS poisons you with cynicism and bitterness for your future relationships, whether they're romantic or not; your greatest \"revenge\" is moving past her and eventually building a real relationship with an adult woman built on love, trust and honor. \n\nI'm a nobody from nowhere but I'll be that ear if you need it in a dark minute. Just DM when that comes.",

I was like, what the fuck, give me your God damn phone, and she stated flipping out on me. Now I really wanted to see her phone, fuck the phone call I needed to make. She wouldn't hand it over, so I just snatched it out of her hands, then she snatched it back and smashed it on the ground. What the ever living fuck.\n\nSo, the phone was smashed, no longer working. I took it, and a throwaway phone with me as I left for work. Put the SIM in the throwaway phone, and immediately started getting texts from her coworker who was mad at her for fucking the guy the coworker was cheating on her husband with. Seriously. My wife fucked her co-worker's dude on the side.\n\nFiled for divorce, let the co-worker's husband know, and skipped town. Fuck that crazy.",

            "TIFU by reading this when Monday I freaked out about my hours changing from getting off at 7PM to 5PM, thinking I'd come home to her fucking some other dude. She didn't answer my calls or texts on my way home, but turned out she was sleeping.\n\nEvery now and again, I get these random nagging feelings thinking she's seeing someone else, as I have a history of being with cheaters (and yeah, it's not fair to her to keep thinking these things, but I've internalised it all up until this point on commenting about it) and I dunno. When we first got together we were all hot and heavy, always down to do the deed whenever it hit our fancy, but after about a year, we were doing it less, and after two years, I have to pretty much ask for a kiss, and haven't had sex since... Well, fuck, I can't remember. Maybe Valentine's Day? Maybe not. \n\nSo it's the perfect storm of my insecurities flaring up and making me think she's not interested in me anymore (and she's told me if she wasn't interested, she wouldn't be with me) and then of course, my damaged asf mind is like \"hooooo boy, guess what you're gonna find when you walk through the door two hours earlier than the past few months?

            "- Get the ring back. \n\n- Get checked out. There's no way what kind of filthy bug she passed onto you without telling.\n\n- Start separating your name from any shared accounts or close them. Netflix, bank account, insurance, bills, etc. The earlier you start dividing that line the less she'll fight back about it. Once that sense of entitlement comes back after the shame and guilt fades, you're gonna be in for a hell of an argument.\n\n- if you have any mutual friends, start evaluating if whether they're people you still want to hang out with (and therefore are willing to fight for them) or you're okay ghosting them and letting them think you're the bad guy (cuz she's gonna make you out as one, trust me) \n\n- cease all communication with her. This ain't the mother of your child and she dun do you dirty. Don't give her a chance to wriggle back in to try to manipulate you.  You know the facts and everything that came straight from her mouth and chances are she dressed it up to make it not sound as bad. Excommunicate that person.\n\n- don't get into another relationship immediately.  Come to terms with what happened, see what went wrong, if there was something you did/didn't do that contributed to the relationship going sour, and what you could learn from it.  Once you think you've unpacked it, then start thinking about dating. It wouldn't be fair for the other person to have to deal with any baggage.",

Someone with this many problems would be a ticking time bomb in a marriage.\n\nBy the way, cheaters always claim they only kissed and didn't have sex.

If you want to know someone is safe but let them consistently drive home drunk... smh\n\n>I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them.\n\nNot that I blame you for snooping further, but honestly, this was all the proof you needed. \u201cNothing much happened between us but I deleted the messages just cuz\u201d. Or was the 47 kilobytes of data too much space for her phone? Lol\n\n>she met him for the first time 2 days after the proposal\n\nI\u2019m a little curious here... How did she meet him? Out with friends, work, grocery store, or other? Not that it matters, it just seemed like a relevant detail and was wondering if she told you OP, if you\u2019re even reading this far down on my somewhat negative comment\n\n>Funny enough, the data recovery didn\u2019t even work\n\nOp getting her to confess prior to it not working was very fortunate... but OP, if your reading, could you tell us WHY the recovery didn\u2019t work? I was curious here too as well.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it for my assessment... I agree with everyone saying it wasn\u2019t an FU, but was surprised to read dozens of top comments and see nobody mention the drunk driving.\nOP, I hope you find a better future relationship where there is honesty and faithfulness, but please make sure to find someone who doesn\u2019t make dangerous decisions that can impact not just their wellbeing but the well-being of random strangers who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It\u2019s always \u201csafe enough to drive home nearby just a little bit tipsy\u201d until suddenly you\u2019re responsible for ending the lives of half of a family that was driving back from a wedding late-night.

I started telling stories around the fire at night, but eventually started doing \"shows\" in the chow hall or during talent shows if we were on a bigger base at the time. It wasn't uncommon for me to do so badly that I lost people during these shows; I even had a platoon opt to go on patrol early rather than watch my whole set. I was less fun than possibly dying. \n\nI wanted to get better, so I ordered a book and started working on trying to improve crowd work (talking to the audience) and being more physical. I figured if I could make the interpreters laugh with the language barrier, I'd be on my way to being a better comic. \n\nDuring our next patrol, we detained several suspected Taliban fighters. We needed to keep them on our base until they could get picked up by Intel people, so we needed to watch them for 2 days. I thought the idea of a literal captive audience was too good to pass up and basically tried to do crowd work and run bits by them in an incredibly animated manner. Imagine Sebastian Maniscalco, but 2 months into comedy. I volunteered for as many guard duty shifts as I could. I'd try jokes, I'd ask for their names and where they were from, jobs, e.t.c. anything I could try to make a joke about. Never a single laugh. \n\nEventually, they got picked up and apparently one complained about my jokes specifically. I ended up getting a stern talking to for \"unconventional interrogation\" because I kept asking where they were from and what they did and had to explain that I was so bored and desperate to get better at comedy that I almost inadvertently committed a war crime. \n\nTL;DR: I performed stand up comedy for detained Taliban members that went so badly they accused me of war crimes. Got a stern talking to for that.",

        "selftext": "This fuck up started 6 years ago when I met my wife\u2019s parents for the first time. Thought I had been determined to make a great first impression, ma and pa weren\u2019t thrilled about their country girl being stolen away from them by a city boy. \n\nConversation was stiffer than John Mayer\u2019s penis at 4 am on a friday night, but somehow it veered into the French category. I think we were talking about the civil war. Ma stated she\u2019d always wanted to learn the language. I thought I\u2019d win her over by telling a joke: \n\n\u201dA few years ago I didn\u2019t speak any french, but now I can speak fluently - apparently it is parler liquide\u201d\n\nWell, they didn\u2019t quite catch my wit, apperently speaking neither french nor sarcasm. Before this, they\u2019d been cold to me at best, but now they were treating me like I was the queen of france - before the revolution. At first, I thought they simply loved my joke. Ooh-ing and aah-ing. Asking me to speak more french. Weird, I thought, since the joke wasn\u2019t that funny, but maybe it was their cup of tea? Glass of wine? Jokes about french maybe was their thing. I proceeded to recite the only other french joke I know:\n\nA cat named 1-2-3 and another one named un, deux, trois were crossing a river. One made it avross. Which one? 1, 2, 3 because un, deux, trois, **cat**-re sinq. \n They loved that one too. Looking back on it, they didn\u2019t understand it at all. \n\nWhen they started asking me about where I learn it, how long it took, if I\u2019d be willing to teach them, it dawned on me. It being the first time meeting my wife\u2019s family, me fearing the awkward, and her dad looking like he chops trees with his bare hands, I made the split second decision to lie. \n\nAnd lied I have these past 6 years. My relationship with my wife\u2019s parents has grown steady. I\u2019ve spent far more time with them than I ever anticipated. I would have been comfortable coming clean to them, had it not been for the fact that the frenchness is my entire identity, my being, my worth to them now. I have become a caricature. Fearing they\u2019d suspect otherwise, I way overdid it early on which means I\u2019ve had to keep it up at express pace this entire time. My wife thinks it\u2019s hilarious, which is why she hasn\u2019t said anything, and the lie has gone on far too long for me to say anything. Every christmas the family gets together and I gift them french wines, despite never having been there. I sometimes say \u2019merde\u2019 after intentionally dropping something infront of them and I even learned how to make baguettes. I occasionally wear a beret and they love me for it.\n\nSo much so that they decided to invite the entire family to Paris for their 30th anniversary next year (after the pandemic). They\u2019re so excited and they\u2019re talking about how I can translate for them and \u201dtake them places only locals would know off\u201d and how I\u2019ve \u201dinspired them to finally visit France\u201d. My wife\u2019s parents are no wealthy people, it is a grand gesture from them paying for my vacation to Europe. I know I\u2019ve got to tell them. I can\u2019t back out of it, my wife would kill me. And I can\u2019t wait for them to find out in France, my wife would kill me. \n\nIt\u2019s so frustrating because it\u2019s such a small fuck up that has built up to this tremendous thing over the past few years. I have no idea what will happen once they know, but I\u2019m not eager to find out. \n\nTL;DR: Wife\u2019s parents didn\u2019t understand a joke, thought I spoke french. Me being afraid of awkwardness, doubled down and became \u00fcber-french despite speaking no french at all. Now they\u2019re taking me to real french people and I am screwed.",

            "Better start studying! You could probably learn some pretty passable French in the next 6 months if you try. As long as they don\u2019t learn French as well they won\u2019t really know if you\u2019re perfect. Probably should have started 6 years ago. You might be fluent by now.",

            "I would like to point out as someone who WAS fluent in French - 6 years of not using another language is plenty of time to forget if it was a second language.

            "As someone who studied French for almost 10 years and has made it to Paris three times - believe it or not, you\u2019ll be totally fine. I was so looking forward to get to use my French! But they can spot an American (I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m making an assumption that you are. I am) from a mile away, and they would start speaking English before I even had a chance to give French a try. You can easily get through Paris without knowing any French (or without your travel buddies knowing that you don\u2019t know French). If you make it outside of Paris, I make no promises. \n\nAs far as places to go that only the locals would know about. Well... I\u2019m no local. But I would add Musee d\u2019Orsay to the list. Everyone will want to go to the Louvre. You and your family will decide whether to go there or not. But the Musee d\u2019Orsay is one that many people would skip that you absolutely should not. You can get through it in a few hours, and it has many works from the Renaissance period - including Monet, Degas, Renoir, etc. Don\u2019t miss it. Also! Les Deux Magots cafe. Ernest Hemingway, Julia child, Albert Camus, and many others used to hang out there. Plus the Irish coffees there are also the best I\u2019ve ever had. \n\nTo be honest, if I were in your shoes, I\u2019d spend more time studying the history than the language. The Parisians will bail you out there. But knowing things like the history of the city, architecture, and food will make you look like you studied French for years. Like I did. Lol \n\nOh! And add the Metro app. You plug in where you are and where you want to be, and it will map out your trip on where to get off to switch trains and everything. Dummy proof. \n\nI hope that helps! Enjoy your trip! And if I can help in any other way, feel free to DM me.\n\nEdit: apologies. Not the Renaissance period.

Actually, in terms of museums, you can suggest something most tourists don't do like the Picasso museum or the Quai Branly museum. \n- suggest you go visit actually Parisian spots and not only the tourist attractions, a few suggestions would be the Canal St Martin, le Sentier (there's lots of elderly prostitutes there but I swear it's really funny and there's absolutely no danger, it's one of the few places left with an actual neighborhood life and these ladies are fully part of it), les Buttes Chaumont.\n- try to avoid snacks and restaurants in tourist areas, there are some good ones but most are crappy and expensive. Don't be fooled into taking those \"French breakfasts\" at caf\u00e9s, it's fucking dumb. Go to a bakery, it'll be cheaper and much better.\n- also suggest going to real artisans in terms of food for cheese and wine, for example. A good franchise that you can find anywhere for wine is called Nicolas, the shopkeepers are experts and will always find you something really good at any price range.\n- don't buy wine above 25 euros, you can find good ones for 10 or 15, even less sometimes.\n- if you go to Montmartre, don't let guys start braiding a bracelet around your wrist. They'll ask for money after and you'll be very embarrassed.\n- you can find good Japanese restaurants on Sainte Anne Street, it's in between the Garnier Opera and the Louvre. For other good Asian restaurants, go to the 13th arrondissement : vietnamese, Cambodian, Chinese. Good prices, good food. \n- you don't need to take those overpriced red tour buses, walking in Paris is pretty great. The subway is really not hard to apprehend compared to other cities like New York. \n\nThis is off the top of my head, don't hesitate to ask for more if you've got questions. Oh also you can pretend that you don't understand exactly what we're saying, Parisian French is a fast paced accent, we speak really fast and use a fair number of slangs and slurs that are not taught in school. \n\nIn any case, we appreciate people trying to speak in French, but in Paris we tend to switch the conversation in English because eh, it'll be easier for us to communicate and most parisians are fluent by now. \n\nSource: am Parisian, lived there most of my life. I've been guiding lost Yankees for a very long time. I like it.\n\nEdit : parler liquide hahahahahahahahaahahaha\n\nAbout the wine thing, there are extremely good and pricey bottles, but honestly if your pallet's not accustomed to wine you will have a hard time tasting any difference.\n\nEdit 2 : \n\nadditional nice neighborhoods I just thought of : \n\n- Avenue Trudaine and the surrounding area near the Anvers station. It's next to Montmartre\n\n- Cadet",

            "French is my native language and I\u2019m also a French/Spanish tutor. I would say, avoid Duolingo at all cost. You might learn how to say random words like \u00ab\u00a0croissant\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0voiture\u00a0\u00bb through duolingo, but I personally don\u2019t know anyone who achieved a decent level of French through that app. People who used Duolingo would usually just throw random words that don\u2019t make much sense in a real conversation, thinking they speak the language, when they don\u2019t, and it makes it awkward for me because I have to tell them that their French sucks. \n\nStart by having a deep understanding of the verb tenses that are commonly used in French (imparfait, pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9, plus que parfait, pr\u00e9sent, futur proche, imp\u00e9ratif) first, as well as the basic grammar (Bescherelle is good for this). Then, to build up some vocabulary in an efficient way, learn new words by category (food, school, work, colours, etc.). On Quizlet, you can find premade flashcards for free. Set a goal to learn at least 20-50 new words everyday. \n\n\nOnce you feel confident and have a good foundation, start watching movies, tv show or listening to music in French (it\u2019s useless to do so before having the basic skills, since you would most likely just read the subtitles and waste your time). Duolingo isn\u2019t efficient for someone who wants to be able to have a conversation, but you could try Babbel instead, which I found OK to learn Russian (100$/year). \n\nYou may also find many channels on YouTube, but since you don\u2019t have much time to improve your French, I would go with something more structured: 1) Verbs/Grammar 2) Vocabulary 3) Exposure through movies/songs. And don\u2019t give up. There are a LOT of similarities between English and French. I learned English 3 years ago, so trust me, you can do it.\n\nEdit: Putting random paragraph breaks here and there",

[Watch this video now](https://youtu.be/illApgaLgGA).  It's an hour long (and a little cheesy), but it will show you how you can learn any language in a year.  With French it'll take you like an 1-2 hours a day.  Really, no big deal.\n\n2.  You can't do normal language exchanges right now, so what do you do?  Use [iTalki.com](https://www.italki.com/dashboard) and find yourself a tutor to meet with at least once a week to read you stories.  Eventually you'll move on to conversation practice.\n\n3.  Download the free flashcard program [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and start studying the 1000 most spoken words in French.  Don't use English on the back of the flashcards, use pictures.  It will help your brain \"think\" in French.\n\n4.  Watch as much French TV shows as you have time for.  Start with Children's cartoons at first, then move on to regular TV shows.  Netflix is a great resource for this.  Don't watch with English subtitles, Do French audio with French subtitles.\n\n5.  Don't go and study grammar, let your brain pick it up naturally through input, just like how you learned English grammar.  And don't let the people at /r/languagelearning try to talk you into it.\n\n**YOU CAN DO THIS**",

        "selftext": "Obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. My brother and I have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). This agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so I was convinced he still remembered.\n\nA couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as \"an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones\". Eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. I got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. I decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. \n\nNear the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. There's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. So I went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of \"[brother's name], if you're watching this, I'm already dead. Everyone on the world pretty much is. It's been about eight months since you went to [hospital name]. You need to head for the safe haven in Helsinki (we live in western Canada) - mom might be there. God speed.\" I managed to sync it up to the TV and woke him up as it was starting.\n\nThis is where it all goes to complete shit. My brother began to lose it immediately. He started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. I grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. Nurses came in and I was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).\n\nHe got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. My mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. My dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. I'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. I've also been kicked out of a family vacation.\n\nWorth the wait though.\n\ntl;dr: Convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital\n\nEDIT: Wow this blew up?! I don't have a ton of time but:\n\n1) I don't want to upload the video. I made it sound tamer than it was, I look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xD\n\n2) The TVs in the hospital had HDMI ports. I just plugged it into my Chromebook. \n\n3) I can see why people say I made this up for karma, but I didn't create a throwaway to do that.  If I cared that much, I would've posted it on my main account.\n\n4) My mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. She hasn't been happy with me moving (western Canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. She paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",

He wasn't literally standing next to his bro shaking him.   \n3) His brother believed it because he just woke up and is hopped up on pain meds. He's not thinking clearly or fully awake.  \n4) He screamed. This does not mean he screamed like a little girl. He could have screamed, \"What the fuck!?\" as he gets out of bed.   \n5) He got kicked out of the hospital unless it is an emergency does not mean he was literally banned from the hospital. Just means they asked him to go to the lobby and quit fucking around. \"And don't come back unless it is something serious!\" *insert nurse glare that has no actual legal weight*  \n\nSeriously I can see how the OP could be lying but some of these criticisms just show a lack of imagination/reading comprehension.

If you allow Net Neutrality to be removed then this allows your providers to do what ever they like with your internet especially when companies throw money at your provider to promote their site over existing ones.

            "Net Neutrality will censor the internet and the media you like to consume. \n\nIn the words of Tim Wu, the law professor who coined the term Net Neutrality, the Internet rules are about giving the FCC the ability to shape \u201cmedia policy, social policy, oversight of the political process, [and] issues of free speech.\u201d\n\nTitle II regulations, originally created to police the Ma Bell monopoly, transform the Internet from a virtually unregulated, private system of networks into a quasi-public utility subject to conflicting common-carrier precedents, bureaucratic designs, and interminable waiver proceedings.\n\n\u200cMany rules and regulations kick in, including a selective ban on blocking Internet content and oversight of the competitive Internet interconnection market, but the so-called general-conduct standard swallows them all. This amorphous rule allows the FCC to prevent any practice by an Internet access provider that the FCC believes will \u201cunreasonably disadvantage\u201d an Internet user, application, or content provider. The FCC and net-neutrality advocates correctly recognize that if the agency can monitor and control the distributors of speech, they can shape culture and politics.\n\nThe competitive technology marketplace should be a cause for celebration for a communications and media regulator. Instead, a well-functioning market needed a manufactured crisis \u2014 in this case, illusory \u201cneutrality violations\u201d \u2014 for the agency to reassert power. Title II brings new media firmly inside the regulatory tent.\n\nTitle II rules make the FCC the ultimate arbiter of which tradeoffs and business models are acceptable. Call it innovation by regulatory waiver. So when providers are unsure about whether a new technology or business model \u201cunreasonably\u201d harms some Internet constituency, they can submit those prospective plans to the Commission and pray for an affirmative (and timely) advisory opinion. These advisory opinions border on Kafkaesque. The FCC can decline the request for an opinion, can permit the innovation, or can require more information from the submitting party. These opaque determinations cannot be appealed, and affirmative decisions can be reversed at the agency\u2019s whim.\n\nIf history is any guide, these Title II rules and obligations will drive out smaller ISPs that can\u2019t afford to hire lawyers and lobbyists to interpret the neologisms and incantations that will pour forth from the FCC. The larger carriers, with hallways of attorneys watching the agency\u2019s every move, will muddle through the complexity as they grow more sclerotic, and they may even grow a little larger and more profitable as weaker rivals throw in the towel. Internet and technology companies, used to Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d culture, will increasingly need to lawyer up and ask permission before experimenting with new technology that touches on data transmission.\n\nSome Internet providers may initially fight or test the legal boundaries, but the FCC has ways of breaking defiant firms. The most alarming is that the agency is increasingly using license and transaction approvals to coerce various policies \u2014 like net-neutrality compliance, increasing the number of, say, public-affairs, Spanish-language, and children\u2019s TV shows, and abandonment of editorial control of TV and radio channels \u2014 that it cannot, or will refuse to, enact via formal regulation. In the long run, Internet and technology companies, now FCC supplicants, will have to divert funds from new services and network design to fending off regulatory intrusions and negotiating with the Internet\u2019s new zoning board.\n\nNet neutrality is a wolf in sheep's clothing. \n\n",

        "selftext": "So this actually happened yesterday, and I'm still shaken up over it. My boyfriend and I decided to visit Zapata Falls in Colorado after taking a social distance Covid style road trip. We saw the waterfall and it was magnificent. There were tons of people (few of whom wore masks) so we ventured in a side direction. I noticed a very climb-able ridge and trying to be spontaneous I began to climb. Well, after a few minutes I was having trouble finding my footing and looked down to see it would be near impossible to descend. Cue the panicked calls for the boyfriend, who came up after me and told me we needed to get to the top since it would be safer. I'll note at this point it looked like the top wasn't too far off. Spoiler: we were wrong.\n\nAs we began our ascent I tried not to look down or up as it became apparent this wasnt just a small ledge that would lead to the top of the fall. Nope, we were free climbing a mountain.\n\nAfter about half an hour I was panicked. My feet slid at every attempt upwards and I heard the loose rocks I disturbed tumble off. We called 911 from a small flat ledge where we could sit down. The operator was great and told us if we weren't hurt and could make it to the top, there was a trail. That was encouraging enough to press on. In time we came to the top. I clung to the jagged rock as wind raced past while my boyfriend looked for the path. We began to spiral down the mountain, walking diagonally still looking for this trail. Long story short, we never found the trail and we spent hours slowly getting to the bottom. At one point the ground slid and I skinned my leg on a tree trunk, but all things considered we made it down with minimal injuries. \n\nFrom there we walked towards the sound of water and soon voices came into the mix, distant but clear. Thankfully we pinned where we parked and used a compass and map of the location to get us to safety. I cried like a baby when we got to the car. Today I woke up feeling sore in every fiber of my being but super grateful to be alive.\n\nTl;dr: Thought I was climbing a path to see the top of a waterfall, ended up free climbing a mountain and spent 6+ hours trying to navigate out of that situation. Special thanks to TJ the 911 operator who calmed me down enough to make it to the top without incurring an expensive helicopter rescue fee.\n\nEdit 1: I am BLOWN AWAY by how this has taken off. I'm still en route but wanted to note a few things. 1. I have read comments that clarified I did not free climb but instead free soloed. I know nothing of climbing (clearly) and am grateful for the education. I'm leaving it just to further show my climbing ignorance. 2. Regarding that ignorance... I fully agree this was a dumbass thing to do. I should have stayed on the trail. I endangered myself, my boyfriend and any possible SAR that would need to save my tourist ass. I am not normally this person and I will act accordingly in the future. 3. For those who are posting kind words and encouragement thank you. I fully acknowledge that I fucked up and am trying to make the best of it. I did learn a lesson and ultimately I am trying to be gentle with myself as we all make mistakes. Thank you for your empathy. \n\nEdit 2: I got in late last night but uploaded a video of the initial climb (super grainy don't know why) and a drawn route. In the video we thought that tall rock ahead was the top. It was not. Thank you to all the people who did remind me to stay on the trail out of respect for the park, myself and others. I wholeheartedly agree. Without further ado... Accidental Mountain Climb https://imgur.com/gallery/NK30iuC",

            "Mountains are scary as fuck. Something like this just happened with my friend group, two of us were about to go on vacation so the last day they were present we decided to hike a 3000 ft mountain\u2014only problem was that it was supposed to rain for the entirety of our duration there. \n\nWe say fuck it and set out anyway, and multiple hours of climbing pass with no rain, so the entire ascent is blue skies and not a drop in sight. Going out with an imminent rainstorm was poor decision #1, poor decision #2 was going out so late. We reach the top and decide, after eating and taking pics of the views, to have a photo-op of all four of us with the timer camera. That took the most time. \n\nAs this was going on an intense fog rolled in and we realized we were in a cloud, which was awesome until it became a storm cloud. The rain waited to start until we were at the TOP, and by then it was about 8:00, so sunlight was waning fast. We began booking it because we wanted to find where the trails crossed to take the less steep one down\u2014the one we took up had so many rock sliding moments that if we did them in the rain we\u2019d get ourselves killed. \n\nThe whole time on the mountain we\u2019d only seen one other person\u2014a guy going down as we went up. That was likely because everyone else knew what was about to happen.\n\nThe next two hours were spent in pitch black darkness getting absolutely drenched with nothing but our phone lights and a shitty crank-powered flashlight. We turned off the lights at one point to confirm how fucked we were and you couldn\u2019t see *anything* except for the vague shape of leaves in sky. If we had been off trail or lost, it easily could\u2019ve gone so much worse.",

        "selftext": "Yesterday I ate the ends of a chicken wing. Someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so I tried it out. I never expected this to happen. \n\nI must not have chewed one properly. I got something lodged in my throat. To dislodge it I ate some bread and drank some softdrink. Some pain persisted but I went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. \n\nThis morning I woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. I walked to the public hospital down the road because I was starting to worry. \n\nThe GP noticed I had a \"crunchy throat\" when pressing on it. He immediately sent me off to get an Xray. That showed I have a perforated esophagus. That is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. The \"crunchy\" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. \n\nTo get more information I started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219576/\n\nThey consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. It's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. A few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. They said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. \n\nNow I'm waiting on the results of the CT Scan which will determine whether I get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. If I'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. \n\nTL;DR: I ate the ends off a chicken wing and now I'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.\n\n**Update:** A surgeon just spoke to me. I have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. They don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.\n\n**Update 2:** The main surgeon just spoke to me. I'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. The critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. So I can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and I need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.\n\n**Update 3:** I had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. It's called a PICC. It's how I'll be eating and drinking over the next week.\n\n**Update 4:** I'm out now and everything seems to be fine! I have another check up on the 11th of December to confirm.",

I was one of the founding members of the X-Men, and I was balls deep in mutant pussy. So, fucking was literally my superpower. I could cure the sick with my cum. Humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. Including the members of the X-Men. So, in this dream, I was fucking Blink and Jubilee. Sparks were flying in the bedroom. I mean, damn. I never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. But deep down in dreamland, I gave *all* the fucks. I experienced the most explosive orgasm. I woke up at that moment.\n\nOof. I was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. I'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. Especially if you're wearing loose pants. I locked eyes with the passenger next to me. She wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. It had the words \"Best Mom Ever\" on the pillow case. *Of course it had*. At that point I realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. I was too embarrassed to really speak, but I managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. She shook her head as if to say \"don't mention it\". And then she said this fucking shit: \n\n\"Don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"I have a son who's also into X-Men\"\n\n**Words that will haunt me for the rest of my days.** \n\n*Edit: Appreciate the Silver & Gold! Last time I checked I had like 5 comments and 3 upvotes. This, I did not see coming. Thanks for all the responses, from the believers to the none believers, you're all equally entertaining! For those of you asking for photos of the pillow, once I got off the plane, I snatched my bags and rushed to the nearest bathroom, where I changed pants. Once I did that, I tossed the pillow in the trash. An Uber was waiting to take me straight to my new job. No fucking way was I gonna bring a \"best mom ever\" pillow into the new office. This fuck up needs no sequel.*\n\n*TL;DR I came on a plane with the utmost shame.*",

She wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. It had the words \"Best Mom Ever\" on the pillow case. Of course it had. At that point I realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. I was too embarrassed to really speak, but I managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger.

She was cute so I sent her a message saying hi and we talked for a bit and then I got her snap.\n\nOn Snapchat she asks if I wanted to play truth or dare and being the horndog that I am I agreed. The questions were innocent enough at first, but then I dared her to send her most recent picture in her camera roll. It was her cleavage (score). In that moment I knew I had succeeded in my dick's desire. I picked dare next because she picked dare. Her dare was to put toothpaste on my dick.\n\nNow, I'm not proud of this but I wasn't super against it at first. I called her out for just trying to see my dick by putting a funny spin on it. I decided to video call her on Snapchat and she watched me pull out my dick and such. I then said that was enough and I didn't wan't to rub toothpaste on my dick but she insisted she would send nudes if I did.\n\nSo, I squeezed out some toothpaste, rubbed that bad boy on my cock, and sent a pic to the girl. Not two seconds later I check and she unadded me on snap and unmatched with me on Tinder.\n\nHoes really be out here getting guys to rub toothpaste on their dicks and leave.

But she only exhibited a headache and none of the other features until her blood pressure shot through the roof. He was born shortly after we were admitted to the hospital and while it was the happiest day of my life I haven\u2019t really had the chance to fully deal with the trauma of walking into a hospital thinking my pregnant wife would get a shot to quell a headache, only to haven\u2019t to confront the reality of possibly walking out alone. I chose not to focus on any of that. Instead, I put my head down and concentrated on the things we could control.\n\nHe was in the NICU for several weeks and everyday we had to be strong parents for our son fighting for his life. And of course, once he graduated from the NICU we suddenly had a baby to turn into a full-grown human.\n\nThe lack of sleep is real. Plus, post-partum and the grief of not experiencing the full-term has been very difficult for my wife. Meanwhile, I\u2019m a freelance artist who has been getting a lot of work recently after a VERY dry few months. Basically, I\u2019ve had absolutely no time to slow down and think about everything.\n\nThis was a transcontinental flight. He was marvelous. Slept almost the whole way, even after our flight was delayed for 7 hours and we spent the entire day at the airport. My wife had held him most of the flight while I caught up on some work. But when her back was aching I took him and I looked for something to watch. I didn\u2019t want anything too stressful and I thought, \u201cFinding Nemo has that Thomas Newman score and the blue and orange will be soothing.\u201d I had completely forgotten about the beginning. Really, really dumb.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t turn it off. Even as the snot out-volumed the tears. In a sense, it was like an ice bath\u2014at first, it stabbed me like a thousand knives but once I relaxed and let it wash over me, I felt that part of me begin to heal.\n\nWe\u2019re both starting therapy because we have a man to make and we can\u2019t be good parents without being ones who are as healthy as possible. This is just the beginning as a parent. But, I can\u2019t help but think that maybe \u2018Finding Nemo\u2019 helped me figure out just how much I\u2019d been holding inside. Which, is coincidentally kinda the whole point of the film: letting go.\n\nEDIT: I just woke up and when I sat down to feed him his morning bottle I realized my phone was going crazy. This is crazy. I can\u2019t believe how much this has blown up! Thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. I cannot adequately express how much that means to us.\n\nAlso, to answer a little bit of a fair question, this is a FU because I didn\u2019t really choose the right venue for this, or stop to think that Pixar is pretty much synonymous with sobbing. Planes already heighten our insecurities so choosing a film that will surely make me cry in that environment was not a great choice.",

The baby's heart actually stopped and the doctor rushed (I'm talking about throwing the door open so hard that it broke the wall protector) and shouted that we had to get the baby out RIGHT NOW! The next day we were informed that had we not come in that day, both my wife and child would have died. \n\nOur baby girl was born 5 weeks early and had to spend a week in the NICU. She came home with us after she was cleared by the doctor and was so tiny that we had to roll up towels to put around her in the car seat. She grew pretty quickly and, with the help of some great doctors, had no lasting complications.\n\nDuring her 3 year check-up, the doctor nearly made me cry by giving me the best news I've heard: If her chart didn't mention it, you'd never know she had complications at birth.\n\nWe celebrated her 4th birthday in August and she's absolutely perfect. She's the tallest in her class, cuter than any of my kids should be, and is so incredibly smart that she's being put in a Mandarin immersion class for kindergarten.\n\nI have two girls and they are my entire world.

Thankfully the baby and I recovered within a couple of minutes. We cried it out over pizza once we got home.

I had a 2 year old child at the time also. I remember getting home from the late shift around 11pm, walked in my son's room and kissed him on the head, then I sat on my couch, and cried. The entire shift I was imaging what if that had been my son.",

        "selftext": "This happened approximately six years ago, I was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that I post it here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee'd, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee'd because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn't been with anyone else. I hadn't been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed \"why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!\" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I've been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee'd. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test. The night before we went, I inadvertently discovered that I had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap. ",

I thought that he was faking it, but the moment I saw his penis spraying cum all over my room like a fountain, I was impressed.

So yeah, we did anal sex, and he was repeatedly asking me if he was \"in the right spot\" inside my anus, and my answer was always no. \n\nWe did some research, but we both would always open a page, and always skip to the \"how to\" part instead of reading through the introduction and stuff where they'd usually mention that only men have prostates. \n\nSo basically, we did this for an entire month and I started getting really frustrated because no matter what, we just couldn't find the right spot inside me, whereas my boyfriend would always hit his right spot and sprayed like a fountain all over my room. A very frustrated me, constantly kept searching for results on the internet until this morning, when I finally realised the truth, and how much of an idiot I've been all this time.

If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.\n\nHalf an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).\nI get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. \n\nI explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!\n\nits takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.\n\nI still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....\n\n\nSo it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.\nMy son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.\n\nTL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.\n\n",

            "Great read! Glad you're ok, OP. I am a bit confused on the timeline of this whole thing, though.\n\nSo you leave for your aunt's house, 3 hours into the trip you pick up the hitchhiker, and 30 minutes after that they knock you out and rob you. You then wake up apparently a couple hours later because the sun was coming up. So that's roughly 6-7 hours between you leaving the house and waking up from the carjacking. I'm basing this on the fact that the sun rises about 6 am where I am. \n\nSo what time were you leaving in the first place? 11? Midnight? Just to go to your aunt's house?  Why not just wait until the morning to make such a long trip, especially without telling your wife and son where you're going? Things may work differently in Zimbabwe, so if that's the case, nevermind. But dude, out of all of this, try to remember: even with a bad memory, learn someone in your family's phone number! Perfect for situations like this. And fuck picking up hitchhikers! Again, glad you're ok.

The older son ,\"Alec\", was enjoying thus far his senior year at HS and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. On the other hand is my nephew \"Dan\" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. When I pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. Alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more \"robust\" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and Dan. Being the cool uncle I let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. As she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my Marine Corps days. If he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. But dont go empty handed. I suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. Now that I think of it I was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. So the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.\n A few days later it occured to all of us Dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. When his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. I however was not buying it. I pulled him aside and got the truth. The boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. He would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. He met a girl and they had been seeing each other. I was happy I could help and could not believe it actually worked. However things went south. \n A few days after my return to the east coast I received a very emotional call from my sister. She explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a \"Have you seen this man\" flier on the door. It was a grainy surveillance photo of Dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. The flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. When she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. Now Dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and I told I am not invited for Christmas. Poor Dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.\n\nTL;DR.  I royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters.",

        "selftext": "I'll admit I haven't been the most attentive husband lately. My wife has told me I need to make more of an effort in our relationship or we would have problems. I've tried really hard to invest in our relationship ever since finding out my wife is not feeling as happy as she\u00a0should be.\n\nThis fuck up happened last week. My wife's birthday\u00a0was coming up. I decided to go big. My wife absolutely loves surprises so I decided to\u00a0surprise\u00a0her with a romantic night and lots of flowers and presents. She had to go to work in the morning of her birthday and I had the day off. A lot of time to plan everything out.\n\nI decided, being the idiot I am, to pretend that I had forgotten\u00a0my wife's birthday\u00a0just to make the surprise, well, even more of a surprise. The plan was as follows: my wife wakes up and I don't mention her birthday. She thinks I've forgotten it. She goes to work and I get everything ready. She comes home in the evening after work and\u00a0tadaa!!\u00a0When she opens the door I'll be waiting for her with gifts, flowers dinner and everything romantic I could think of. Sounds like an amazing plan right? WRONG.\n\nNothing special happened in the morning and my wife left for work while I slept in. During the day I got everything\u00a0ready\u00a0and apart from mildly messing up the\u00a0desert\u00a0everything went great. Then it was time to wait for my wife to return. She\u00a0was supposed\u00a0to get home after 4pm. 4.30pm nothing. 5pm still nothing. I was starting to get worried and I texted her where she was. Around 5.30pm she read my message but didn't reply. I called her and she didn't answer. I was starting to get extremely worried and texted her if she was okay.\u00a0Thats\u00a0when she replied.\n\nShe texted me opening up about how she couldn't believe I had forgotten her birthday even after her expressing to me how she had felt neglected in the relationship and wanting me to put in more effort. I, in all my stupidity, still decided to play dumb to make my big surprise work. I told her to just get home so we could talk about it. Big mistake\n\nShe told me she\u00a0was done\u00a0talking and started mentioning divorce. Fuck\u00a0fuck fuck.\u00a0Thats\u00a0when I called her and she still wouldn't answer. Then I panicked and started explaining everything to her by text. I took pictures of all the things I had done around the house, the gifts the flowers the decorations the dinner everything. I just wanted to surprise her that's all I wanted.\n\nI tried calling her to no avail. She read my messages and after not getting a reply I just broke and started crying. After what felt like the longest wait of my life my wife comes home. She's crying saying she's sorry. I told her it was my fault and we both just cried holding each other. We spent the night crying and cuddling and eating the dinner I made. She told me it was the best thing she had ever eaten (obviously a lie, it was mediocre at best and already cold). It wasn't the surprise I had hoped to give her, I'm just glad to still be married to her.\n\nAnd yes we are working to fix our relationship. I love this woman with all my heart. I had her permission to share this\n\nTldr: Wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday and pretented to forget her birthday to make the surprise better. She got really upset and started talking about a divorce. I ruined the surprise trying to explain myself and we spent the night of her birthday crying and cuddling.\n\nEdit: Wow thank you for the kind words everyone! I can't reply to everyone so I just wanted to say I appreciate it here!\n\nFor all the concerned people, yes we are getting help and fixing things like I have stated before. I appreciate the concern but with all\u00a0due\u00a0respect I'm going to take relationship advice from\u00a0professionals and\u00a0not from\u00a0reddit. It's weird to have people arguing about my relationship when frankly no one knows us or the situation we are in. I just wanted to share this\u00a0story\u00a0on here with my wife since we already talked this issue through. Still, reading your personal experiences and what you have gone through is helpful so please do share if you feel like doing so!\n\nAnd to the\u00a0people\u00a0messaging me calling my wife horrible things I\u00a0sincerely\u00a0want to say, fuck you. Calling me an idiot\u00a0is justified, calling my wife horrible is not.\u00a0\n\nEdit2: I'm getting so many comments about this that I've decided to\u00a0address\u00a0it here. I commented this before but I'm going to put it here too so people can see it better hopefully. Like some have said I wasn't really thinking about her when doing what I did, I made\u00a0the whole\u00a0surprise essentially about myself even though I didn't mean to. It was never my intention to make her feel bad even though I now realize that\u00a0of course\u00a0she would feel horrible for\u00a0the whole\u00a0day after I pretended to not remember her birthday. I've apologized for this and these things\u00a0were talked\u00a0about.\n\nReally the only thing I was thinking was about wanting to surprise my wife and not about how my way of going about it was going to make her feel. My dumb logic was that hey, my wife loves\u00a0surprises\u00a0so I have to make the\u00a0surprise\u00a0as\u00a0suprising\u00a0as I can, any way I can. I never intended to make her feel bad but my lack of thinking made that happen and I feel horrible for it.",

            "Pro tip: If your significant other expresses that they\u2019re unhappy in the relationship because you act like you don\u2019t care (I.e., they feel neglected), your best move is never going to be upping the ante from accidentally acting like you don\u2019t care, to acting like you don\u2019t care *on purpose*.",

            "For future reference, it's a dick move to pretend to have forgotten her birthday.

I just hope you understand that that's in fact what you did.",
            "So even if your plan worked out she was supposed to spend the day thinking you forgot her birthday? And then you'd be able to \"win\" by not having forgotten at all and proving her wrong? \n\n\nI seriously can't fathom how people can plan pranks or surprises that hinge on making the other person sad/insecure/angry/scared for extended periods of time (i.e. hours). Imagine how her day went, she didn't just go from 0 to divorce at 5PM, she likely spent the whole day going through the logistics of leaving you, especially those hours after work.\n\n\n>When she opens the door I'll be waiting for her with gifts, flowers dinner and everything romantic I could think of\n\n\nThis is also not really going the extra mile or anything, gifts flowers and a dinner seems pretty normal for a birthday. You just had to add disappointment to the mix.",
            "I wonder why people think that making you feel shitty before dropping the surprise is actually a good idea? I find it quite manipulative and selfish; just to make your surprise feel bigger... It\u2019s always better to tell that you have a surprise for later and make them feel the excitement the whole day, rather than making them feel neglected the whole day and then after the surprise, feeling ashamed for reacting badly without knowing there was a surprise...\n\nI hope everything turns out ok with your relationship but maybe you need to try to change your point of view and show a bit more empathy.",

            "Next time, say happy birthday the night prior. Like \"happy early birthday\". And if questions are asked about what and such, play it off as \"it's a surprise! You'll find out when it's ready\". The anticipation will be crazy.\n\nIf you want to really create anticipation, say stuff a week early like \"I'm really excited about your birthday and I'm planning something but it's a secret~\" and just keep reminding about how excited you are and she'll look forward to it all week. Throw in random chuckles and if she asks, say you're thinking about the surprise and it'll drive em mad.\n\nSource: personal experience",

            "I would hate it so much if my partner pretended to forget my birthday. Especially sitting at work half the day, it's all I'd be thinking about and I'd be in a terrible mood.

            "Does nobody actually think  about how other people feel? Does no one reflect on how they would feel if the exact thing happened to them? It never seems to be great for the person getting the surprise, they spend all day feeling like shit. It doesn't make your surprise better.",
            "Pro tip: never make a situation where your partner is surprised you did the right thing or cared for them.  Literally the opposite feeling anyone should ever feel. And making them really sad just to provide something to cheer them back up is quite frankly disgusting.",
            "So my big piece of advice as someone who has screwed up many times, but learnt how to get better: remember what the baseline expectation is. \n\nAlso, surprises and acts of affection are best when they are spontaneous. They say to someone \"I was doing something else and I saw this and it made me think of you because I love you\". Example: I occasionally go food shopping at a more expensive shop just because I know they have a great flower selection and I can usually pick up something that will make her go wow.",

There is no way that the \u2018surprise\u2019 would ever undo the memory of the hours of misery that preceded it, and it\u2019s likely that the natural response would not be relief and pleasure but anger, made worse by the victim blaming that would doubtless follow if you allowed your feelings to \u2018spoil\u2019 the surprise.\nEdited to add, I really don\u2019t care much about birthdays and anniversaries and wouldn\u2019t be much bothered if someone genuinely forgot.

Incels everywhere.\n\nOP, a relationship, especially a marriage, is effort that lasts a lifetime. Please don't try for a month or two then fall back into old patterns. Best of luck to both of you.",
            "Sounds like a bitch, I'm sorry but you don't just not come home, you need to have the decency of sitting on the bed and looking that person in the eye, with no hard feelings and just explaining that you feel like it's over\n\n\nIt doesn't seen to me like shes trying, it seems to me that she's just waiting for an excuse to justify a decision she already made a long time ago\n\n\nShe needs to understand that you are the best and to go back to her mindset of when you both got married",

            "Sorry to say OP but you're kinda screwed....divorce is not something that's brought up over a forgotten birthday. Its something that's tought about for a looong tine. All this was is a trigger for her to actually mention it. Its gonna take a lot more than a romantic evening to save your marriage at this point.",
            "This is what happens when you watch too many sitcoms.",
            "When I organized a surprise party for my mother's 70th birthday with all of her family from different cities, I simply told her I wasn't available the exact date, but I invited her to dinner the day after. And since I *had to be somewhere else*, I asked her to come sit my children. It worked great!",

            "You\u2019re an asshole: You made me cry. ;-) Good luck to you both.",
            "Unfortunately, that kind of surprise, had it \u201cworked\u201d, still makes it more about you than your partner.  She went all day feeling like you disappointed/ignored her again after she tried to communicate; even if you had been able to give her the \u201ctaa-daa\u201d surprise, it\u2019s a bit of an emotional whirlwind for the recipient. \u201cI\u2019ve spent all day thinking my partner really doesn\u2019t care any more and now I have to be pleasantly surprised and thankful\u201d...it can definitely read as you trying to make yourself look good, rather than doing something actually thoughtful for your partner.  If you had to leave them hanging all day in order for the surprise to work, it\u2019s pretty bittersweet.\n\nMy oldest brother did that to me as a kid; even had several phone conversations with me throughout the day, which made me feel sad bc I thought he forgot. He thought it was a fun buildup for calling me later in the evening to sing to me. He said he waited all day just to sing to me and I told him I didn\u2019t believe him, he forgot about me until our parents reminded him. \n\n\nIt\u2019s such a silly little incident from almost 20 years ago, but I remember it. I remember it because I already felt left behind by my big brother (he was my hero as a little kid and we were getting older), and his attempt at a \u201csurprise\u201d just reinforced how easily forgettable I was, rather than make me feel special.",
            "This is one of the reasons I think surprise parties are just terrible ideas. Yeah sure some people enjoy them but from my asocial pov, there's plenty of people who don't enjoy all the hooplah or the feeling that someone has forgotten about a special day. Doesn't help that my entire fam did actually forget my birthday when I was 10 and I waited the whole day for there to be a surprise.",

            "To all the people saying \"wow she really jumped to divorce, lots of red flags\" - have you ever been married or in a long term relationship? His wife had previously specified there was a big issue in the relationship and on a massive opportunity for her husband to show he cared, he missed that opportunity.  \n\n\nSometimes divorce gets mentioned - sometimes it is necessary to express to our partner EXACTLY where our boundary lies. Giving ultimatums constantly is obviously a toxic pattern but thats not what I glean from the story at all. \n\nHonestly it kinda sounds like the people who are saying this might be projecting a bit - this guy seems very self aware of his flaws and wants to change them. His wife also seemed very embarrassed and felt foolish after she realized the situation was different then how she perceived. If you're looking at this saying \"RED FLAG RED FLAG SHE TEXTED? FUCK HER\"it kinda just sounds like you are hurt or don't know how to handle tension in YOUR relationships.",
            "I was at a big event on mother's day once and was planning on calling my mom after the event was over to wish her a happy mother's day. As you can imagine, I came outside to a plethora of angry text messages about how I forgot about mother's day. That is why, regardless of what your plans are, ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS say happy birthday, mother's day, whatever on the morning of that day. Whether it's verbal or just a text message, let them know that you haven't forgotten about them, because the further into the day you go the more likely they are to get mad at you.",

            "As a general rule, a nice surprise should NEVER include something that upsets the recipient. Sours the whole thing.

Why. \n \nGlad it all worked out though! (For you, can't speak to plane guy's marriage.)",

            "1. Birthdays are overrated.\n2. Wife has felt this way for a long time, -- \" My wife has told me I need to make more of an effort in our relationship or we would have problems.\"\n3. Good job making an effort, OP. But doesn't sound like you went *that* big. You could try to incorporate personal items. I get why you went the surprise route -- \" My wife absolutely loves surprises\" -- but if birthdays are as important to our wife as implied, should do a basic thing form them and let the surprise be separate.\n4. You guys should be talking more often. It's her birthday. You didn't attempt to contact her until after 5pm. For people who are big on birthdays (sounds like your wife is, OP), they typically take the day off or leave work early. If you're really trying to surprise her, you should have been checking in with her more often to make sure she didn't get home early to ruin the surprise. Regardless of the birthday scenario, you should be checking in more often on a daily basis.\n5. As stated, the wife has felt this way for some time now, but her ignoring you and refusing to talk to you is emotionally immature of her, and nearly as emotionally manipulative as pretending to forget her birthday.\n6. Y'all need counselling.",
            "Ha! You should have given her something small at the beginning of the day. Maybe a flower or small trinket. I totally get your thought process though.",

            "I find the whole pretend to forget the bday thing to rarely ever work.  Sure it would be a cool surprise when she finds out, but you put her through a lot of stress throughout her day.  I know you didn't mean it, but you played that joke out for too long to the point where you sort of ruined her day.  \n\nYou probably could have sent her flowers at work, and hold the rest of the surprise when she gets home.  But either way what's done is done.  I'm glad to hear you are both seeking help.  Asking reddit for relationship advice is the last thing anyone should do.  Reddit has a habit of only seeing one side of things and not fully understanding the relationship.\n\nBest of luck!",

Hell, people will just go \"well I guess were not meant to be\" and divorce and never see a counselor. Marriage is hard work, and it never stops. It's so worth it though if you can work through your issues.",
            "This happened with my mom\u2019s 50th birthday. We spent a lot of time setting up this huge surprise party and had pretty good covers for where we were. So good that she would not talk to us that day because she thought we weren\u2019t doing anything at all for her."

As she starts to worry about the end of life in our solar system, i get sidetracked again and try to reassure her that we don't have to worry about the Sun swallowing Earth in its outer shell as a Red giant because our neighbouring galaxy Andromeda will already be merged with our galaxy, making it impossible for us to be have a home here anyways. \n\nAs my girlfriend digests this information, she starts to think of how humanity may end completely and how life, and our existence is basically meaningless which sends her into a panic attack, causing her to freeze up, have difficulty breathing, and start crying for about five minutes straight.\n\nNow I'm here, typing this up and trying to get her to relax at the same time by explaining how we are a relatively young species and have a long time to figure out a game plan, though I'm not sure if any of it is really helping.\n\nTL;DR I told my girlfriend the sun will eventually burn out, swallowing Earth in the process and eliminating all life, causing her to have a panic attack and cry before bed.",

I race walk on down to the men's shit house, I arrive finally, push open the door and head for the most private stall in the back because I had a feeling this one was gonna be quite loud. Upon getting to the door of the stall I noticed that the latch was sort of in between locked and open. I didn't think it would be wise to just open the door because it may well be occupied so I took a couple steps back to look under the stall to see if there were somebody's shoes in there that would tell me if it was indeed occupied....\n\nTwo things happened. As I bent down far enough to see under the stall, the occupant was looking under the stall right back at me...awkward...really really awkward. And given the urgency of the situation, the pressure of my leather belt against my lower abdomen caused me to fart, real loud, at that exact moment. I don't know if there are words to describe what seemed like an eternity when we both locked eyes with a loud, slow motion fart going off in the back ground was like. Wanting to laugh but afraid it would cause me to shit my pants, I waddled to an open stall and let 'er rip.\n\nTL;DR TIFU by waiting too long to head to the restroom, looking under a stall just to see someone staring back at me and I farted real loud at the same time because I had to take a crap so bad.",

Once we are about to land I\u2019m regretting this as its becoming clear I\u2019ve eaten something I shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nWe land, I rush to the bathroom and get into the only available stall.  Things are just starting to happen when a toddler age girl crawls under the door and stands up with a confused and somewhat alarmed look on her face. I do my best to cover the twig and berries but there\u2019s nothing I can do about the furious explosion of 5 hours ago airport deli sandwich.  \n\nOnce the echo dies down my new friend starts to cry but she stood her ground bravely.  What I assume was her father has reacted with some alarm however and starts calling her name in rather urgent tone as he paces back and forth in front of the stalls trying to find her.  I\u2019m almost frozen in shame / shock / realization that horrible smell is me combo but manage to creak out \u201cin here\u201d between cramps.

A few minutes later my ex comes out to tell me he was on the toilet looking at his phone when the manager came in and busted open the stall in a hurry.

        "selftext": "This happened 2 days ago. So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.\n\n2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.\n\nHuh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it's not yours?\n\nAngrily, she answers it's not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?\n\nI tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.\n\nSo last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...\n\nNow the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.\n\nYOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE\n\nJesus Christ, I don't even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don't have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.\n\nThe next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that I'd put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.\n\nTLDR : Found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.\n\nEDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.\n\nEDIT2 : The [thong](https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU) in question\n\nEDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I'll not be able to keep up! There's too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!\n\nEDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them. Finally, my friend's fabric softener is Fleecy.",

She finds it and immediately lets me know that is NOT her shirt. Her sister had just stayed with us maybe it was hers? Nope. Her bestfriend just stayed with us maybe it was hers? Nope. \n\nWell shit, I am thoroughly out of ideas at that point and I tried to explain how stupid it'd be for me to knowingly throw another woman's shirt in with my wife's clothes if I was in fact doing something shady. My wife was doing the thing where she says its fine but it does not feel fine and you know this will be an ongoing issue.  \n\nCue to sometime later when her bestfriend calls back explaining that she asked her friends who she was staying with before she came to our house and it ended up being one of theirs. Turns out she had grabbed it mistakenly when she was packing up, found it our place and assumed it was my wife's so she left it at our place.

So I kicked them under the baseboard of the freezer, wondering what the person who swept up would think when they were discovered.\n\nLater we figured out that we had done the laundry right before we left the house, and I had laid my coat on top of the laundry pile.

I've also known several mischievous women who did pull a stunt like visit a married guy's house and stealthily leave a pair of sexy underwear behind just to stir up trouble in the household. Whether the women did it to start a break up of the couple, or just for sick kicks, is anyone's guess. It's safe for the friend, because she can then simply pretend ignorance and suggest that the thong must've gotten stuck via static cling. Chances are pretty good that your wife thought of this and also realized that you'd just be the clueless victim instead of a cheater. Your wife will definitely keep a much closer eye on your female friend from now on. And you should keep this all in the back of your mind as well.

        "selftext": "I suddenly remembered this story today. I don\u2019t think I have ever told this story to anyone before. So here goes. \n\nThis happened a few years ago when I was a pre-teen. During the summer, my family and I went back to our hometown to visit my grandparents. We were short on rooms so my sister and I shared the same room the entire summer. We had separate beds, but sometimes my sister would trade blankets with me     because my blanket was thicker and warmer. \n\nOne day during the summer, I discovered porn. But instead of finishing the job when I watched it, I went to sleep that day without completing the experience. I woke up with wet spots on my bed and underwear the next day. \n\nAt the time, i was about 80% sure what came out of me wasn\u2019t pee, so I went on google to figure out what happened. I learned that I had a wet dream. I washed my underwear and my bed sheets but for some reason I did not wash my blanket.\n\nWhen I went back into my room, I saw my sister had switched blankets with me and I freaked out. I didn\u2019t say anything and just quickly left the room. I ran out of the room and googled \u201cCan you get someone pregnant from a wet dream?\u201d Obviously none of the results I was looking for popped out.\n\nI thought my life was over and I accidentally got my sister pregnant cuz she was using my blanket that had  a little bit of my ejaculation on it. The idea haunted me and I did not tell anybody because I was too scared.\n\nMaybe like a week after that, I finally got the courage to tell my dad that i got my sister pregnant. This was the conversation.\n\nMe: \u201cDad, remember when I accidentally peed on my bed\u201d\nDad: \u201cYea?\u201d\nMe: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t pee\u201d\nDad: \u201cYea I know it wasn\u2019t pee, you\u2019re going through puberty, it\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201d\nHe walked away. End of Conversation.\n\nAfter that conversation, I just decided to wait a few months to see if my sister was pregnant.\n\nNeedless to say, she was not pregnant. I was just a really dumb child.\n\nTL;DR I had a wet dream and I thought i got my sister pregnant bc she used my blanket.\n\nEdit: Holy shit this blew up, this is technically my first ever post. I\u2019m glad you guys enjoyed my suffering. I also want to add that I actually didn\u2019t learn sex-ed until 9th grade so everything I knew before was from google.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards, it almost makes up for the weeks of anxiety and stress lol",

It was probably after my first sex-ed class in 5th grade (not the actual first class - I mean the first 1-2 week session on sex-ed in science class during 5th grade). Anyway, I was convinced that since my sister and I shared the same bathroom, that she was going to get her period, and my semen was going to find her tampon, and we were going to have an incesstual cess-pool sewer baby, that was going to die in the pipes under our house. I mean I was SURE of this. I couldn't sleep at night for weeks.\n\nUntil, I decided that semen must be *green*, never white, what I had coming out of me was some fluke of nature, it wasn't semen, and all was well.... Until, 6th grade sex-ed came and I learned the color of semen was *white*, not green! I think at about this point I realized what I was doing was normal and I stopped worrying about orphan sewer fetus'. But that was a tumultuous year of guilt for a minute there.",

            "Not quite as bad but when I was like 10 we started health class at school. I either didn\u2019t pay attention or just didn\u2019t understand, because I thought a wet dream was just a side effect of puberty and it was essentially just wetting the bed. I had no clue it was ejaculation.\n\nOne night I woke up to a wet bed, it was either urine or sweat, but it definitely was not ejaculation. I was too embarrassed to tell my dad that I wet the bed at 10 years old so when I went to ask for help changing my sheets I told him I must have Ahmad a wet dream. He stared at me for a moment and left the room one the sheets were changed. Looking back I should have just said I wet the bed, because what I can\u2019t up with is far more embarrassing.\n\nUnfortunately he passed away two years later, before I realized my mistake and put two and two together about the whole wet dream process. So now I don\u2019t know if my dad thought he had a very open son or just a dumb one. Either way I\u2019m sure he got a great laugh out of it, which makes me happy.",

It was such a complicated situation from all the reports I had, but one of the most awkward conversations I ever had was about appropriate sexual partners. The gist of it was don\u2019t have sex with your sister and if I find any sister porn on your phone the judge is going to be so mad. \n\nI had plenty of awkward conversations with the kids. My training officer said to just be blunt and spit it and and the juvenile sex offenders are easy. They don\u2019t do drugs or fight but just want to give each other blow jobs and take dick pics.

As cute as he can be, it gets old after a while, and if you've ever had a boy, you know how they can become obsessed with their peckers. I told him one night that if he didn't put it away, the Pecker Snatcher would come and take it. He looked at me with some disbelief and said I was kidding him. I told him it was the truth, and that is what happened to his sister. His eyes got big and he put his pants on.\n\nFast forward a couple days and him and his sister have now elaborated on the story, and the Pecker Snatcher is now a man who has a basket full of peckers that he carries with him, and other elaborations on the story. All was good and well until he explained the entire mythology they created to their grandparents and teachers. Now I'm the weirdo. Parenting is dumb.\n\nTLDR: I created a fictional Pecker Snatcher so my son would put his pants on, and he and his sister elaborated on it and told other adults.",

(Yes, that has really happened with some young boys; the book *Flowers for Algernon* captures a fictionalized account of this anxiety.)

I\u2019ve had it for 4 years and we\u2019ve been through a lot together. So when he knocked it over (breaking off 3 of the largest branches in the process) I was PISSED. \n\nI told my students I\u2019d be right back and thought I muted myself, so I went to assess the damage and yelled \u201cNO\u201d several times. Then I tried to grab him so I could shut him in another room while I cleaned up my plant, but he kept running away from me. At this point, I said/yelled \u201ccome here you FUCKING RAT BASTARD!\u201d (A nickname sometimes said endearingly, although not at this particular moment).\n\nAfter successfully shutting him in another room and quickly trying to salvage the remains of my beloved money tree, I went back to my computer to see the following messages from students in my Zoom chat. \u201cYOURE NOT MUTED\u201d \u201cTHAT WAS WILD\u201d \u201cOMG MRS WE CAN HEAR YOU\u201d etc. Let\u2019s just say I had some apologizing/explaining to do after that fuck up. Let\u2019s hope I still have a job tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR: my cat knocked over my beloved plant in the middle of my teaching online, and i thought I was muted when I yelled off camera \u201cyou fucking rat bastard!\u201d My students informed me after the fact that they heard everything I said. Big yikes.\n\nEdit to add: [Cat tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bx3HG7Q)\n\nEdit 2: I went back to teaching and came back to my phone seeing that this has blown up :D All the comments have me cracking up.

        "selftext": "Obligatory it didn't happen today, however I realized my idiocy today.\n\nI am a small game developer part-time (I also have a regular job). Since more than 1 year I have been working alone on a puzzle-platformer that I've been thinking of for 2 years.\n\nIt's a labor of love. After about a year of hard work, I had something that I was proud of, and that I considered ready for release. It's a web game and when you release a web game, what you usually do is that you put it on a game portal. Maybe you remember flash game portals where office workers were slacking off on in the 00's (personally for me it was at school). Well they are still a thing except games are not made in flash anymore, but the idea is the same.\n\nAlso, when you are a web game dev, it's very well known that russians love web games. So if you manage to have russians liking your games, you are half the way there because you will get tons of players.\n\nSo anyway, I was ready to release my game, a bit apprehensive of course, I managed to get my game on a couple portals including a huge russian one.\n\nIn Russia, my game got wrecked. Everybody hated it. My game is a 0.8/10. I'm not kidding, I don't think there is a worse game on this portal. It felt like shit, and I was very puzzled.\n\nToday, I showed it to a colleague at my normal job, explaining to him that russians hated my game. I clicked fullscreen. Then I noticed it. The downvote button on that website was overlapping the restart button in the game. So people restarting a level (which happens fairly often) gave me a downvote along the way. I don't know if it's clear so [here is what the buttons look like](https://imgur.com/a/wu6rG9m). You can only see it when the game is fullscreen, which is why I did not notice before.\n\nSo here I am, a bumbling idiot. Where any scammer in his right mind would have used this trick for evil and profit, instead I tricked them into burning me to the ground.\n\nTL;DR: spent more than a year making a game, released it on a Russian game portal where the restart button was right under the downvote button. Everybody restarted, everybody downvoted and now I am the proud maker on the worst web game in Russia\n\nEDIT: wow thanks for the load of suggestion everyone! It looks like this post is blowing up, it's a first time for me! I think I'll try out move the buttons, then email the russian portal to explain what happened and ask them if they would reset the votes. Also since a lot of you asked for a link, my game is called [BombHopper.io](https://bombhopper.io/), if mods want me to remove this link I'll gladly comply\n\nEDIT 2: I'm currently at work, so I need to go for a while but I'll check back soon!\n\nEDIT 3: Holy shit this is crazy everyone! Now I have 21 times more upvotes on here than downvotes on the portal. And thanks for the Platinum, Gold and Silver!\n\nEDIT 4: I'm going to bed now but first I'd like to thank everyone who said nice things to me. I really appreciate it. I'm still overwhelmed by it honestly. This post made it to /r/all whooooo! I'll edit again when I get the answer from the portal.\n\nEDIT 5: It took a lot of time to get in touch with the portal, so I forgot to edit this post with the outcome, sorry! But for the few people that still stumble upon it: now BombHopper.io is actually the best rated game on Titotu (the portal) because they were kind enough to remove all the downvotes. But they kept the upvotes! Props to them!",

Much harder to share and host games so they don't get passed around as much and can run wildly different browser to browser which was not a problem with Flash.\n\nI think web assembly might one day be very similar where you are just sharing around a single binary again essentially, but even that is not quite the same and probably won't be there for a bit.\n\nAlso man the amount of devices right now really blows. It's almost impossible to make a web game now that will run on everything. It pretty much causes all games to be default design for mobile which is really limiting.",

When you run this game on a machine with low graphics performance the physics gets very jerky and unstable up to the point where it is not playable because the character drifts into the ground or other obstacles.\n\nIf you want to fix this you could look into decoupling the physics step from the screen redraw. The idea is to at least run the physics at a close to fixed rate on average. The graphics refresh rate doesn't really matter for this since you only \"sample\" the then current physics state at basically arbitrary intervals. If the machine is not able to handle the fixed physics rate then the game will just slow down but not break in a total random way.",

Story time.\n\nMy wife (40f) comes into the bedroom with an unknown dress she found in the dryer.\n\nWife: Where did this dress come from?\n\nMe: It's not yours?\n\nW: I know my own dresses. (At this point she is making light but there is smoldering anger behind those brown eyes and I am legit in danger).\n\nMe: Umm, I have no idea.\n\nAt this point I'm scrambling to come up with anything that doesn't make it look like I'm cheating, cause even I realize that despite being innocent this doesn't look good and I'm in trouble. I have no idea where the dress is from. Stalling for time I ask what size it is.\n\nA dumb fucking question. Not her size. Fuckity fuck.\n\nMore scrambling and I say: Maybe it was from daycare and sent back with my kid's (3m) dirty clothes?\n\nA stretch but I'm painfully aware the longer this mystery goes on the more screwed I am. No one has stayed at our house in the last 2 years.\n\nThe whole time I'm thinking: shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit\n\nI suggest maybe someone is sabotaging me. It sounded stupid the moment I said it but I mean, WTF is happening??\n\nI say: It's kinda nice, maybe you should try it on.\n\nPlease no one ever take advice from me ever.\n\nHer eyes are beginning to promise my horrible death despite still seeming amused but don't be fooled, the reaper was at my door.\n\nI'm literally sweating at this point and trying to keep it light-hearted is becoming more and more difficult. Has my dryer wormholed into another person's house in some twisted cosmic joke? Anything is possible now. My wife is losing her humour by the nanosecond as I stare dumbly at this goddamned dress.\n\nI'm at a complete loss and then a revelation comes to me in my moment of need. An epiphany for the ages! A memory to redeem every forgotten thing my notoriously bad memory has forgotten over the years on the daily.\n\nMe: Was it with that skirt my mom gave you?\n\nWife: \\*visible relief as she checks her phone\\*\n\nSure enough there is a picture of the dress in her messages of the items of clothing my mom gave her. High five brain!\n\nMarriage saved to screw up another day!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR An unknown dress materialized in the dryer and neither my wife nor I had any explanation for it. This did not reflect well on me, to say the least. Eventually we figured it out and my marriage didn't crash and burn.",

Something which wasn't out of the ordinary to bring out to the lounge of someone needed a larger mirror.\n\nI walked into her room and there was a note on the ground saying \"kittensandkettlebell, stop coming into my room and stealing my stuff\".\n\nI was so confused! Long story short, her dress somehow got mixed up with my boyfriends stuff and that's who the mystery dress belonged to.

She scampered, wearing only underwear, to her car parked on the next block and drove home. Needing to hide the evidence, you hid the dress in a laundry pile and then forgot about it.\n\nIs that about the most plausible scenario?

            "My ex fiance had a bad memory and she would go on trips for 1-2 weeks at a time. Her sister would come to our apartment and sleep on our couch if she was seeing her friends around Atlanta (where her sister lived was about 2 hours from Atlanta) so she would pack a small bag and stay for 2-3 nights. Her sister stayed for a couple days before she got back.  My fiance gets back from her trip and sees  undies that are not hers in the bathroom (her sister and her were different sizes but I never noticed) so she casually asked me why their are panties in the bathroom and I said I may have dropped them as I was gathering clothes for laundry that day. My male brain never picks up her cues about them not being hers and I just ask her make her point because I am tired of beating around the bush. She accuses me of cheating and I just deny it and she is getting admit about how all guys are prone to cheat because they have dicks and I mention how her sister was just here and how she told her that she could crash on our couch so she texts her sister a picture of the undies and her sister confirms that they are hers.

            "Great post. \n\nI had a dumb moment the other day, my mom was over and I told her one of my vacuum attachments got stuck on the side of the dryer where it was hard to get. Well while I was cleaning, she fished it out along with some black men\u2019s underwear I didn\u2019t remember ever seeing. \n\nBackstory: my husband used to wear all cotton Haynes boxer briefs, and like most men, he would wear them until the waistband broke if he could, holes or not. So I have slowly been buying him Duluth boxer briefs on occasions: birthdays, Christmas, anniversary, etc and since I do the laundry I have been slowly throwing out all of the Haynes ones. He may have like one or 2 left but he never wears them and all the others are Duluth. \n\nWell when my mom fished out the attachment, she fished out some Haynes boxer briefs. Now this sounds weird to most, but my mom is over a lot and I do laundry when she\u2019s over so she\u2019s seen his underwear, and I\u2019m pretty sure she noticed it\u2019s not the kind he wears. \n\nI\u2019ve never cheated and never have had the thought in my mind, but the look on my moms face of confusion had me sweating because I knew she thought they were not my husbands. I probably got over defensive explaining the whole underwear situation to her. It\u2019s like driving behind a cop when you aren\u2019t speeding and still freaking out for no reason. \n\nAfter all the worry that went through my head in those 10 seconds, she just shrugged and said \u201coh\u201d.",

            "Storytime...\n\nAn ex of mine (then girlfriend) had recently moved in. I soon discovered that her sister was not the greatest regarding personal space and boundaries. 4 months after she stayed with us (only for a weekend), my girlfriend found a pair of sexy panties in our room, tucked between the headboard, up against the wall. \n\nChaos ensued.\n\nNeither of us could explain how or why someone else's panties had been tucked away in our bedroom. We changed the bed regularly, but it somehow got missed because it was between the headboard and wall and not the mattress. I have never cheated on anyone in my life, but that didn't stop my girlfriend from accusing me. At some point, I asked her if she knew if her sister had used our room 4 months ago. That inquiry, though seemingly logical, did not help at all. \n\nNevertheless, she called up her sister. To my horror, her sister could not recall losing a pair. \n\nAt this point, she is assuming I am a lying, cheating asshole. And even though I never would do such a thing, the pair of unidentified panties clenched in her fist was not going to dispel her rage. And so she storms off out the door, tossing the sexy pair of panties in my face as she leaves. All my calls in an attempt to work this out go straight to voicemail.\n\n2 days later, she and her sister come back to pick up her stuff. They are about 1/2 way done when I toss the panties she left on top of one of her boxes. That is when her sister has a surprised look on her face. They were, in fact, hers. It turns out she thought she had left them at some guy's house and not ours. As it also turns out, she recalled she had used our bathroom instead of the guest bathroom to take a bath, which is why at some point, she had changed in our room, not the guest bedroom.\n\nAt that moment, my soon-to-be ex-girlfriend looks white as a ghost and looks like she was going to puke. She drops to the floor, screams, and breaks down crying. I, being a lot more understanding given the circumstance, try to comfort her. She kept repeating over and over, \"I did not know.\" The more I try to comfort her and ease her pain, the more she looks like she is breaking down. So I step back, and her sister has this horrified, sorry look on her face, but also I sense she knows something I did not. She, too, starts to cry and repeats over and over, \"she didn't know; it's not her fault.\"\n\nI again try to comfort her, and she loses it when I forgive her for thinking poorly. At this point, they are both crying so hard; I cannot make out what either of them is saying. And the more I forgave them for the mix up the guiltier and ashamed they both look. My soon-to-be confirmed ex is having a panic attack on the floor, tears everywhere.\n\nIt turns out during those 2 days; she had hooked up with several other guys. She had been cheating on me as a way to get back at me (revenge) for something I had now been vindicated as never doing (now proven innocent). While they sat there freaking out, I continued to bring her things to her car.",

        "selftext": "This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. \n\nStress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. \n\nSo, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). \n\nNot really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. \n\nAnd so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.\n\nI was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.\n\nSomehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. \n\nI don\u2019t really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.\n\nI snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. \n\nI\u2019m not going to talk about what happened next, as I don\u2019t want to relive the next few moments.\n\nMy father is just disappointed. He hasn\u2019t talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.\n\nMy mother believes that we should \u201cembrace my sexuality\u201d, and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. \n\nAnd I'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it\u2019s a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. \n\nBut it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.\n\nTL:DR Returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, I now live in shame.",

Why be all angry *still* , like a bitch and increase the mental scars on the kid, I understand initial anger but to be all angry still! As an adult? Come on get over it, and why over fucking react and consider \u201csexual therapy\u201d , thusly telling your son what he did was completely abnormal when you know he was blasted on medication . The poor kid right here on Reddit explained exactly what happened ! He was medicated and confused, he didn\u2019t whip his thing out and jerk in front of his family while completely sober. The parents are both adults they know most kids masturbate as their first form of sexual activity , especially boys. They act as if it\u2019s such an insane thing. I just think the best response would be to firstly , be upset that he did that and say you can\u2019t do that in front of others just to not totally justify the behavior but then secondly be a fucking person and understand he was medicated , third, be there for the kid and say \u201chey don\u2019t be embarrassed, it was a mistake, your not a bad person for that mistake bud, it was kinda fucked up, but we understand you were drugged up and what not\u201d.

        "selftext": "I want to start by giving some background here. I basically live, eat, sleep and breath Amazon. I need something, straight to Amazon. I use kindle and audible daily. Want to stream music, Amazon music. Want a new movie, prime video. Run out of something randomly, \"Hey Alexa.......\" Laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. Amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. So when looking for a place to store photos, I see \"prime members have free unlimited photo storage with Amazon photos\". Naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. Automatically upload photos from my phone? Even better. \n\nRewind to September 25th, my mom's birthday. I thought about her gift for a while, but when I remembered she didn't have a smart TV, the answer was easy. I hop on Amazon shopping and use my Amazon credit card to purchase one FireTV stick. She was so happy she could watch Netflix on her TV now. Yay, success! Or so I thought. \n\nYesterday I get an email from Amazon with the subject line \"welcome to the Fire TV family\" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! Not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did I imagine that it would sign in to my Amazon account without even asking for a password. Surely she'd have to use her own account. \n\nFast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. Eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. Sitting in my mother's kitchen, I glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65\" photo of my vagina. \n\nI spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. I happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. I'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. I took probably 40 pictures that night for my SO to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my ENTIRE FAMILY to view. I have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. \n\nNobody helped me. The remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where I'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. I didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, I just ran away. \n\nThe worst part, I asked Alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand \"sorry, I'm not sure about that.\" Fuck Amazon.\n\nUpdate: I promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. I talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. However, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. \n\nI'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an Amazon ad, I just wrote it how I wrote it because I thought it was funny. I wish Amazon was paying me for this crap. \n\nI'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. Yes I fucked up, I was a dumbass, that's why I posted it here. Yes, I should have known this could happen. Call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my SO do. It's fun. I don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. It happened. \n\nThanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. And thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!\n\nTLDR my sexy pics ended up on my mom's tv at a family party.",

        "selftext": "So this happened 6 years ago. My laptop with 8 GB RAM stopped working so I showed it to a repair guy. He took the laptop, repaired it, and returned it to me after 2 days. The laptop started working again and I was really happy. However, the speed felt slower than before. Previously, I could open multiple chrom tabs and still be able to play games while they were open but now it would drop a lot of frames and my laptop would start overheating. I thought maybe it\u2019s getting old so that\u2019s why the performance is dropping. So I didn\u2019t care much. \n\nFast forward to few days back. The same laptop stopped working again, so I called the same repair guy. He took the laptop again, repaired it and returned it to me in 2 days. This time when I started using the laptop, I could IMMEDIATELY tell something was off. The speed was RIDICULOUSLY slower than before. If opened just 2 tabs on chrome it would still overheat. I checked on YouTube for solutions and came across this video where he said to check on computer settings whether all my ram slots were functioning properly and all my ram cards were being detected. So I open computer setting and guess what I find out? It\u2019s reading only 2 GB of RAM! How the fuck did it drop to 2 GB from 8 GB?! I thought it must be an error so I restarted the laptop multiple times and it still read 2 GB. Then I called the repair guy and asked him about this. He replied \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor error. It will fix automatically over time. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d I was so confused. I didn\u2019t believe him so I opened the laptop myself and checked the ram slots and Guess what I find? ONE OF THE RAM CARDS IS MISSING AND the RAM card that was in it was NOT the one that I got with my laptop because I remember it had a stylish border. So I looked up the card number online and found out that it was only 2 GB. I called the repair guy again and asked him about this. He said that he was also repairing another laptop and swapped ram cards by mistake and he was really sorry. So he came home the next day, swapped the ram card with my original one and was about to leave when I asked him \u201cWhat about the second card?\u201d\n\nRG: What card?\nMe: The one that you stole from me years ago. \nRG: I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. \nMe: This is only 4 GB RAM. Don\u2019t try to fool me again. I\u2019m calling the cops. \nRG: Wait wait I\u2019m sorry!! I think I remember now!I\u2019ll bring it! I had forgotten about it!\n\nSo he brought it back and now my laptop is as fast as ever. I guess I would have never known about the stolen RAM card If I never called him again. \n\nTLDR; Laptop repair guy stole one of my RAM cards 6 years ago and I learned that recently. I confronted him about it and after threatening him of calling cops on him, he surrendered and returned it to me.\n\nUpdate 1: HOLY SHIT!!! I did not expect this post to blow up!! Thanks for all the awards! I have never got these many awards before! Speaking of the theif, I reported it to the customer service of his company. They told me they will take action against him. I will ask them again tomorrow and update it on this post.\n\nUpdate 2: The guy got fired from his company and got arrested! Apparently he had made over $5000 by selling stolen electronic parts from all his customers. He had stolen things like cameras and graphic cards etc. His company gave everyone of his customers a huge discount coupon in return as a token of apology. The cops are still investigating the whole chain of these scammers. I hope they get caught soon! Also I read most of the comments and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions people had:\n\n1. He obviously did not return the exact same RAM card to me. He must have bought the same model from one of his friends from the chain. \n\n2. How is this my TIFU? Well if I had investigated this the 1st time my laptop got slow 6 years ago, then I could have not only saved 6 years of slow processing of information, but also prevented others from getting scammed in that time period. \n\nThat fucker got arrested. It\u2019s a shame it took him so long. The lesson we should all learn from this is to be careful with whom you give your products to and try fixing things on your own. Don\u2019t be an idiot like me.",

            "In college I was visiting my aunt and uncle who lived 4 hours away.  Got in my car to go home and it wouldn't start.  Thankfully there was a car repair shop a block from their house.  Got told I needed a new starter for $400 (a huge amount of money to a kid surviving on waitressing tips).  I paid and when I picked up the car one of the repairmen wanted to show me a feature my car had \"just in case I hadn't noticed\".  It was an anti-theft switch under the steering column.  Didn't think much of it.\n\nUntil 3 months later when my starter died again.  I was really confused because I had just replaced it.  The honest mechanic I used in my college town told me it looked like the starter had never been replaced in my car.  I finally put two and two together (duh, I must have flicked the switch getting in/out of the car and they took the opportunity to swindle a stupid college kid).  Tried to call the previous repair shop for money back and they laughed in my face before hanging up.  My uncle went down to advocate on my behalf and since he's 6'4\" and a big guy (but mild mannered and too nice at times) they decided to give back the $130 starter costs \"under warranty\".\n\nAnd that's the story of how I got scammed, and why mechanics are on my list of about 3 professions that I don't trust unless I have a long history with one I've found to be honest (dentists and handymen/contractors are also on that list).",

One of them was a 22 year old teacher who was traveling by herself and a guest of the hotel. I get cut early and I decide to go out for a couple drinks. At a bar nearby, I see the guest - she is very clearly drunk and proceeds to throw up all over the bar. Now this part of town is kinda known for sleazy guys and she\u2019s by herself - so I take her back to the hotel and get her in her room safe before anyone can take advantage of her. I leave her my number to text me when she\u2019s awake to make sure she\u2019s okay and she thanks me the next morning and explains she was blackout drunk and barely remembers any of the night. I thought that was the end of it - until my boss pulled me into a room and proceeded to fire me for \u201cfraternizing with a guest\u201d. I explained that I only got her to her room safe and was worried because she was young and alone, but nope. I\u2019m officially unemployed now. For helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel okay.\n\nTL;DR - got fired for helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel room okay.\n\nEdit: for those asking for more information: I did take her in the closest entrance which was the employee entrance. I think this has a lot more to do with it. My boss is not a rapist and didn\u2019t slip her anything. And while I\u2019m thinking of naming them, I don\u2019t want to get at risk of going up against a large company. I\u2019m a broke 22 year old (and I am a girl, for all y\u2019all who thought I was a man) who was living paycheck to paycheck. I can\u2019t afford a lawyer. I did file for unemployment. I appreciate everyone\u2019s well wishes. \n\nTW: I actually had a very bad episode as a result of this and attempted. I\u2019m in the hospital now and will not have any way to update further for a while.\n\nEdit 2: thank you everyone, sincerely, for all the well wishes. I\u2019m back from the hospital and am staying with family until I\u2019m a little more stable. I appreciate everyone\u2019s kind words and support. I\u2019m unsure if anyone will see this since it\u2019s been some time, but I thought I\u2019d update.\n\nAfter much consideration, I\u2019ve decided to name the hotel: Viceroy Chicago. Whether or not you decide to stay there is entirely up to you. There are some wonderful people working there, but it seems they place liability above the mental or physical safety of their guests and employees. This is a passage from the email HR sent me:\n\n\u201cIn regards to your employment status with Viceroy Chicago, entering a hotel room with a guest, is in violation of Viceroy policy.  Colleagues are not allowed to stay at the property in which they work and Unauthorized entrance/access to any Viceroy space/facility, offices, guest rooms or computer information sources is conduct that Viceroy considers inappropriate and leads to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, which due to the severity of this infraction, we will terminate employment at this point.\u201c\n\nSo there you go. Do with this information whatever you wish. I understand their decision from a liability standpoint personally, but not from a moral or ethical standpoint. While I\u2019m the hospital I realized it was best I got out of there now anyway. I wish you all the best.",

If she decides to start shit, or lie about her interaction with you, it's not going to go well for you, or your place of business.  Drunk young women are simply bombs waiting to go off.  Call the bomb squad.  I get that this thread will be filled with people with honest intentions, but the world is not full of people with honest intentions.  here's a scenario for you:  You escort drunk girl back to her room.  Her boyfriend enters later and rapes her.  Last thing she remembers is you walking her to her room, and nothing afterwards, except for the fact that she was raped.

Maybe next time if you find yourself in a similar situation you might want to get another employee to be there with you too - firstly to corroborate your side of the story, and secondly carrying drunk people could put a lot of strain on your back - don't end up throwing out your back and getting injured for it.

            "Assuming the hotel has some corporate backer, it's worth filing a complaint with HR over the thing. Get your side on paper with them, as opposed to just your direct manager or whomever. No crazy accusations, just the simple \"While off-shift, I saw an incapacitated guest safely to her room. This was miscategorized as fraternization and I was summarily fired. I don't believe the implied disregard for guest safety is in keeping with the expected behavior of *BLAH BLAH HOTEL*\"\n\nDon't expect a quick response, or necessarily anything at all, but it may change their response when someone calls doing an employment history check at the very least.\n\nOn the off chance the boss *does* have sleezy reasons for taking issue with this (statistically speaking, most men aren't serial predators), you've at least added a data point to correlate when somebody does make a claim.\n\nFinally, if you got hit with some policy (like being seen with the door shutting behind you as you entered a guest's room on a security review), you may at least get an explanation out of the thing. Only if it's a really clear-cut policy. Generally, the rule is to give a fired person as little information *why* as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: not accusing you of making crazy accusations, there are those in the thread ready to convict your boss as a serial rapist though.",

As honorable as you were, she was blitzed and could have not believed you only got her to her room safely. You helped a very drunk woman to her hotel room by yourself. Keep doing the honorable thing, but ask someone to accompany you as a witness the next time. Just for your protection.",
            "Does fraternizing with a guest count when it's outside of job hours? If it does, that sucks OP and I am sorry for your unfortunate circumstances.\n\nI guess this is a clear example of \"No good deed goes unpunished.\" Doesn't make sense, but, sadly, it is true."

Let\u2019s call him Gardening Club Guy. \n\nSo I spend the day before plucking, prepping and getting the perfect outfit together for my night with GCG. I ultimately choose a nice little push up bra that matched my undies and made the titties look very nice. I don\u2019t normally wear bras like that, but it seemed like the occasion to.\n\nWhat started as a great night together, turned into a great morning together, which turned into a great afternoon and evening together! \n\nI eventually return to my place and start reminiscing of the stellar sex that was had, and decide to shoot GCG a message about how last night I thoroughly enjoyed whatever he did with his tongue that made it feel like there was a tiny tornado rampaging my clit (I firmly believe if your partner does something you like/ that gets you off and you want them to do it again..TELL THEM)\n\nGCG thanks me and then says \u201c So last night when I was feeling your breast..\u201d\n\nand here I am, getting in the mood to do some reminiscing when all of the sudden GCG drop kicks my life with \u201c...I felt a firm lump on your left breast. I didn\u2019t want to not say anything.\u201d \n\nSo now I\u2019ve gone from horny to horrified in 2 seconds flat. I had just gotten a breast exam a few months ago, so it seemed downright impossible..\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m grabbing my breasts like a mad woman trying to feel for any weird lumps, when the deceivingly nice little push up bra thrown over the chair catches my gaze. \n\nThe realization sets in and I start spontaneously laugh-crying. \n\nGCG got a firm hold of the spillage/over flow of boob that didn\u2019t quite make it into the bra.\n\nHe grabbed the fat.\n\nThen proceeded to inform me of his findings.\n\nI thanked him and let him know about my previous cleared breast exam, but welcomed him to come by to feel me up and really show me what he meant..you know, just to be sure. He was happy to hear I had one done so recently and said he\u2019d be more then happy to show me.\n\nBasically I\u2019ve found a super sweet guy who I get along with wonderfully, and clearly doesn\u2019t want me to die anytime soon. I\u2019m extremely thankful. \n\nTL;DR hook up thought he found a lump in my breast that turned out to just be a fat roll due to an ill fitting bra\n\nEdit: I got a breast exam at my local plannned parenthood yesterday just to be sure. No cancer here, just fat!\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tag NSFW! My bad, I really should have seen that one coming. For those asking about planned parenthood, the facility in my area is called a family planning center. They offer yearly exams, information about birth control, std testing etc. I believe they work with planned parenthood. And to clarify the fuck uppery on my part lol, I could have  avoided a really awkward conversation if I had just worn proper fitting clothing.",

            "Back in my late teen years I thought about going into medicine. So I read a lot of books about medical school and training to become a doctor. One book was a memoir and was fairly detailed about diagnostics.\n\nLate one evening, a girl I knew knocked on the door and told me she needed a place to stay for the night. I invited her in and offered her the couch or my bed. She crawls in with me and one thing leads to another. \n\nSo I was going down on her and I had a hand on her lower belly and I felt something kind of hard and roundish. So my mouth and hands/fingers are occupied but my brain is saying \u201cyou just read about this...\u201d\n\nShe had a good time and returned the favor and we are laying in my bed, having a cigarette and I say \u201cUm, is there any chance you could be pregnant because...\u201d and I explain it. Then feel again and get her to feel.\n\nTurns out she needed a place to stay because she had a fight with her parents about her boyfriend. \n\nAbout a week later she knocks on the door again, this time with a suitcase. She was pregnant and her parents had kicked her out. The boyfriend dumped her. \n\nShe stayed with me for a couple of months and I nursed her through morning sickness and hormones raging. I told her she could stay as long as she needed and I would help her all I could. But I wasn\u2019t the father of the baby and I didn\u2019t have the money to help with medical treatments etc.\n\nAnyway, I came home from a weekend trip and she was gone. A few years later, at home on leave from the Navy, I see her in a department store with her husband and two kids.",

        "selftext": "This actually happened over Christmas last year.\n\nMy family, including (paternal) my grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having Christmas dinner. \n\nMy grandfather brought up that he did AncestryDNA (or was it 23and me?). I don't remember the exact one, because I can barely think about it. It's hard just writing this up.\n\nIt was really cool to hear what he found. He found mostly Scandinavian spread out over the British isles, particularly Wales. We knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% Persian! Very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. He's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. \n\nThe only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of King George III. The reason why I question this is King George III is recorded as one of the few Kings who never had a mistress. \n\nHowever, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of King George III (we are descended from the woman). He mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.\n\nANYWAY, off topic. I thought it was fascinating, and I love hearing what he's found. I brought up possibly using my Christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. I don't think I was really going to do it, I usually use the money to pay bills.\n\nSilence. And it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. Everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.\n\nMy sister and I look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. My parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. We look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. I have weird Hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. My sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. \n\nI always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. I never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair I have such cool pretty eyes. \n\nWell, okay.\n\nDad starts first. Dad (D), Mom (M), Sister (S), and Me.\n\nD: There's a chance 3ar3ara_G0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.\n\nS and Me: Imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. My sister grabs my hand (I love her big sister ways).\n\nMe: Okay, um... \n\nD: Your mom never had an affair. This isn't some cheating story.\n\nMe: Wha.. (I start to feel very sick).\n\nM: I hoped to never have to tell you this. I was raped. The reason we're not sure is because your dad and I had sex earlier that day.\n\nMe: (I want to die, I start crying). Everyone else knows though, if they left the table.\n\nD: Your grandparents know.\n\nS: Okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?\n\nM: No, they wouldn't move forward with the case. \n\nMe: He's still out there?\n\nS: But obviously we're far away from this guy, right?\n\nMy dad and mom look at each other. \n\nM: It was my brother.\n\nI felt so sick. I felt... dirty. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I couldn't stop shaking. My sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. We probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.\n\nOur husbands were just stunned and quiet.\n\nThe rest of the vacation was just weird. If it weren't for my nephews, I'm pretty sure I would have just gone home.\n\nOh my nephews are wonderful.\n\nWell, we came home, and I had to battle with the \"Do I want to know?\" thoughts. I could get a DNA test. But I couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. But it weighed on me too much. I had to know in order to move forward. So I asked my dad if he would submit his DNA with mine. We weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. It was hard asking him to not say anything to her. He should be able to talk to his wife.\n\nSo we submitted the test. \n\nI am my father's daughter. I cried when I got the results. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\nI made a decision not to tell my dad - I wanted to surprise them. I kept saying I hadn't gotten the results back. I did tell my sister though.\n\nI gave them the piece of paper on Mother's Day. I was going to wait until Father's Day, but I couldn't. So I got a blank card. \n\nInside I wrote: \"Mom, Open the paper.\" She opened it and I had written Happy Mother's Day, and Happy Early Father's Day. \n\nLots of hugs and tears that day, yah? \n\nThank God.\n\nEDIT: left out half a sentence, oops. \n\nIt was my uncle on my mother's side. I have met him. My sister and I were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. \n\nFamily did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. \n\nMy parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. Two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. Incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there I guess was his reason. Plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. \n\nMy mom didn't go No Contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. Why that long, I have no idea. Those are her reasons. \n\nShe did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. I guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.\n\nGrandmother is dead now.\n\nThis happened in Louisiana. \n\nEDIT 2: Mods, if this isn't considered appropriate for this sub, please feel free to take it down. I thought I fucked up by the secret coming out in the first place. But it is a happy ending. I leave it up to you glorious mods.\n\n**TL;DR:** I found out I could have been the product of a rape - by my Uncle. Anxiety and tears ensued. Found out I am my father's daughter. Surprised them.

I just wonder if they avoided knowing yours lest it confirm the answer they were afraid of (like if Mom is O, Dad is A, and they found out you had type B, they'd have known you couldn't be your father's daughter).  It wouldn't be guaranteed to tell, but it just occurred to me that that's a way they could have potentially known for sure without a paternity test, so maybe they actively avoided it to be safe.",

She would step on a piece of dirt on the floor and fall down screaming \"Me hurt foot\" or hit her head on a pillow and make a huge deal out of it. We don't watch soccer so I have no idea where this behavior came from. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe is 2. I am her mom so she believes everything I say. I used this to my advantage and told her that kisses fix everything. Stub your toe? Get a kiss. Smack yourself in the face with a broom? Kiss. Cut your finger with the fake knife? Kiss. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was going great. She caught on quick and, instead of screaming, always asked for a kiss for her \"hurt\". How could this go wrong? Well I did not foresee the world falling apart and needing to work from home with my 6 month old and 2 year old. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome days it's great. They are amazing and the only reason I'm staying sane. Other days.... Nothing makes you reevaluate your decision to have 2 kids 18 months apart like being trapped in a house with them 24/7. *kidding*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is one of those days. My daughter was eating her breakfast while I was on a video call. She bit her tongue and started crying. Then she stopped and I saw the look on her face. She recovered and I thought she figured it out on her own and forget about it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo here I sit on a very important video meeting and my 2 year old comes running in screaming \"MOMMY KISS TONGUE\". I am trying to shift my 6 month old so I can turn off the audio and video. I managed to mute it (after she screamed of course) but didn't get the video shut off in time. My 2 year old sticks her tongue out and shoves it at me for a kiss as I'm opening my mouth to tell her no. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that's how her tongue went straight in my mouth  while all my coworkers were watching. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext time on Our Series of Unfortunate Events, she will probably be naked climbing the cabinets in the background. \n\n\n\n\nEdit: For all of you so concerned that my terrible parenting is the reason my daughter is dramatic - My daughter's behaviors are constantly and appropriately ignored/redirected and she uses a social-emotional program to learn how to handle big emotions in a little body. (Almost like I do this for a living!) She is intelligent, kind, caring, and yes, *dramatic*. She is strong-willed and a performer. She will put on a show even if her teddy bear is the only one watching. \n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes, I did teach her kisses fix her hurt. That is something I specifically did for MY child because, personally, I don't think it's so bad to live in a world where mama can fix everything, even if only for a little while. \n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: taught my daughter that kisses fix hurt and she French kissed me",

It shocked them that she wasn't fussing over them.  They would just nod and get back up to play.\n\nShe said her proudest moment was on the playground.

            "This reminds me of Alexis, this adorable 3 year old with brown hair in ringlets and coke bottle thick glasses, who I babysat in like 1985 (yeah, she was named after the Dynasty character). I didn't really understand the repetitive nature of toddlers and mistakenly made up the \"Squish Squish\" game for her.  \n\nShe was legit like a picture of the perfect little angel toddler, and was straight up the child from Hell!  She physically destroyed everything, like a rockstar in a hotel room, and I was desperate to get her to stop or at least help me clean up the evidence that I lost all control of her every time I sat her.\n\nShe was in the bathroom, and I waited right outside the door to clap, cuz she was new at the potty.  When she was done and flushed, I headed in to heap on praise, but found the room covered in tissues, cotton balls, q-tips and makeup applicators.  She had dumped all of the products her parents kept on the counters in containers and jars and spread them ALL OVER the room.  Sighing, I started with the cotton balls, and I taught her to put each product away in the right jar and say \"squish squish\" as you pressed them down to make room for more. Making it a little game.\n\n   She adored the game.  We \"squish squished\" the whole bathroom.  The items weren't perfect any more but they were put away, so who cares?  The cotton balls and q-tips and make-up applicators were all in place.  Tissues in the box.  Until she squealed \"AGAIN!!!\" and flung the containers around as I grabbed for her and she got away like a slippery little fish.  She doubled down on her destruction this time, and now the paper products were joined all over the room by the magazines, baby powder and the contents of a little trash can.  I was stuck in that bathroom for two hours, playing \"Squish Squish\" over and over again.  Thinking at first I was a genius for teaching her to clean up.  Not knowing she'd make bigger messes to play the game for as long as I was there.\n\n  The NEXT time, she graduated to the kitchen trash can.  Coffee grounds and orange peels, the whole nine.  I didn't return her mom's call for a sitter after that.  I actually went out and got my first real job to avoid it. She was the most adorable thing you've ever seen in your life, and I'm not a huge fan of kids, so that is really saying something. But she knew how to destroy a household in 3 seconds flat.  You ever see the video of the two little boys who got flour all over the house?  Those kids had nothing on Alexis.  She'd get into the used litterbox.  Her mom kept that house near immaculate, I have no idea how with Hurricane Alexis. \n\n   To this day, when I press the trash down or shove something in a bag that doesn't quite fit, I say \"Squish squish,\" and think about her.  I even did it today.  \n\nTL/DR: reminds me of the little girl I taught to clean up her messes, playing \"Squish Squish.\"  Not knowing she'd make mess after mess, because toddlers like to play the same game over and over again.",

        "selftext": "Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.\n\nThis is where the fuck up happens.\n\nAfter around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.\n\nI'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.\n\nShe starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. \n\nRight on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.\n\nI sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.\n\nAlthough me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(\n\nTL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",

        "selftext": "Last Saturday, I woke up in the middle of the night. No big deal, but I immediately noticed something wrong with my left ear. I had no pain, but every few seconds I would hear a loud crackling noise in my ear. I have experienced an earwax blocking before, but I had never heard this sound before. This made me concerned, so I tried googling my symptoms, but to no avail.  \"It's probably just an earwax blockage, right?\", I think to myself. I stuffed a cotton pad with olive oil in my ear to soften the earwax and returned to bed. After putting the cotton pad in my ear, the crackling sound stopped, but it was replaced with some soft ticking sounds. It made it hard to fall asleep, but eventually, I managed to drift off\n\nThe next morning, the noises in my left ear had stopped. Great, but there was still wax in my ear, because I could hear it move when I put pressure on my ears. Over the course of the next days, I tried to remove the ear wax myself. I put water in my ear, more cotton pads with olive oil and I even tried to get it out with tweezers (I know I shouldn't have done that, but I was impatient and really wanted to just get the earwax out and be done with it). All these methods failed to get the earwax out, until today.\n\nI was once again stupidly poking around with tweezers inside my ear, when I finally managed to grab the earwax. Excited, I took it out and wanted to look at what my ear had just birthed. To my horror, the blockage in my left ear was not caused by earwax, but it was caused by what looked like a kind of tiny moth. This creature had somehow managed to climb into my ear at 2 a.m., caused me to wake up and couldn't leave my ear because of the cotton pad I had stuffed inside.\n\nI am still trying to process that I had a dead moth in my ear for half a week.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards and for all of your own ear bug horror stories in the comments! It makes me feel less unfortunate to have experienced this. Also, to answer a common question: I posted a picture of the moth in the comments and people have been asking how big it was. It looks pretty big in the picture, but it was only around a centimeter big.\n\n\n\nTL;DR I thought I had an earwax blockage, tried removing it on my own, turned out it was a moth trying to make my ear its home or something.",

I've only ever seen what appeared to be insect legs after a patient told me he thought he got a bug out of his ear. A Facebook page of audiologists I follow just recently had a post from an audiologist who had a tick in her ear! \n\nMy recommendation though if you've got concerns about wax (or bugs!) is to either go to an urgent care, or call a local audiology/ENT office to get checked out. Most at-home earwax removal attempts are generally unsuccessful, or cause injury to the eardrum or deeper middle/inner ear structures.

I then woke up to an e-mail saying there was a zoom meeting at 11am. So i immediatly turned on my pc and joined the meeting and asked a friend of mine if he also joined ? He didnt even know what i was talking about so i texted him the meeting id and the password and asked him if he wanted to listen to the lecture together on discord. He said \"yes\" so we hopped onto the discord together and begun trashtalking the prof for the bad communication where i called him a son of a bitch for sending the mail at 10am for a lesson at 11am. Now heres the problem. Every lecture i had last semester immediatly muted everyone who joined so in my mind i was muted....Turns out i wasnt and immediatly my phone got flooded with messages asking me to turn my mic off.Great start to the new Semster, i hope you guys had a better day than me today :D\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR thought i was muted and called my prof a son of a bitch in fornt of 150 people while trashtalking him with my friend",

I thought I\u2019d see them again the next week, but then the wheels fell off the world.\n\nLast night, I was running delivery out to cars. I see Mr. Married. Shifts are limited, so I need cash badly- online tutoring would be great. I virtually body slam my co-worker to deliver his food.

Slow blink.\n\nI do not clue into the FU. I say, \u201cYour wife said you were interested\u2026\u201d\n\nHis head shifts 45 degrees, cocked and questioning. He stares blankly at me, inexplicably silent.\n\nIn a moment of cognitive dissonance, I hear my brain misfire as I realize he thinks I\u2019m propositioning him.\n\nI blurt, \u201cTutoring. Your wife wanted me to tutor your son in math.\u201d\n\nHe nods slowly, and we both pretend that shit show didn\u2019t just happen as he says, \u201cYeah. Alright. Okay. Bye.\u201d\n\nI fake a smile and bolt back inside.\n\nI\u2019m half-hoping I never have to see the man again but the other half knows that I have 4 packs of ramen left and prays this traumatic cringe has not made it too excruciatingly awkward to hire me.\n\nTL:DR gave a married man my number to tutor his son.

I was 11 years old and began to have really bad pains around my lower back. Went to the doctor and x-rays confirm that I was having a kidney stone. Doctors thought it was highly unusual for an 11 year old to have kidney stones so they made me an appointment with a specialist.\n\nFast forward a week later, 9/11, I return to a specialist doctor so they could check me out and run more tests. So, my dad and I are waiting in the room waiting for the doctor, playing \"I spy\" or something, and they doctor walks in. He tells us that he wants to check my prostate to see if there is anything unusual going on.  My dad consented and then I was told to drop my pants. \n\nThe doctor puts on his gloves, gets the lube ready and then it was go time. The doctor then checks my prostate, feeling all around to determine is there was anything unusual. Here is where the fuck up comes. While the doc is doing his thing, I look straight into my dads eyes and say \"wow this feels good\".  My dad just looks at me with a blank stare. At the time I didn't think anything of the comment but now looking back, i'm not sure who felt more uncomfortable, my dad or the doctor who was still conducting the test. I cringe every time I think about this now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr -- Got my prostate checked out by a doctor in front of my dad and told him it \"felt good\"",

She is a bartender and didn\u2019t want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. \n\nMe, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. So I jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. \n\nWhile I\u2019m making my journey, I decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. I\u2019m in a pretty great mood. I had the day off and my SO was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some New Girl. \n\nMy journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. Just open desert. So while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. \u201cWhat can I do to add a little romance to this situation? Cover the bed in some dove chocolates? Maybe some flowers?\u201d \n\nI make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. Miraculously, I made it back home before her.\n\nFinally I decide, \u201cNah, romance isn\u2019t nearly as great as comedy.\u201d So when I get home, I break open the box and spell out \u201cAnal?\u201d on the bed with the tampons. \n\nSO gets home and goes straight to the room to change. I follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. \n\nShe takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. Now she won\u2019t stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is \u201cfamous\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve created a monster. \n\nTLDR; Spelled out \u201cAnal?\u201d with my SO\u2019s tampons. She thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. Reddit agreed and now she thinks she\u2019s famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.\n\nEdit: WOW! My first ever medal. Thank you kind stranger. Now at least I can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.\n\nEdit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. Whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.\n\nEdit 3: we are ending this \u201ccontest\u201d at 11:59 PST on 7/17/19. It looks like I am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, I would like to say a few things... I had no clue this would blow up like this. I thought I\u2019d get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while I\u2019ve been in here for a year. This has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. \n\nThat being said, please go show her some of that love I know reddit is so capable of showing.

        "selftext": "I want to preface all of this by saying that Ben Shapiro sucks, and I\u2019m in no way attracted to him, which is why this is such a monumental fuck up. \n\nI have found myself extremely amused by all of the Ben Shapiro memes that have been going around. I found the interview where he said, in response to Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s song WAP, that his doctor wife told him women didn\u2019t get wet absolutely hilarious. That\u2019s about the extent of knowledge and familiarity I have with him and his viewpoints. \n\n\nThe other night I met up with a tinder date. Things were going well and we ended up going to bed together. This is NSFW and sorry for the TMI, but he said \u201cyou\u2019re so wet\u201d to which my brain, for some reason, decided this sexy moment was the perfect time to crack a joke. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Ben Shapiro\u201d is what it wanted me to say. With all of my might I tried to force this comment down, not wanting to bring up Ben Shapiro during sex for the first time with this guy, and succeeded in not letting it rise to the surface. But my idiot self was so amused by the dumb joke I had made in my head that a felt a laugh bubbling up instead. Now, most men don\u2019t really feel so good when a woman laughs in their face right after they\u2019ve gotten undressed, so I was really trying to divert that laugh in whatever way I could and decided to try and let it out as a seductive sigh. But clearly the raging conflict and suppression I was engaged in caught the attention of my sexual partner, and he stopped and said \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\n\nMy brain was in such a state of disarray that the seductive sigh came out as I answered his question in the most basic terms possible: \u201cBen Shapiro,\u201d I moaned. His expression was indescribable. Shock, uncertainty, revulsion, all crossed his face in the same split second. We still did the deed but he didn\u2019t finish lmao.  I feel like even if I tried to explain myself, there\u2019s no fixing it. Haven\u2019t heard from him since. \n\nTLDR: brain wanted me to make a Ben Shapiro joke during sex, accidentally moaned his name instead\n\nHoly shit this blew up. Just gonna address a couple points \n\n- this happened mid coitus. After the momentary pause he went back to business. I was kinda frozen up by what occurred and by the time I regained my sense it seemed like I\u2019d be digging my own grave deeper if I brought it back up \n\n- obviously I know I did pretty much everything wrong I could have done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s in this \nsub and not in r/MyLifeIsAwesome. If I could go back I would change things. Next time I\u2019ll just make the joke lol \n\n- neither of us has reached out since. I think we\u2019re both happy just pretending it never happened\n\nI\u2019m glad my unfortunate sexual encounter could bring y\u2019all so much joy haha. Makes me feel a bit better about it. Maybe one day I\u2019ll try stand up and incorporate this story into my routine haha",

Right before I went to the bathroom, I popped a warhead sour candy in my mouth. I went to the bathroom, stripped down and hopped in the shower. just as I put my head up in the shower to rinse my face, the warhead in my mouth slipped back and *got stuck in my throat AND I STARTED CHOKING.* I realized this, and after a few seconds of 'AWGHWAGWHAGWH' I jumped out of the shower and RAN out of the bathroom, to my parents room, the only place where people are that could help me. I BARGED into their room, cheeks out, balls-a-dangling, and continued my 'AWAGWGHAWGAHW' noises. Their initial reaction is what you would expect for you to run in buck naked in front of your parents. Then, they realized I was choking, and my dad jumped out of bed, grabbed me and proceeded to do the Heimlich maneuver on me. That hurt like hell, I'll tell you that. after a few reps, the warhead in my throat shot out and landed on the carpet. I collapsed on the ground, soaking wet, legs splayed with His Majesty in full view. I then realized what just happened and I, AN 18 YEAR OLD DUDE, am lying naked in front of my VERY CONCERNED STARING parents. I grabbed the candy, which was lying next to me, shouted a thank you, and BOOKED IT back to the bathroom.\n\nI haven't seen either of my parents since, I would like to book a 3am flight to Alaska, if anybody can do that for me HMU\n\nTL;DR I choked on candy while in the shower, and my parents had to do the Heimlich maneuver on my naked self.",

We had been working on rebuilding his jet ski engine and at the end of the night he went home and was walking through the garage on his way into the house when he noticed a can of brake parts cleaner (BPC from here on) on a shelf. \n\nSo Jack decides that since he has seen me and my friends clean grease off of parts with BPC with such ease, why not use it to scrub his arms? Jack takes the BPC into the house (lives with his parents) and proceeds to hop in the shower with said BPC. He said that he had just finished giving his arms a good coat of BPC and was scrubbing down when the fumes mixed with the steam from the shower started to make it hard to breath and his eyes started to water up and burn. At this point he\u2019s completely unable to see and reaches down for the soap to try and get the BPC off of his arms as quickly as possible when he fucked up and accidentally hit the sprayer on the aerosol can of BPC spraying himself directly in the dick/balls. \n\nAt this point, he said it felt like someone had sprayed him in the junk with bear mace (BPC is *very* irritating to soft skin, ask any mechanic who has ever gotten it in their ear!) so, with no other options, he climbs out of the shower, still unable to see and rips the bathroom door open, collapsing onto the hallway carpet, fully naked, right in front of his mom. There was a bit of an exchange here but it was very awkward as mom tries to help him up and figure out what the hell is going on. \n\nAnyway, after airing out the bathroom and catching his breath, he finished the shower and said he ran cold water on the affected area. He called me afterwards to ask what to do and all I could do was laugh at him. While on the phone he tells me about the cold water (bad idea, cold water contracts skin pores, basically trapping in anything that has been absorbed) and that he is currently laying in bed with the ceiling fan on full blast, air conditioning set as low as it would go, wrapped in a blanket with only his D/B hanging out. \n\nHe was fine the next day.

I'm sure they're just relieved that you're ok and glad that they were there to help.   You did not fuck up by not dying.  Though you did fuck up by getting yourself into that situation, lol.",
            "Hey Op, glad you're alright! Since no one seems to have mentioned it, I'd suggest going to the hospital/ doctor if you can - the heimlich maneuver can cause internal damage as it is usually pretty rough. All the best, and as everyone else said, your parents don't care you were naked, they care that you're alive!",
            "Don't be afraid to go to the hospital if you start feeling anything strange. The Heimlich is very violent for your body to go through. Being young and from what it sounds like it wasn't very much so you should be ok but keep it in mind.",

At that point survival mattered more than embarassment. \n\nAbout 4 years prior to that event I also choked on some salami thanks to my expander plate in my mouth. Wrapped around the bar along the roof of my mouth and dangled down my throat. Father ended up giving me the himelick infront of the family during dinner. Ended up throwing up all over the carpet and ruining everyone's appetites. Hurt a lot too.\n\nOn the bright side I'm still alive and kicking so that's a plus.",

            "In cases of chocking the most important thing to do is to not panic. Do not try to take a sharp breath, this invariably leads to the lodged object becoming more lodged and it just makes things worse. \n\nWhat to do is to calm down, and take a very shallow breath if you can. Most blockages are not completely air tight so as long as you keep things calm you should be able to get some air in. Then with air in your lungs you can have a try at pushing the object out or at least will be able to remain conscious enough that you can then seek help from another person. \n\n1.\t\tStay calm\n2.\tShallow breaths\n3.\tClear blockage or seek help\n\nGood luck folks. \n\nSource: first aid course, also have almost choked a few times now, apparently I\u2019m somewhat prone to it \ud83d\ude15chicken, it\u2019s always chicken for some reason",

Lange zeit.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nEdit: Wow. Ok. First, thanks for the gold and the silver. My most popular post ever is about me being a moron. Good feeling. Yes, I will never be looking at my phone without sitting or lying down again.\n\nSecond: for those claiming I'm lying because I haven't answered, I'm Australian dudes. I posted this at 11pm and then went to sleep. I'm in the hospital. Calm the farm. For those who require it though: Broken Leg https://imgur.com/gallery/ur4ietO\n\nThird: the language I was working on was German. I'm aware of the limitations of Duolingo, but I find it fun. And I'm pretty addicted to the whole streak thing\n\nFourth: yes. I'm an idiot. That's why I posted in TIFU. Right now I'm in pain and I thought someone might be able to get some enjoyment out of that because of the absolutely stupid reason.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nThis just happened today, on mobile so please forgive any typos. Including the one in the title. Should be Duolingo\n\nSo this morning was like any other Tuesday morning. I woke up at 7 ready to head into work for my favourite work day of the week. I was gonna learn some new stuff and sit at a desk, not having to interact with customers at all. \n\nI get dressed and head out into our stairwell, not bothering to turn on the lights as I head towards the bottom floor and the garage. As I'm heading down, I figured it was a great time to pull out Duolingo. Gotta keep up with my streak and all that. \n\nAs I'm completing the lessons, I'm getting towards the dark bit of the stairs. Not noticing or looking where I am going at all, I put out my foot for the next stair and suddenly, I fall. \n\nThere is a massive crack as my foot hits the floor at a bizarre angle and I let out a scream. I reach down and touch my leg and notice that my shin should not be bulging like that and scream again, this time with more panic. I can't move the leg, it hurts too much. I crawl my way over to the phone and notice Duolingo still open. Naturally the first thought in my head is, 'well, this needs to be closed' before I called my husband for help and some crutches. As I'm waiting for him I look down at my phone. Sure, I'm in immense pain... But those daily lessons... \n\nI stabilise my knee and promptly reopen the app. And there I am, waiting for crutches, sitting at the bottom of a stairwell, with my leg and ankle bent in two places in a way those parts were very much not supposed to bend, finishing the very lessons that caused me to fall in the first place. \nThat was 16 hours ago. I am now lying in a hospital bed, unable to sleep, with my broken leg in a plaster cast - and yet still the haunting \"Hoooo\" of that owl calls to me.\n\nTL;DR: I fucked up by keeping up with Duolingo and ended up breaking my leg.",

        "selftext": "This happened today. Just a few minutes ago, in fact.\n\nA bit of context: I got banned from tinder a few years ago for selling feet pics (oops) but was recently single and wanted to get back in the game. After deciding other dating apps were a little too wholesome for me,\nI decided to go for Tinder. I needed a phone number that wasn\u2019t blocked, so I used my mom\u2019s and then called her and got the code. I figured, she\u2019s like 60 and probably doesn\u2019t even know what a dating app is, so no harm, no foul right?\n\nToday we\u2019re all sitting at the table getting ready to eat breakfast and my step dad comes out and sits down. He\u2019s calm as can be as he butters his toast. He glances up from his paper and says to all of us, \u201cI am packing my things and leaving this afternoon.\u201d\n\nI almost spit out my orange juice. My brothers start crying. Mom is sputtering, trying to figure out what is going on. She keeps asking why, and he pulls out a literal printed page from the google search results of \u201cwhat is tinder\u201d. He hands it to my mom. She doesn\u2019t even know what is going on at this point, she doesn\u2019t remember giving me the code months ago. \n\nI grab the paper from her and read it, and realize where I fucked up. I turn to my step dad and let him know, frantically, that it was me. He asks why in the world I would need to use her phone to make the account. I scroll through my phone, find an album of different angles of my FEET, and explain to him. He was thoroughly disgusted, and went back to their room through almost tears of laughter. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s still leaving but my family will never look at my the same again.\n\n\nTL:DR: tried to sell feet pics, got banned from tinder, used my moms phone, danger is afoot",

            "Am I alone in thinking that just having downloaded tinder is not something that warrants such an extreme response as to calmly state to your entire close family (including adoptive children) that you're just straight up leaving? Like did he see messages/pics that \"your mum\" had been sent/sending? That seems like it should warrant a serious discussion if you're on top of your emotional game, more likely an arguement or a separation until things can be sorted out (if at all), but just ***announcing*** that you're fucking off like it's the 5 o'clock news?\n\nI dunno, seems like there should be a bit more to this to me. Without knowing every detail obviously, this seems like kind of a shitty reaction to me",
            "Is anyone else disturbed that her step dad would immediately leave (not to mention blatantly telling the kids at breakfast) after discovering tinder was downloaded? You\u2019d think he would at least ASK his wife what was going on before announcing such a damaging thing at the breakfast table. Maybe OP can back this dude up, but he sounds insecure and bad at communicating healthily.",
            "What the feet look like tho",
            "yea...I doubt it though. Most of it seems completely crazy but on top of all things why wouldn't you make up literally any excuse why you were banned. If he went as far as printing a page of Google results on what tinder is you could of said you were banned for like swearing or something in the chat instead of immediately showing your for pay feet pics.",
            "I'm sure I'm not the only person to say you didn't have to tell him about the feet.",

            "So basically if you get a new phone number and that phone number was previously used and banned on tinder,  you can't use it eventhough it wasn't you who got banned.  Seems like a flawed system especially since you can get free Google numbers top use.",
            "How does one tell if ones feet ate attractive enough to sell feet pictures? I'm intrested in doing it but sort of afraid.",
            "TIL you can get banned from Tinder for selling feet pics",
            "Sooo he was going thru your mom's texts? That's pretty bad.",
            "Couldn't you've just not mention the feet part? Maybe say you just lost access to your account or something?",
            "Umm... This is pretty funny since nothing came of it. However, that's really NOT the way to do things if he decides something is big enough to leave. That's a pretty shitty and  irresponsible way to spring that on your spouse, and in front of other members of the family, no less. Honestly, it's kind of concerning. He just decides, without talking, that he's packing his shit and leaving and tells your mother for the first time in front of people? YIKES FOREVER\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, obviously this is funny and nothing bad really happened, so I hope I'm not being offensive, it just strikes me as kind of fucked up the way he went about it.",
            "That\u2019s kind of a terrible way to say he\u2019s leaving. Didn\u2019t even ask her about it. He\u2019s lucky it was you and not a hacker or something. But to not say anything to his wife and just drop that bomb on the whole family at once. Wow.",

        "selftext": "I (25F), work with older people (40 - 50+M/F) and today they added me to the whatsapp work group chat. One of my co-workers came to my desk and asked me if I was aware of what my picture was on whatsapp. I use whatsapp very rarely, mostly with friends if we are not using other apps available i.e. Snapchat. I had to check as I had not been on whatsapp in a while. So I open whatsapp to check my picture and felt like throwing up.\n\nSo the story behind my whatsapp profile picture is that I saw it on Twitter, showed it to my friends because I thought it was hilarious. One of them said I wouldn't set it at my profile picture, and I said bet. So I set it on an app I never use and completely forgot about it. The picture is a very detailed and pornographic image of Iron Man and Captain America having sex. Picture Attached: [WhatsApp Picture (NSFW)](https://imgur.com/a/MzTNCpr)\n\nOnce I saw it, I immediately changed it to the most professional picture of me I could find. As I'm panicking and not knowing what to do, wanting to change my identity - a co-worker comes up to me who usually chats with me and is very friendly with me could not even look me in the eyes. My boss saw this picture, all my co-workers saw this picture, I feel like I have scarred these older people for life.\n\nTomorrow I have to go back to work and I don't know what to expect or what to do.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy co-workers saw a pornographic image which was set as my profile picture on whatsapp.\n\nUpdate: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uu5g8o/tifu\\_by\\_joining\\_my\\_work\\_groupchat\\_and\\_now\\_i\\_feel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uu5g8o/tifu_by_joining_my_work_groupchat_and_now_i_feel/)\n\nHere is a link to me telling the friends mentioned about the whole situation for anyone wondering of the aftermath: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1490361790](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1490361790)",

Simply state it was an image that was shared on a superhero themed forum or something similar. State that you shared a conversation, comment.. whatever.. anything other than THAT image and that your friend, who was reading said conversation or comment had your phone and changed your avatar without your knowledge. Depending on the coworkers, if alcohol is an acceptable vice among them, it might be more sympathetic if you mention that played a role. Re-emphasize that you rarely use that app and forgot all about it. \n\nApologize, again,  profusely for any offense or discomfort it may have caused anyone involved. \n\nGo through any & all apps that have even the slightest possibility of being seen by and or used for company related anything and get rid of all things  remotely *offensive\" and set every single social media account to to secret. \n\nLet everyone involved know that you have replaced the image with a more professional one and, again,  apologize for your oversight and assure them you won't let anything like this happen in the future.

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn\u2019t happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. \n\nSo backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn\u2019t want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren\u2019t virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. \n\nShe was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I\u2019d see her again. \n\nOne time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn\u2019t even \n\nThings went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn\u2019t find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend\u2019s expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. \n\nTurns out that she hadn\u2019t clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone \u201cdaddy\u201d who was definitely not her dad (the mother\u2019s words, not mine).  \n\nShe told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. \nMy girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn\u2019t. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying \u201chow could she do this\u201d and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. \n\nSo we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn\u2019t get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise \u201cI\u2019m home for the weekend\u201d. She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. \n\nWe got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. \n\nWhen I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how \u201cwe won\u2019t do it again\u201d and how \u201cwe\u2019re just stupid teenagers\u201d and most importantly how I was gonna \u201crebuild their trust\u201d. Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.\n\nAt the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn\u2019t want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it\u2019s still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend and I took phone sex to a whole other level.\n\nEdit: holy fuck you guys I went to class and come out and this is what I see???? Thank you so much for the gold stranger. My first gold!",

When I got to the living room, he put his hand around the back of my neck, guided me out of the house and down to the dock.

She also says that there's no street parking and to park in the neighboring parking lot, ok cool.

He (the other guy, not my dad) accidentally poked his own finger with a primed syringe full of lethal tapeworm, quite possibly putting a 12-18 month cap on his lifespan.  From the next room, my dad heard \"Fuck!  YYYEAAAAAGHHH!!!\" and then the sound of shattering glass.  Dude grabbed a scalpel, sliced his own finger open down to the bone, and dunked it in rubbing alcohol, killing any tapeworms that might've made it into his system before his circulation could send them to his brain.  He passed out from the pain and broke the beaker of alcohol, and obviously needed a trip to the ER for stitches, but he survived the experience.\n\n**EDIT:** Some have asked what the tapeworm was, so I emailed Dad, and he said:\n\n> It was either Echinococcus granulosis or Echinococcus multilocularis.

            "3 reasons you're not going to die:\n\n1) Bleeding is a natural reaction clearing out intruding particles - your cancer cells have probably been swept out by your first drop of blood.\nFurthermore, in the upper layers of your skin, there is a heck-lot of immune cells specifically produced to catch intruding particles. Even if they make it into your venous system - again unlikely - phagocytic cells should catch them before they make it into the arterial system and capillary system of the bone marrow - what would be quite some travel to go unnoticed. The immune system has an incredible amount of ways in which to detect and destroy cancer cells.\nAs for needle-stick injuries in general some statistics from virology: Healthcare professionals often have needle-stick injuries from patients contaminated with highly infectious viruses such as AIDS or Hepatitis B or C. However rates of actually transmitting these diseases are quite low. \n1.5 - 3 % for Hepatitis C; 30 % for Hepatitis B; 0,3 % for HIV.\nSo the chances of cancer cells actually getting into and staying in your bloodstream should be quite low.\n\n2) As far as I know spreading of cancer cells is linked to certain binding factors, alterations in these binding factors normally only occur in later stages. So chances are quite high that even if cells enter your bloodstream and don't get destroyed by your immune, the specific binding factor(s) for _your_ bone marrow is missing. That's a shot in the dark truly, because your subtype of your cancer cell would be important to evaluate that but chances are in your favour big time.\n\n3) Lymphatic cells have a very high reproduction rate, so the natural occurrence of cancerous cells is quite high by itself. Your body however, should be well capable of destroying cancerous cells. Even if you should develop ALL - highly unlikely as I stated above - ALL should be very well treatable. Depending on your age and subtype survival rates, which are now mostly considered as \"healed\" are well over 3/4 and in some studies even over 90 %. New treatments are develloped every month basically. By people doing science - not injuring themselves with needles - sorry just joking.\n\nSo - Needle stick injuries happen quite often... Seldomly people die ;) You will not. But the check ups will be a pain in the ass ;)",

My reddit is COVERED in dogs from various sources. My Facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. Basically everywhere I turn, I see dog. Not a bad life to live. Until yesterday (YIFU I know). I walked one of my mother\u2019s friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. It wasn\u2019t very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. It\u2019s hot. I\u2019ve just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. I want to blame dehydration for this FU, but really I know I\u2019m just an idiot. A couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. My first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a hot day and I\u2019ve seen dogs in pushchairs before. Maybe they didn\u2019t want its paws on hot tarmac. Maybe they\u2019re just a little extra. Regardless, the thought that babies exist didn\u2019t enter my tiny stupid brain. As they got up to leave and walk by me, I decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words \u201cWhat breed is it?\u201d and gestured towards the pushchair. They looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. It was a baby. A HUMAN baby. I\u2019m so glad they took the traditional British approach of confused stare and silence. If they had said something I think I would have disintegrated on the spot. It was a long walk home after that and thankfully, I didn\u2019t pass anymore pushchairs. \n\nTL;DR I asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the Internet.",

A friend of mine, \u201cJenny\u201d shows us a picture of her father so I pull up Facebook images of my mother and father. A friend of mine saw my father and said I looked just like him but when he saw my mother the color in his face drained.\n\n\u201cChad\u201d watched me scroll down my picture of my mon then asked about my siblings. He described them in detail, PERFECT DETAIL!!! He then said to me, \u201cLilly, I think I fucked your mom.\u201d I laughed of course, Chad has a reputation and I figured it was a joke until he described my siblings, my mothers home, the neighborhood and ect. \n\nI felt horror. Sheer horror. He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him! Just a few days ago he was flirting with me and what not! And now I find out, he\u2019s a motherfucker! Literally a motherfucker!\n\n\nTLDR; college friend fucked by mom, described her and my family in detail, and had been trying to put the moves on my days prior without realizing I was her daughter. MOTHERFUCKER!\n\n\nEdit: To clarify some more things, apparently he found her through a hook up ad. She had someone watching my siblings while she took him to the bone zone\u2026 so the bed I\u2019ve sat on has mom and Chad juices on them. He asked me to call him daddy now. I feel homicidal.\n\nEdit 2: my parents haven\u2019t been together for as long as I\u2019ve been alive. My Mom has not had a long lasting relationship through out my life and I kind of blame myself for that. I say this because I was never an easy kid. I was bitter and sad and no one wants a woman with a child that doesn\u2019t receive the necessary mental help to thrive. My mom and I also don\u2019t have the best relationship either. I always felt she was a bit envious of me do to the fact that I\u2019ve been able to maintain a relationship longer than she has at my young age. While I\u2019m a bit frazzled at the prospect of my friend doing my mom I guess I can\u2019t be mad at him because he genuinely didn\u2019t know. A little ways down the road we\u2019ll both laugh at this. My Giga Chad sigma male friend will not end up sleeping with me tho because I am deeply into someone else. My partner said I should fuck his mom tho to assert my dominance.\n\nUpdate: fucked his dad. I\u2019d been plotting hard and I did it. I fucked his dad.

So I was being a trash goblin last night and staying up into the wee hours to eat easter candy and play video games, which I don't do that often.  Anyway, does anyone else enjoy robins eggs? Those neon colored malted milk ball eggs they sell this time of year? Well, as a kid I used to do this stupid thing where I would lick them and smear the color all over my lips because hey, free lipstick! Do not ask what compelled me to do this, but i did this last night with a blue one. Then of course because I am a trash goblin i forgot all about it, fell asleep slack jawed upright on the couch with the lights on and TV still going. Next thing I know theres shouting, panicking sounds, and I'm being shaken violently, and by the time I come to I see my husband fumbling with his phone? I kind of... flapped my arms angrilly and said something like \"whazwrongwitchyou?!\" Yeah, he had been about to call 911 because he just walked out on his wife passed out with blue lips, he thought I was choking. He was pretty incensed when I told him it was candy, it's the dumbest thing I've ever had to explain in our whole marriage.\n\nTL;DR: I accidentally did a candy coated immitation of the recently deceased causing my husband a panic attack and a near summoning of an ambulence.\n\nEDIT- Didn't expect this to be so popular, thanks for the awards, and the discussions on different candy eating rituals! My husband has steadied his nerves and is now just ribbing me mercilessly- not just for scaring him senseless, but also because I've been training for a triathalon and eating really healthily, so this lapse was extra grotesque.",

            "Reminds me of my own candy related TIFU. When I was a teenager in highschool my boyfriend's family was nice enough to invite me on vacation once. We stayed up late with his siblings and had late night snacks, including peanut m&Ms and pasta. I licked two different colored m&Ms and stuck them lightly up my nose (because I'm classy af) when I took them out it left rings of blue and green on my nose. I stuffed the m&Ms in my mouth and we all laughed so hard I legitimately choked. If you haven't recently experienced choking, it often results in vomiting violently to clear your airways. So that's what happened and my boyfriend managed to catch it in his hands as I was running to the bathroom. I'd say it ruined the weekend but it really didn't, but it was kinda a signal we all needed to go to bed. At some point after I remember laugh-crying on the floor and he told me I was beautiful.

Today being Valentine\u2019s Day, I made reservations for a course meal at a hotel restaurant.\n\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s not my usual style; I\u2019m perfectly happy going to cheap izakayas and that kind of thing, but variety is the spice of life and we both decided it would be nice to dress up a little and have a fancy meal.\n\nTwo course meals were already going to set me back a pretty penny, but the fuck up was when it came time to order drinks. As befits a romantic dinner, we decided on a bottle of wine. I have long since decided not to pretend to be a wine expert and to just ask the servers for their recommendation when it comes to this kind of thing. Our waiter went for the drink menu, came back with a tablet, and made a few suggestions, all around the \u00a516,000 ($160) price range. Of course I tried not to let it show, but I thought that was a bit on the expensive side and swiped to an $80 alternative. I asked him if it\u2019s a good wine.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a very good wine, sir.\u201d\n\nI told him we\u2019d go with that one, and he politely took the order and left. My girlfriend spent the next 10 minutes or so joking about the wine ordering process, and I thought she was making fun of me for going with a cheaper wine. Fair enough.\n\nThe wine was served to us and we both agreed it was really good.\n\nShe kept going with the joking, though, and it was when she said that she hoped that it was 80,000 yen and not 80,000 dollars that it finally hit me. Somehow, even after living here for as long as I have, my brain misfired and I equated 80,000 yen with $80 when it\u2019s actually more like $800.\n\nBy that point, we were well into the bottle and there was no going back.\n\nNeedless to say, that was a shocker, but I did my best to take it in stride and just enjoy it. She was pretty cool about it too, laughing about it but also showing concern about the (for us) outrageous price. I\u2019m fortunate enough to not have to worry about it, and I\u2019m thankful for that, but my bank account definitely took a hit tonight. I had to mentally prepare myself for when the bill arrived.\n\nAnyway, as I told her, we\u2019ll just be drinking tap water for the next 10 Valentine\u2019s Days.\n\nTL;DR - During Valentine\u2019s dinner, messed up the yen-dollar exchange rate in my head and ordered a $800 wine at a restaurant instead of an $80 one.\n\n\nEdit: Well this gained traction while I was sleeping. Here\u2019s the bottle for those asking, complete with wine dribbles on the tablecloth:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Lx4PGvh.jpg",

            "Valentine's day memories! That is a good story. \n\nEarly in my relationship with my now husband we agreed that we didn't need to go over the top for the day. Living in Vancouver, we decided on staying in with take out sushi and a movie. Our regular sushi place had just closed so I pulled out the yellow pages (yes it was a number of years ago) and picked the first Japanese restaurant I saw nearby. Things got weird during the call when I asked if they had sushi to go, the woman asked me to hold on and I heard a hushed conversation in Japanese. She told me they could do it and I ordered around five rolls from memory (California roll etc.). They did not tell me the price over the phone. \n\nWe drive there and my partner starts going \"oh shit\" as we roll up. We had ordered from Tojo's.... This chef invented the California roll apparently and you usually would spend the money for the ambience and prestige of dining there. So here we are in our pajama pants picking up a $200 order from the fanciest sushi restaurant in Vancouver. Shrug, oh well. It was good sushi and not the most expensive mistake in the end.",

One of the best I\u2019ve had. My mom realized the waiter could have easily just brought a super expensive bottle of wine to fuck with the Canadian tourists.\n\n\nGot the bill and the bottle was maybe \u20ac20?

            "I only ordered $800 bottles of wine (in Japan) when somebody else was paying!  There was that one time when I made an ATM withdrawal, and the ATMs have a 10,000 Yen button, so if you want 30,000 Yen you push the \"3\" and the 10k button and you get your $300 dollars worth of cash. I wanted 5,000 Yen, around $500, but I hit the 10k button and 50, which gave me 500,000 Yen, about $5,000.  I thought that was too much cash to walk around with, even in Japan, so I went into the bank and redeposited most of it. They gave me a free pack of tissue, so I came out ahead.",
            "That hurts, in my experience a $200 bottle of wine isn't 10 times as good as a $20, though noticeably better. When you get into the hundreds and thousands for a bottle it starts being more about class than actual taste",

I wanted lunch so I googled for sushi near by. Found a spot a few blocks away so I went there.\n\nWalk in and its lovely, super small - so I go sit at the sushi bar and they bring me some tea.\n\nAfter a few moments they bring my the menu;\n\n8 course chefs choice $175\n\nThe only thing on the menu.\n\nI can't get up and leave now! shucks.\n\nOK\n\nit was *amazing* gold leaf on some of the nigiri, the best sashimi, cook your slices of wagyu on this glowing red hot rock that they serve you...\n\nI went back to work in SF and said \"Uhm...

So spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.\nThe googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being.

I go completely deaf in one ear out of nowhere. Thinking its wax I use a bunch of wax removal and lubrication kitsch to get the wax out with no luck. Low and behold 7 days of lubed wax treatments the fucking eraser is plumbed from my ear with some suction. Its disgusting. \n\nI still have it. Threw it in a 1g sized zip lock and kept it.

She's actually about to move to the UK herself, so we ended up chatting about the differences. \n\nAnyway, I'm fascinated to know where the eye is!

First idea was to use some larger ones kinda up on either side to make a sort of elephant face. But alas I'm kinda fat (stomach, not bragging) and they kept falling off and I couldn't get the right angle. Then the fuck up begins... I found some smaller ones that were SELF ADHESIVE and thought it would look like a snake if I put them on the head. Took the pic, fantastic results (though she said it reminded her more of those squids on old school Super Mario than a snake). Anyways, I quickly realized I had fucked up when it came time to take them off. It was obviously a very unpleasant experience, like someone holding a lighter under it. Also had 2 red dots on the head of my junk for almost 2 weeks that made it look like I'd had an STD. LPT: Never use self adhesive anything on the head of a penis.",

It said that if there's ever a bug stuck in somewhere it shouldn't be(i.e. my ear) you should turn off all the lights and shine a flashlight in there. If the bug isn't stuck, it should be attracted to the light and crawl out. I went and found a small flashlight, turned off the light in my room and shined the flashlight in my ear.

I'm a bit of a bigger guy.  6'2\" and a fairly huge ass.  We moved into our new house 4 years ago and the place has these teeny little doll toilets.  They are usable but you have to sit with your knees around your ears.  Meh... maybe the place used to be owned by hobbits or something?\n\nFor the last 4 years every time I take a shit it turns into a \"crayon\" experience.  You know... you wipe and wipe and wipe and every time the TP comes out with a brown streak like you are wiping the end of a crayon.  When I think I've finally got things clean I head out for a walk.  Half a block later I've got this burning down there and a sticky feeling and when I get home sure enough a chunk of shit has worked it's way down into my ass crack and made a sticky mess between my cheeks and maybe into my under ware.\n\nDid I mention this has been going on for FOUR YEARS?  Several times I've thought of seeing a doctor and maybe it's some kind of colon cancer or who knows what.  Like not enough to really do anything about it... but a worry none the less.\n\nSo a week or two back our toilet started doing a little mini-flush every few hours.  Annoying.  The valve inside it was leaking.  Some investigation and it turns out this little doll toilet has a strange flush by wire sort of thing and a complicated two stage flusher.  Home Depot has a replacement but it's $81.  And I hate this thing anyway.  So rather than pour good money after bad I headed over to Costco and pick up a new toilet.\n\nChanging the toilet on my own was a real challenge.  Those things are heavy.  I got very sweaty, took off my shirt, hauled the old one out to the garage, got the old icky brown wax ring all over my hands and headed back towards the house.  Meanwhile the nice young Christian lady next door pulled up and said \"Hey!\"  Being super sweaty, no shirt, puffing like a hog, I held up a brown apparently shit covered hand and said \"I've got some toilet issues!\".  She looked horrified and quickly closed her garage door.  FML.\n\nToday the toilet is installed and I decided to christen it with an inaugural shit.  Life changing.  I finally discovered my 4 year's of FU.  With my knees down at the normal position and the bowl much much larger it can now accommodate my entire ass.  The shit came flinging out like it should.  (Edit for clarity:  The old tiny hobbit bowl toilet was apparently squeezing my ass cheeks together preventing a full release of my poo - thus the Crayon effect).\n\nBetter still, the larger bowl can now accommodate not only my gigantic ass but also my hand can now reach all the way up into my ass crack!  I can finally properly clean my poo hole.  Couple swipes and no more crayon!  I'm CLEAN!  I almost felt like running next door to tell the neighbor about my triumph but ya... think I've freaked her out enough for one week.\n\nEdit:  Well this sure blew up beyond all measure.  Thanks for the over 10K upvotes (and counting!).  The \"helpful\" and \"wholesome\" awards made me laugh but thanks so much for all your kind awards.  Many helpful hints on how to sit on a toilet, how to spread ass cheeks and all the rest - much appreciated.  I will also strongly consider your suggestions for a bidet.  I've always thought they were sort of gross... but reading over what I just posted... ya... not so gross.    Even the negative comments made me laugh.  Thanks all!  You guys are hilariously the best. \n\nTLDR; I spent 4 years shitting in a toilet that was made for hobbits.",

In an effort to make things less boring, we played \u201ctwo truths and a lie.\u201d I gave the kids my example, which was: \u201cI have two brothers. I\u2019m from Texas. I love horror movies.\u201d Unfortunately, I messed up my own directions and gave them two lies\u2014the brothers and horror movies.\n\nFor inexplicable reasons, I just...rolled with it, only corrected the brothers thing, and the kids were delighted at my \u201ccool hobby.\u201d Now I have kids excitedly emailing me to ask about my favorite horror movies, and they\u2019ve promised to make me some really fun artwork based on our (presumed) shared love of this genre. Apparently a middle-aged, mom-type teacher who loves horror movies is some kind of unicorn to them, and I don\u2019t have the heart to correct them. \n\nI feel my only option moving forward is to just embrace the lie. To get started, I watched a shitty (yet still scary to me) horror movie on Netflix after school. Now Netflix is suggesting other horror movies which I\u2019m afraid of based on the title and font alone, and I guess I\u2019ll never sleep again.\n\nTL;DR: Lied to children; must quickly become an expert in a genre of movies I truly hate.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the suggestions!

            "Just imagine all the bad guys talking in a falsetto voice. Mock them mercilessly. Make 'em cry. You won't be so scared then.\n\nOn the flipside, do some research on how some special effects are produced and watch each movie like you're analyzing their technique. Try to figure out *how* they're performing the stunts. Learn about makeup and prosthetics and admire the artistry behind it all. A lot of good horror movies I've seen I've accidentally ruined by learning how the \"magic\" happens, and it totally kills the fear. It also helps to see the behind the scenes and blooper reels before actually watching the movie so you get a feel for the actors outside of their horrific persona.\n\nTL;DR: Watch the movie as someone behind the scenes instead of watching as a normal horror flick victim. Totally changes how you see it\n\nEdit: I'm a bit of a horror movie buff so if you want some good recommendations that aren't the go-to cliche (to make you seem more legit) I have literal lists I can send you. Most are easily available cuz I'm a broke college student. There are a lot of \"horror\" movies that aren't necessarily scary as well, or are easily disarmed and humorous\n\nEdit 2: guys my lists aren't that great tbh, and they're short. You're making me feel like some great horror connoisseur and I'm not. Really. But here are a few of my favorites. \n\nAs above so below\n\nThe descent (sequels suck, don't bother with them)\n\nCloverfield (not for those who are easily motion sick)\n\nCloverfield 2 + 3 (Better than the first imo)\n\nSplit + Glass (Unbreakable too but I have yet to see it)\n\nHeritage\n\nVVitch \n\nThe Ritual\n\nThe Babadook\n\nAnnihilation \n\nThe Haunting of Hill House (Netflix series)\n\nYou might tell I have a preference for the more psychological aspect of horror based on this short list. I've omitted my more popular favorites to assist you as you delve deep into the darkness of your own psyche. There are many movies I have yet to see that I keep track of, so my list will expand as time goes on. I'm relatively new to the horror field but I know a thing or two about what makes a movie good. Feel free to send me recommendations of your own; I'm always down to question reality as I know it. \n\nAs a general rule I like to give M. Night Shyamalan the benefit of the doubt, as his movies have a great amount of depth and his talent has increased over the years. Also, anything based off of a Stephen King novel is bound to be good I've found. \n\nEnjoy!",

She was not into horror films at all when we first got together until I showed her Cabin in the Woods and now she joins me in my October horror marathon. It's such a meta, genre-breaking film that she wanted to watch other horror movies after that. That being said, I've been slowly exposing her to some of the best horror films and franchises of all time: Evil Dead 2, Rec and Rec 2, The Exorcist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, The Ring, The Grudge, John Carpenter's The Thing and In the Mouth of Madness, Candyman.\n\nIf you don't feel like being scared or sitting through those movies, just use Wikipedia to read the synopses and you can get an idea of what the movies are about.

Carrie (the 1976 version) is a favorite of mine, which is more beautifully tragic than scary to me.  The Shining is a tough one to get through, so watch with a friend.

            "You know who's a really good author? Stephen King. Sure, many of his books have sadly been adapted into that stupid jump-scare horror movie formula, but if you want to watch something that's a bit more interesting, I can suggest some of his works. Maybe you've even already seen a few. I'm not sure how anyone can get through life too long without stumbling upon any.\n\nI got into his books over ten years ago when I watched The Green Mile on tv (which doesn't count as horror, so it won't help you) and decided to check out the books by the author that made that amazing movie happen. Turns out, the books are miles off of what I thought horror was even about. For most of them, I don't even care about the genre - what really matters, are the awesome characters and intriguing storylines. The man knows how to write a good book if I've ever seen one.\n\nStephen King movies that are technically horror, but have a lot more to offer:\n\n* The Shining (Stanley Kubrick\u2019s version)\n* The Mist (the special effects are meh, but Frank Darabont is a genius)\n* 1408\n* The Dead Zone (there's a series, but I'm talking about the movie with Christopher Walken)\n* 1922\n\nSo yeah.

Maybe have them write their own stories?\n\nCreepy pastas are the current iteration of cautionary tales and oral traditions. With 6th graders, you won't want to get into anything worse than pg 13 films. I agree with reading/watching reviews with spoilers if you find the movies hard to watch. Also watching with your SO/friends during daylight hours will make it easier. A lot of horror movies have a good comedy element that you might enjoy. Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein is hysterical. Having them draw you pictures sounds like it would be really fun for your students and you can have them talk about what they draw and what it is that they like about the movie they drew. \n\nIs science your thing?

When the teacher arrived I greeted her and she asked me to help with some things and I left.\n\nLater I found out the high school kids were asking who I was and if I was her son. I don't know why they thought that because we don't really look alike, and I also don't know what possessed her to, but for some reason she said yes. Then she apparently maintained the lie for a solid 3 years. The kids would randomly ask about me and apparently a few of the girls thought I was cute and she'd tell them random stories like \"oh! He's studying in Paris now\" or just make things up.\n\nJust random, but your lie to your students made me think of this story.\n\nEdit - Also I'm a huge horror movie fan.

The thing you need to understand is *the uncanny valley.* It's an amazing concept that is perhaps the best visualized in robots -- back in the day when robots were clearly robots they were quirky and lovable, and when you get to *completely* human-like robots like in the Terminator or A.I. they're again fine. However, the middle part where they *kind of* look like people but yet clearly act and talk in ways our brains don't think they should, we hit the 'uncanny valley'. It's a feeling of unease you can't even train away from.\n\nOlder 'horror movies' relied a lot on gore and jump scares to be their horrific element. So Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday 13th, even Alien... they scare you but you can laugh at the experience later. Modern 'horror movies' try to push you as deep into the uncanny valley as they can and honestly that gets under my skin a lot lot worse. Take the Saw movies for instance, or some Twilight Zone episodes. They just burrow into a little place in your brain that stores every really scary thing that might crawl out or might happen to you and bring it out every now and then.\n\nFreddy, Jason? They just kill you. They look goofy and they lose at the end of the movie. I loved them as a kid and would probably re-watch some of the movies if I had the chance. \n\nBut I really don't want to imagine getting autopsied while being conscious or waking up tied and gagged in a casket being carried to the incinerator ever again, thanks very much.",

            "Horror comedy is your friend! There's a lot of good, fun horror movies out there that really aren't about the scares and more about the laughs. Depending on what you're able to stomach, gory practical effects-wise and scare-wise, some of the horror comedy that come to mind include Tucker and Dale vs Evil, The 'Burbs, Night of the Creeps, Shaun of the Dead, Scream, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Gremlins, Cabin in the Woods, Braindead (1992)... I also suggest checking out horror movies that aren't scary at all because of how much they suck and that wind up being funny instead, a la Troll 2. \n\nI also suggest Dolls (1987), simply because it's one of my absolute favorite films and I think it's a very good one to ease someone into the gorier side of the genre, since it overall has a very Goosebumps-y vibe to it; just with a disproportionate amount of gore at random intervals, since it's a Stuart Gordon film (He also directed Re-Animator, which isn't quite horror comedy imho but can be quite funny). \n\nDepending on what aspects of horror unsettle you the most, you should definitely look into the sites \"doesthedogdie\" and \"wheresthejump\"; the former catalogues a bunch of common information that people might want to be warned for prior to seeing a movie, esp a horror movie (EX: \"Is a child abused?\" \"Is someone stalked?\" \"Is there eye mutilation?\") and the latter site catalogues the exact moments that jumpscares will happen in a movie. They're not perfect, and less popular movies are less likely to be filled out properly, but they can really help! \n\nIf you cannot stomach even that, though, then I absolutely suggest Dead Meat's Kill Count videos on youtube. Each video summarizes a horror movie, counting up all the deaths and pointing out cool facts about how the movie was made, how the effects were accomplished, etc. He's covered every film to date in the major slasher franchises (Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Scream, etc) and a TON of other horror films as well. It'll allow you to get a good idea of what actually happens in these specific films AND have cool film trivia to share with your students. The videos do still show the gore, but James tends to blur out the extra gnarly stuff to avoid demonetization; and they're not jumpscare-y, either, if that's a concern. If you want, you can even watch a Kill Count video first, then decide if you want to watch the full film afterwards now that you know everything that happens in it. \n\nGood luck! \n\n-film studies major w/ an interest in horror",

        "selftext": "This happened only minutes ago.\n\n\nThe graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.\n\n\nAt the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.\n\n\nNow, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?\n\n\nStarting to sound like a mistake yet?\n\n\nIf the answer is \"no,\" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.\n\n\nMy first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.\n\n\nBack at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.\n\n\nNow I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.\n\n\nI open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.\n\n\nOh golly gee fuck was I wrong.\n\n\nNow at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.\n\n\nI experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.\n\n\nYou see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.\n\n\nOh, that's not all rust.\n\n\n*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*\n\n\nDo you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, \"Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?\" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.\n\n\nThey're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.\n\n\nAt least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.\n\n\nTL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.\n\nEdit: Hi, Reddit! I just wanted to say many thanks for the gold AND all the offers for cockroach-free PlayStations!  warms my heart, and I'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. Happy Redditing!",

German cockroaches are some of the hardest to get rid of, and one of their egg sacks (oothica) contain up to 50 roaches. You need to buy some cockroach gel bait. Vendetta Plus, Advion, Alpine. Vendetta Plus is the best in my opinion. Also, buy some Gentrol point source. These are a bit pricey, but the are an insect growth regulator. This means that if they are within 75 square feet, all they have to do is smell it and they will not be able to reproduce. If they aren't already fully grown adults. It inhibits them from growing anymore. So, if they are too young to reproduce, then they will never grow big enough to be able to. Take the gel bait and place a BB pellet size on any ledges/corners/baseboards/ kitchen cabinet hinges/. Place the beads 6 inches apart. They will eat it and die. If you take these steps properly, you have nothing to worry about. If you leave two, in 6 months you will be infested with thousands. Take extra care of your kitchen and bathrooms. Any electronics draw them with the warmth. TV's, modems, routers, wireless telephones, power outlets, back of refrigerator, back of deep freezer, under coffee pot, backs of microwave, grooves of an oven.

The poison kind that roaches think are food and take back to the nest.\n1. Clean up all clutter so that there are less places for roaches to hide\n1. Clean up all food. Keep food that you need in sealed containers and get rid of everything else. Don't leave dirty dishes in the sink. Don't leave dirty dishes anywhere.\n1. Make sure everything is dry. Dry out the shower when you are done, dry out the sink when you are done, don't leave cups of water lying around.\n1. Put that roach poison shit everywhere. In all the nooks and crannies. Hopefully, since they don't have any food (see 3) or water (see 4) they will go for that poison like it's their only chance at life.\n\nHopefully there weren't enough roaches that got away to start a colony but you can never be too sure. A week or so of this, and if you don't see any more roaches (look in cabinets and around appliances in the kitchen) then you can relax.\n\nPlease please be vigilant. We aren't dirty or gross people but we are still dealing with roach problems because of that nasty ass apartment. Those fuckers survived being in a moving truck and then a storage shed in the middle of summer for 6 days. They'll survive on a crumb if you got it. \n\nGodspeed.\n\n",

            "A couple of weeks ago, I saw a pretty big cockroach near my dog's food and water bowls. It squirms away before I can stomp it. This thing was at least three inches long, with long antennas. Maybe it wasn't a roach, but I'm not about to look through dozens of roach photos and random roach facts. The last time I saw a roach that big was in a third world, tropical area.\n\nI figure, no need to alarm the gf. I'll catch it later. Later that night, my gf is doing the dishes and I hear, \"OH MY GOD\". It's on the ceiling above the sink. As I'm reaching for it with a broom it goes into the cupboard. Gf opens it, sticks her head underneath to get a better look and sees it in the top shelf by the ceiling. I could barely get myself to do that because I was scared of it landing on my face. So, for the next 5-10 minutes, I'm forcing myself to get of rid of this thing and I'm standing on a stool from a little too far away and my gf eventually says, \"Do you want me to do it?\". I gladly say yes (I'm a guy, btw). It crawls behind a crockpot and a waffle iron but my gf isn't tall enough to see it. I see it behind the waffle iron and regroup. I go back and the thing runs out to the ledge and I back away like, well, like a bitch. It's like that thing was taunting me (it also had nowhere else to go, but still).\n\nNow it's in plain sight so I grab the broom and the plan is to knock it out onto the floor. I reach up with the broom and of course this bastard flies down parallel to the broom stick and tries to land on my arm. I drop the broom and once again, back away like my life was on the line. I manage to coax it out from behind the stove, then the fridge, all while standing on the stool. It runs out to the living room and from behind the fridge, and I'm still on a stool, watching my gf swing a broom around for the next 10 seconds before finally getting it to stay in place so I could deliver the super easy death blow (begrudingly). We had just watched the latest Game of Thrones episode at the time and all I could think of was how I'm Theon, and she's Brienne/Yara/Arya.",

        "selftext": "10 days ago, my younger sister started developing a cough. Understanding I'd now need to shut myself in for at least two weeks, I set about getting a few supplies. Near enough everything was completely sold out online, however, I managed to find an amazon listing for 40pcks of ramen. Couldn't believe my luck! All were sold out bar the spicy chicken flavour. Not a problem - I like a bit of spice. Without reading the ad, I purchased immediately using the buy now button, thinking I'd found the listing just in time...\n\nIt arrived a few days later and I eagerly grabbed a pack. I noticed it read 2x spicy on the front. No worries, as a Brit, a hot curry and a pint is pretty much a weekly occurrence from birth. I excitedly cook my first batch. Pouring the included sauce on I notice it's blood red, thick and viscous. Once mixed In though it looks OK. The noodles smell great. Oniony, chickeny tomato like smell. Right up my street. \n\nI took my first mouthful and messily slurped up the noods, getting the sauce all over my lips. It tasted pretty g- OH MY GOD WTF THE PAIN!!???\n\nIt was IMMEDIATELY screaming hot. Intense heat within 2 seconds flat. I coughed, inhaling some of the oily sauce and having it stick to the back of my throat, making me cough more and more. I ran for the milk, which offered me only temporary relief. I suffered through and finished the bowl. By the end, I was crying, sweating, pouring out from my nose and had turned a lovely shade of red. I had a Google of the brand and it turned out these are the hottest ramen available on the market. A limited \"nuclear fire\" edition release with double the spice of their already extremely spicy \"fire\" ramen. Just the originals are so hot that it's become a trend online to film yourself attempt to eat a single pack. I now have 39 more packs of the twice as hot kind to get through.\n\nI refuse to let these go to waste. I'm 5 packs in so far, each pack literally makes me cry. I sincerely regret panic buying. Let this be a lesson for anyone. Just shop normally and read things before buying them. Don't be a twat like me.\n\nTldr: panic bought the hottest instant ramen on the planet in bulk without reading the product description. Now suffering greatly for my stupidity. 35 packs of suffering left.\n\nPs. My sister had a common cold, nothing to worry about. :)\n\nEdit: the noodles are samyang 2x spicy fire chicken ramyun. Alternatively, Google \"worlds spiciest ramen\"\n\nEdit2: Please, get out of my dm's. I will NOT send noods.\n\nEdit3: Wow, apparently saying as a Brit I can handle spice makes about as much sense as saying as a fish I can handle dry land. Apologies for triggering the spicelords...\n\nEdit4: So you're saying ketchup ISN'T spicy????\n\nEdit5: I have started to piss streams of fire. Genuinely painful burning sensation up through the inside and tip of my wingly wangler. Who'd have thought that was a thing??",

I find the after effects to be even more uncomfortable, so I recommend consuming a good amount of fiber and vegetables also.\n\nIf you are looking for a burning remedy inside the mouth, the best solution is lemon juice. When I am eating things like this I mix some lemon juice and water for a beverage - the high acidity of the lemon juice actually neutralizes spicy oils. Drinking water feels good when it's in your mouth, but all it really does is move the oil around.",

But she's stuck on consoles and her iPad and has been making noises about wanting mods for the past 18 months. I keep telling her bedrock doesn't do mods and she always replies with \"well buy me a computer\".  \n\nWell two weeks ago we were talking about her gym class she goes to where they do fun physical fitness stuff for kids. Its at a real gym with real gym instructors. She said they did a plank for 30 seconds as part of her class. And I (stupidly) said if you can beat my plank time id buy her a computer. Now my time is 2.25. And my wifes is around 3.15. \n\nSo the gym instructor asked all the kids what their goals are this year. Just a general life thing not related specifically to physical fitness. Some said stuff like \"read more\" or \"finish X game\" etc. my kid says \"To do a 4 minute plank\".  Well the instructor suddenly had something he could work with. So he said \"ok lets do that!\". \n\nIn my kids bravado she had forgotten the original bet was 2.26 or better. In doing so she overshot it by a fair way and made it considerably harder for herself\n\nBy the end she was a sweaty crying mess, her form had gone to hell but it was definitely still a plank. The instructor yelled 4 minutes and she said \"can i stop now?\" between tears and heavy breathing. She stopped at 4.08. \n\nAnyway, whats a good mid level graphics card for Minecraft with some shaders?\n\nTL;DR Made a stupid bet with my kid about buying her a PC if she beat my plank time. I lost and am now poor.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies, generous offers of parts and build specs! Wow this blew up while I was asleep on Australia time. She woke up this morning and I said \"Are you sore from yesterday?\" and she says \"No why?\". Well, now im really annoyed. Promise i'll post an update.",

I knew my daughter valued the daddy/daughter time, so I told my son, \"Sorry bud, you can't go unless you can play the game, and you need to be able to read the cards and do the math for the cards' health to be able to play.\"  At this point he was barely reading board books, I figured I had at least half a year or so.\n\nA week later he walked up to me with a deck he put together and read through every card and explained how many hit points randomly-selected pairs of cards would have after attacking each other.  I then proceeded to pull random cards from my daughter's stash, figuring he just memorized the ones in his deck.  He read all those to me too.\n\nSo that was how my son managed to end my six-month dodge, five and three quarters months early.",

            "Love the bet with your kid, I'm known for making bets with my 11 year old daughter too!  I really hope you get this comment, my dad did a similar bet with me.  Back when I was 10, he knew I loved computer games (super nintendo emulators!) but that I only had them at his house since my parents were divorced.  He one weekend had a table full of boxes.  He simply said \"these are all the parts to make a computer, if you can get it working, you can take it home\".  He knew I loved puzzles, fixing things, gundam models, and legos.  So this was my ultimate functioning lego.  Of course this was before Google and such, he would check in with me just to look, make sure I was safe, ask me how I was doing and where I thought I was in the process, and it took me all weekend..  He made sure I didn't give up.  It made me appreciate computers far more, and actually sparked my interest in them.  Many moons later, I have my Cisco Certified Networking Associate, Security +, Bach degree (working on masters), and about 15 years of IT experience making well over $100k a year and LOVING my job.  I don't have a lot of memories with my dad that make me truly smile, but every time I pull open a computer it makes me think of him.\n\nObviously you can't bet her to build it to keep it haha, but building it together could be just as fun!  If you need any assistance send me a message!",

Sure your wallet may be a bit lighter, but I think that's a small price to pay for the lessons everyone involved learned. \n\n\nCongrats OP! Some people never figure out how to successfully motivate their kids (in a healthy way) but it looks like you're on to something! Happy minecrafting to your little one!",

EXCEPT in the background he'd  made friends with a gym rat kid at school and he'd been exercising every day, multiple times per day and we never suspected. Apparently he waits until I'm watching TV in the evening with earphones in and my wife is asleep and does pull-up reps in the garage! So, not knowing this I said, let's knock out 20 pushups since I knew that I could do 25 or 30 if I pushed. After I turned 50 I've neglected the gym a bit....\n\nAnyway we did 25 face to face and I was getting worried but it was pretty amazing, little dude has zero body fat and has somehow become ripped!

This has a monitor but needs a mouse and a key board.  \nThere are a few other things you should look into like instead of buying a gpu some apu(s) can run many games at respectable frame rates without a dedicated graphics card, while still having the expandability for one in the future, also i would recommend a run of cat6 to the computer because wireless is bloated nowadays.",
            "That's some motivation. Nice to hear that you are going to keep the bet as everyone should. \n\nI suggest a nvidia 1060. Not the newest but definetly a good starter graphics card that will work for the next few years, especially minecraft. And if she wants to do mods, she definetly will find out that there are shaders too, which will make the game look fantastic and a 1060 is a solid graphics card for minecraft with mods (and shaders).\n\nSome other things you have to consider:\n8 GB ram minimum and\nminecraft won't take much space so 500 GB space is enough.",
            "Ouch, truly a FU for the ages with your timing.  GPUs are still pretty expensive due to shortages.  Your best bet to find out what is good value for your desired needs is to post in a sub-Reddit like PC Master Race with a list of what you need the PC to do and ask for recommendations.\n\n\\*edit\\* for what it is worth, ignore the \"Minecraft can run on a potato\" comments.  Once you start playing with shaders then the requirements shoot up rather dramatically.  If you get her a 1080p monitor then I would recommend a GTX 1060 or better along with something like a Ryzen 3600.  My daughters also love Minecraft, one has a 2700x with a 980 ti and the other has a 4790k\\* with a GTX 1650 and the 1650 really struggles with Minecraft on a 1080p monitor using shaders.  Both of those PCs are hand-me-downs from my PC over the years other than the 1650 and hopefully the release of AM5 will see that 4790 go to my son as I upgrade to that platform.\n\nAlso, a 4 minute plank is rather impressive regardless of her age.",
            "I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re keeping your word. Lying to her at such a young age for something so difficult will probably scar her for life. \n\nIf you can get your hands on any 3000 series gpu from Nvidia you\u2019re in good shape. \n\nIf you are open to second hand gpus there might be a price drop soon with how bad crypto mining is recently. (not an expert on crypto just heard people might sell their gpus if it does fall.) I wouldn\u2019t shop for a gpu worst than a Gtx 1070.",
            "Rtx 3090, intel 129000k, ddr5 ram 64 gb 4000mhz, and a 4K 240hz monitor.",
            "probably wont be seen but a 1660 would be perfect. remember also that minecraft is a ram based game so more ram allocated to the game=more fps. using shaders and stuff is where the gpu comes into play",

So I put my head down on the desk and took a fat nap. Shortly after I fell asleep, my nose started bleeding. A lot. There was so much blood, it formed a massive puddle on the desk. \n\nEveryone else was gone at this point. My teacher is a G so he lets us play dodgeball during study hall from time to time. He figured I was really tired so he didn\u2019t wake me up for it. \n\nEventually they all came back, and saw me with my head on the desk and a puddle of blood forming around it. They all started freaking out, and all the commotion woke me up. So then I sat up and I was like, \u201chuh?\u201d\n\nThe end\n\nTL;DR: fell asleep in class whilst everyone else was gone playing dodgeball, got a bloody nose, looked like I was dead when they all came back\n\nEDIT: did you die?

        "selftext": "Sorry for the length and formatting. On mobile. \n\nTLDR; I ignored the warning of a friend about a guy who asked me out, I lived to regret it\n\nThis happened in 2008, shortly after I got stationed in South Korea (Republic of Korea, officially.) \n\nI was a lowly private, albeit a reasonably attractive woman in my early twenties. I was out one night with some friends, when a tall, funny redhead guy, who happened to be one of my friend's soldiers, asked to take me out to dinner. \n\nFriend told me it was a bad idea. I asked why, but he wouldn't give me details. My exact words were \"what's the worst that could happen, I get a free meal and we don't click?\" \n\nAs you may have guessed, this was not, in fact, the worst that could happen. \n\nThe following evening, we were supposed to meet at the taxi stand outside post, but he was late. He calls to tell me he's at the ATM and ask if I have cash for the taxi. Not a great start, but, sure, I can spring for the taxi. \n\nHe gets to the taxi stand, we ask the Korean taxi driver, in our mash of Korean and English, to take us to the nearby Air Force base, which houses the only Chili's on the peninsula. Something to the effect of \"Adishe, Osan ka-ju-sai-oh\" (Sir, take us to Osan, please.)\n\nWe're going through back roads, and I ask what he thinks of Korea so far. He starts going off on a rant about how \"these people don't even speak English\" and I must have looked at him like he had lost his mind. As I open my mouth to speak,  a little boy loses his ball and runs into the street to get it. This set Red off all over again, talking about \"these people have no common sense!\" and just really racist, weird and out of touch comments. \n\nWhen he finally takes a breath, I remind him that we're in their country, not the other way around, and that everyone's been really respectful, so I'm not sure what his problem was in the first place. He gets mad, and puts his headphones on, not saying another word to me the whole way to Osan. \n\nWhen we finally pull up to Osan Air Force Base, I lean forward to pay the driver, and he says, in perfect English with an American accent \"thank you, ma'am, that will be X amount of wan.\" and I could feel the blood rush to my face. Red does a double take at this man's English and darts out of the cab. I apologize profusely, and the driver reminds me he speaks English, tells me he spent ten years in Chicago, and that he knows I wasn't the one being awful. I tipped him as well as I could, thanked him, and apologized again. \n\nWe had to take another, shorter taxi ride once on base to the Chili's. Red remained silent, and, not surprisingly, I paid for this one, too. \n\nRed, who is about 6 ft 2, dressed in baggy, bleach-white shoes, pants, t-shirt and baseball cap, decides to go to the restroom as soon as we're seated. He comes back, immediately and loudly commenting on \"everyone\" staring at him. Trying to lighten the mood, I say that it's strange how clear it is which guys are Army, and which are Air Force. He asks how I can tell, which is almost funny to me, and I use the phrase \"pretty boys\" to describe the AF guys, and say the soldiers all look a little tougher. He starts *yelling* actually *yelling at me* that if I like AF guys so much, I should go out with one of them. I just stared at him\n\nServer comes, I ask for a water- there's no way I want to be drunk around this dude. He insists that the margaritas are the only reason to come to Chili's, and orders one for me. The server is a young woman who looks at me nervously, but I just nod to let her know it's fine. I ordered a Buffalo chicken salad, he orders two appetizers, beer and a steak. \n\nI had one sip of the margarita, and \"let\" him finish it, on top of the three or four beers he has. He snaps at the server, sends his food back, just everything he could have done. We don't talk much. \n\nThe server brings the check and he says to her \"Oh we'll split it right down the middle\" or something very clearly to the effect of I'm paying 50% of that number. She looks at me again, and I take the check from her. \n\nI am totally done at this point. \n\n\"Oh, if we're going to split it, let's split it! These beers are yours, the steak was yours, the appetizers are yours... technically the margarita was mine, even though you drank it, but I'll take that and my salad, and you, *sir* can pay for the rest!\" The server is just standing there awkwardly staring as I finally raise my voice at this jerk. He opens his mouth to say something and I snap \"What?! Did I *miss something?!*\" and I hand her cash, as he hands her his card. \n\nHe didn't even tip, but I did. (Off post, tipping is rude, but, frankly, she more than earned it.)\n\nHe was totally silent the entire ride back, which, of course, I paid for. \n\nI let his supervisor/my friend who had warned me know how it went down, and apologized for not heeding the warning. Somehow, at PT the next morning, Red had showed up in the wrong uniform and was smoked quite severely, I heard, but we never spoke again.\n\nEDIT: *Thank you* to everyone who has been kind in the comments. I didn't think my default worst date story would cause this kind of ruckus. \n\nINFO: I was an Army medic, stationed on Humphreys at the time. *We were briefed that it was considered rude to tip servers in Korea.* At least one person with more personal knowledge than my own on the matter has clarified this in the comments. I was a server before joining, and strongly support people tipping their servers well and often where it is customary/necessary for them to pay their bills.",

She split from him a while ago, and since I never, ever criticized him, she was still in touch with me to be able to borrow money to get started over. \n\nLadies, listen: Guys don't like to criticize one another, and they often make tons of excuses for bad behavior from men.

            "This reminds me of one of the worst first \u201cdate\u201d\u2019s I\u2019ve ever been on. I met a guy on an online dating app. Talked for about two weeks before we decided to meet up IRL. He had a few pictures in his profile but none of them were that clear but for the most part we seemed to get along pretty good. \n\nHe had agreed to meet up with me at my shop and then we were going to walk next door to this bar/restaurant that I went to all the time. I don\u2019t really care about how much money someone has or get hung up on looks, but don\u2019t flat out lie about every damn thing you say. \n\nThe guy shows up on his bicycle (said he had a car but turns out his license was revoked years ago due to multiple DUIS\u2019s) he is 15 years older than what he said and was using pictures from 15 years ago, he is wearing a white wife beater and light grey sweatpants both are dirty af with visible stains and drenched in sweat from the bile ride. Looks and smells like he hasn\u2019t showered, shaved, brushed his hair or teeth in over a week. Yet I, still trying to give the benefit of the doubt, *still* agree to get a drink next door. \n\nGuy spends a half hour talking about himself and pounding down shots. But then (after my end of the conversation consisting of only of \u201cHuh.Wow.Yeah.Ok.Cool.Huh.\u201d) this guy asks me if I have cash on me to pay for our drinks because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t find an atm on the way over\u201d (yeah ok guy) says this line which I will never be able to forget: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what! Besides these drinks, if you pay for the cab, I\u2019ll *let you* come over to my place!\u201d \n\nI headed to the bathroom, paid and tipped the bartender because she was a friend and I didn\u2019t want her getting stiffed out of money because of my shitty decision to go on this \u201cdate\u201d, called a cab, left out of the back door and went the fuck home. Blocked the dude on everything and luckily never saw or heard from him again. No idea if anyone will read this whole stupid story but this was my shittiest date.",

We lost track of time and had to really book it to get back before curfew, but in our drunken stupor we lost track of one of our friends (he'd disappeared at one point and we couldn't find him)\n\nCome to find out the next morning that he'd stayed in Osan and crashed in a hotel for the night. We found him just walking down the street when we returned for him. We treated him to Chili's as an apology, except we didn't know how long the walk would be to get there, so we had a pretty good hike to round things off.",

            "I went on a date like this once 9 years ago when I was 18.\n\n\nI have to preface this by saying at 18, I was freshly out of a long term relationship, had absolutely no self confidence, was really shy and didn't have great boundaries. I met some guy on PlentyOfFish who shared a few interests with me, was a little older (mid 20s) and seemed really lonely, so we talked on and off for a few days. he asked if I'd like to go on a date, and despite the fact that I wasn't really attracted to him, I said yes.\n\n\nhe lived an hour away, and I didn't drive at the time. so he drove up to my suburban Denver town to meet me at my apartment. right when he stepped out of the car, an overwhelming scent of cheap cologne hit me, and he enveloped me in a really long and uncomfortable hug. I got in his car and asked what he wanted to do. he asked if there was a mall around here, because he wanted to eat at a food court (why would you drive for an hour just to eat at a shitty food court?). I directed him to the local mall, an outdated, echoey place called Southwest Plaza (if you've been there - remember SW Plaza before it got remodeled? yeah, that's the version of it we went to).\n\n\non the way there, he played this horrible, 99% bass house music way too loud enough for us to even speak over, so we didn't. we arrived at the mall and as we walked in, passed a young woman wearing shorts. my date yelled \"CAMEL TOE!!!\" out loud, unprompted. I was so shocked that it took me a second to realize he was talking about the woman. in hindsight, I should have seen all these red flags right off the bat and gone running, but I didn't. \ud83d\ude44\n\n\nwe got to the food court and my date settled on a Chinese spot run by a family; their teenage son was tending the counter that day. he stood pondering the menu for a while, then said to the kid, \"do you have any dog?\" the kid didn't say anything, but looked at him with an expression of abject hatred so intense that I felt it in my entire body. \"no... no dog? okay, well how about cat? I hear cat's leaner, anyway.\" I don't remember what my date ended up ordering but I hope to god there was a lot of spit in it.\n\n\nafter we ate, my date decided he wanted ice cream, so we headed downstairs to Dairy Queen. we were standing in line behind a bigger woman, so my date took this opportunity to say very loudly to me, \"god! shouldn't she be standing in line at the gym, not at Dairy Queen? I mean, come on.\" the woman clearly heard him but didn't turn around or say anything. I was totally mortified. I'm not thin by any means myself, but I knew from prior conversations that my date had recently lost upwards of a hundred pounds - he used to be obese, too. who the fuck did he think he was?\n\n\nI made up some lie about being tired, and did my best to drag my date back towards the parking lot, but he wanted to stop at Journey's before we left. I stood just outside the entrance while he went in and looked at the wall display of shoes. another guy approached the wall, and I heard my date say to him, \"hey man, what do you think of these shoes?\" the guy gave some kind of \"they're alright\" answer, but my date cut him off and said \"I think they're horrible. I would never buy these shoes. you know why?\" the stranger, taken aback, half-heartedly asked why and my date, who is white, spat \"because they're N***** shoes. only N*****S wear these shoes.\"\n\n\nI turned on my heel and speedwalked out to the parking lot. it was a long bus ride home but I'd literally rather have been anywhere else at that moment. my date jogged up to me outside and asked where I was going. I told him that I'd never met a worse person than him, that he was racist, childish and horrible and that I'd like to go home. he complained about the hour he spent driving up there, how he thought I was having a good time - he even lamented that he thought we had the same \"sense of humor.\" he said \"let me take you home at least,\" which he did. the shitty house music didn't even begin to cover the awkward silence in his car on the ride back to my place.\n\n\na few days later, he messaged me and said \"I know our first date didn't go so well, but I meant to ask: do you want to be fuck buddies?\" I later found out he lied to me about having a child (said he didn't when he definitely did).",

        "selftext": "So this started 2 weeks ago\n\nI went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. Doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a GF.\n\n Naturally I start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. I get to teasing him about him not losing his V card, my mom is not liking the conversation. His gf ends up coming over, I stopped the teasing I'm not a monster. So I'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. I tell her not to worry about it I'll talk her into letting my brother go out.\n\nI get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. My argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised Ying and yang I grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. He grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. Saying how a party would be good for him I even offered to go, (I'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, I told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (I know how that sounds). So I finally convinced her she agreed.\n\nSo I decide that I need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. I knew my bro was losing it that night. Fast forward to the party, I drop him off so my mom thinks Imma be there. I pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. Bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. \n\nSkip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. Well holy fuck did I get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. Well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  So now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and I'm becoming an uncle.\n\nTL;DR Convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his V card, he got his gf pregnant. \n\n\nUpdate 1: So she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. So we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. I'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. My brother is getting tested for STI's I was all over him about that. Also thanks for the gold and silver (I have no idea what that does). Thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. \n\nUpdate 2: Everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. My brother does not have any STI's or STD's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,I'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. There are quite a few of you wondering what the \"teenage gang stuff\" was you can DM and I can explain what I did if curious, how I got out, how my life has changed and all. \n\nUpdate 3: *in Maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! Mother is crying brother is in shock and the GFs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. Everyone pray for this child. \n\n\nUpdate 4: They are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, I helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. I've started a savings account for him, and my GF and I are going to move into a place with him and his GF to help them out.",

            "2 weeks ago? It's *not impossible* that she knows she's pregnant already, but I highly doubt it unless she was already pregnant before the party.  I'd have her take a pregnancy test around him (could be lying about that) and then a paternity test (if positive).  All ASAP, because if he thinks she's already pregnant, what could raw dogging it again hurt? \n\nTo convince him, just explain how wrong all the timing is.  It takes at least 9 days for HCG levels to be high enough to get a positive, and she'd have to have been ovulating just after the party, AND she'd have to have missed a period (unless she wanted this kid and planned the whole thing and was testing early).  Whichever way you look at it, she's probably insane. ",

I just have to get a doctor's note and I can retake it.\nSo off to the doctor's office I go, trying to fix this mess.\nI had to come up with a reason why I couldn't go to my exam today. I told the doctor I had massive ear pain, a headache, and some nausea.\nDoctor checked me and I ended up having an infected wisdom tooth. I just didnt notice it somehow. I had some pain here and there but it felt like it was coming out of my tempomandibular joint wich I have had problems with before.\nAnyway at least I have my doctors note now. \nFirst problem fixed.\nI chose to get said wisdom tooth pulled because it was crooked anyway and the infection would probably reoccur.\nMom drives me to the dental surgeon. I got drugged up real good.\nTooth pulled, everything went fine.\nGot in the car with mom, told her about every time I have done drugs, and about all of the gay sex i have had (she didn't know I was gay). \nNow I am in a shit ton of pain, my mom won't look me in the eyes anymore, and I cant sleep because the cows are going insane again.\nTL;DR: tried to bamboozle my doctor into giving me a doctor's note because I overslept my exam, ended up having to get my wisdom tooth pulled and came out to my mother high of off my ass.\n\nEDIT: 1.this did not happen in one day.

I like to work out to music and there is one particular song that for some reason really helps me get in the mood to squat. It's a song that I'd played for some time without question until 4 months ago because it has a few swear words in it.\n\nMy child had been listening to the song a lot more because they recently got into dancing to my music, I realised this when they repeated some of the lyrics and I explained to them why sometimes there are words that we don't use and why ect. \n\nMy child is very emotionally in tune and can express themselves very well. So after this conversation they were very alert to any 'naughty' words, so if they hear anyone swear now they will tell them it's not okay. \n\nLet's fast forward to a few weeks ago, my child is now having a lot of big feelings that are resulting in big tantrums. Tantrums where they start lifting their fingers up and crossing them over into the shape of an X, and then saying 'off mummy, off' while moving this little X made of fingers in my direction. That confused me for a bit I must admit.\n\nThen came the realisation. \n\nWe were sat down eating dinner and I said the dreaded word that every toddler hates - 'no'. That one word started something that let me know how intelligent my toddler really is. My toddler lifted their fingers, crossed them over, stared at me and said 'x off mummy'. I sat there for a minute while it dawned on me. \n\nI composed myself, and then I asked if 'X' meant something else? My toddler silently nodded while staring at me... I asked what it meant and I was met with 'I can't tell you, it's a naughty word mummy'. This was all the confirmation that I needed but I knew I still had to continue to address this issue. \n\nI asked if 'X' was the same word from the song. My toddler broke out laughing, smiled at me and said 'yes mummy'. They had been telling me to fuck off in their own very unique way during tantrums for a few weeks now, and I didn't have any idea until it dawned on me that X had another meaning.  \n\nTL;DR Toddler repeated a swear word, and got told not to use swear words. Toddler then created their own swear word in response and had been swearing at me for a few weeks",

At one point our inner children came to shine and we just bashed each other with them, some occasional tickling, her screaming and one or another balloon popped. I'll spare you further details, since I'm sure you get the idea.\n\nFast forward to when we were done.\n\nWe're not tired yet, so we start up some streaming page and watch a movie. after like 5 minutes there is a blast, like someone hit the side of our building with a car, and again and again. i quickly grabbed my underwear from the floor and put them on while drunkenly moving towards the door to check what the hell is going on. I'm still one room from the entrance, but have a line of sight when the door blasted open and a Special Forces Police Unit team of 6 stormed into our apartment.\n\nwell.. i was standing there, in my undies and deaddrunk. my GF naked in the bedroom even more drunk.\nI'm doing some occasional artsy craft, and from a sale I got to own about 7 completely disassembled mannequins and baby dolls. For a lack of proper storage they're cutrently spread throughout the apartment. It kinda looks like a cheap horror movie at the moment.\n\nSo I was laying there, face down and surrounded by taped babydolls and limbs of mannequins. That for sure does not look good. They put a hood over my head and brought my girlfriend and me to the police station for questioning\n\napparently someone heard her screaming and the bangs and thought someone was murdered\n\nWell.. I just came home from the police office where I got laughed at for this story and I thought it might give you a good laugh as well.\n\nTL;DR spicing up sexlife with things we found on the internet lead to Special Forces Police Unit kicking in our door\n\nEdit: it seems important to mention that I'm not based in the US\n\nEdit2: yes this happened. i was there when it did. here's the door with one of my babydoll projects in the background: http://imgur.com/gallery/U34z3OG\n\nEdit3: police paid for the door. carpenter will come in on monday\n\nEdit4: the hood was to protect the identity of the Police Unit since they also do a lot of undercover shit",

I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. \n\nWe pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. \n\nBeing one who didn't want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. \n\nAs I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. \n\nAs I'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. \n\nShe then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. \n\nThe cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. \n\nTL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car\n\nEdit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350",

The driver was just travelling down the freeway without any idea this was going on.\n\nMy buddy and I flagged him down and followed him to the side of the road to offer any assistance we could.

They ate some hummus first, then put it away (didn't do anything at the same time like some of you freaks suggested) and then had sex. My son's boyfriend (I think they're boyfriends) saw the post and couldn't stop laughing, so told my son (thinking it could be about them) who told me because I think he felt a bit guilty about hiding it.\n\nOther than that, nothing really exciting happened. We had a long awkward talk, I told him I don't really endorse him having sex but he should really use a condom etc.\n\nNow onto the more important thing, hummus. I really like hummus now, I'd never had it before because it just looked kinda disgusting (yellow and sludgy) but I have learnt appearances can be deceiving. It was homemade so I'm going to have to ask for the recipe so I can make some more (I've finished all of it)\nAlso what are some other good things to dip in it? I've tried the obvious things (carrot, cucumber, breads) and any suggestions would be appreciated. \nA lot of people have recommended Baba Ganoush as well? Is that similar or better than Hummus?\n\n\nTLDR: My son is actually gay, but also I really like hummus",

Pour the sesame seeds into a food processor and turn it on. Pulverize them to your heart\u2019s content. \n\n2. Slowly add olive oil while the food processor is running until you get a paste. The sesame seeds should stop jumping and the mixture should turn smooth and semi-liquid. \n\n3. Turn off the food processor. Add 1/4 cup lemon juice, 3 additional tablespoons of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of water (I use the water from the chickpea can myself because I\u2019m classy.)\n\n4. Run the food processor until you have a nice, smooth liquid. \n\n5. Turn off the food processor. Add drained chickpeas, garlic, salt, and cumin. Then run the food processor again. You might need to scrape the sides a couple times and rerun to make it smooth. \n\n6. Pour your hummus into a serving bowl. Use a spoon or spatula to make a well in the middle. Fill with olive oil and garnish the solid part with a dusting of paprika. \n\n\nIf you want to make flavored hummus, grab a bell pepper (roasted,) extra garlic, a handful of olives, 2-3 jalape\u00f1os, or whatever else you want in there. Add about 75% to the food processor (Step 5) and replace the olive oil in the well with the other 25% (Step 6.) For example, throw 3 walls of a roasted red pepper into the mixer and chop up the 4th wall to throw in the well. \n\nEnjoy!",

Peel off long strips of lemon peel for the topping and then cut and squeeze the lemon into a blender and add the tahini to the blender. Blend for 15 seconds to whip air into the tahini. It should go from a liquid to thick and fluffy.\n3. Add the olive oil and the garlic and blend for another 15 seconds until combined.\n4. Add half the chickpeas and blend for 15 seconds, if there are still whole chickpeas that haven\u2019t been blended scrape down the sides and keep blending, repeat with the second half of the chickpeas.\n5. The texture should look quite dry at this point so add the water and blend till you like the texture, add the cumin and salt and blend to combine. \n6. Add to a bowl and score the top with a fork to alow the olive oil in the topping to evenly cover the top\n\nTopping\n1. Cut the garlic cloves into slices and add with the lemon peel to a frying pan with olive oil and fry with constant stiring for 1-2 mins on low heat just so that the lemon peel curls up and the garlic starts to brown. \n2.

I should also mention that for almost ten years I've used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. It's by no means a secret identity, but it's also not explicitly connected to my real name. Or so I thought. I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:\n\n***I have to say when \"Titty Boobowitz\" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  \n\n***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** \n\nOoops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up \"you're not moving on to the interview process\" email.  \n\nTL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.\n\nEDIT: Just because I didn't make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up. We had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. I'm relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to TONS of idiots like me. At least I didn't put \"attention to detail\" anywhere in my resume. \n\n",

Typically in my in person classes, I am usually just there and get my work done and leave, I usually just blend in and go under the radar in most classes.\n\nBasically, I have recently been seeing the memes and TikToks of students joining with funny backgrounds, and some are hilarious.

Suddenly the professor gasps and starts cracking up, as does everyone else, when the professor is like \"[/u/iamnotonaplane](https://www.reddit.com/u/iamnotonaplane/) WTF is that on your screen\", and I am like \"Whats what?\" when I open my own screen and see myself inbetween the legs of the one and only.\n\nTime to drop out.\n\nFML.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR accidentally joined my zoom call for my class with a large black dick in my background.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold!",

However I don't really think his girlfriend(s) or family truly care about the money. They just want Wood to be remembered for who he was.\n\nThe overarching theme of the article seems to be \"what if you died and the thing that came to define you was just one photo, of one moment in your life.. a jokey meme meant to shock\"\n\nIf anything, let's all remember Wood as a real person full man with his own hopes, dreams and faults.\n\nFinally, just to be clear I don't judge anyone for spreading it. There have been millions of these photos and there will be millions more. The picture was taken with his full consent.

For better or worse, she managed to not point the camera at herself but the other attendees got an earful while they stared at her tacky bathroom wallpaper. Then today, my wife shows me a video of a Zoom call with about 15 people in it and some woman heads to the bathroom, puts the laptop on the floor pointing right back at the commode so she'll be able to see the screen and pulls down her pants and sits down to do her business in front of everyone before realizing in panicked horror her mistake. \n\nThis is why I'm drafting a policy that all Zoom meetings must be recorded.\n\nKeep up the good work people of Earth.",

We topped the evening off with some marital bedtime bliss and fell asleep holding each other...\n\n...and I very nearly never woke up. \n\nI am a person with environmental allergies. I had never before experienced anything as severe as anaphylaxis, but the allergies have undoubtedly gotten worse as I age even with medication. \n\nMy wife, meanwhile, is a person with chronic pains. Her physical therapist had recently sold her a topical pain salve made from all natural resources. On the night in question, my wife had applied the salve to her sore neck hours before I fell asleep with my face cradled there.\n\nThis pain salve, as it turns out, is a simple mix of poplar buds and honey. \n\nI am very allergic to poplar. \n\nSedated by the wine and extreme fatigue of a late night, my body slept through the early warning signs. By the time I woke up, I was covered head to toes in hives and struggling to steal gasps of air. My fingers and toes were completely numb. Nothing made sense to me. \n\nI\u2019m very happy to report that the medications I have on hand curbed the attack, but another hour asleep might have done me in, or at the very least sent me to the ER. \n\nWifey threw away the salve. \n\nGod I love her.\n\nTL;DR: Amazing date night with my wife almost ended in fatality when I passed out in a puddle of allergen and nearly experienced my first episode of full-on Anaphylaxis. Wife continues to be amazing woman worthy of love and adoration.",

Got all sorts of medicines.\n\nIt took about three months for me to pee out the stone. Three months of getting up in the night to go to the toilet, goign back to bed, and 60 seconds later needing to pee again.\n\nAt one stage the pain was so bad - even with medication - that I was no longer able to eat. In one 24 hour period I had one bite from a piece of bread...and felt full. I was losing kilos per week. Luckily I was already 120 kg and overweight. I lost more than 20 kg. My shirt fronts were hanging loose. People were commenting on it.

Around midnight we were messing around, and completely naked, when I heard a truck coming up that trail.\n\nNow, she was involved in some nasty child custody stuff at the time, and guns had been waved around more than once, so I was well armed to say the least.

Turns out it was just a buddy of mine headed upriver to check his weed patch, or his trotlines, or some such.  After he passed I walked back down to her, and we got back to our business.\n\nNow, I'm blessed in that I'm not allergic in the slightest to poison ivy or poison oak.  It has no effect on me, at all.  And apparently, when I low crawled that last stretch to the trail I went right through a patch of poison something.\n\nThe next morning, that poor girl was covered.  All over her body, and *inside of her*, too.  She ended up in the hospital over it.  I had one little itchy bump on my wrist.  \n\nPoor kid.  I wasn't surprised when she broke it off.  :)",

        "selftext": "So, the day started out wonderfully. I woke up around  half past six, went out to see that there is absolutely no one at the beach. I quickly ran downstairs, ate a bagle, while putting on my swim trunks. Looking at the clock in my living room I was happy with the amount of time it took for me to get ready and rushed off to the beach. \n\nOnce at the beach I took of my shirt and layed on the sand for a while. All that sun and the gentle rolling of the waves put me to sleep pretty fast. To my surprise I nodded off a fat one, three hours had past since I fell asleep. I was woken up by the screeching of seagulls and yawned while still laying on the sand. When suddenly something wet and mushy landed right in my mouth, yea that's right a seagull shat in my open mouth. \n\nFour hours and 3 tubes of toothpaste later I can still taste the soury bitterness of the turd. \n\nTL;DR Yawned at the beach and a seagull shat in my mouth.\n\nEdit: Oh my, didn't expect that this shitty story would blow up like this. Some say that that brings good luck, guess it brought me good karma, also thank you for my first award yay!\n\nEdit 2 lol: For all of you who were wondering if I got a sunburn. The sun here isn't all that strong in the morning, so I got off without a sunburn.",

            "I don't want to freak you out, but droppings carry a lot of bad stuff. Here's what I found: (Specifically does not mention seagulls, but other birds.)\n\n Here are some examples of transmissible bird diseases associated with pigeons, geese, starlings and house sparrows:\n\n* **Histoplasmosis** is a respiratory disease that may be fatal. It results from a fungus growing in dried bird droppings.\n* **Candidiasis** is a yeast or fungus infection that can be spread by pigeons. The disease affects the skin, mouth, respiratory system, intestines and urogenital tract.\n* **Cryptococcosis** is caused by yeast found in the intestinal tract of pigeons and starlings. The illness often begins as a pulmonary disease and may later affect the central nervous system. Since attics, cupolas, ledges, schools, offices, warehouses, mills, barns, park buildings, signs, etc. are typical roosting and nesting sites, the fungus is apt to found in these areas. Dust from droppings can be sucked through ventilators and air conditioners, contaminating food and cooking surfaces in restaurants, homes and food processing plants.\n* **St. Louis Encephalitis**, an inflammation of the nervous system, usually causes drowsiness, headaches and fever. It may even result in paralysis, coma or death. The disease is spread by mosquitoes which have fed on infected house sparrows, pigeons and house finches carrying the Group B virus responsible for St. Louis encephalitis.\n* **Salmonellosis** often occurs as \u201cfood poisoning\u201d and can be traced to pigeons, starlings, sparrows and rodents. The disease bacteria are found in bird droppings; dust from droppings can be sucked through ventilators and air conditioners, contaminating food and cooking surfaces in restaurants, homes and food processing plants.\n* ***E.coli*** infection: It is one of the common infections caused by an enteric bacteria.\n\nSource:\n\n[The Human Health Dangers of Bird Droppings Associated with Building HVAC Systems - Pure Air Control Services, Inc.](http://pureaircontrols.com/human-health-dangers-bird-droppings-associated-building-hvac-systems/)",

These are semidetached houses in a housing estate, so it took me maybe 30 seconds to get to that house, 30 seconds back. Just as I was dashing back home, I felt a massive, warm, gloopy something on my face. I kept running, straight into the kitchen and shouted at my mother \u201cmammy, something landed on my face!\u201d Once she stopped laughing her arse off, she cleaned me up, told me a bird pooped on my face, and that it\u2019s really good luck.

        "selftext": "I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn\u2019t bring myself to post this. \n\nBut reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. \n\nSo yesterday was my sister\u2019s birthday (this fu didn\u2019t happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. \n\n\u201cLook what mom gave me,\u201d said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.\n\nNow, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Looneytoon. My primitive ape brain said \u201cfunny joke!\u201d\n\nSo I did it.\n\nI think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister\u2019s eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. \n\nSo my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister\u2019s ring. No, I didn\u2019t know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.\n\nSo brief intermission from my sister\u2019s birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother\u2019s chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. \n\nI shat out the ring this morning. \n\nHappy birthday sis. \n\nTL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister\u2019s ring because I thought it would be funny. \n\nEDIT: good fucking god my inbox. Tune in tomorrow morning and I\u2019ll share a picture of the accursed ring\n\nEDIT 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.\n\nEDIT 3: front page!! We did it reddit.

To top it off when I said hi the first morning I was back she barely made eye contact with me and just gave me a half smile and curt nod. I asked my husband if he noticed the change and he said he just thought maybe her recent switch from workout clothes to big dresses were making her look bigger. Maybe?
