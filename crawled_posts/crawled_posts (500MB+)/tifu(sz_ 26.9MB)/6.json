        "selftext": "So last night I went out as I do every Saturday.\nWhen I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it \"just to rest for a moment\".\n\nI woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn't move it at all.\nAt first I didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.\n\nDuring my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.\nHowever my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. \n\nIt appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.\n\nNow I'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.\n\nTL;DR: Drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",

            "Jerez this should be a PSA.  I often wake up with that pins and needles feeling in my arms because I too sleep with my arm under my head.  And I often drink a lot of beers too.\n\nScary stuff, hope it gets better.",
            "Wtf dude I feel really sorry for you! Thats so fucked up! I hope it gets better with time as I heard you can sometimes train your nerves.",

            "Thank you for introducing me to this new fear, I now will hesitate every fucking time I go to sleep.",
            "Ok. This isn't permanent usually. It typically takes a while to rehab and it's faster and more likely to be temporary if you try to rehab it. You'll be fine. \n\nThe people who end up with real damage are the ones that don't rehab it.\n\nSon of an ER doctor. Not terribly uncommon.",
            "If I remember rightly Dave Mustaine, guitarist and lead singer of metal band Megadeth, did something similar to his arm when he passed out after shooting up heroin. When he woke up his arm was basically useless and he had to teach himself to play the guitar and regain the same muscle memory that he had built up playing over the years. He eventually did and continued to have a pretty successful career with his band so yeh. \n\nGood luck with your recovery! It might not be smooth but hopefully you'll gain full control of your arm and hand movement again.",
            "Something similar happened to me in the past. You will probably be okay.",
            "That's tough but not the first time I have heard of this occurring. This happened to a friend of mine while we were in college, definitely did a number on him mentally but after a couple of months in PT he finally regained full functionality. Stay strong my dude.",
            "This is actually pretty common. It\u2019s casually referred to as Saturday night\u2019s palsy. Though if I recall correctly it usually clears up within a few months and you usually get full or near full motor skills back. I remember the healing process taking something like a week per inch of damaged nerve. \nWith that said I\u2019m no doctor, just going from what I heard/read at some point so do your own research if you\u2019re curious.",
            "I broke my right wrist (am right handed) a few months ago and had to do my exams with my left hand. Till this day my hand is not as flexible and strong as it used to be.\nIt sucks to not be able to use your hand fully but hopefully you find joy in learning to use your left like I did.",
            "A farewell to arms... I just woke up with a biblical hangover and somehow I\u2019ve lost a part of my back molar. My mother asked me to come out to a family gathering in the beer garden... I think I\u2019ll go for the cure. Good luck with the arm, friend.",
            "I did this a couple of years ago. Got drunk at home, too drunk in fact. I'm not entirely sure how I caused the damage, whether I banged it or anything.\n\nWhat I do know is that I fell asleep on my computer desk, so the presumption from the doctor was that I'd fell asleep with my arm against the desk and my weight behind it.\n\nI was told it was Radial Nerve Palsy and that it could be months or up to a year to recover.\n\nI had no grip at all in that hand, couldn't even move a finger, but it had recovered after six weeks, (probably more like 7-8 weeks to gain back full strength).",
            "It's called Saturday Night Palsy. Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine suffered it when he fell asleep with his arm over a chair. Had to re-learn how to play guitar as it was unclear whether he would be able to in the first place after the injury",
            "Wow what a thing to happen.  Another hidden danger of drunkenness.   I had nerve damage from a pinch/pressure point.   Saw an acupuncturist who really helped me. Nerves can definitely heal but it happens slowly.   It may come back yet.  Good luck!",
            "Well thanks for the psa for sure. Guess you don't be driving stick too often.",
            "The vocalist from Megadeth actually fell asleep with his arm over-hanging the back of a chair in the hospital when he was younger and it paralyzed his playing arm. He was able to get movement back through a lot of PT. Weird comparison, I know, but your story reminded me of that part of his autobiography. GL OP hope it gets better!",
            "I feel your pain. My SO and I went on a banana boat while on vacation. We weren\u2019t strapped in properly and his foot ended up in my eye. Now I can\u2019t look down without seeing two of everything and my eyes are misaligned. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s permanent but I\u2019m hella depressed about not being able to see properly. Hopefully we\u2019ll both get our shit back in working order.",
            "Man, this happened to me when I was 14 (wasn\u2019t drunk). Was on a 12 hour flight back home and fell asleep with my arm snug between my body and the arm rest thing. Woke up unable to lift my hand at all. Thought yea this is common, it\u2019ll probably be fine in a few minutes, but turns out I had damaged some nerves just like OP.\n\nTurned to physiotherapy, who constructed a cast thing that used metal wires to lift my hand up, as I could still flex my wrist just fine (couldn\u2019t extend it. After a few sessions of using gel and an electrical stimulation thing, my arm showed no signs of improvement. Was told that it would take months for it to recover. I live in Hong Kong, and someone advised me to try acupuncture, and gave a recommendation of a Chinese doctor who did it. Did 3 weeks of 3 sessions a week, and my forearm fully recovered. So OP, I\u2019d recommend giving acupuncture a shot, though it might be hard to find a trustworthy guy depending on where you live.",

            "Damn dude, now I have another thing to worry about when I fall asleep drunk. I wasn't even drunk last night but I woke up this morning with a dead arm from sleeping on it.",
            "Heard about a really drunk guy at a festival falling asleep sitting up with his legs folded underneath him, on his knees. They had to be amputaded. Serious stuff.",
            "This exact thing happened to a friend of mine a few years ago. He passed out in a chair, with his arm dangling over the back of the chair, pinching a nerve in his armpit as he leaned all his dead weight on it for hours. I just saw the aftermath when he had his arm in a sling and mentioned how much it sucked programming like that.\n\nPass out in your bed if you can, on your back as long as you're not absolutely shitfaced and worried about aspirating on vomit. It doesn't hurt having a buddy system in place so that someone's making sure you end up alright once you've had enough too.",
            "1. Did the doctor suggest nerve glides to make sure everything is in the right place?\n2. Find a good physio.",
            "I did this with my feet. Fell asleep kneeling and leaning against the counter in the bathroom for a few hours. Woke up and couldn't feel my feet at all. Went to the hospital and it took 3 days regain feeling to where I could walk again and then another couple weeks before there were no more numb spots in either foot. It was scary as shit.",
            "I personally had this happen to me twice actually. I was put on ambien to help me sleep and it worked a little to well. I woke up to literally no strength in my right hand. I could hold it up but my finger strength was jello. After 2-3 days I was able to type on a keyboard at work. After about 2 weeks things were getting easier. I would say it took at least a month for me to confidently say I had my normal hand strength back. So when it occurred again I just knew I could get through it and pushed on (also stopped taking ambien). Hang in there I think you will get back to normal with some time. I also got a stress ball that I could sit and squeeze when I wasn\u2019t doing anything.",
            "This reminds me of something I read about Eddie Money several decades ago.  Looked around and this was the only reference I could find to this exact thing:\n\n>  At a party one night back in 1980, after drinking heavily, the singer snorted a substance on a mirror that was being passed around the room. Money assumed it was cocaine, but it was really a synthetic barbiturate. He nodded off and spent the next 14 hours lying on his leg, severely damaging a nerve. The incident also brought temporary impairment of his kidney function.  \n\n [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/money-eddie](https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/money-eddie) \n\nI remember in the original article I read that one of the things that bothered him, making him take a more assessing look at his life, was that this was at a party with a lot of people, some of whom were supposed to be his friends. But he sat there, passed out, for 14 hours and no one checked on him.  He got clean after that, but he had to learn how to walk again.",
            "Had a friend do something similar but more severe with heroin  and xanax. Fell asleep on his leg for nine straight hours and when he woke up it was unresponsive. He now has permanent  damage to his leg and has a giant numb spot that I imagine will never fade.",

            "I love how many of the TIFU stories end up in hospital even though hospital makes no difference in the end.",
            "Did this before, with the added twist of also having a girl over. I had to put my pants on one-handed and shove my hand in my pocket to keep it from flopping around. It was a month before I could close my fingers, two months before I could grasp things, and about 4 months until I got my grip strength back. All in all, a terrifying experience.\n\nI hope you regain the ability to grasp things, it sucks.",
            "Just to clarify. I am not extremely overweight. I'm 193cm tall and have a little more fat that I got during the school year. It is the fact that I am a larger guy, but this has happened to people who are half of my size.",
            "Holy fuck. This is my worst fear when I wake up with both arms numb from somehow sleeping on them. Have you ever tried to sit up in bed with both arms numb?",
            "Saturday night palsy. Happened to me too, but without the beer... my L- triceps were affected.  To give you an idea of the damage, I could easily do 30lb skull crushers with my R- tri and only 5lb with my L.  It took 2 years to rebuild the strength, but the size and shape is different than my R...\n\nTLDR: with commitment and dedication to physio, perhaps you can  recover??\n\nBest of luck my friend.",
            "On the bright side, this could make masturbating more interesting.",
            "Sounds similar to what Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) went through like 20 years ago. Was told he probably would never play guitar again. He didn't accept that and with constant exercises he regained the use of his arm. Worth looking into his story",
            "Physical Therapist here....I wouldn't worry too much, and here is why.  \n\nYes, you impinged a nerve. Most likely your ulnar or radial nerve. It's a peripheral nerve and has the ability to regenerate. The fact that you have only reduced sensation and minor loss of strength is a positive sign that full function will return. The big thing is the inflammation from the compression has to be reduced and processed by the body. \n\nDoctors should NEVER say you will be permanently affected by something like this. I've seen people do many things doctors have said they won't. Only Siths deal in absolutes. \n\nKeep working the muscles. Go to physical therapy and have them start working the arm with massage and other techniques to reduce inflammation.  Nerve gliding exercises are good too. And whatever you do, sleep in your other side when you pass out.",
            ">It appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.\n\nThe real fuckup here would be to give up. Rehab it. Work to get it back. Might take weeks, months, years. But don't you dare quit on it because one doctor gave \"his best estimate\".",
            "That sucks man i usually just piss myself.",
            "Pretty much the same thing happened to me a few months ago. I fell asleep in a chair after a long day of work, woke up a few hours later and my whole arm was numb, couldn't move it at all. Usually this'll happen, it goes tingly and everything rushes back. This time it didn't. I had to go to work tell my bosses I'm taking the day after off to figure out what's going on (I work in a labor intensive job so this crippled my ability to work). So I know it was a problem with my nerves and I thought it was pinched so I went to my chiropractor. She worked on me and out didn't get better but she told me it was Radial Nerve Palsy. I knew Dave Mustaine had it from pretty much the same thing, sleeping all fucked up in a chair. It took years for his to get better but I guess since I'm still young mine gradually went away after a few months. It completely changes your life and you basically have to relearn how to function. Have hope man, I know it's difficult but just keep forcing yourself to use the arm. Hopefully it'll gradually get better and it'll all be a long lost nightmare. Do your best not to sleep in chairs or in weird positions everyone.",
            "On the upside, you can give yourself \u201cthe stranger\u201d",
            "Dude, what kind of beer were you drinking? You should write to the company. Tell them how much you sacrificed...\n\nMaybe they could sponsor your recovery. You could find a good rehab team, and work back I to a position where you can open can with one hand.\n\nThis is a fucking brilliant opportunity.",
            "Did some dumb shit when I was drunk myself a couple years ago. I woke up from a blackout and had an incredibly swollen knee and blood all over my room, immediately ran into the bathroom and saw that I had busted my chin open. Got 2 stitches in my chin and even though I'm able to do squats, jumps, and run now I'm forever going to have a bad knee that gets sore if I sit or stand for too long. Sucks being in the sore knee club at 21.",

He announced the disbanding of Megadeth on April 3rd, 2002, and immediately began intense physical therapy in an effort to regain whatever function he could in his left arm/hand. \n\n17 years later, Megadeth is still touring and writing new music, and Dave is still one of the best rhythm guitarists in the genre. \n\nBust your ass, have a good attitude, stay positive, and you never know what you\u2019re capable of.",

Even after around ten minutes my wrist was completely useless and despite being able to move my fingers I couldn't flex my wrist at all. Even though I could move my fingers I could only control them laterally and in gripping motions but not with up and down motions so my entire hand would just flop to whatever gravity dictated. Over the next week I started to gain sensation back in my wrist but by that time my entire forearm already had started to atrophy. I took months to fully gain back my hand and lower arm strength and dexterity but it did come back. Hopefully at least this might be the situation with you.\n\nI had a glob of physical therapy putty from an earlier bone break in my hand and kept it in my hand to remind me to keep trying to move it and I think that helped a lot.

I\u2019m watching a PBS special about WWII submarines and she sat down with her tea and started to watch.   \n\nSo my wife isn\u2019t a huge history buff and I am constantly reminding her of the order of commonly-known events.   She is incredibly intelligent but she apparently had a very boring history teacher and never absorbed the information.  As such, she had no idea that submarines\nwere actually torpedo-carrying murder machines that were designed to blow up their enemies.  \n\nI look at her and she\u2019s bawling\u2026tears running down her face and she says, \u201cBut I thought submarines were just like for exploration and fun and stuff.\u201d  I chalk it up to hormones, but I really ruined a nice morning.\n\nTL;DR made my pregnant wife cry when she found out that submarines are war machines\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, went to sleep and this got a bit hairy.   Thank you to those who understand pregnancy brain and found this as cute, albeit shocking as I did. No thank you to those who went straight to calling my wife horrible things or assuming anything else about her, and a big FU to those saying anything mean about my kids.  Without going into much detail, yes, she had a sheltered childhood where she didn\u2019t encounter submarines all too often, in the water, on land, or in the media.  I guess her parents never gave her the \u201csubmarine talk\u201d.  She does in fact know a lot more about the grisly details of war now, as we have been trying to get her up to date, especially about the world wars.  She may have had an inkling before that submarines were evil, but I don\u2019t think it was something she wanted to hear that morning.  Pretty sure she thought they were used in war, but just for spying on the enemy. Be nice, and may you all keep your heads above water.",

Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. 13-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail.\n\nWhat we didn't know, was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away.\n\nSometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... 'til he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces. You know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour.\n\nThursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Upended. Well, he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here, anyway he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.\n\nAnyway, we delivered the bomb.'",

I've visited two museum submarines from the Gato and Balao-classes (there's one in Pearl Harbor Memorial in Hawaii and another next to the Intrepid in NYC), both of which served during WW2.  Those two classes are significantly smaller and have only a single hull of 2 or less inches separating the crew from the icy depths of the ocean.  Modern submarines have dual hulls; an inner hull for people and an outer hull that's filled with void spaces and ballast tanks.\n\nI can only imagine the complete utter fear and despair of the crew during WW2 when their sub gets sunk from depth charges or sea mines and have less than 15 minutes of breathing air before all compartments flood.\n\nYour wife was partially right: the deep sea exploration stuff was popularized by Jacques Cousteau post-WW2 buuuut the cold hard truth is that military funding drives human innovation.

By mid 1944 Japan was running out of fuel and materials to fully supply their army and navy.  But since unrestricted warfare (sinking merchant ships without warning them first) was one of the crimes we accused the Germans of doing, the US didn't want to admit that it had done the same thing only better, so it really wasn't taught.",

I had video evidence of my kid getting a foot in the face and they ended up being very embarrassed about the whole thing. Honestly though, I\u2019m glad they called me in because you never know what home life is like and hopefully they\u2019ve gotten some kids out of a bad situation. \n\nTL;DR - School thought I beat my kids, but all their bruises come from jiu jitsu training.",

            "When my son was just a little dude, we had a game we'd play. I'd change his diaper and then grab his legs and scooch him back and forth along the floor. He'd giggle and clap and we'd all feel good. \n\nThen we moved to an apartment. I tried that game again and he cried! I rolled him over, and his onesie had ridden up and I'd carpet burned all the skin off his back! Well, not all the skin, but he had a big patch of carpet burn on his back. Worse yet, it was vaguely triangular shaped and looked like it was an imprint of an iron. We'd just moved to the area and started him at a new daycare, and I spent the whole day waiting for cops to show up. They never did, but I was sweating the whole time.\n\nI think the apartment had super-strength carpet and it acted differently than our carpet had at home. Either way, I still feel kinda bad about it, and I totally feel your pain of just knowing that CPS is on the way.",

I\u2019m not sure they believed me because they asked several times. I was laughing about it so they finally caved. \n\nThe doc asked if I wanted him to reset it or if I wanted to wait for a follow up with an ent later that week.  I told him to reset it. It made a serious crunch noise (but the cartilage didn\u2019t move so I had to have it rebroken by the ENT to put it all to rights as much as possible). I didn\u2019t make a sound and took it just fine. The doc couldn\u2019t believe I handled it that well. He told me I handled it better than the men that come in with broken noses. :)",

I was furious that they would call cps without even speaking with me about a child that they had only seen once for a minute and didn\u2019t even attend the school. Luckily cps saw my vacuum and I showed them the mark matched exactly but it really opened my eyes on how easily someone could have their life torn apart from something innocent.",
            "I got CPS called on me in middle school. I am allergic to mosquito bites to the point where they swell up and turn into nasty scabs, even if I don\u2019t itch them. I went to school in shorts with my scabby legs, and the nurse saw me and pulled me aside. Yes, everything is fine at home, I\u2019m allergic blahblahnlah. I still got them called on me, despite me being allergic is also in my school medical record. My parents weren\u2019t too happy with that one on the schools end.",
            "When my daughter was 4 she fell off the swings and broke her arm. My sister in law calls me up and says \u201cthis is cps calling to talk to you about your daughter.\u201d In the panic I don\u2019t recognize her voice and then she breaks out laughing.",
            "I was just talking with my parents about this story.\n\nI was 4 and my family was visiting my grandparents house.  I wanted to take a bicycle ride and BEGGED my dad to let me ride on the handlebars.  He had never let me ride there before, and I don't know why, but he finally gave in and let me.\n\nWe drove down the end of the private road on my grandma's old, yellow bike.  She had put those bright-colored plinky balls on the spokes.  They went up and down on the spokes and went plink plink plink.  4 year old me was mesmerized by then.\n\nPerhaps you see where this is going.\n\nI remember clear as day, 4 year old me thinking, \"Hmmm....I wonder what would happen if I stuck my foot in there.....\"\n\nWe got a little further down the road and I just HAD to know what would happen.  So I did it.\n\nA few moments later, I remember coming to in the ditch.  My sock and shoe had been torn in half and were lying about 20 feet away.  My dad was knocked off the bike, too.  I started screaming.  He scooped me up and ran the 1/4 mile back to the house.  Bless my mom, she heard the screaming outside and had immediately jumped into the old, brown station wagon and picked dad and I up and headed to the hospital.\n\nHere's the part I profusely apologize to my dad about every time I think about it:\n\nIn the ER waiting room, I was crying, wailing, and yelling \"MY DADDY HURT ME!!  MY DADDY HURT ME!!\"  Over and over again.\n\nI don't know how my parents convinced the doctor not to call CPS.  Probably because my dad was a public defender and dealt with actual child abuse quite often for his job.  Then again, I just don't know.  He doesn't remember.  I think he's blocked it out.",
            "My mom was lucky that we got most of our black eyes and chipped teeth during recess lol. Great school to take the initiative though. I'd consider myself very lucky to be surrounded by such amazing teachers and caregivers. Well done to everyone involved!",

            "Similar situation happened to me in high school. Teachers thought i was being abused b/c of bruises i got from martial arts. My mom sat down with the principal and schooled them on what was going on, complete with pictures of me & my brother in tournaments and trophies.",
            "A different story in the same vein. I used to play paintball and we had a headshot only game. This resulted in me getting shot from behind with multiple bullets hitting the back of my arm until I was hit behind the ear (come to think about it, that's the ear that now has hearing loss). Well, the back of my arm was completely bruised. Dark bruises. I live in Phoenix and wear sleeveless shirts a lot. I was also a TA for a psych class. One of the students thought my husband was beating me and told a mutual friend who happened to also play with me so she told him what happened. It was nice that he was concerned and funny that I was so oblivious about how ugly my arm was.",

Maybe mentioning to them how you\u2019re glad that they called you in could help them continue doing so?",
            "Very clever of you to get other kids to beat up your kids, instead of doing it yourself.",
            "I worked in a childcare setting and have had to call CPS a few times. The thing is, teachers/caregivers know your kid pretty well. I\u2019m not about to call on the kid that regularly walks into corners and trips over their feet in front of me for a bruise but I\u2019m keeping an eye on that and might ask what happened.  If your kid wasn\u2019t bruised regularly because of covid and showed up one day with them I would for sure call. Thanks for not taking it personally.",
            "I'm dreading his day myself. My little 2 year old has Mongolian Blue Spots all over her back. They look like shes been hit with a stick thats left bruises. \n\nI take regular photos to show that they've  looked the same since birth because I just KNOW ome day someone's going to accuse me to abusing my daughter.\n\nTheyre in her medical logs and midwife notes etc, bit still.",
            "Ha, I remember putting both my kids into school one day with black eyes.\n\nI headed off the teachers\u2019 inevitable stupid question by putting the two of them together so she could see that the bruise on each child matched the shape of the skull of the other- they\u2019d collided at speed while playing some sort of mad tag/rugby hybrid they\u2019d made up.",

            "I used to work in EMS and we had cheap stretchers that required a bit of jiggling and finangling to get the wheels to drop when lifting. My legs were always covered in bruises from using them to brace the stretcher. Made for interesting conversations when I lived at home with my parents while getting back on my feet.",

            "Funny story time:\n\nWhen I was 8 I got a softball, baseball bat, and glove for my birthday. I went out to play catch with my dad and I wanted to catch a ball that he hit with the bat. I wasn't doing very well pitching to him (I was 8 of course) so he tossed the ball up and hit it with the bat... Line drive to the bridge of my nose! (Accident of course) Knocked out briefly, blood pouring from nose, etc.\n\nA little while later and we get to the hospital. I give my account of events to the nurse or whoever. Doctor walks in and reads the charts: \"so your dad hit you with the bat?\"\n\nMe: \"No, he hit the ball, the ball hit me.\"\n\nConversation continues, doc leaves and comes back, whatever. \"So when your dad hit you with the bat\"... \"NO my dad hit the ball with the bat, the ball hit me!\" This proceeds a couple more times and I'm getting more and more vehement with my responses.\n\nIn my little 8 year old brain I'm thinking, \"you're a doctor! Your supposed to be smart. Why can't you remember that it was the ball! I don't want you to be my doctor!\" My parents however knew exactly what he was doing (checking for abuse) and they just sat back and let me answer.\n\nFor the off topic conclusion: I had a dislocated nose (yes it's a thing. 2 pieces of cartalidge run along either side of the bridge of your nose in little grooves. Mine had popped out and were down closer to my eyes.) They brought in a plastic surgeon who went up through my nose and pushed them back in place (I was put under for the procedure). Instead of having a straight bridge to my nose like my dad does, I have a curve that perfectly fits a softball.",

            "At least they brought it up to you so you could refute it.  When my wife was pregnant, she fell down the stairs.  After that, doctor appointments were super awkward for me.  The nurses were all curt with me and just generally unfriendly.  Usually I get along great with people.  My wife brought it up to one of the nurses and the nurse admitted that they all just assumed I pushed my wife down the stairs.",

For some god forsaken reason, she decided to take it upon herself to claim my parents beat me and neglected to feed or care for me.\n\nI was too young to know if there was any legal stuff, any involvement with social services, or any further repercussions, but my parents did not, and do not beat or neglect me.\n\nNow I think about it, she was quite a Karen.",

Trying to find the words to explain that I worked with a parrot who liked to turn his head upside down like a goober while perched on my arm, and would nip at me if I didn't pay attention to him, was...a struggle. \n\nThey did believe me pretty instantly. I expect that one was too weird for a kid to invent.",

Sorry about formatting, I'm typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven't been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.\n\nMy favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven't washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don't think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn't going to start complaining.\n\nThis morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I'm embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.\n\nTL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.\n\nEdit: I would reply to all of you if I could, but today has been very emotionally taxing.

            "My boyfriend passed away a few months ago and I have a sweater of his I still haven\u2019t washed (gross, I know). It smelled like our bed and I had no idea where the smell came from. After some time, I realized it was the smell of my own lotion! Idk how I didn\u2019t realize it sooner considering he used to use my lotion religiously before bed. Now I put my lotion on my hands, rub the excess onto the sweater, and keep it on my bed to sniff whenever I feel sad. I relate to this post a lot more than I\u2019d like to admit.",
            "First of all, nothing is weird or wrong about how we grieve. Everybody\u2019s process is different and unique and completely valid. I\u2019m guilty of something very similar, albeit also very \u201csad\u201d. \n\nMy dad passed 7 years ago from a drug overdose. Unfortunately, I was the one to find him too. At 20 years old, it was the first real death of somebody close to me and from the second I found him until this very day, I am a different human. When the police and paramedics and other EMS personnel showed up at my house and started to tear everything in my parents bedroom and bathroom apart in an effort to get to him, I was absolutely stoic trying to keep the rest of my family calm. In all of the chaos, I noticed that the bandanna he had wrapped around his head when he died had fallen off, and I snatched it up and shoved it in my pocket before anybody else could see. \n\nI\u2019ve kept this (yes, unwashed, sue me) bandanna in my backpack or purse or luggage every single time I have travelled since then. Nobody else knows I carry it with me. It lost its scent years ago, but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s one of the only things I have of his, and something about it being something he wore on the day he left this world makes it too special to shove in a box or up on a wall or make a pillow/blanket incorporating it. It\u2019s blue and white, and one day if I ever get married I would like to wrap my bouquet in it or wear it on my own head or something, but for now it\u2019s my traveling companion. \n\nTL;DR - Grief is weird by nature. Let it be weird. Those little bonds are all we have left, and ascribing meaning to them allows us to let those we loved so much in life live on through us.\n\nEdit: THANK YOU FOR THE GOLD! My first gold ever :) you\u2019re too kind!",

Well one of those things was a vest and I decided to wear it one winter to stay warm. I thought I kept smelling him on it but the smell was fading. I pulled a jacket out of one of the bags to get a good strong smell and noticed the difference right away. It\u2019s amazing what our minds adapt to and hide from us when trying to protect us. \n\nI hope you can reach out and talk to someone so you can finish working thru your grief. I never did and now 14 years later I feel like it\u2019s to late.",
            "I know lots of people are sending condolences, but I see this as a good thing, sort of. First of all, now you won\u2019t ever be in danger of losing the smell you associate with her.

It has a particular smell - and over time that smell made me feel safe and connected. When she passed, it was all I had to hang on to and ride through the grief. I've since left home, but, I still have her little sweater, favorite toy, and collar with me. Hanging on to those connections isn't a fuck up. It's normal.

Not saying our situations are the same, just that I understand, to some extent I hope, what you must be going through.\n\nI don't see this as a FU though. For me this is beautiful. Let me explain..\n\nImagine what it would have been like had you realised this within a few days that the smell, that beautiful odour of your partner that was helping you stay afloat, was no longer there. That it had been layered over by your own odour. It might have been so much more gut wrenching to think that you had lost her last physical trace. That last thing that reminded you of her presence around you.\n\nBut you see that did not happen.. You did not lose her..\n\nTo me, she actually became a part of you, completely, indelibly. Instead of seeing it as layering I see it as a gradual mixing of your odours, until it became your own.\nCall me a romantic but I refuse to think that the smell is lost to you. Instead it is now what you and her smell like together. For me, she is now forever within you and everytime you get the smell I hope you are reminded that she is always around.\n\nFor me this gives a whole new meaning to what Sirius told Harry, \"Those who love us never truly leave us. You can always find them in here.\"\n\nI am sorry if this comes out as ignorant of your pain, I do not mean to devalue it.

The first thing I did was smell his cap; the scent of coconut hairwax, his cologne and a very faint bit of Marlboro was something I could almost smell before he entered the room. But then the thought suddenly struck me: his scent will fade with time..  I panicked the fuck out. What if one day I can\u2019t remember how he smelled, how his voice sounded, the way he moved, how his big bro hug felt.. At a certain point looking at photographs or videos will feel as if it was a lifetime ago that he was part of my life.. But all this physical proof of his existence, it\u2019s all a blessing to me, but there is one thing that is a lot bigger than anything on the outside that will stimulate your senses and remind you of your lost loved one.\n\nIt\u2019s inside of you, it IS you. Someone that was and is of such big importance to you. Let\u2019s say a pillar of your identity, will always be a pillar of your identity. Your girlfriend changed your life, she changed how you look at things, how you think about things, she changed you in more ways than you can think of. It might sound weird but you ARE your girlfriend, just as much as that I am my brother. We become the ones we love, and even if we lose them, they live on in us. No physical manifestion or sensory perception that reminds us of them is as strong as the part of you that is them. Because that my man, will never wear out or fade with time. You will carry your girlfriend around with you for the rest of your life. Just like someone else here said very wisely: when you\u2019ll fall in love again, not only will YOU choose this person, but the big part of you that is your girlfriend will choose this person as well. \n\nMoving on is a very confusing and broad term. Your grief and sadness will never disappear, and it doesn\u2019t have to. You\u2019ll find a way to carry it with you, it might seem unbearable now, it might feel like you are being crushed under it\u2019s weight, but give yourself the time you need to find a way to look ahead of you. From living minute to minute, hour to hour, day to day and eventually you will dare to think about tomorrow again. And when tomorrow comes, you\u2019ll see that even though \u2018yesterday\u2019 you lost your girlfriend, and you struggled to get through \u2018today\u2019 alone, your loved one was inside of you all along, and she will be there \u2018tomorrow\u2019 and beyond.",

            "Not take away from the Heartbreak of this story but some comedic relief I just like the smell of my dirty pillow.",
            "This is heart-wrenching and made me feel a lot of things I didn't want to feel.\n\nOn topic though, the pillow may very well have some of her scent lingering on it, especially if she used scented lotion, face wash etc. It probably mixed with your smell, which is even sweeter because you two are still combining your essences even after all these years. Your germs are still touching :)",
            "I'm guessing someone may have already said this, but - since you've had such close contact with her, and then with her pillow when she passed on, you've been absorbing her pheromones, skin oils, shampoo and soap smells, perfume, etc.  That stuff doesn't just disappear for a very long time, it'd get into your skin no matter how many showers/baths, even time away isn't going to fully separate you from her smell.  You might have gotten used to it, but I imagine someone else who hasn't spent time with you could smell it.\n\nAt the same time, yeah, your smell was getting into the pillow, the same way it got into her skin before she passed.\n\nThink about that. You spent enough time together where neither of you even smells the same anymore. That smell you go on and on about in your head?  That isn't just her smell. That smell is the both of you. That smell is together.  You could throw the pillow away and you'd continue to have that smell - that smell that isn't just her and isn't just you, it's your life together.\n\nIt might fade. It might get harder to smell (though I believe there are things you can do to fix that).  But really it's harder to smell because she was part of you for a long time, so it's harder to smell just her without smelling you both.\n\nThose soaps and oils and other superficial/surface level smells will fade, but think about what won't fade, what can never fade. I'm being literal here, because she clearly made you happy, and I imagine you made her happy as well. That kind of change effects all sorts of things to do with pheromones, hormones, excess dopamine and serotonin, etc.  Being together changed you both permanently, chemically.  That won't ever go away, just like her memory, and the positive things she brought to the relationship, the things that stuck.\n\nI know it doesn't replace her, but I hope the thought that she's physically and chemically a part of you, the idea that she will never truly leave you in a sense, I hope that brings you peace, and hopefully happiness somewhere down the line. I wish you every bit that you can take, and then a bit more.",

I lived with my Dad and had occasional overnight visits with my mother and she let me keep one of her nighties.

Because of this I have always kind of liked the smell of body odour, and so as a young teenager didn't realise other people found my natural smell unpleasant. Cue lots of bullying... After a couple of difficult months I learnt to wash more frequently and to use deodorant. Still don't find BO unpleasant...",

        "selftext": "Throwaway account in case I regret this post as much as I regret what prompted it. TL:DR below. Sorry for the length. Didn't realize all this word vomit would end up being somehat cathartic. \n\nLast night I decided to get into my car completely naked. I had one job. Meet my gf at her place. Drive us back to my place. End of story. No stripping required. However. As the day was coming to an end, the anticipation of spending time alone with my gf was clouding my judgment. All of a sudden I was horny and thinking it would be kind of kinky to show up naked behind the wheel and saying something silly like \"excuse me, ma'am... did you call an Uber X?\". I was rock hard thinking about the risk factor and how my gf would react. I imagined her laughing at the absurdity but also being somewhat turned on by the nudity. I wasn't too worried about other people catching me because my plan was not to interact with anyone else and to stay in the car until I was back inside my garage. \n\nI realized I fucked up the moment I pulled into the parking bay and noticed my gf standing in the rain with an umbrella and her two roommates huddled underneath. All of them were frantically waving at me like \"OMG, please hurry, it's pouring\". I had two choices. Proceed as planned and accept my fate. Or preserve my dignity and leave my gf and her roommates in the rain. I drove my naked ass out of there feeling conflicted as fuck. In my defense, there was never any mention of roommates joining us. My gf called and assumed I didn't see them somehow. I apologized and explained, albeit fearfully, why she just witnessed me drive away without her. I promised I'd be back to pick them up in 30 minutes or less. Fully dressed. It was tricky trying to pinpoint if my gf was entertained or annoyed during that phone call. That being said, I couldn't help but feel like I was pushing her buttons when I asked her to lie to her roommates about my reason for fleeing the premises. \n\nMy gf said it wouldn't be necessary to tell lies because she had me on loudspeaker the entire time. Crickets. I fucking died inside. I could hear the roommates laughing in the background before one of them said \"tell him to turn around\". At that moment, another call came through. Unknown number. My saving grace. Or so I thought. I said goodbye to my gf and discovered it was my mother who didn't realize she was still using her work phone after hours. My mom asked where I was because she just arrived at my place. I said I wasn't home and stressed what a bad time it was for her to pop in unannounced. She said she had leftover lasagna for me. My favourite. I said I'd be home in a few minutes and made it clear that when I arrive I'm gonna drive directly into my garage and open the front door from the inside. I emphasized that she should remain in her car, out of the rain, and under no circumstances should she approach me until she saw me in the house looking decent. \n\nMy mom approached me as soon as she heard me honk. Her vehicle was blocking my driveway but instead of getting out of the way so I could access my garage and avoid being seen in the nude, she got out of her car without warning and marched to my car with a plate of lasagna wrapped in tinfoil. I was tempted to drive away again, but I didn't have the balls to abandon both women in my life on the same night in the same way. I rolled down my window and said \"mother, stop\". She did not stop. Not until she realized I was wearing nothing but my seat belt. I asked her to please move her vehicle and not ask questions. She caught me naked. Of course she asked questions. Lots of questions. \n\nI made it sound like it was nothing more than a dumb prank between friends but my mom was convinced I was under the influence of her nemesis, Satan. I knew what that meant. She was using Satan as a metaphor to describe my gf, which she's done before. Usually I'd bite and we would argue but I didn't have time to dive into that debate because once I was done getting dressed, I had to leave again. On my way out, my mom proceeded to pray out loud. I froze at the door and had to wait until she was done updating God about yet another classic example of how her son was being tempted by the flesh into committing acts of indecency. As usual it was over the top theatrics and passive aggressive slut shaming towards my gf. Somehow all of this was her fault, not mine, I was just a victim of a Jezebel. It took everything in my power not to lose my shit during that prayer.\u00a0 \n\nFast forward to the most uncomfortable car ride of my life. My gf didn't really make conversation (or eye contact) other than asking if I didn't mind dropping her roommates at the mall. I could tell she was embarrassed by me. It was my first time meeting her roommates in person and it was obvious they didn't know how to behave around me. I apologized to all of them for my actions and promised never to leave my house naked again. Not gonna lie, acknowledging what I did made it even more awkward. I got zero replies. Just forced smiles. My gf turned on the radio instead of talking to me. Due to the bad weather we had one radio station available. A talk station. So, there we all were, awkwardly listening to people who suffer from misophonia discuss how disturbing specific sex sounds were to them. Fuck last night. \n\n**TL:DR Made plans to pick up my gf. Got horny thinking about her. Decided to drive naked as a sexy surprise. Realized my gf was waiting for me with her roommates. Left them all in the rain to go home and put on something to wear. Got caught by my religious mom who happened to be at my house. Had to listen to her badmouth my gf with Satan metaphors and prayer. Got dressed. Returned to my gf and her roommates. Cue awkward car ride.**",

Obviously what you did was weird and there's no way she could have known, but it was all in good fun and an interesting way to add some excitement to your sex life.

            "Similar to this my uncle's family name is Black and ours is White. It's a large family. One day we were at a large public pool with many kids from both sides. The adults were trying to get the kids out of the pool for pictures. First it was all of them, then the whole family, then they wanted to do just the Black family and then the White family. For context we're all white and for that matter the Black family are a bunch of blondes and redheads. Anyways, one of the parents was trying to get the most responsible preteen to go get the other side of the family for pictures. She ran to the pool and screamed \"all the Black kids have to get out of the pool so the White kids can get in!\" There was no music but I just imagined a record screech and the whole place stopped and stared at this seemingly horrible little racist girl. Follow that up by my uncle following black folks who were there around with his ID trying to explain. Hindsight it was hilarious but at that moment it felt real wrong.\n\nUpdate: The real point of me sharing the story was to make OP feel better and I conveniently left that bit out.

        "selftext": "Well for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. \nTo set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. \nWell one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. \nI indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. \nI then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off.  I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. \nI again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. \nNow to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. \nThis poor girl was FREAKED OUT! \nI finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. \nWell my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d\nI still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking  as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least)\nNeedless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \nTL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.",

            "Although I learned American Sign Language as a third grader I also took it as my only elective in college. Our teacher was deaf and she would give sentences to sign back to her.

She on the other hand made the fist but she jerked it up and down so instead of saying \"My grandfather wants milk\" she said \"My grandfather wants to jack off.\" I thought the teacher was going to die! She was a middle-aged woman and the look of horror on her face was priceless! All of us were laughing hysterically",

            "Holy wall of text, Batman!\n\n>Well for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. To set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought.\n\n>Well one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. I indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! \n\n>Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. I then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off. I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. I again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. \n\n>Now to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. This poor girl was FREAKED OUT! I finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. \n\n>Well my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d I still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. \n\n>Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least) Needless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \n\n>TL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.",

After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...\n\nSince we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn\u2019t had time to meet each other\u2019s parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I\u2019ll bring you over to meet my parents, and I\u2019ll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. \n\nLong story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend\u2019s mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle\u2019s daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn\u2019t seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn\u2019t right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family.

            "This is my standard comment on flatulence:\n\n>Beans (and some vegetables) contain sugars that your body can't digest. Basically all humans are bean-intolerant the same way that some people are lactose-intolerant (lactose being another sugar that some people can't digest). Beano (and the vegan alternative, Beanzyme) contains the enzyme that your body needs to digest these sugars from beans, so it should help.\n\n>These sugars are water-soluble, so soaking your beans (discarding the water) and boiling them (against, discarding the water) will slightly reduce the amount of these sugars you consume. Tinned beans, if you avoid consuming the water they are tinned in, are good for this reason.\n\n>Also, some legume-products (like firm tofu, protein powders, etc) contain fewer of these sugars because they have been pressed or dehydrated to remove the water, and therefore the sugars went with the water. And tempeh has been pre-digested by a fungus, so shouldn't contain as many of these sugars either.\n\n>These are all things that should help you transition to going vegan without the sudden increase in uncomfortable intestinal gas. As others have said, your digestive system should adjust after some time (though scientifically speaking it isn't known whether your intestinal flora adjusts to produce less gas or whether your intestines just become better able to deal with the gas without discomfort).",

            "There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with calling in gaseous to work! There was a time when I wished I\u2019d done that. One day several years ago I went out to lunch with coworkers and ate some pasta salad that disagreed with me. We went back to the workplace and my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of flatulence.\n\nNow, I have always maintained a strict workplace farting policy. I work in my own office, so I\u2019m alone in a room and odor is not a problem (unless someone stops by with a question). So the only real concern is the noise. Over the years I\u2019ve developed a method where I cough really loudly and, at the exact same time, I force the fart out in one staccato burst. It normally works like a charm.\n\nWell, on this fateful day, my office farting policy suffered what can only be described as a catastrophic failure. With my innards roiling, I coughed as loudly as I could and squeezed out what I anticipated would be a garden variety fart, but instead was a hot squirt of liquid feces. No doubt about it: I\u2019d just shit my pants at work.\n\nNow, my office is pretty far away from the bathroom. I had to make it past five or six offices and a row of several cubicles to get there, and I had no idea whether I had a visible poop stain on the seat of my pants. With no other option, I clenched my buttocks together as tightly as I could to minimize the seepage and power-walked to the bathroom as fast as I could.\n\nMercifully, when I got to the bathroom I discovered that the toxic release had been contained by my underwear (boxer briefs ftw). No stain on my pants whatsoever. I took my undies off, wrapped them in paper towels and buried them deep in the trash (because I didn\u2019t want my boss or a coworker coming in later and wondering whose shit-stained drawers were in the trash). Then I sat down on the toilet and unleashed a truly hellacious dump. I straight up napalmed that place. It was like someone had hooked a firehose up to a gravy hydrant, and it sounded like someone ripping wood paneling off of a wall. It was so bad, I had to wash my balls in the sink when I was finally done. Then I worked the rest of the day sans underpants, and every time I felt a fart brewing I hustled back to the bathroom and didn\u2019t let it loose until I was sitting on the toilet.\n\nSo yeah ... trust me, skipping work due to flatulence can be the lesser of two evils.",

So in a few hours you will need a shit that is going to make your entire house smell.  \n  \nStart with basic stir fry vegetables on rice. The farts won't be as bad and they will clean your diet up.  \n  \nI once switched back to vegan in time for a conference. By day two I was letting out farts that could clear a stadium even if the home team were winning. I farted in a gambling establishment as I was passing a group of drunks. They started a fight because they thought someone had shit themselves and wouldn't own up.  \n\n  \nYeah, vegan is a hard switch from a meat filled diet at the best of times.

The fiance and I got on well enough and we tentatively started to form a friendship.\nThe night before their wedding, my friend stayed over at his brother's. \nI stayed the night at their house with the bride. She had no friends or family in town and I was by default the bridesmaid.\nFeeling kind of sorry for her for not having had a Bachelorette party or anyone around, I suggested that we go out to have a few drinks, celebrate her last few hours of singlehood. \nShe agreed. I ordered a beer and a tequila each for the first round, thinking that we'd start with a shooter, have a few beers and end off with a shooter, nothing wild. I didn't want to be the cause of a severely hungover bride.\nAfter the first tequila hit her stomach, she changed, became more animated, I put it down to just pre-wedding excitement.\nNo one told me that she was a recovering addict who hasn't had a drink in 4 years. No one. \nIn the past when I visited, my friend and myself would drink beer and she wouldn't, I always thought that it was because she wasn't particularly fond of beer or alcohol. I have lots of girl friends like that, who will only drink on certain occasions.\nBut I like beer - (the Hon. Brett Kavanaugh)\n\nThe bride started chugging beers and shooters like a fratboy. I tried to stop her, she wouldn't listen to reason. She became more and more aggressive, so I just backed off. Had I known then what I know now, I would've made a bigger effort, even if that may have meant a black eye or bloody nose for me.\n\nAs Murphy would have it, she chose the exact moment to go to the restroom as a girl who was doing lines in the stall next to hers. The bride asked and got given. Anything for the Bride, right? 'Oh my gawd, oh wonderful, you're getting married tomorrow, here's another'\nThe night went downhill from there. She was like a freight train, with me barely hanging on.\nShe phoned her husband-to-be and told him that the wedding was off, that she's changed her mind.\nI felt like dog-shit.\n\nI eventually managed to get her home at around 04h00. He was waiting for her. She screamed at him and he shouted at me. \nThey postponed the wedding.\n\nI feel so, so bad.  I never wanted to cause shit for either one of them.\n\nTL;DR I took my friend's fiance out for a drink the night before their wedding, thinking I was doing a nice thing. Didn't realize that she was a recovering addict and the wedding got postponed.",

            "She should have definitely stopped you before you even left the apartment/house for the drinks. Blame you? How the fuck were you supposed to have known her past? Nah, slip all of that shit. None of this is your responsibility. Clearly she was having some second thoughts.",
            "If you had *known* about her addiction and still went to the bar, then this would've been your F-up, but without her OR your friend giving the heads-up, there's no way you could have known. You were just trying to be a good friend and give her the bachelorette party she didn't have. What happened next was entirely out of your hands. Perhaps the two of them weren't compatible in the first place, and this saved them years of an incompatible marriage. I hope your friend is understanding and doesn't take his anger out on you.",

            "Ahhhh, this sucks for everyone and I'm sorry it happened. I'm in recovery and I don't think this is your fault. She needed to communicate this, first and foremost, and secondly, it's really up to her to set those boundaries. IF you had known and IF you were acting as an enabler, it would be different, but this was on her. It's still hard and it's not an easy road. Eventually she'll (hopefully) get to a point where she can talk about it and outright refuse to expose herself to this risk, but it is her choice. Not your FU, but still a sucky situation.",
            "Hey. I'm a sober alcoholic (40M). This is totally on her - I know you feel bad about the situation, but it's not your job to maintain her sobriety. You say she had been sober 4 years - in that case she would've been quite aware of what was going on in her head. And whatever pushed her to drink again (maybe the marriage situation wasn't really up her alley?) she very likely relapsed mentally before she took the actual physical action. Which, by the way, is fairly normal - we have this movie concept of sobriety where it's a yes/no proposition, but a large proportion of addicts who become sober for life, do so after one or two or more relapses. I even did this myself - the one relapse I had, I actually planned. I sent my family off on a vacation and spent 6 days chugging supermarket wine before I called a few people and set my shit straight again. So, IMO, you may have catalyzed some shit happening, but the shit was a long time cooking.",

Either way you are not at fault.",

In a matter of days she got kicked out of her house, a cheap motel, hit by a car, had multiple surgeries. The surgeon actually said he was more worried about trying to deal with who knows what in her system more than the surgery (which included rebuilding her pelvis). \nTotally not your fault when people don't tell you and then fall off the wagon hard.",

I know you care a lot for people around you but trust me, if you can't convince someone with your words, getting physical with someone who's in recovery isn't going to help either of you. Again, I get your intentions and all, it just made me feel compelled to tell you that you are not at all responsible for someone else. \n\nAnyways, this is bad, but not as bad as you might think. It almost sounds like she was harboring these doubts for a while and while I'm not suggesting that alcohol opened her up to the truth, she definitely wasn't 100% in it and it's probably better that she postponed.

Edit: my relapses are just drinking a ton of beer for 2-3 days. No hard liquor. It's not better, but no crazy shit. Just sedating my pain.

Maybe she wasn't \"allowed\" to drink with her fiance, and then when you offered she just saw a chance of letting it go and do whatever she wants.\n\nBecause if she wanted to be sober, she would AT LEAST say something (I know self control for addicts can be super hard, but that's why you learn to TALK and TELL people that you won't go to bars and things like that)",

Maybe she felt a social obligation or fear of being further isolated in a town she knows no one in, and didn't want to refuse. Maybe she was just really scared and felt that nagging itch that makes addiction so hard to klmove past. Who knows.\n\nBut this wasn't your fault, and while I can understand why he was upset, if he's a reasonable person he'll realise that eventually too.

            "I had a similar situation (though I was the bride so at least I didn't feel like I ruined a wedding.) \n\nI don't have many girl friends, and the ones that I did have at the time were my stoner/party buddies. I was by far the mildest of them, they partied hard. For a while before my wedding life was just hectic, we all went from working together and living near each other and hanging out every day to more distant - one friend lost her job and apartment, moved to another city to live with her mom, and pretty much dropped contact. We were never the call/text and chat types so it wasn't super weird to not hear from her when we weren't hanging out in person. \n\nWhen it came time for my bachelorette party I gathered my two party girls, a kind of mutual accquaintance I was just getting to know, a friend from school that I had only reconnected with once or twice over the years, and my brother's girlfriend. We went to a local bar for a concert/party and just hung out and drank and had some fun. We took a few rounds of shots and had a few beers, then the party girl who moved away started going to random people literally saying \"hey man, do you have any drugs?\" Singing \"drugs, drugs, gimme lots of drugs, I want to do drugs!\" etc. The school friend and brother's girlfriend were baffled, they'd never been in a group with someone who was so wasted, and definitely not someone asking for \"drugs.\" We decided to call it a night and had to drag/carry her across the parking lot to the car. Got fast food on the way home, she ate it in the car, then got pissed off that they left her order out when we got to the house and her food was gone. We finally convinced her that she already ate it and determined that she did not want any other snacks from around the house, then she passed out in a chair and pissed on it. She didn't even wake up when I changed her clothes and moved her so we could clean the chair.\n\nWe couldn't figure out why she got so hammered so fast - she was by far the heaviest drinker among us and was usually the last one to leave/pass out at parties. We knew she wasn't on anything else because she had stayed with the other party girl the night before and if she had anything she definitely would have shared it with her. \n\nTurned out when she moved away she *went to rehab* and had been sober for several months. Her tolerance tanked, she way outpaced herself trying to drink as much as she could as fast as she could, and she basically blacked out while her body went on a mission to find literally any drug. I felt fucking terrible about it, if I knew she was sober we would have just stayed at my house and had pizza and popcorn and watched horror movies or something. She definitely intentionally kept it from us and showed up ready to party. It sucks, but she made that choice. Your friend's fiance did, too. She very easily could have said \"actually I'm sober\" and suggested going out for milkshakes or something instead. It sucks a lot, it feels like your fault, but it's something that she has to deal with and come back from. I'm all for supporting recovery and not enabling addicts, If you knew it would have been a dick move, but you didn't know and couldn't know. The best thing you can do is be supportive of your friends as they work through whatever their next steps are.",

Which bar is open 24/7 and wont kick me out? \n\nRealising this, I turned a new leaf almost immediately and told myself I'm responsible for this recovery so I wasn't ashamed to communicate that to others. Grab a drink? Man, maybe not, I'm down for a coffee instead. Going to bar/club? Alright, there is a nice chill restaurant w good food i know of where the guest can still drink and I can order other non-alcoholic beverages. \n\nPoint is, you COMMUNICATE this info so people are informed and can assist you as well. If they're still inviting, these are bad influences. You can make the judgment yourself. \n\nBoth groom and bride failed to communicate it to you and upset with you?

But when people realize you\u2019ve gotten clean from addiction, they\u2019re more likely to support and help. \n\nAnother point: when a stressful situation (marriage is one) happens, the world beats it into our heads that there is no more freedom. You\u2019ve lived your life and now your settling down and the only thing left is kids and death. It\u2019s easy to relapse, because when you come clean, you don\u2019t have your release anymore.

But it\u2019s so much more then that! It\u2019s a whole lifestyle change. Not just abstaining from your drug of choice, but changing your thinking, how you treat people and the world around you, & doing a lot of inside work to figure out your stressors and what makes you want to use.

It may have been related to the stress of the wedding, but she made a choice not to tell you. It can be really easy as a person who isn't in recovery to want to take blame away from her for this, but in recovery there is an overwhelming responsibility placed on you to keep yourself out of situations precisely like the one you described and she knows this better than anyone; the reality of what you do and don't have control over is drilled into you.\n\nShe should have said no the moment you suggested drinks, and if you are as close to her as you seem to be, she should atleast let you know she doesn't/can't drink specifically so she doesn't have the ability to weaponize you against her recovery. Using people who don't know you aren't supposed to be doing what you are doing is a very, very common way people relapse.\n\nNot your fault.",

We ended up talking in the same circle and he introduces himself. We start chatting and quickly find the circle around us has disappeared and it is just us. \n\nHe is so smart, his smile is outrageously cute, and I love how he seems laser focused on me instead of one of the many attractive women that have now joined the party and are talking about their cool Raya dates. \n\nAs the night wore on, I found myself talking to various different groups, but, each time this guy would appear again and we'd end up just talking to each other again. Someone who neither of us knew came up and said we made an attractive couple, and I realized somehow in the span of two hours we were already acting like a couple. It wasn't just being sexually attracted to him, I felt so comfortable around him and he was so attentive to my needs. \n\nI told him offhand I had allergies to the dog at the party. Hours later when I started sneezing he immediately knew why and moved us outside. His smile was the thing that immediately caught my attention but it was the thoughtfulness that made it so at the end of the night, we catch an Uber home together and end up kissing. Before the Uber drops him off I give him my number. \n\nSunday comes, don't hear from him. Ok, ok, I get it, we both got home at 4am and I too just want to sleep the day away. \n\nMonday comes. Silence. \n\nTuesday, even more silence. I know I've read how it is \"uncool\" to text a girl immediately because you want to seem super cool and wanted, but we're both in our mid-thirties and, I hoped, realized these mind games are bullshit. If you like someone, text them when you can. Life is too short to be with people half-interested in you. \n\nWednesday comes and I'm a mixture of angry and over it and insecure all at the same time. How dare he lead me on like this! ...Well, I guess I'm glad I only wasted one night on this asshole....was I not pretty enough? All these thoughts raced through my head and coalesced into me typing his name and work place into Google to see if I can find him. \n\nTurns out, he was incredibly easy to find. I was planning on just looking at him because I missed his face, but I accidentally clicked the link that brought me to his LinkedIn page. Yikes! Now he'll know that I stalked him which made me feel even worse. >.< I probably looked crazy. \n\nWelp, since I was already on his page I guess I'd look at where he had worked. Maybe he wasn't really interesting and I'd feel better about him ghosting me. \n\nNope, turns out he is not only very smart but also humble because his resume listed a dozen different cool jobs, impressive schools he's attended, things he's worked on. Great, I probably wasn't impressive enough for him. -_- \n\nNot thirty minutes later he friends me on LinkedIn, but seems surprised that I was reaching out. He had evidently texted me that night, and again the next day, only to not hear anything back. I had ghosted him. \n\nAnd this is how we found out my fuck up. When I gave him my number, turns out I was off by a digit. Turns out, tipsy me isn't so great at typing or proofreading. \n\nIf I hadn't been a creepy LinkedIn stalker, it could have been months, if ever, before we would have seen each other again. Right now we're laughing about it and setting up our first real date. Wish me luck Reddit!\n\nTL;DR Thought a cute guy was ghosting me. Turns out, I gave him the wrong number. Fixed my fuck up by using my cyber stalking skills, and now we're going on a date!",

I was in an odd spot by this point, getting out of a 4 year long relationship (just after graduating high school) and wanted to remain single a while to center myself. I was always dating someone so i never really took time to address my own needs. \n\nBut this girl made that inner strength dry right up and i find myself speculating on just how far out of my league she might be. I finally get the confidence to talk to her a bit (because drinks and assorted unhealthy habits that you practice in college) and immediately kind of freeze up. \n\nI asked for her name, she tells me. And all my dumb little man brain thinks is to say \"your name is ____?\" Point to my brother, of the same name. \"His name is _____.\" Some friends then call me over to play pool and i just walk away, slightly panicked and just as stupid. \n\nNot only did i never tell her my name, never gave her my number, and none of my friends knew who she was because she hadnt hung out with our group before. So i did what any reasonable person does after possibly missing thier chance at thier dream partner: start looking on facebook. \n\nSo i start browsing friends of friends of people who dont even use facebook hoping to find her. The college page, in case she followed it there for some reason. Everywhere i could think. No dice. Until a few days later. She had the same idea and much more luck than i did, as it recommended me as a friend to her.

Which was par for the course, i had gotten out of a long relationship and wasn't used to the new landscape of internet dating where everyone ghosts everyone as soon as someone with more promise/potential shows up. I hadn't even planned on messaging her because when I had logged on to lavalife and saw her message, i was actually there with the intent to delete my account and stop dating for a while, but i liked the stuff in her profile so much that i thought i'd let her be the last person i connect with and *then* I'll delete my account. It was more of the same ghosting crap, so I felt pretty bummed. \n\nThrowing caution to the wind though, because she did seem really nice, I reached out to say \"hey *just in case* here's my email address again, I haven't heard from you so if you DID email me maybe just copy/paste because there's this typo that you might make\" and sure enough, ***she had typed my email address wrong***.\n\nAnd thank god I reached out because she thought i was ignoring her and not getting back to her!

            "So this reminds me of something I did with LinkedIn. \n\nWhen I got my first adult job after college, I was on LinkedIn the one day. Seen this one girl who I thought was cute, hence why I added her. She had a mutual connection as that was a coworker at work who got me in there in the first place. My friend texts me a day or so later and says something in the context of \u201cI was weird for adding her,\u201d coming from her to him. \n\nA few months go by, and Im leaving work. I see my buddy coming with that girl beside him as she\u2019s in a rush to catch the train. He briefly introduces me to her. \n\nA few weeks go by, and there\u2019s a work lunch party. At the time I had finally started going to a barber to get my haircut professionally. Well at the party I notice her looking at me. Didn\u2019t think much of it, but knew something was up. About a week or two after that party, she messages me on Skype out of the blue. We end up getting to know one another. \n\nNothing much came out of that until last year when we started hanging outside of work. By then I had moved on from the company. We met a couple times whether it was her and I or mutual friends who would join us. Things ended up changing around July 4th as she ended up meeting her current boyfriend at a party while I was away at a wedding I was in. \n\nI was bummed once I officially knew something was up weeks later after she met my friend and I late one night in the city. We still talk these days as just friends, but not as often as we once did. Sadly I\u2019ll never really know how she felt about me as she was one of a select number of girls I\u2019ve met in life who have had an interest in the stuff I do. Woe is me:/",

Warning... poop talk below!\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months and absolutely DO NOT discuss bathroom habits. Nothing. So, I can't share this horrible fuck up with him so I'm telling it to you nasty people. \n\nWe've been quarantining together at his place for about a month and it's been really great. Tonight, I just got finished with a run and decided to take a hot steamy shower. But first, I had to empty the tank (runners will know the feeling). After, I hop into the shower and do my thing. \n\nNow, I don't know how you people wash your butt but here's how I do it - I get the washcloth nice and sudsy, wipe down all my crevices, and then lean forward facing opposite of the shower head, spread the cheeks,  and let the water pressure get in there. Well, I must have been REALLY relaxed because next thing I know... there is poop on the bottom of the bathtub. Like a decent sized log. I didn't even feel it come out. I am HORRIFIED and kind of stare at it for a few seconds wondering how this just escaped me. I quickly lean out of the shower to grab some toilet paper and guess what... the poop slithered down towards the drain! Now I have the poop stuck in the water stream and only being held up by the drain, so without thinking, I try to grab it, only for it to be smashed down and liquified even further. Fuck!!!!\n\nI turned the water off and grab a new piece of TP. I tried wiping the inside of the drain, but it just made it even worse. Now I added wet TP pieces to the mix. I unscrew the drain cap and let it run in the sink, only for even smaller pieces of poop to come out and get stuck in THAT drain! I repeat the process and finally get the sink drain clean. \n\n10 minutes pass and my boyfriend is still wondering why I'm in the bathroom even though the water is turned off. \n\nBack to the bathtub drain - I keep wiping and just keep getting more poop! Does he poop in the shower too?! There is no way this is just from me! He had some cleaner under the sink so I sprayed the living shit out of the drain and hoped it was fine. \n\nIt doesn't stop there. All of that TP I was using? Yeah, I was tossing it into the toilet. When I finally got my drain situation under control, I flushed the toilet... only for it to be clogged with so much toilet paper. And he doesn't have a plunger. So now I've been in this bathroom for a solid 40 minutes and need to explain to my boyfriend that I clogged his toilet - but not from massive shits - but from toilet paper, because I pooped in his shower (????).\n\nWell, I had to say something, so I left the bathroom red as a lobster and explained I accidentally flushed a tampon and it clogged the toilet so I need to run to the pharmacy to procure a plunger. \n\nHe believed me. \n\nTaking new butt washing suggestions now...\n\n**TLDR:** My bowels were so relaxed that I accidentally pooped in my boyfriend's shower. I had a hard time hiding the evidence.\n\nEDIT: Since many of you need clarification... here you go. Yes, I DID poop before I showered. i thought I was all emptied out. By \u201cdecent log,\u201d I would say it was the size of my thumb. It was a decent size for something I didn\u2019t feel. I forgot that we all have different perspectives of what decent looks like. After reading the comments, I think what happened is that I gave myself an accidental enema. When I\u2019m washing away, I like to get ALLLLLLLLLL the places clean, and I think the hot water jet made the bad things happen. I am a healthy person otherwise, but thank you for your concerns \ud83d\ude0d",

            "Not a plumber but came here to say that I have a colostomy so I absolutely cannot control where I poop. My nurse told me pooping in the shower is generally not a big deal because it washes down the drain and it\u2019s the same kind of drain as the toilet. Just don\u2019t do it all the time and collect any solid matter left in the drain when you\u2019re done. That said, I can\u2019t imagine how stressful this was since you obviously weren\u2019t expecting it. I had a somewhat similar fuck up the first time I got poop in the shower and I knew it was a possibility! I feel for you! \n\nIn regards to the \u201csee a doctor\u201d comment, if this happens regularly, there\u2019s a whole branch of physical therapy that deals with pelvic floor muscles and can often help. (This helped me deal with a lot of my issues before my surgery). But likely not necessary for a one time thing. Best of luck to you!\n\nEdit: thank you for all of the awards!!",

            "Here\u2019s what to do next time:\nFinish cleaning yourself first. Then turn up the heat as far as it will go, but try to stay out of the stream. If there is a detachable shower head, use it to strategically blast the target, wherever it is softest and you can break it up. Make sure it\u2019s set to narrow-beam. Work slowly but thoroughly. Wide beam will get you nowhere fast.\n\nWhatever solid remains after that, pick up, drop in toilet, wash hands thoroughly.\n\nNEVER try to do the waffle stomp unless it\u2019s already past the point of no return, or super soft and you cant do method A for some reason.\n\nIf you have to stomp the drain, pray theres some chemicals you can use to help dissolve, or the pipes are super good. A little drano helps (just a little, like half a cup, you don't want to fume up the place). Be safe with it, don't let it touch your skin, even a little splashback. Rinse skin very thoroughly if you do get hit by some. \n\nKeep the shower running, make it a long one, don\u2019t stop until the whole job is done and has been no longer visible for 5 minutes.\n\nDo a soap-down foot scrub of whatever shower surfaces came into contact with it. Hold the handle for support, and don't trust your feet for traction for a little bit, DO NOT hold the lever or spout, they can break easier than you think.",

            "This just brought up a terrible college memory. \n\nI was at a party at this frat house, the place was packed and everyone (including me) was pretty drunk. I was having a good time until I was faced with one of my worst fears as an extremely shy shitter; I had to take a poop and it was urgent. \n\nI push past people to get to the single, tiny, decrepit bathroom they have available for guests to use. At this point, I have to go so bad that I figure It\u2019ll be one quick stop and drop and I can get out of there asap. \n\nI slip into the bathroom and barely had time to lock the door before someone is trying to get in. Facing my worst fears, I decide to just get it over with and in one swift motion I pull down my pants and push out a decent poop. Proud of my accomplishment, I grab some toilet paper and proceed to wipe. To my horror, I realize that I NEVER TOOK OFF MY THONG AND I POOPED ALL OVER IT. \n\nOk slight setback right? Next move is just to take off the thong and throw it away right? Well, I\u2019m looking around and there is no trash. There is no closet, no cabinet, no drawer, no place to hide my shame. This bathroom is basically a closet with a sink and a toilet. I begin to panic, shit thong in hand. \n\nPeople start knocking, I panic more. I attempt to flush shit thong down the toilet. IT CLOGS. No plunger, no toilet brush. People are asking through the door if I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m freaking out. \n\nI fish shit thong out of the most DISGUSTING toilet situation you can imagine and try flushing again. Everything goes down thankfully but now I am once again holding my trashed and now soaking underwear. \n\nPeople are POUNDING on the door now so I just say fuck it. I wrap my thong in toilet paper, put it in my fucking purse and dip the hell out of there. I throw it in the first trashcan I can find and I get the hell out of that place. \n\nI didn\u2019t even want to wait to find a ride home so I walked several miles literally crying from embarrassment.",

            "Relevant story.   Was having dinner at friend's place the other weekend. Stomach felt bad, needed to poop. Our daughter had just peed in their ensuite bathroom a few minutes prior, which is off of the master bedroom, which is off of the living room, which is just up the stairs from the dining room where we were sitting. Their other bathroom is down the other stairs and down a longish hallway. Basically it's further away than the ensuite.\n\nWithout really thinking, but because pooping with other people around makes my uncomfortable & I wanted to be discreet (\"using other bathroom? must be pooping\"), I just go and use the ensuite bathroom. Cue a massive load of judgement from my friends when they realise that I pooped in their ensuite bathroom which is apparently an unwritten rule.\n\nI can already tell this is going to be like one of those cringy memories from highschool that keep you up at night for years to come.",

            "I have a story sort of similar to this.\n\nWhen I was in middle school many years ago, one summer night I was just chilling and playing games with a friend of mine. However I had a really bad stomach cramp and usually when that happens I have some diarrhea. So I go into my parents bathroom (they were sitting outside in the patio with my friend's parents) and I try to get it to come out. For some context, it was like a master bathroom with 2 sinks, separate toilet room, and a glass wall shower next to a bathtub. I was still having the cramps, so I decided to take a hot shower to alleviate some of the cramping (middle school logic!). As soon as I got in the shower I felt the poop wanted to get out immediately. So I thought I didn't have enough time to run to the bathroom, so I decided to shit myself in the shower. My parent's shower was one of those where it had a drain in the center with holes on it, and my shit ended up clogging the drain. It was still too solid to go down into the drain, and water was starting to rise. So to try and solve the problem, I cupped my hands together and let water splash onto my shit to try and move some of it. After that didn't work, I decided to step on it to try and push it down the drain. It got rid of some of it but progress was very slow and my foot started to smell like shit. While I was doing this, my mom walked in since she needed to get something from her sink drawers or whatever. She saw me stepping in my own shit and started laughing at me. After laughing really hard, she went and got me a trash bag where I had to kneel down and pick up my own shit using wet wipes since I figured paper towel or toilet paper wouldn't work. After I finally picked up all the shit I cleaned myself as best as I could in the shower and walked out. My parents and my friend's parents were laughing their asses off so I'm sure my mom told them what happened. Always shit in the toilet, kids.",

        "selftext": "Happened this week and I just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.\n\nContext: I've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. \n\nI've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. In fact they've helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It's awesome. \n\nSo here's where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn't believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.\n\nMy surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it's completely different to what I've come to know over the course of my life. I can't really tell if I'm whispering or shouting just yet because I've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. \n\nPARENTS: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. \n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold! Thank you so much for the Platinum!!! Thank you for the silver!!! \n\nTLDR: I've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than I realized.",

            "Wtf are ear tubes?",
            "PLEASE take care of your ears people. This especially goes for parents. I had 5 sets of tubes as a child and consistent ear health issues related to my uniquely shaped ear canals. The tubes came out as normal each time, but my eardrums are now permanently scarred as a result of having them in.  \n\nI had a terrible ear infection almost 5 years ago now. It started as normal but it ended up being one of the worst experiences I've ever dealt with in my life. I had a job working all night doing retail construction with a buddy of mine. I ended up sneezing after work and my entire eardrum just erupted, all of the pus and blood that was behind the drum came pouring out of my ear. I thought it was okay because the doc had told me my ear popping shouldn't cause me any serious issues. I can only assume the pressure on my ear was abnormal and the presence of the infection had eroded my ear health to such a degree that it caused damage to the nerve cells inside the cochlea. After that rupture my ear started ringing very loudly. So loudly that I considered everything to stop it from suicide to flying to Mexico or elsewhere that they could inject stem cells in it. Unfortunately for me that technology doesn't exist yet and I've had to live with the resulting tinnitus for many years. My ear has continuously rang since that day. Luckily, it's only in one ear and the ringing is sometimes barely noticable. I would attribute any healing to me being around 20 when that infection occurred. Therefore, my body was young enough to partially repair it.\n\nI have grown used to the tinnitus and it is normal to me now. Fortunately there are methods of keeping your ears clear, like using wax earplugs in water and using flonase or allergy medicine regularly. Flonase especially helps because it opens up your sinuses and therefore keeps the ear canals from getting too much drainage, or so I've been told. \n\nI hope this message can reach people because as a young person I see so so many people not taking care of their ears. What I wouldn't give to be able to hear silence again. To enjoy the sounds of the breeze, the woods, music or anything hearing related again. My experience has taught me to be grateful for what I do have and to be careful. You only get one body. \n\n\nUSE EARPLUGS:\n\n1. When going to concerts, even if you look goofy. \n\n2. Around any loud equipment, including your lawnmower. \n\n3. In the water especially if you have ever had any issues with ear infections. \n\n\nDo not crank the volume on your headphones. Do not blare loud music in your car or in your house all the time. \n\nDo use medicines to keep your ears clear. Do try to keep your ear canals clean and prevent wax build up.\n\n\nPlease be careful with your ear health folks, once it's gone, it's gone.",
            "This actually happened to my brother too! Except they were forgotten about when he was less than 5 years old and they caused a permanent hole in his eardrum that's had to be patched over twice with skin grafts.",
            "I went through almost this exact same scenario! My ear drums never properly healed and I had to get skin grafts in hopes of closing the holes. One of them took and healed properly. The other one did not and I have much worse hearing in that ear as well as a permanent hole. I sincerely hope your ear drums heal!!!",

Everything is so much louder now that I can\u2019t hear anything at all because everything is at a low hum.\n\nI\u2019m now 22 and was 18 when I had them taken out.

I have no good control of my pitch so my voice sounds different from minute to minute to other people. And I can't tell how loud or quiet i am. Some people tell me my voice is super loud and It carries hard, but other times peopel can't hear what im saying.\n\nAnd the voice I hear back in recordings is vastly different from the voice iu hear in my head. \n\nMy body even compensated with bone conduction, using my jaw and side of my skull to hear things better.

I obviously wasn't aware of how it was affecting my hearing until they were put in. Previously my hearing was apparently very bassy kind of like I was underwater. After the ear tubes I couldn't hear any bass. Music sounded like a poorly adjusted stereo for 3 months until my brain recalibrated.\n\nI don't know how your tubes stayed in so long, mine fell out after a year basically like the doctors said they would.\n\nAnd yes, it was a fun conversation piece telling people that I could plug my mouth and nose and still breath through my ears (albeit with a struggle).",

The second ones got pushed out by my eardrum healing around them.

No one fucking corrected me till this kind waitress at a diner when I ordered one at 17ish. She kept asking me what do I mean like six times until I became annoyed. I said something like, \"What you don't have it? You know! A GIRL cheese! You take two pieces of bread, butter one side of each, slap some American cheese on it and then cook it on the stove. That guy over across by the door has one, but with ham. I just want cheese. You know, a girl cheese!\"\n\n Damn I did hand motions from taking bread out, buttering it, slapping it, and grilling it as well.

See, it's here on the menu in the back. I'll get that right up for you.\" \n\n Everyone that heard the exchange laughed, and my friends were hysterical. I felt so fucking dumb, and apologized profusely. I wrote a napkin note, and left a 20$ tip extra and thanking her. \n\n Like why the fuck couldn't anyone in my life tell me it is grilled.

Just from reading some comments down below I wonder if they're the same thing OP and others are talking about. Also I have a little scaring left from them, which allow me to pop my ears at will.

Now that you don't have tubes, be extra careful when you gets head colds, just because you are an adult, doesn't mean you necessarily outgrew ear infections, the tubes were there to keep your ears properly drained and maintain appropriate pressure in the inner ear.

            "I have had 4 sets of normal tubes and one set of \"t-tubes\" in my life. None of them really helped. I had to wear hearing aids at the age of 11 as well as glasses so young fat me was prime bullying target. Luckily I got to stop wearing them around 13.\n\nAround age 15 I had to have more surgery on my eardrums to try and remove the excess scar tissue to try and get my eardrum to function at least slightly normally. From all of this I have gone through life by lipreading to boost my hearing.\n\nMy hearing has never been normal and people never really understand. Friends get frustrated, colleagues think I'm ignoring them if they stand behind me (can't see their face = basically can't hear them)",

That's where you blow air out of your ears to equalize the pressure. \n\nI was pissed when I found out how minor the surgery is to put the tubes in place, as when I was a child I had to undergo general anesthesia for the operations, but the last tube I got in they just did it in the office with a little local. I was like, \"WTF!? That's it!? I had to suffer the nasty taste of that gas for days because you thought I couldn't handle a little cut in my ear?\" My mind was absolutely blown!",

I thought they fall out a lot of the time? \n\nI'm 38, and would love to find a doctor that would put them in for me now.  I probably (definitely) should've gotten them put in when I was younger. My tubes are too small,  so I *still* get ear infections pretty regularly. And I've ruptured my ears a couple times because of infections, so there's a lot of scar tissue. \n\nSending you some positive energy & hopes for a speedy resolution.",

Anyway recommended I should go see a new ENT and gave a referral, went on waiting list but no one ever contacted me so didn\u2019t bother following up as I really don\u2019t want any more fucking operations and I\u2019ve kinda just accepted this is how I am, anyway I had the same experience when they came out and was like whoa wtf is going on, I still have shit hearing and just resort to hearing aids now which was also the most bizarre experience in my life!!! Everything is so loud like just hearing footsteps and the sound of scratching clothes and omg the supermarket and my own fridge just fucking weird that it took so long to actually wear them full time!\n I also went 2 winters without any infections which was so amazing that when I got one this year I was like ha well shit I had a good run!\n\nAnyway I usually lurk here but just was freaky how much your story is like mine that I had to share my experience!\nGlad you wrote this!",

He told me that the \"T-tubes\" he was inserting were not a kind that he was used to. After ~60 minutes he told me he felt really bad for making me cry but that we were gonna have to reschedule. \n\nI was done by that point anyways and made an appt for 2 weeks out. This time I made sure i asked for something to take to help calm me down for the next time since it was pretty traumatic. He did write me five 10mg diazepam (valium) so I was just loopy and tired but I still felt everything at the next appt.\n\nSecond attempt to insert tubes was successful thankfully. They are still in today but I have an issue with my right ear drum that's causing it to stick to my inner ear and was told years ago I might need to get a transplant to replace mine (cadaver) if the issue wasn't resolved but I haven't been to an END since 2011. I still don't have health insurance and can't afford the office visit fee. I really need my ear cleaned too bc was buildup has muffled my hearing slowly over the years and adding the ear drum issue, it's bad. I can't hear for shit and I'm always yelling bc I can't hear myself speaking clearly which irritates my fiance to no end. \nSo yeah... ear infections can kiss my ass."

As promised, here is a follow-up! I found him! \n\nAnd ironically, Reddit had nothing to do with the reconnection, but I appreciate how sweet and supportive the Reddit community has been in trying to help me.\n\n# So here's the full story:\n\nI tried the GPS-spoofing Tinder hack so many of you suggested and was able to land my account in Gangnam, Seoul where I initially was when I matched with him. But to my dismay, I couldn't find him at all. I narrowed down my options to his age-range, but it still didn't work. My index finger was swiping left constantly, that I felt like a broken record. I swiped left on hundreds of guys until eventually, there were no more matches to be found.\n\nSo I finally decide to replay the entire date over again in my head and suddenly recall my date explaining how he signed up for a language exchange app to learn English and how he's an active member. I didn't recall the name of the app, but it was a total big-brained move that I didn't utilize the power bequeathed before my very hands, which was google. So now, with a million fewer IQ points, I search \"language exchange apps popular in Korea\" and was presented with a few options. Immediately one of the icons displayed looked very familiar! *\"That's the one\",* I thought, \"t*hat's the app that he showed me during our date\".* I rushed to the app store to download the app and impatiently fill out the prompts to create a new account. I selected the \"want to learn Korean\" and \"want to teach English\" options. Finally, I was done creating my profile. The app told me it would take up to 7 days to approve of my account, so I can start finding language exchange partners.  Since this was my only lead left, I unwillingly played the waiting game. \n\nAn hour later, I receive a notification that my account was approved! I rushed to the app and nervously scanned the Korean profiles that popped up in my feed.  There were profiles after profiles of teen girls with straight black hair and wispy bangs trying to emulate their favorite k-pop idol, or middle-aged guys with unflattering selfie angles, but none of them was the guy I was looking for. I was a bit dejected but found out that the premium subscription allowed me to search for specific users. I fidget around, trying to find my date from the free user's list, but was finding very little luck with that method. I caved in, shelling out the $20 for the premium subscription, justifying that it makes sense to pay for it because at least I'll get to practice speaking different languages. (although that was just an excuse to hopefully rekindle with him). Once my transaction was complete, I accessed the search bar and typed in his Tinder alias. My reasoning was that since his actual, Korean, name is so common (think John Smith), he wouldn't put it on the app. I held my breath, waiting for the results to show up... but no results were found. I was slightly disappointed but did not lose hope. Maybe by a stroke of luck, searching by his Korean name would work? I was doubtful, but grasping at whichever straws I had left. From past experience, searching up his Korean name on facebook gave me more than a hundred results, but none of them were him. I typed in his Korean name and pressed enter. I resumed holding my breath and prayed that this would work. The words \"2 results\" popped up on my screen. I frantically looked at the results. The first profile was a buff dude with a gnarly bleached blonde goatee. \"*Not my guy,\"* I dismissed*.* Then I quickly glimpsed at the second profile and my eyes widened and my heart froze. It was *him.* It was the guy I so desperately tried to find this past week. \n\nI clicked on his profile, but suddenly, my anxiety kicked in. *What if I message him and he thinks I'm too desperate and is turned off?* I panicked but forced myself to initiate a message anyways. Like what was I going to say? \"*Hey sorry for ghosting you for a week, are we gucci?\"  What if he's mad? What if he doesn't like me anymore?* I took a deep breath to clear my mind and tried to articulately explain my situation in a few sentences. I repeatedly revised and deleted parts of my opening message before I finally decided to take the dive and hit send.\n\nThen it was playing the waiting game again. One perk about being a premium member on this app was that you got to see when users are active. After a few minutes, the app said he was active right now. \"*Great*\", I thought optimistically, *\"he'll message me soon, and we'll clear up all misunderstandings\"*. Minutes went by and he didn't respond. *That's okay, maybe he's in a conversation with someone else...* Several minutes turned into an hour, and one hour turned into two hours. My stomach churned. Maybe I really did FU by not being cautious enough with my messaging apps. I mean, what kind of sick psychological game was this, making me receive a taste of my own medicine?\n\nEvery time my phone buzzed with a notification from the language app, my ears perked up a bit. But it was always some middle-aged guy propositioning me for sex or a white dude with yellow fever trying to use the new pickup lines he learned in Japanese. Occasionally, I'd get a wholesome friend request from someone genuinely trying to learn English, but nevertheless, out of all the 32 messages I received, none were from my date. Yet, I gave him the benefit of the doubt from experiencing how overwhelming the app could be within those 2 hours. I changed my language exchange profile to exactly mirror my Tinder profile and put my language exchange profile on high visibility mode so that he would notice it. Suddenly, I got an influx of messages from various users in addition to the Reddit notifications from my previous TIFU. I couldn't stand it and temporarily muted all my notifications on my phone and headed to class for 4 hours. After class, I was ready to cut my losses and understood if my date didn't want to contact me again. However, I decided to open up the app after class and check my messages, not expecting anything to happen. But still, within me was a nestled hope, that he still wanted to reach out to me.\n\nAnd there it was, nestled within all the other messages was an unread message from my date. Even though I said I was ready to cut my losses just a few minutes before, I couldn't help but squeal. I couldn't stop my smiling and did an excitement lap around the hallway outside my classroom. He seemed genuinely **happy** that I found him again and that he could keep in contact with **me**! I was jumping for joy on the way back home. We resumed our conversation from the week before as if nothing happened!\n\nLater in the day, he called me (through the language app), and we talked about our crazy weeks. I'm just so glad to have found him again and talk to him about various topics. I don't need some crazy intense romcom-esque relationship, I'm just content with just keeping in contact and seeing what goes from there!\n\n**TL;DR:** Found my date I  accidentally ghosted on a language exchange app after relentless searching because my brain decided to remember something important.\n\nI want to thank Reddit for putting the effort into helping me find the guy! Your support helped me gain the courage to take the extra step into searching for him <3\n\nEdit: apparently the app I used doesn\u2019t need premium to search for users. Fml, I\u2019m out of $20\n\nEdit 2: I THINK HE READ THE POST, HE\u2019S ASKING ME ODDLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ABORT\n\nEdit 3: False alarm, he just added my alternate (non banned) Kakao account because apparently he literally has no other social media. We talked more and he said he was afraid I hated him after ghosting him LOL. He reconfirmed that he had a great time on our date! I decided to stop being a scared b*tch and told him I was glad to have met him again. We\u2019re supposed to video call tomorrow! Yay",

Otherwise, maybe he did actually see your message really soon after you sent it (since he was active soon after you did) but he just wanted to do exactly what you did and take his time to make sure he had written the message exactly the way he wanted and to get across exactly what he wanted to say along with showing his happiness at hearing from you and trying to reassure you over any uncertainty or worries you had!

Anyways, my friend would wear those super stretchy under armor shorts and \"flash\" my friends oh our side of the room by putting his hands in his pockets and raising his arms up.\n\nOne time tho, the teacher caught him doing this, seeing all his junk and interrupted her own lecture to confront it. \n\nSo instead of slapping the teachers ass in your case, he flashed her accidently\n\nEdit: he didn\u2019t flash his nads on purpose.

            "I'VE DRANK MY FATHER'S PEE TOO! I'll make a post on it at some point, but when I was 12 years old, my father had his online work station/man cave in the basement. My stepmother and brother especially were light sleepers, so we would try to hold it until they woke up so we didn't flush the toilets, unless it was an emergency. My father, unknown to me, had a way of getting around this. He had the legendary piss bottle. Not just any bottle either, an empty Canada Dry 2 liter bottle of ginger ale. He would pee into this container until it got full before emptying it. Of course, all that piss would stink after a while, so his way of combating this was to add a little laundry detergent. Harmless right? Wrong. One day after bringing in groceries I noticed a full bottle of what looked like unopened, fizzy ginger ale. Naturally I brought it inside, poured a glass, still fooled into thinking that the bubbles were carbonation. And then, I chugged. I immediately knew something was VERY off, but papa didn't raise a quitter. I thought maybe something in my mouth was off and got washed down? A sip or two, a lot of distress, and the realization that I wasn't drinking Ginger Ale later, my father walks in, turns white as a sheet, and absolutely breaks down laughing. He explained what happened, and after minor stomach pain and a fair bit of emotional trauma and trust issues against ginger ales, I learned to accept the reality that I drank a solid half of a cup of urine and laundry detergent.

When I was 10 my mom decided she wanted me to move in with her and her boyfriend. Anyway, when they took me I was no longer allowed to have soda, and of course I missed it. \n\nAnyways now you\u2019ve got this bit of backstory, one day I went with my moms boyfriend to a fast food drive through and he got a soda. Afterwards, we stopped at some corner store and he ran in to grab something, leaving me alone in the car. I wanted that soda so badly. I was a good kid though, so it was a bit of a moral dilemma in my head. Ultimately I decided I would just take one quick gulp before he came back out. It tasted weird. Kind of minty, and thick. I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it so I wasn\u2019t immediately disgusted.\n\nHe came back out after a moment and as we were driving away he noticed the cup in the cup holder, laughed and said that he had brushed his teeth and spat in the cup earlier, and jokingly said not to drink it, having no idea I already had. I held it together, somehow, but I never told him I drank a fat gulp of his day old toothpaste loogies.... The memory haunts me to this day. My stomach still turns whenever I think about it. \n\nOh and the actual soda was in an identical cup in the driver doors cup holder. The game was rigged from the start.",

I was driving and had a girl I was trying to impress in the car with us, so I simply handed an empty bottle to him. Interesting side note, your urine will smell radically like fruit loops, if you enjoy this same liquid diet.\n\nMy buddy J was notorious for being broke and eventually, the strange smelling urine got the best of him, and he said for $5 he would take a drink of it. Immediately, I had my wallet out, and handing him five dollar bills. He drank, and through my rearview mirror, I saw the confusion on his face. He drank, again, and I saw absolute shock.\n\n'Dude, it tastes exactly like fruit loops. Try it,' he exclaimed to me, to which i refused. 'I will pay you $2 to take a drink of my pee.'

I was extremely pissed and asked to see the recycle bin, which he refused to show me, then telling me later that day that he deleted it bc he\u2019s a dickhead like that. Fortunately I still had an auto saved copy from a while back, but I still lost a lot of work.\n\nFast forward to today, I\u2019m thinking how I can get him back, when I have an idea. I got one of the old COD games from my friend and set it up so that when the game folder was opened, it ran a batch command that opened a porn website over and over. I knew he would try stealing it again and couldn\u2019t wait for him to be busted. Just when I was ready to lay the trap I went to edit the file and instead of right clicking, I opened it. My mouse cursor instantly slowed from the thousands of searches at once so i shut down my laptop. Minutes later when I had restarted my computer I got a message popup from the school IT department telling me to take my laptop up to the office. They called my parents and I got sent home and now I\u2019m facing suspension and have to have my laptop in teacher\u2019s view for the rest of the term. After today my phone is being confiscated until my parents believe I have learned my lesson. I guess it\u2019s karma and all but I still wish this guy had opened it because his parents are very strong Christians and he would have copped it much worse than me.\n\nTL;DR: I tried to prank a classmate by getting him to open many porn tabs in class with a file command but I opened it and got myself in a load of shit.\n\nEdit: turns out he didn\u2019t remove from his recycle bin, getting it back tomorrow and no hard feelings\n\nEdit 2: my parents ended up not confiscating my phone, but I can\u2019t use my PC until end of term so hooray I guess\n\nEdit 3: For all the people asking, it was a shortcut that was made to look identical to a folder apart from a tiny arrow at the bottom so that it ran the command on click. Sorry for not clarifying\n\nEdit 4: I apologize for not knowing how to spell batch lol",

I do not know, and you shouldn't worry about it. \nPLEASE take a step back, curb your anger and try to \"bird's eye\" look at the situation. It is clear that your son/daughter knows porn is bad, and that's exactly why he chose it for the prank. It is also clear she/he didn't TRY to open porn on a school PC. \nWhat happened here is a harmless prank going wrong, but also, a very beautiful show of talent, planning, ingenuity and wit. \nPLEASE do not over-punish your teenager and do not choose limiting computer time as punishment. Instead, give him the assignment to explain thoroughly what were her/his intentions, what was wrong with it, and how would he/she go about pranking that friend again without risking angering you or the school, both in the content of the prank, and the technical details. \nCHERISH THE TALENT, instead of cutting it in the bud.

        "selftext": "TL:DR: Accidentally added \"WAP\" to my workplace playlist. Song played at work. Let's just say If the customers in the store didn't what \"WAP\" stood for, they definitely did by the time we managed to turn it off.\n\nI\u2019m a key holder at a children\u2019s toy store. We have two CDs that we\u2019re allowed to play that have songs deemed \u201csuitable\u201d for the store. One of the CDs is your typical kids\u2019 sing-alongs, \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d, \u201cOld MacDonald'', all that jazz. The other is this weird folk CD that has the worst rendition of \u201cOh, Canada!\u201d I have heard in my life. So naturally, I made a playlist on Spotify with family-friendly tunes that I could put on when my manager wasn\u2019t there that didn\u2019t make my brain turn to mush and dribble out my ears. \n\nThis morning before my shift, I wanted to update the work playlist as it was getting a little stale so I did the quick add option that allows you to go through your liked songs and just click them to add them to the selected playlist. Awesome, great, gonna have some fresh tunes to get me through my closing shift.\n\nI\u2019m at work, about two hours in and my coworker tells me her till needs a drop (there\u2019s too much money in the till and I have to open it and count out $200). While I do this, the back room (where my phone is connected to the store speakers) is locked to prevent anyone going in and waiting for me back there when I bring the cash back to the safe. \n\nSo I'm counting an insane amount of 5 dollar bills when all of the sudden the speakers start blaring \u201cWHORES IN THIS HOUSE, THERE\u2019S SOME WHORES IN THIS HOUSE\u201d and my blood runs cold. Oh my ever-loving fuck, I added \u201cWAP\u201d to a children store\u2019s playlist. I look up and see looks of horror on the faces of women and innocent children. \n\nI panic and go to shut the till so I can run and turn off the music but remember my manager telling me that if I shut the till without taking out the correct amount of money, I would be in a world of trouble. In her words exactly, \u201cEverything comes second to the handling of cash.\u201d And I wasn\u2019t about to call my manager and tell her that it had to come 2nd to Cardi B talking about her \u201cwet ass pussy\u201d. So I start yelling for my coworker to grab the keys from around my neck and open the backroom door. She grabs the keys and sprints to the backroom door but yells back that she doesn\u2019t know what key it is. I describe it to her and she tries it but says it\u2019s not working. I\u2019m furiously counting the money but the panic is making it hard to keep track of how much I\u2019m actually taking. \n\nFinally, my coworker gets into the backroom and turns off the music but not before Megan Thee Stallion has the pleasure of informing us all that \u201cIf he ate my ass, he\u2019s a bottom feeder\u201d. \n\nI quickly finish counting the cash and make sure of the amount before I do what can only be called the Walk-of-Shame to the backroom, avoiding eye contact with all the angry mothers in the store. I get back there and see that I did in fact add \u201cWAP\u201d to the store playlist. I give myself a moment to breathe before putting on my best customer service voice and speaking over the intercom, \n\n\u201cGood Evening, Customers. On behalf of \\[STORE NAME\\], I would like to apologize for the technical difficulties. We hope to make it up to you by offering free gift wrapping on unlimited items\\*. Thank you and have a fantastical night.\u201d\n\n\\*Gift wrapping is already free.\n\nLet\u2019s just say I welcomed back \u201cOh, Canada!\u201d with open arms after this.",

In this case, it was the numerous coincidences- starting with that of selecting the most inappropriate (and coincidentally currently most popular) song to \"accidentally\" slip into the rotation, which just HAPPENED to come on during a very delicate operation which she just so happened couldn't stop doing, making the situation worse. Also if you are the key holder, you've clearly had that position for awhile, why only fix the long-standing two CD situation now, and also if you were only allowed to play those two CDs, where did you get unilateral power to change it up- if you have that power why didn't you use it before? So many holes in this story- through which you were able to comically weave in lines of the song and the clincher ending of offering them something they'd already get for free anyway. Nothing about this smacks of something that actually happened but does make for an entertaining story calculated to be as popular as possible. I'd say great job on the creative writing, but TIFU by definition are supposed to be real, so reading this kind of shit getting to the top of Reddit really annoy me. At least it was entertaining, unlike some of them which have gotten to the top lately which are just downright stupid.",

        "selftext": "This story happened in 2004, I'm posting it because I was asked to by my family. This story is told all the time in my life by my parents, so I hope you enjoy it.\n\nI'm British with a Welsh dad and Portuguese mum. Mum wanted me raised to not be a stereotypical British teenager sneaking out lying about going to a mates house and passing out from drinking vodka in a field, so she got me drinking tiny amounts of wine at dinner time from the age of 5/6. We're talking a shot of wine, no more. They learned their lesson after I got shitfaced aged 5 off of brandy (story in the comments).\n\nMe being autistic got super into this and wanted to try all the different red wines we had, and I asked lots of questions. It became a little special interest of mine when I was 8. For those who are unfamiliar, if you're not baptised into the church as a baby, you can do a combo baptism/first holy communion as a kid through Catholic school. I did this in primary school so I would have a place at the best secondary school in my city, which happened to be Catholic.\n\nLike weddings, you have a dress rehearsal for the first holy communion, with the priest. It's a whole goddamn mass, except instead of 300 people in the bigass church, it's the 10 or 20 people in the ceremony and family/godparents to be as well. So being a dress rehearsal, there's a full communion with the wine and wafers to be Top Lad Jesus' blood and body.\n\nI was doing so good at being a normal kid during the ceremony until this part. Then it was Special Interest Activation Mode. See the priest doesn't really expect kids having communion to drink the wine, they expect you to hold the goblet and give it back. Well, not me, and not this time - I swirled that goblet, sniffed it, said \"wait this is familiar\", had a sip, SHRIEKED, and turned to my parents jumping yelling \"MUM, DAD, THIS IS BLOSSOM HILL! IT'S THAT GRENACHE WE HAD LAST WEEK!!\"\n\nMy parents have never been so fucking humiliated in their lives. We bailed the rehearsal, was told to be silent during the real one, and shortly moved churches. I think the priest thought I had the devil in me and was some alcoholic kid, because the bastard tried to drown me during the official baptism and there's a video of me coughing my guts up lmao.\n\nTl;dr: my parents got me an autistic kid to develop a special interest in wine which bit them in the ass when I got baptised and had my first communion at church.\n\n---\u2010\u2010------------\n\nEDIT: Due to a comment bug the brandy story is an addendum here.\n\nBrandy story:\n\nWhen I was 5, I kept getting recurrent bronchitis. It lasted over 6 months, the antibiotics just weren't curing it and they had to keep getting stronger ones.\n\nIt tasted of fake banana and the texture of it was giving me autistic meltdowns. My dad could not rationalise a 5 year old to keep taking the antibiotics so he started experimenting to try and make it palatable.\n\nFirst he added sugar. Still gross. Then fruit squash. Still gross. Tried another batch with fruit juice. Even worse.\n\nAt this point he was losing the will to live and probably losing interest in me living and so desperate times call for desperate measures. The final form of this Ring of Fire bronchitis medicine, the secret ingredient: brandy. Lots of brandy.\n\nDid I like it? Hell no, but it knocked me out cold so it gave him the goddamn peace and quiet he wanted.",

        "selftext": "To be upfront, this did not happen today, but rather exactly one year ago today. I was reminded by my friends' snapchat memories of this absolutely awful experience one year ago.\n\nSo I'm a junior in college now (I was a sophomore then) and I work for a club on campus that raises money for a charity that gives money to families of children with cancer to ease the financial burden of things like hospital bills and hotel rooms for treatment, etc. At the end of the year, we throw a 10-hour long concert which usually involves a lot of student DJs doing quick sets to pass the time.\n\nAnyways, we needed someone to fill in for a half hour set, so I thought, \"why not?\" and plugged my laptop in, ran some cheap DJ software, and played some pop music off a playlist. All is well, right?\nWell, as it turns out, all was not not well. I was unknowingly playing \"Die Young\" by Kesha which contains the lyrics:\n>Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young // We're gonna die young // We're gonna die young\n\nNot long after, I got a text from my friend and the conversation went something like:\n> dude change the song // ??? // you're playing die young // and? // the kids are here // oh fuck\n\nI look around and everyone is staring at me thinking this is some cruel joke because all of the patients we sponsor are at the event. I quickly changed to \"I Gotta Feeling\" and all was well. Luckily, none of the kids were listening too closely and didn't get upset. I got a stern talking to by the club advisors, but they ended up letting me go because they couldn't prove that I played it on purpose. That night, we ended up raising $121,000, so... silver linings, right?\n\nTL;DR: I played a pre-set playlist at a children's cancer fundraiser. Kesha's \"Die Young\" came on. Got a talking to.\n\nEDIT: Realized I probably shouldn't include the name of the charity in this post.\n\nEDIT 2: hijacking my own post to try to turn these upvotes into some donations to the charity. If you\u2019re interested in giving, ~~here is the link.~~\n\nEDIT 3: Decided to remove the charity again to not violate Rule 5. If you feel strongly about donating, PM me.",

            "You're not alone in that sorta thing.   7 or so years ago I'm attending the reception of a wedding which is being held just a few weeks prior to Christmas.   The brother of the bride is giving a speech, and without any warning the bride's grandmother slumps over in her chair and goes into cardiac arrest.   They clear a path, and carry the grandmother out to the foyer of the banquet hall where they perform CPR and eventually have her transported via ambulance to the hospital where the poor woman was pronounced dead.   \n\nThe reception continued, albeit with many people in attendance being directly affected by the loss, and spirits are low to say the least.   The bride is beside herself with grief and the family is consoling themselves as best as they can.   Once the speeches and meal ends, the DJ starts up the dance floor, and about halfway through the DJ puts on the song \"Grandma got ran over by a reindeer\".....  \n\nUpon hearing this, the entire hall is aghast with disbelief, and the bride charges over the the DJ and proceeds to chew him out.   I was told the DJ company gave her a huge discount as an apology.",

We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.\n\nIn the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.\n\nThe box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.\n\nI just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..\n\nTL;DR: Got a gift from a girl I really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside.",

            "From the sound of it - you saying it's still painful - you need closure. While it doesn't heavily impact your life, it's never good leave negative emotions unchecked.\n\nI'd recommend reaching out, letting her know what you found, and explaining things from your side. Make sure you reassure her you're glad she's happy, and that you're just looking for closure.\n\nIt likely won't change your relationship, but it gives you - and possibly her - some peace. Missed opportunities occur all the time, and usually don't affect your life. However if you carry the lack of closure with you, its bound to manifest itself. Take it from someone who suffers from near-lifelong depression: don't discredit how much small negative emotions can subtly manifest, and snowball to disaster.",

I wasn't paying too much attention (I assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Yes I'm an idiot I know lesson learned. WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS KIDS! Anyway, it was just starting to rain and I saw a KID ABOUT TO GO INTO THE ROAD. For the life of me I still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. I was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.\n\nNow, I was going quite fast and as I said, did not have a seat belt on. Next thing I knew I was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. No pain, no panic, nothing. I just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever had in my life. I just laid there, not knowing what to do. I heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. I thought I was going to die. There was a lot of blood.\n\nYou know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? Well that didn't quite happen but I did start thinking about who I care about and who I love. Here's where I tell you about my best friend. A girl I've been in love with for around two years, I never let her know and never intended too. She is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and I didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy I'm happy. There's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. But I thought I was literally dying, and all I could think about was her in those moments. The pain was starting to kick in but I was just thinking about how she'd never know how much I loved her.\n\nI realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force I could muster I took it out. It was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message I could sent was an \"I love you\" to her. I thought that would be the last message I'd ever send.\n\nI don't remember much after that. Days have been a blur. I've had quite a few operations, AKI due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. But my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like I got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! All I do is sleep and appreciate the fact I'm alive. The other driver and the kid were okay btw.\nAnyway, as you can see, I did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but I can't undo that message I sent. I've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. I told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. Earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. I haven't replied yet and I don't want to. I don't know what to do. So far I've been writing this TIFU as procrastination and then after this I plan on taking a long nap. Thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Got in a car accident and while I was bleeding out I told my crush best friend I love her. She's in a 10 year relationship and I haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.\n\n\n\nEDIT: GOD GUYS THIS BLEW UP SO MUCH!!! I only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!\n\nSo I spoke to her... Over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. I decided that the best thing I could do at this point was just tell her the truth. I didn't expect anything and I didn't want anything to come out of it, but I just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. I would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but I guess life is just different from movies...\n\nI told her how I felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. But I also added, and it's true, that I've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. I don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as I want her happy. I think she understood where I came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. I hope nothing will change with her because I love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. So I guess I just have to give you the boring response... But it's reality so sorry if it sucks... Im okay with though, I really didn't expect anything and still kind of think I was being selfish. We talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! She said she'll try and make the trip, even though I told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... She was really flattered though I think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing I thought about when I thought I was going to die",

            "My dude, as someone who has been in love with a few close girl friends who I was \"friends\" with, and having had my entire life to reflect on my regrets for not acting on it (at the right moment), let me just say -- OWN IT.  Its true.  Better to let it out, let her know, and move on with life.  You'll never regret not knowing if anything could come of it, and--this is the KEY--you may not realize it yet but you've just freed yourself.  No more pinning away in love in secret.  Its out there.  I think the secret held love tends to linger since, whether you admit it or not, you're holding out hope.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet it go dude.  You love her, she knows now, its ok, love is awesome and powerful and it hurts sometimes too.  Its not a bad thing, its natural, it happens, and sometimes its mutual, sometimes its not, and its its not mutual, then that's fine, on to the next one.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of this accident as a new beginning.  Move on dude--two years of loving someone unavailable has kept you from being receptive to the world, and in the world there truly are a lot of other available people who you may have already run into but weren't receptive because of this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe world gave you a reset button here.  Embrace it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeal up, but I say don't shy away from it.  Once you're up to it, have the conversation and just say \"yeah, its true, and in the moment when I thought I was going to die, I didn't want to die without you knowing.  Now that its out there I suppose there is no going back, and that's ok.  I'll be ok.\"  Maybe it will be fine, maybe it will be awkward afterwards, but that is life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know what you will NOT be left with?  Regret.  Good luck.",

Tell her you know she's not available but you thought your life was ending,and she was the person occupying your mind in that moment, and it seemed important then to say what you felt. You do love her, and because you love her, her being happy matters to you. You can let her know that you accept the situation as it is, don't expect anything, and she doesn't have to worry that you'll try anything or make the friendship weird.

You have felt that way a long time and you thought the bigger picture was her happiness, but on death's door you didn't want to go without speaking your mind.  Then you have to live with the results.\n\nThat's it.  Other people here are looking at this with romance in their brains.  She may not feel the same way OP.  This may be the thing that ends your friendship with her, at least for the time, maybe forever.  That's the hard knock life though.  Reality isn't always a storybook ending.\n\nThat said, she may come running into your arms.  Storybook endings do happen and there is no reason it can't happen to you as well.  In fact another possibility is that she doesn't come running right away, but later on down the road she realizes she needs you in her life.\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities here, but ultimately you really only need to remember one thing no matter what the outcome is.  When you thought you were dying, you didn't want to die with the regret of not expressing how important she was to you.  You did that.  There is no greater expression of someone's importance to you than declaring your love for them.  My hope for you, regardless of the outcome of this very small moment in your life is that you remember that moment every chance you have.\n\nYou never know when you are gonna go, so never tuck away your own strong feelings because you don't want the last moment in life to be the one where you physically can't tell them.\n\nStay strong OP.

            "I once my best friend about my feelings I've had for her for years. I wasn't dying like you, but she was moving to another state the next day, and we might as well not see each other again for years. She had just finished a long term relationship, and was not interested in another one before working more on herself. I knew that something between us would never work, and I was not interested in trying to have something with her, I was just interested in being honest, because I knew she prefers honesty.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nFew years later she came back because of work reasons, we are still great friends. Actually we are roomies! All romantic feelings are gone, we both found someone very special, we respect each other and share a great friendship.  Of course, time helped a lot. We kept in contact, and made an effort to keep a healthy friendship.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that a great friendship can overcome this situations.",

You could get a pass for being terribly delirious, but i wouldnt. If she asks what it meant tell her that you want to name your daughter after her.

I woke up a couple of days later in the hospital and was about to be kicked out, they said i'd be fine, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, no big deal but when I went back to work, one of my female coworkers I was good friends with was acting very strange around me and kind of avoiding me. I finally stopped her and asked her what was going on and asked her why she was being so weird. She told me that she was feeling embarrassed and having regrets about what we did and all this stuff. I'm stunned and wracking my brain wondering what in the world she is talking about. I start asking her what she is referring to and she is being evasive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally she tells me everything. Apparently what happened was, during one of the days I can't remember, I was out of my mind on drugs from the hospital and thinking and saying crazy things (which is why I don't remember any of this), and apparently she came to visit while I was conscious. Apparently, I told her that I was going to die and she started crying and I was comforting her and then I told her that I loved her and wished she would give me an old fashioned handy since I was more or less confined to that bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know why or what words I could've strung together for this to occur, but apparently it worked and she did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen she found out I was going to live, she came back and berated me and said I had pressured her into it by convincing me I was going to die but apparently all I could talk about in response to this was telling her to remember to feed the fish we adopted last week when she leaves. She finally realized I was so drugged and out of my mind that I didn't even know what I was saying, so she just left and was embarrassed by the entire thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my perspective, I don't even remember any of this happening. But as she told me, I was cracking up laughing and she did too. We apologized to each other and things became less awkward soon after, and a couple of days later I asked her out on a date. I thought it was very sweet that she came to visit me in the hospital. I knew she was single but i'd never really been interested before, but after that whole string of events, we started to go out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's really funny looking back because she is so shy, timid, and kind of conservative, so every time I think back to what she did in the hospital I can't help but laugh.",

First, yeah you thinking you were gonna die and texting I love you is a great gesture and all and in context everyone would be fine with that. You could play it as a friend thing if you wanted. She\u2019s your best mate also and you thought you were gonna die. But as others said the more mature option is to admit it\u2019s true as it\u2019s the most genuine and best way to say you appreciate her relationship and won\u2019t obviously pursue her.\n\nThe interesting thought is that she appears to have chosen to read it that way - if it wasn\u2019t already confirmed or you weren\u2019t obviously embarrassed to see her also. So it\u2019s viable to think she is hoping it to be true and wants to talk about it to confirm. Otherwise if she didn\u2019t feel anything most likely she\u2019d ignore it and not bring it up or say I love you too assuming it was a friend thing. \n\nIn which case maybe best scenario is a difficult but honest break up with her BF before anything happens with you.

That being said though, if there\u2019s not a romantic future with this girl, its probably better that you guys go your separate ways. If you are madly in love with someone who doesn\u2019t feel the same way, you are doing yourself harm. Why be in a constant state of want, if you will never have? You are likely missing other opportunities to have a fulfilling relationship with someone else by focusing on this pipe dream. It will suck for a bit to lose your best friend and accept that you wont be with them, but in the long run you will be happier.

            "When I was 12 years old (in 1984), I walked into my 7th grade Spanish class for the first time and saw easily the prettiest girl I had ever seen in my entire life to that point (we'll call her Sharon \\[not her real name\\]). I was an overweight kid, and knew I'd likely never have the chance to talk to this girl, let alone ever be friends. On day two, my teacher gave us assigned seats, and wouldn't you know it, she and I were placed next to each in the back row. Over the year, we became good friends. Sharon was gorgeous, and if she didn't know it, she did a great job pretending she didn't. I never told her how I felt. Years passed, and we maintained our friendship. She would have a boyfriend every now and then, and I would die inside a little when I saw her with them, or we talked about them. We ended up in different high schools, but kept the friendship. We had pretty different political views, but we were able to have civil discussions and agree to disagree. We even went to the first Earth Day concert together in DC in 1990, even though the environment wasn't the first thing on my mind. \n\nAnyway, we went to different colleges that were only 80 miles from each other, but neither of us had a car. In January '91, I met a girl (we'll call her Bethany) while home on Winter Break and it got serious pretty fast. If I am one thing, it's loyal, and one of the qualities I have always looked for in people is loyalty. I never tried to break up Sharon  and any of her boyfriends, because I felt I would somehow be encouraging her to be disloyal. But, one night while I was back at college in the Spring of '91, I got a phone call from one of Sharon's new friends at school, telling me that Sharon loved me, and has loved me for years, but never said anything to me about it. She told me that she was sure that she and I would be married one day. I was floored. But, I was also in a relationship, and wanted to be faithful and loyal. So, I pretty much lied through my teeth and told her that she missed the boat. In order to maintain loyalty, I lied. It was one of the dumbest things I ever did. \n\nAfter that, she and I slowly lost contact. I ended up dating Bethany for the next 2.5 years, and it was not a very good relationship. She cheated on me multiple times and I was completely clueless. SOOOO, fast forward another year (I was 21 by then) and I met another girl, Dawn (her real name), and I was a goner :-). She and were married in 1995, and we now have 9 beautiful children together (I would absolutely, positively not trade my wife or kids for anything in the world, and this post shouldn't be considered as me saying or thinking that I should have married Sharon instead). I went several years without talking to Sharon or knowing where she was. Come to find out that she had spent some time in England and had met a nice guy there, married him, and she stayed over there. I was very happy that she was happy. \n\nI SAY ALL OF THAT TO SAY THIS: You told her you love her. Stand behind it. You have no idea if she will look at you and say, \"I feel the same way.\" If she says it's too weird, and she pulls back, you might just tell her that if she ever changes her mind, she should reach out and tell you. You might be in a place where the two of you finally get your respective lives aligned, and end up together.",

            "I had something somewhat similar happen to me several years ago. I was driving back to college in a different city, and suddenly my car seemed to be accelerating on its own. I put on the brakes but I was still going 50 over the speed limit, and I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was still accelerating. I called my mom. In my head I was thinking either my mom has a solution, or I\u2019ll be able to tell her I love her before I drive into a ditch to avoid hurting anyone else on the road. \n\nI told her I love her, then in a last resort effort, I took my shoe off and tried to pull the accelerator back up with my toes. It worked, and my car stopped accelerating. I took it to the dealership and they told me it was likely the mat had slid over the accelerator, and I had managed to push it off with my toes. Needless to say, I refused to use a mat in that vehicle anymore. RIP to the carpet in that car. \n\nAnyways, later I messaged a friend to have them tell my (now ex of 3 years) boyfriend to call me. He didn\u2019t have a phone, and this is one of the reasons he wasn\u2019t my first call. He was pissed that I\u2019d call my mom to say goodbye instead of him. He said I should have texted the friend right away (as I was barreling down the highway going 160km/hr in a 110 zone). I don\u2019t think he ever forgave me for that. But that\u2019s part of why he\u2019s now an ex. \n\nSide note: As I was in pure panic mode at the time, I didn\u2019t think to put my car into neutral to stop the acceleration. But if anyone else finds themselves in a similar situation, neutral is your best friend. \n\nTl;dr: When I thought I was in a life or death situation, I called my mom to say goodbye instead of my boyfriend. He never let it go.",

I didn't find out until a year after she broke up with one that he was physically abusing her. This relationship happened after I had moved out of state. I had visited one time and stayed with them and I had no idea it was that type of relationship.

He disappears for a little while and I go to find him.    I didn\u2019t really need him for anything, just wanted to say \u2018hi\u2019 since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.\n\nI start walking down the hallway towards his room\u2014our house isn\u2019t super big and I knew he was in there.   The lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but I could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.\n\nI decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   He was lying with his back to me, I could tell by where his phone was.   As I am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, I see it.   My son\u2019s boner.   As I was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   It all happened so fast and I was already airborne before I realized what was happening.   I did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son\u2019s boner through his boxer briefs.   \n\nThe entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, I\u2019m sure.   I have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, AND I DON\u2019T WANT TO.\n\nAt that point, I am still flopped down on his bed.   Both of us are well aware that I just saw him whacking off.    Both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   I say, \u2018Dinner is almost ready.\u2019   (It wasn\u2019t)\nHe said, \u2018Ok, I\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u2019\nI said, \u2018No hurry.\u2019\n\nNow I\u2019m standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he\u2019ll need if he ever finds out I posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering WHY DON\u2019T BOYS CLOSE THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE MASTURBATING?  \n\ntl/dr:   Basically the title.     \n\nEdit: spelling.   Dammit, I can\u2019t change the spelling of \u2018masturbating\u2019 in the title.   Oh well.   I fixed \u2018Fortnite\u2019 though.   \n\nEdit 2:  for those asking:\n\n\u2014I am mom.\n\u2014I want to be clear, I have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   I am a nurse.   I talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   The horrifying part is that I walked in on him.   That was not ideal.  For either one of us.  \n\u2014his door was OPEN.  \n\u2014I have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before I walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   \n\u2014he isn\u2019t on any social media.   I am quite confident that his identity is protected.\n\nEdit 3:   For anyone still interested...\n\nTHANK YOU (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and I lessons about boundaries and privacy.    \n\nWOW.   I now know what \u2018RIP my inbox\u2019 feels like.   I had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.\n\nFor those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.\n\nAnd an update:   There is no weirdness.   We went straight back to the status quo, had dinner and just continued about our night.   I didn\u2019t act weird and neither did he.   ",

I've put it on subscription, and if they want to start selling a 72-pack, sign me up. I have three reasons for needing this much Kleenex, and their names are Liam, Samuel and Hank.\n\n> This is how it goes in this house. First the Kleenex disappears. Then the toilet paper. Then they go for fabrics. And you don't want it to get there, unless you're ready to invest in a five gallon drum of Fabreeze.\n\n> This used to be a good Christian home. But it's not about moral judgment anymore. I'm way beyond that. I'm in survival mode. If I don't supply absorbent paper products, I'm going to find my dish towels hidden in the basement, stiff as aluminum. The other day, I almost cut my hand on a sock. I am sorry to speak so frankly, but with three teenage boys, a woman has got to be practical.\n\n> The funny part is, they think they're being sneaky, with their 45 minute showers and sudden need for \"privacy\", as if I'm going to walk in on them journaling. They slink around the house like unfixed cats, while I try to announce my location at all times. No one needs to ask me to knock anymore. I knock on the walls. I practically wear a cow bell. I'm not looking to catch anyone by surprise, believe me. I'm just trying to get through this.\n\n> The other day my husband was watching me unload the groceries, and he asks me, all sweetness and light, \"Honey, what're you doing with all that Kleenex?\"\n\n> I about knocked him off his chair.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: Obligatory thanks for the silver/gold.

        "selftext": "This just happened 2 hours ago.\n\n\nI work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.\n\n\nI had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled \"sexy pikachu\". Found [the one](https://www.deviantart.com/nancher/art/Pikachu-sexy-version-159235080), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.\n\n\nI quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, \"Hey, I'm remoted into a client's computer. You changed their background, not mine.\"\n\n\nI shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, \"Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it.\" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she's the owner's daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. He's just basking in the moment of instant karma. \n\n\nI stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say \"Ok, send her over to me.\" I'm a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it's really best I talk to her.\n\n\nI answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what's going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like \"Hey, I'm locking my computer for you\" or \"Hey, I'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?\"\n\n\nTL;DR Tried to change coworker's desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client's PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager.\n\nEdit 12/11/2020: Link to pic no longer works.

[This picture was a naked Hasselhoff where his junk was covered by puppies and he was sprawled out in a sexy pose](http://funhipo.com/contents/originals/1452589466773.jpg).  I tiled that on his screen then closed the lid.  One small problem, he didn't open up his computer the rest of the day.  The next day, he went to an onsite.  We serviced equipment for our customers at their factories.  He went to one such place, set up his stuff, fired up the computer, then went to take a dump while the computer booted.  Well, the background came up as the background on the login screen and sat there for all to see in that factories quality department.  So, nobody was really offended, just my friend was incredibly embarrassed because he was in a plant full of old redneck factory workers who saw his half-naked Hasselhoff computer background. ",

She is normally very timid and self conscious about her body despite being in great shape (her body returned to Pre-baby weight almost immediately) and being a beautiful woman. \n\nThe other night I hopped on my computer and browsed the internet in the evening as my wife fed the baby and put her to sleep. She came out in the living room asked what I was up to, I told her not much just gonna play a game or two with some friends. She said that sounded fun and then started tidying up a little. My attention then turned to my game with my friends. The lights were very dim in the room and I had headphones on. I hear a noise just slightly above the noise in my ears and look over my shoulder to see my wife sitting on the couch in the dimly lit room. \u201cYou\u2019re sneaky I didn\u2019t hear you come in\u201d I say.

I fire off a \u201cHuh?\u201d Text. I quickly get up to go see what she\u2019s talking about. I find her curled up in bed sobbing. I climb up next her and ask her what\u2019s wrong and what the text meant. \u201c you know exactly what I mean\u201d. I still have no clue as to what\u2019s going on. After a little bit more probing  she tells me through tears, \u201c I wanted to have a fun evening with you. I put on lingerie and laid out all the  stuff for sex (towel, lubes, etc...), I come out to couch all dressed up and you look right at me and go right back to your game. \u201c\n\nI honestly was shocked by all of this. The monitor was super bright and I could all but make out the silhouette of her when she came out. I tried to explain that to her but honestly what could I say in that moment.

That could be the case for her as well if this is a frequent miscommunication between you two. It may be worth a conversation.\n\nRegardless of the reasoning, I'm sure this situation will be behind you both shortly and that it will help you both grow closer as a couple.",

            "Pro tip: when this sort of misunderstanding happens and someone\u2019s feelings get hurt, trying to convince the person that their feelings shouldn\u2019t have been hurt (\u201c\u2026 convinced her that I could not see anything \u2026\u201d) isn\u2019t likely to help. Rather, go for empathy first and explain later. \u201cWow, I can totally see how awful that must have felt. You had this great night planned for us and I just totally missed it.\u201d Typically one can only get past those sorts of feelings and talk about a potential miscommunication once they know the other person actually understands their feelings. This has nothing to do with rationality. And even if it is the result of pregnancy hormones, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that the feelings are very real and need to be acknowledged. \n\nI\u2019d also encourage you to try not to think of it as \u201cbeing in the doghouse.\u201d Your wife, whom you love, is hurting. Does it really matter why? Be present with her, take her and her feelings seriously. Open the lines of communication. Marriage isn\u2019t meant to be oppositional or transactional, it\u2019s meant to be working together to understand and love each other.",

There is the exhaustion and sleep deprivation from the new baby, self esteem issues from a changed body, and emotional issues that can be exacerbated by hormonal changes. \n\nClearly, men should never pressure their partner to be intimate too early. But this can also lead to men being nervous to initiate or even talk about intimacy, making the woman feel unattractive. \n\nCommunication is absolutely key. Assume no sex for minimum a month, unless she feels great and initiates. Let her know your desires, but make it clear you are concerned that she is ready. If she isn\u2019t physically ready, try suggesting a clothes-on make out session. She will feel desired, without the pressure that you will try to turn it into more. Don\u2019t ask for anything that is a one-way street, like oral sex - if she is a giver and wants to please you, she will let you know. \n\nTalk about when you might be interested. Maybe see if Grandma can take the baby for a first evening without mom, to give both of you a break, and maybe make it into an entire romantic evening. Be prepared that there could be changes to her body, including her vagina, that could take some getting used to.

            "It\u2019s already been said in this thread, but I\u2019ll say it again.\n\nDirect communication is key.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to get to a place where you and your partner can have a conversation, and it goes something like \u201cHey, I am really feeling like I want to get intimate/sexy with you,\u201d and the response can be \u201cGreat, let\u2019s plan to get intimate at this particular time,\u201d it will relieve you of so much stress involved with assumptions of the significant others thoughts and reactions to those assumptions.\n\nIt may sound like a business transaction the way I type it, but it can be totally fluid, and be mixed with flirting and foreplay.\n\nAgain, you might already get what I\u2019m saying, the key point is to talk to each other and communicate your worlds to each other instead of trying to read minds and navigate through disconnection.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s great to practice forgiveness. \n\nIn the heat of any sort of miscommunication, it can be hard to let go, and give up your side of the argument, but if you can manuever yourself to taking a small break, it makes it easy to come back and apologize for the miscommunication, pronouncing your affection for your partner, and bringing things back to your happy place.",
            "Dude don\u2019t sweat it! you are aware you\u2019re in the doghouse that\u2019s half the battle. You should definitely try to make it up to her. It would be good to maybe communicate that when you\u2019re playing video games you aren\u2019t really \u201cthere\u201d and planning ahead or not trying for sex in the middle of games would lead to better results. Does your wife play games? Sometimes people who don\u2019t play don\u2019t understand that you can\u2019t just \u201cpause\u201d. Good luck bud",

            "You don't owe her sex. And her acting that way is her manipulating you for it.",
            "This sounds more like, \"Today my wife fucked up by not being able to communicate her wants/needs clearly\" to me.",
            "This is such a common occurrence. Guy plays video games and gets really into it and accidentally forgets to show love and give attention to loved ones. I hear it all the time. Maybe it would be a good thing to set a time where you put the controller down and devote some quality time to your girl. Video games are great but they are also very effective at taking up all of your attention and time that would otherwise go elsewhere so keep that in mind. I know couples who have divorced because of video games.",
            "This is so stupid and the attitude is sexist. Like if you came home and expected sex from your wife you'd be roasted on Reddit for expecting sex. Or if you didn't feel like having sex suddenly your wife freaks out and thinks you don't find her attractive or are cheating. However, if she doesn't feel like sex it's ok and you have to be understanding.\n\nLike you get in shit for only thinking about sex and you get in shit for having other stuff on your mind and not being in the mood.",
            "Women still haven't learned to say \"let's fuck\" yet in 2020?",
            "I'm sorry you're in the doghouse because there was no reason for you to ever be in it. You have nothing at all to apologize for. I learned a long time ago that hints really never worked with my husband. If I want sex, or anything really,  I just ask for it. Communication is the key to a long and happy relationship and it sounds like you guys need to focus on talking to each other. \n\nMaybe once a week or month, if you have a reliable babysitter, you could have a date night at home with the baby away. It would be a chance for some intimacy and conversation.  You could both get dressed up if you wanted, prepare a nice dinner for her, and you can tell and show how beautiful you think she is all night. You can work up to sex if you want, but that wouldn't really be the main focus here. If it leads to sex, then great, but it doesn't have to. She needs to feel more like a wife right now and not just as a mother. \n\nBest of luck to you both.",

If you want something, you go get it, or at the very least make it known in no uncertain terms what it is that you want. Otherwise you wind up getting nothing that you want.\n\nMy friend and his wife had an issue with this same thing. I told him to tell her to just walk up to him and say \"get naked\".

I had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. He was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. I was feeling pretty generous at that time so I got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because I was curious how far he would venture in. You know, normal pet owner stuff. He got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. I'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. \n\nTL;DR: My cat sneezed directly in my mouth.",

Was easier than driving across the entire city daily. \n\nSo every morning, I'd be awoken by the oldest of the two kitties, with her letting me know \"It is time for affection and then food.\" \nOne particular morning, she was hyper affectionate and I woke up to her rubbing her face against mine, aggressively. She then proceeded to sneeze in my face multiple times, and she was a wet sneezer. \nAt this point in my life I had a milf cat allergy, where if I touched my face after touching a cat, my eyes would get itchy and I'd start sneezing. I proceeded to have the worst allergy attack I'd ever had thanks to this assault of affection, and sneezes to the face. Since that day, I have never had another allergic reaction to a cat. I now own two who rub up all over my face all the time. \n\nLong story short, this is what we call building an immunity. Your cat was just vaccinating you, be grateful peasant!",

This is an old story, but then again I'm an old man.\n\nAbout 30-some odd years ago, when I was in my early 20's, I worked for a newspaper as the assistant district manager. One part of my job that I was doing then was to go around and make sure that the paperboys (remember them) picked up their delivered bundles of newspapers for delivery.\n\nThis was on a Sunday morning and I had to drive around to all the drop-off spots. And there it was...a bundle of newspapers still sitting out undelivered. I looked in my little booklet of paperboys and saw the name and address of the boy who was supposed to get them. No issue. He probably overslept and I just needed to wake him up.\n\nI went to the house and knocked on the door. A woman in her 40's answered the door.\n\nMe: \"Hi. Is Paperboy there? He hasn't picked up his newspapers and they need to go out!\"\n\nThe woman then solemnly looked me in the eye. The 16-year old boy who I was asking about had hung himself in his own closet the previous day and was gone. She was a neighbor who was staying with the family to help them.\n\nI felt about 1 inch tall.\n\nI don't remember what exactly I said to her, but I apologized for the interruption and waking everyone, gave my intense sympathy to her, and backed away with my tail between my legs. I then contacted my boss for a copy of the customer list and delivered those newspapers myself for the next few days.\n\nIt was awful!\n\nI know that I had no way of knowing, but I defy anyone who has something like that happen not to feel like the cosmos should have presented us with divine knowledge to not get into this!!! I didn't stay in that position for too much longer.\n\nTL;DR Tried to wake up a paperboy only to find he died; tried to apologize my way out",

            "As a newspaper reporter I once mistakenly informed a close family member that their loved one had been killed by police the day before. \n\nThis is a huge no-no in journalism, it\u2019s why media outlets are supposed to wait until family is notified to release names, so this doesn\u2019t happen. I worked at a small town paper and we usually couldn\u2019t even get the names before police notification so this wasn\u2019t that.\n\nThis truly wasn\u2019t our fault. \n\nWhat happened was a man led police on a chase while drunk and high and crashed into a building. He then threw the car in reverse and back towards one of the officers trying to get him out of the vehicle. Obviously this opened the door for lethal force and he was killed. \n\nThe next day, the police released his name, in the afternoon, so presumably family had all been notified, right?\n\nWell wrong. Myself (photog) and a reporter were told to go to his last known address and just see if the family would give a statement. \n\nWe get there, young man opens the door we ask about the deceased he says \u2018yeah he lives here. He\u2019s my mom\u2019s boyfriend.\u2019 We say well, you know we wanted to talk about what happened. \n\nHe says \u2018what do you mean?\u2019 reporter and I look at each other, confused and say \u2018uh...he was involved in the shooting with police last night.\u2019 And he looks at us confused and suddenly it\u2019s sinking in he has no idea what we\u2019re talking about. \n\nSuddenly a car pulls into the driveway, slams on the brakes and a woman gets out the car sobbing uncontrollably, between gasps saying \u2018he\u2019s dead, he got shot last night, oh my God\u2019 etc. This is the deceased\u2019s girlfriend and we\u2019re suddenly like \u2018what is going on, the police released his name, we thought you all knew.\u2019 She had just heard a radio report identifying her boyfriend as the man killed. \n\nWell it turns out the guy was estranged from his parents because of his drug problem so the police were only able to notify them and the parents didn\u2019t bother to let his girlfriend and the people he lived with know. It\u2019s unclear if they even knew where he was living or would have been able to but still, a very weird situation. \n\nReporter and I apologized profusely, they gave us just a couple quotes and we got the hell out of there. \n\nDefinitely one of the worst days as a journalist.",

I asked where Mr. Neighbor was and asked about the plates (They sold the cars together). Then I noticed he's dressed in all black formal attire...and there's a bunch of people standing around dressed in black...\nI walked in to his wake. His son asked me to wait and he went and retrieved the plates. I wanted to curl into a ball and just roll away... When his son came back, I apologized profusely and thanked him.

            "Similar situation happened to me when booking a cruise a year or two ago. It was my second time using an agent. The guy (agent) scheduling my travel was super super nice. Older gentlemen who had been in the travel industry for over 20 years. He shared tips and information about our planned destination as well as others. Just a good guy to talk to and I immediately felt good about going with a little known agency.\n\nTwo months later I found out my wife was pregnant and our doctor recommended we should not travel due to some issues my wife was having at the time. Called the agent up to request a refund/cancellation. I expected the run around since the policy was absolutely no refunds unless you purchased their insurance. I explained the situation and was told to grab a doctors note and all would be good. He shared a story of how his daughter had similar issues as my wife and would be willing to make an exception. He said he would call me back once he heard back from the cruise line and confirm the cancellation/refund.\n\nA week goes by and still no word from him. I called several times throughout the week with no response. I was worried he gave me the run around by just telling me what I wanted to hear. He was also unreachable by email over the following two weeks.\n\nFinally, I call the main agency line and speak with another agent. I start off by politely venting my frustrations about how it was so unprofessional not to hear anything given my circumstances. I then led into how he seemed to be a genuine guy and how his advice on my personal situation stuck with me. This just didn't make any sense......she immediately starts crying and informs that he passed away two days after we last spoke. I just couldn't believe it.\n\nShe shared more about him and a few experiences that meant a lot to her over the years they worked together. This hit the feels harder than the passing of a family member for some reason.  The fragility and unpredictability of life is something else.",

            "I had something similar happen to me back in the early 1990s. I was the writer and associate producer of a video that the producer was going to sell (VHS video) in stores as well as rentals (i.e., Blockbuster video). The video was called \"CPR For Everybody\". The video was supposed to teach everyone basic CPR skills (not certify them but at least give them enough knowledge to help first responders).\n\nOne of the segments of the show featured people who had been saved by someone doing CPR on them. The premise was to get those people on camera saying that people should learn CPR. \n\nWell, as associate producer and writer, my job was to find people who had been saved. So, I took to the newspapers and newspaper archives (this was before we all used the internet for research). I found a one or two-year old newspaper article about how a local citizen had stepped in and saved a man who was having a heart attack. It happened in my local area, so I was able to track down the family. I called and left a voicemail message, explaining who I was, that I was working on a TV show, and would like to interview the man. A few days went by, I knew I had the right family per the voicemail message hadn't been changed. But I hadn't heard anything. I called again and left another message in case they didn't get my number right.\n\nA neighbor called me a day or two later, and explained that the man had died a few days after the news article was in the newspaper, and they hadn't done a follow-up article.",

            "Tangentially related story: I was a paperboy in a smallish town when I was 13, and one morning a 12-year-old paperboy serving another part of town was hit by a car and killed while out delivering his papers. We all knew each other and the route managers didn't want us to find out about his death while we were delivering, so they drove around until they found us, brought us down to the newspaper office, and called our parents to come in and pick us up. The paper's management was more worried about making sure we were safe than about getting the rest of the papers delivered that morning (how times have changed). \n\nA short while later, the lobby was full of crying teenagers and pre-teens when a neighboring business owner walked in the front door and started yelling at the managers about his \"damned paper\" not being delivered, AGAIN, because his \"dumb ass delivery boy couldn't do his damned job\". \n\nHis delivery boy was the kid who got killed. \n\nWhat followed was three minutes of the most sheepish, epic, groveling apology that I've ever heard. The paper's editor wasn't having any of it, and the article he wrote about the death contained the line \"Sadly, some of his customers still thought it worthwhile to complain to us about his missed delivery yesterday, including Mr. Jack Hoff, on Maple Street.\" Small town pettiness at its best.",

            "Many years ago while moving i was looking through a stack of old papers and found a telephone bill from a couple of years before. I was in the mood to dig up bones so i perused the long distance call list to look for familiar numbers or cities. \n\nI saw a small town in Illinois and knew this was the mother of a fella I once knew ... we had parted friends when I left state. I dialed her up to see if he was still living at home or had a new number. \n\nWhen she answered and I asked for him, she screamed and hung up. I knew this was probably not a good thing but i called back because i was worried about her. \n\nShe said she was glad I called back because she'd just been surprised and didn't mean to drop the phone. \n\nShe went on to explain that he had killed himself two years earlier, not long after I'd left town. He'd gotten back together with his long time girlfriend and then she broke up with him and got an abortion ... it was too much for him. He was in his mid 20s and didn't think he'd get over the pain.\n\nHis mom and I had a nodce chat after we both had a cry and she appreciated the chance to talk about him. We told Vern stories for half an hour on intrastate long distance.\n\nI've never been to his gravesite as it's 5 hours away but its on my bucket list. Vern didnt think anybody cared but 35 years later I still remember him fondly and share his story.\n\nThe paperboy probably thought nobody would miss him, but you've carried his memory all these years and shared it with us.",

On the elevator I started talking, it was pleasant and then I mentioned I heard her and her significant other were married, I asked how he was. She completely broke eye contact with me and went quiet. I assumed they perhaps divorced or it wasn't going well, it turned out he had committed suicide. I learned about an hour later and felt horrible for at least a week - I couldn't stop thinking about how bad I may have made her feel.

We had just finished seeing my grandma before going to the shops to get some food.\n\n As we get there some old lady tells us \"sorry for your loss\" and walks on. We stood there and quietly started laughing because we still saw my grandma less than 5 minutes ago.

I called this one number for a mother and daughter and jauntily told the man who answered that I was calling from Dr. Optometrist\u2019s office to see if we could schedule their eye exams!\n\nThe guy, in the flattest tone I\u2019d ever heard, told me that they\u2019d BOTH died in a car accident like a week ago.

Every week I would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  \n\n***Story Time***\n\nLast year, on r/WritingPrompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. I forget the full details, but it intrigued me and I wrote a 6-PAGE STORY about it. Anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but I still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that Reddit post.\n\n**^((It was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**\n\n***Present*** \n\nSo a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. So I was like, okay sweet I don't need to spend any time on this project. I went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. To be sure I don't get into any trouble, I delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. \n\nYesterday, I get an email from the Professor saying I need to meet with the Dean immediately. At this point, I am shitting my pants. She told me that I stole someone else's work and I could be withdrawn from my program. I try to explain but I have no proof that it was my work because I no longer live at home and I wrote it on an old laptop. I have a meeting with the head of the University later today. I am so fucking scared. I am currently driving home to find that fucker.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I copied and pasted my own work from my own Reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. Could be withdrawn from my program\n\n\nEdit 1: [17:00] I found my original work. Took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. Travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. I\u2019m okay with taking a zero, obviously, I just hope they can reason. \n\nAlso, I can\u2019t show the Reddit emails because I never had a real email for the account. \n\nEdit 2: SUCCESS! I brought my old laptop to the University principal and provided proof that I was the one to write the story. They were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what I told them before. They asked me why I did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. I told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. \n\n*Results*\n\nI am not kicked out, and I am actually given another chance at the project. My professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. \n\n\nThanks everyone who supported me through this! I won\u2019t do this again. I\u2019m sorry. \n\n\nAlso, thanks u/SQUID_FUCKER for the suggestion\n\n> Just read all the edits.  You know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  If the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.\n\n\nMaybe this will be the plot of the new story.

Track down a dozen other examples of stories you did in that profile that got deleted and go into the meeting with all of them, and something else you wrote at the time that you can prove was yours and not posted onto the net.  Give them all over and explain things.  They should be able to see that the writing style is the same and likely come from the same author.  I would then take the old story and re-write it.  With the benefit of years of practice and experience you ought to be able to significantly improve on anything you wrote in the past.

In this case, we had to write a report on any subject pertaining to the material, but we had to have the topic approved beforehand. We\u2019d had a question on a test that I knew I could base a full paper around and he agreed to it. Fast forward to when the papers were returned. He calls me out into the hallway to tell me that I was very lucky not to be turned into the Dean for plagiarism. His proof was that I took some wording from my own answer on the test and used it in the paper. Never mind that the test was a paragraph and the paper was 10+ pages IIRC. It was 20 years ago and I still hate that guy.",

In my first week I read out a first chapter I'd written over the summer, but it was practically the same version I'd posted in a writing sub.

We\u2019ve been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.\n\nI was joking with the kids  that I\u2019d left their Nintendo Switch at home, they suspected I was joking but went along with it anyway. So when I told them I had brought it they wanted to check.\n\n\u201cI brought it,\u201d I said \n\n\u201cOur Switch?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Our Switch\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?!! OUR Switch?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes!! OUR Switch!!\u201d\n\nThey got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. I noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn\u2019t really register.\n\n\u201cOUR SWITCH?\u201d\n\n\u201cOUR SWITCH! Ha!\u201d\n\nThen my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - I was like \u201cit\u2019s ok... it\u2019s a buffet\u201d\n\n\u201cOUR SWITCH! Ha!\u201d\n\n\u201cOUR SWITCH!\u201d\n\nThen my wife leaned in and urgently whispered \u201cit sounds like you are all shouting Auschwitz\u201d\n\nMy whole body went cold with the realisation.\n\nNeedless to say I immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son\u2019s knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before I could stop him... \n\nI have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. \n\nTLDR: Shouted \u201cAuschwitz\u201d loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of Germans and Austrians. I\u2019m really sorry.\n\nEDIT: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! My first. To those calling BS: I wish it was. To the genial Germans and Austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - I will sleep better tonight because of you. And for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it\u2019s a kinderhotel. Kind of like if Michael Bay did buffets.\n\nEDIT2: just to all my salty comrades telling me I\u2019m a \u201cscum cunt\u201d, that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud.

My son looks at me and says \u201cLike Pikachu?\u201d\n\nA bit of background.  A few months ago I discovered that Disney Now has the full run of all Pokemon episodes.  Like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  My son and I have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  My wife and I decided to get a Switch as a family gift for Christmas, along with Let\u2019s Go Pikachu.  For my son\u2019s birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a Pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  \n\nSo a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his Pikachu plushie.  Drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing Frostpunk and says \u201cDonder Shok!!\u201d while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  \n\nAs he runs away, clutching his plushie, all I can say to my wife was \u201cI think Pikachu\u2019s been teaching him some tricks\u201d.  She was not amused.  \n\n\n\nTL;DR - Pikachu taught my son Thunder Shock.  My wife is not happy about this development.  \n\n\nEdit:  My first gold!  Thank you kind stranger!\n\nEdit 2:  I know this may be more cute than traditionally TIFU, but I\u2019m rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn\u2019t too pleased at the time.

I stumbled inside and grabbed the shirt of an attendant to say \"Please stay with me. I don't think I'm okay\".\n\nMy body was shaking, my vision narrowed, and the pain grew nearer. \n\nThey gave me some water and talked with me to calm me down. Eventually, I felt well enough to go to my parent's house while my girlfriend was away just to be around someone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Going to the Hosptial:**\n\n  \nAfter half an hour at my parent's, nothing was better and I realized **I may actually be dying**. \n\nMy heart rate had NOT slowed down, my breath was shortening, and my chest felt like it was collapsing. I calmly looked at my mother and suggested \"Alright, I believe now is the time we go to the Emergency Room\"\n\nWe pull up to the ER and I stumbled inside the same way you would if you were drunk.\n\nI politely tell the receptionist \"I need to be seen in some short while, as I am having what must be a heart attack\".\n\nShe hands me a form to fill out, which I make it about a third of the way through. My mind isn't cooperating and I have no strength to write anything down. The portion where it asks for my name was chicken scratch, and I could not for the life of me remember my birthday. \n\nShe motioned someone to come collect me from the back urgently but I was too embarrassed to go with them without having properly filled out a simple form. \n\n\"No, no! Let me fill out another one.\"\n\nThey waited kindly with worried looks until I dropped the pen and said \"well we will just have to do this later\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In The ER**\n\n  \nWhen I get back to the ER I am writhing in pain. Nothing is lowering my heart rate. Some punk comes in asking if I would like to pay all-at-once for a discounted price or on a monthly basis. I ask him if we can \"please consider these things later. \n\nAbout two hours pass and a few injections of something or another later, they tell me I\u2019m fine but I have a fairly rare heart condition called [Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/), which had been excited by the stimulants and could have ended very poorly. \n\nI had taken pre-workout my entire life and had never known how close I always was to death. \n\nThe doctor explained, until my surgery, every time I take stimulants like that I am flipping a coin on my life. \n\nSo, while I am an unusual case, I encourage everyone to reconsider taking such supplements and to not be so concerned with properly filling out the welcome form when going to the ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: took pre-workout, went on a run, went to the ER, found out I have WPW and may have died of sudden cardiac arrest if I wasn't treated",

We worked this kid but could never get anything back, transported him to one of the best childrens' hospitals in the nation, and they couldn't get him back either. The only thing we heard at the time was that a week before he had been diagnosed with a heart murmur. \n\nI asked a cardiologist who worked with our dept. if he could find out what the kid had died from. Turns out the kid had WPW. Never diagnosed, never had presented. I asked him what the odds were on something like that. He said he'd get back to me. Sure enough, a few weeks later he let me know that of the people who have WPW, who are 13 years old, and of those, whose first presentation is cardiac arrest, this kid had been very roughly 1 in a million. \n\nSo you beat those odds, OP! The good news is that ablations are very effective in taking care of WPW.",

It\u2019s totally manageable and not nearly as deadly as they make it sound, but it sure is scary when it happens!",
            "Hey, I am a cardiology tech working in Canada, what you have is something you were born with, it is an extra electrical pathway your heart developed which bypasses the \"lub-dub\" and just makes all chambers contract at the same time. Like you said, very rare. This is what is known as a re-entry circuit and unfortunately it can happen with any early beat (everyone has early beats) that starts at the precise time. Stimulants will cause a higher chance of getting these early beats and thus putting you into that really high heart rate that made you feel so crappy. There are three ways of getting you out of it once it starts:\n\n1) your heart has another early beat at the precise time that gets you out of the reentry tachycardia\n2) you have cardioversion which is pretty much defibrillation but at a lower intensity \n3) you could always try a vagal maneuver which temporarily slows down the conduction enough to get you out of it\n\nMainly you'd just get meds to prevent the heart from being overly excited or you can get an ablation that burns the extra pathway\n\nPreworkouts aren't really that dangerous, it's just in special cases like these or when abused, then again all substances are harmfull if abused anyways\n\nCheers!",

What I was told, prior to his surgery, was that he could drop dead at any time.

I would recommend you try and get it corrected as soon as possible.\n\nFor those who are unaware, this is an extra passageway on your heart, that forms a small loop back to the heart. When your blood is pumping, and it hits that loop, it begins to cause a harsh fluttering effect that can be akin to 300 bpm. You are basically prone to feeling the effects of cardiac arrest, at random, until the problem is helped.\n\nFor your bonus imagination, look at your chest when you are done working out. You might notice you can vaguely see your heart moving at higher bpms. Now, imagine sitting or laying there, and seeing it do that much more clearly. It hurts, makes you want to pass out, vomit, cry, and typically gives you the feeling of pure panic, whether you want it or not.\n\nOn the positive side, this can be corrected with closed heart surgery through the femoral artery on both legs, using an electrical probe. They will have to stop your heart after you are knocked out. I was told that I have about a 3% chance of dying, a 20%chance of having a pacemaker, and if I'm lucky, no aftermath at all.

        "selftext": "Oooooh boy this is a big FU. I have been working on a cruise ship for the past 5 months. When you live with, work with, eat with, and do everything else with the same people every day for months at a time you tend to get pretty close to them. I was the bass player in a cruise ship band quickly made friends with the drummer, from Brazil. This was my first time working on a cruise ship and this has been a goal of mine since I was just a wee lad. 10 days from the end of my contract me and my drummer friend decided to go out in port and have ourselves a memorable day. Too many beers later it was time to get back to the ship. We, being crew, have a sharp deadline for getting back to the ship. The problem was we, in our drunken stupor, got a little too far from the ship. My friend and I made it back to the port with about 5 minutes to spare but that wasn't enough time to make it through customs and back to the ship. Of the two of us, I had more to drink. Therefore I was the one who had the genius idea to hop the fence and make a dash for the ship. Well the customs officials had a different view on how good an idea that was. The two of us hopped the fence and immediately got busted. The ensuing police debacle not only got us in trouble, but held up the entire cruise ship. The Captain came down onshore and scolded us before firing us on the spot. When you're fired off a cruise ship... You're fired. There and then. They packed our bags for us and threw them on shore as the ship left port. Fortunately I am an American citizen so the consequences for me were to buy my own flight home, but my best friend was handcuffed and escorted to the airport where he was sent home and told never to return. 10 days left... And I fucked it up. \n\nTL;DR I convinced my friend to break international immigration law because we were running a few minutes late and now he can never come back",

This dude jumped the railing (which is like 3 stories above water) and tried to swim away. He didn't escape and lost half his uniform lol.

You can probably find another hiring agent and find work through them or go through a line that hires directly.\n\nAnyway, I'll make you feel better by sharing some monumental TIFUs by former coworkers that got them fired.\n1) Was ported in Callao, Peru for a double-overnight with the town of Lima about a 30 min cab ride away.  We went to Miraflores that night and I partied out with some musicians, the other stage tech and a chef.  Callao doesn't have a cruise ship terminal so we docked at a seaport alongside cargo ships and tankers.  A few miles outside the port, there was a bar that catered to ship crew and the sound tech thought it would be fun to check that out after leaving Miraflores. Bad idea.\n\nThis was one of the sketchiest bars I've ever been to in an incredibly seedy part of town.  Despite being able to see our ship from the bar, we felt unsafe yet we continued drinking.  Bar was full of crew from other ships and a handful of weathered women that could only have been hookers.  The chef ends up with the cute one of the bunch and leaves with her.  We don't see him ever again after that.\n\nIt turns out that the girl took him back to a hotel quite far from the port and after doing the deed she robbed him while he slept!  He didn't speak a word of Spanish and conned several cab drivers until finally getting to the port several hours late for his shift. He was promptly fired and sent home.\n\n2)  One port day we were late in leaving Montevideo, Uruguay.  I didn't think anything of it as that happens from time to time.  The next day, I ran into an old friend from a previous ship who was a Spa manager.  He told me he was an emergency fill-in because the other Spa manager and an employee had just gotten fired.  We left the port late the day before because police were investigating a death in the spa.  Apparently, a passenger had a heat stroke in a sauna because the spa employee forgot to perform the routine checks!\n\nChin up sailor, you'll find yourself another gig!",

        "selftext": "So this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. Now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. And just before Sillybands took over as chief Tween Pimp Currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed \"locker artillery\". Basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. We would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and Paper Hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.\n\nEventually, things got out of hand. It became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. Heists were performed on teacher's desks. Books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. Students presented welts from Paper Hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. Rubber bands were contraband. It was a full-on Mad Max Magic School Bus adventure.\n\nHere's where the fuckup started. One night, I was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: The secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. Spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. I needed something aerodynamic. So, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. \"I'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?\" I thought to myself.\n\nLet me tell you.\n\nThe next day, I created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. With the inkwell loaded, I felt like a small, sexually frustrated MacGyver with intent to kill. On the bus, my friend (let's call him Neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. I obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. Neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). I aimed, pulled back and fired. All I saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before I heard an extremely sudden *crack*. I looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from Neo's head.\n\nMy parents had to pay for the window. Neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until Senior Year. The principal cracked down on Locker Artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. \n\nBut I still won that arms race.\n\nTL;DR: Sixth Grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. I upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. I was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.\n\nEDIT: RIP Inbox.

The nut fit nicely over the driver, like a reverse barrel. With three rubber bands, it could penetrate an entire pizza box with pizza inside, and still come out the other side. After discovering this, I swore to never use the weapon again lest something like your story occurred.\n\nEdit:\nFor research purposes only of course. And since many people's friends are asking. \nhttp://imgur.com/hiNkbg2",
            "It's probably too late, but I'm gonna write it out anyway.\n\nThe deadliest school supply weapon in my day was the pneumatic paper bullet gun.\n\nAll you need is one of [these type pens.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/03-BICcristal2008-03-26.jpg/1200px-03-BICcristal2008-03-26.jpg) The key design being that the hole in one end is smaller than the other.\n\nYou start by disassembling the whole thing. Toss the butt-cap, keep the tube and the ink cartridge. \n\nNext you make a super slimy, yet smallish, spit ball. You take that spit ball and put it in the big hole of your pen tube, put the small end exit side down on a desk, book, some kind of flat surface. Use your pen cart to tamp it down into the small hole end of the pen. It needs to be small enough to only fill the tip of the pen and be a consistent cylinder shape that can exit the pen tube.  It will squish out most of the spit and become pretty solid, and firmly lodged into that smaller hole of the pen tube. It takes some practice to consistently make them the right size. Once we'd figured out the right paper size, there were many many ready made dry paper blanks ready to be slobbered up.\n\nNext make a much larger spit ball. Large enough to completely fill in the entire width of the pen tube. Now, you have a tightly compacted yet tiny paper bullet wedged into the small end and a larger slimy spit ball wedged into the back end.\n\nPush the larger spitball through the tube with your ink cartridge, if done right, building up tremendous air pressure behind your small paper bullet until,  CRACK. The air pressure forces the smaller paper bulled from the small end of the pen tube with amazing speed and force. \n\nHope this is explained clearly enough, as this was a marvel of Jr. High engineering at the time.",

            "Wow! I love this story! We too had an arms race at my high school. First and foremost; yes it\u2019s weird but I lived in a dormitory in HS (Private School) and so we had a fun time pulling pranks, (most famously my [Crustacean Bus Station](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6mo33j/comment/dk35mlg?st=JDEROH2Q&sh=555b32db) prank)... anyways, my sophomore year we were really into air soft guns and would collect them. For three months we collected these and ran off into the woods in our evenings to have our fun. \n\nYeah, we proudly sported our welts, and the arms race got incredibly crazy as we began modifying our weapons. \n\nWe even had an automatic airsoft gun that we played \u201cABC\u201d with. What is ABC you ask? Well, you stand there without a shirt and they use the machine gun to spell out the ABC\u2019s on your chest. You were known in our circles by your letter. One legendary kid made it to Z and past so he was forever known as \u201c7\u201d and to this day our memories hold him in higher regard than the rest of us. \n\nEventually, the dorm staff caught a snitch who told on us. They rounded up every gun after a room search and piled them in the commons like books in Fahrenheit 451. It was amazing. There were 42 guns in total and when one of the dorm staff was pissed off, he slammed a gun on the table while he yelled and it fired a single B.B. across the room right at one of the dorms new Mac screens ($2,000) and cracked it completely, but the bullet wasn\u2019t done there, as it bounced off the screen and into a students mouth that was sitting at the computer. Luckily they didn\u2019t choke but just injected it, but there was a mix of horror and humor that I still haven\u2019t worked out in my heart as to which to feel about that moment. \n\nWe all split the cost of the computer fix and had detention for weeks.

            "Haha. This reminds me of something similar that happened to me. I always got in trouble on the bus(almost never in school) because we had a 45 minute ride home, it was miserable. \n\nThe bus driver made me and my friend sit in the front when I was in middle school. We weren't terrible kids or anything, probably standing up, being loud, stuff like that. One day after school my friend was already in our seat. He was standing there pretty much so I couldn't sit down(I don't think it was his goal to obstruct me from sitting it is just where he was). But I know he said something jokingly and I decided to give him, in my opinion, a very weak push.  I was just growing into a strong dude so maybe I didn't know my own strength, but I could have pushed him much harder. In my opinion the dude fell back WWE style(fake as shit) and hit the bottom glass pane and broke it.\n\nAnyways, the bus driver only heard the CRACK and looked dead at us. My friend straight ratted me out and put all the blame on me. I told the bus driver I tripped and fell into him. And my \"friend\" told her I pushed him. She told me I was paying and I said fuck off, I tripped, I'm not paying shit.\n\nI never paid. I can't remember if I got suspended of the bus or not. I think I did. \n\nTLDR I weakly pushed my friend on the bus. He(in my opinon) fake fell and broke/cracked the window.

            "I made a \"crossbow\"(more of a bow, honestly, but I had the dream of it eventually having a trigger mechanism) in the 12th grade. I disassembled a bic and got to work. I carefully dug a hole into the sides of the tube, creating a clean hole through the center. I then wrapped a rubberband around it top to bottom and put the cap on to hold the top. I originally planned on stuffing the bottom plug into place to hold the bottom end, but upon testing, putting any tension on it cause it to fly out. My solution was simple: cut that end of the rubber band. It reduced the leverage the band had on the plug, but severely increased the difficulty of assembly. I finally got it shoved in there and built a little sling out of paper which I folded into a small strip, then folded the ends towards the center so that they could be wrapped around the rubber bands and secured with a staple. \n\nWith the bow complete, I then worked on ammo. My solution was to straighten paper clips, creating an actual dangerous weapon. It is at this juncture that I should mention my own stupidity; I did all of this at school. It's a miracle I didn't get caught. When I finally got both ammo and bow complete to my satisfaction, a simple test fire showed that it couldn't pierce more than 5 pieces of paper, but had a pretty decent range. I wanted more, though. I had to push my creation to be able to stick into the ceiling reliably. The answer hit me in science class as I ran my finger nails across the table. They were those weird pvc tables some schools have. Turns out you can use them as sharpening stones. You might see where this is going. I sharpened a paper clip into a needle and shot it almost straight through the ceiling tile. Success.\n\nThen I made my mistake. I used a larger paperclip and got it down to a fine point. I prepared a shot and waited for the teacher to turn her back. Then I accidentally let do, shooting a five inch long piece of directly into my thigh. I managed to keep quiet because I didn't want to get in trouble, but the other kid at my desk wasn't able to keep his composure and shouted \"Holy shit.\"\nOf course, now the teacher had turned around and I grabbed the arrow and yanked it out, quickly stuffing both it and and the bow down my sleeve. The teacher came around(an older lady, sweet as can be) and started investigating the disturbance. I can't remember my excuse or exactly how I got out of it, but I can remember the searing pain. That shit fucking hurt. My interest in the weapon had disappeared and I gave it away to a buddy on the bus.",

            "You are reminding me of a story a family member of mine tells. She was down in the big city a few hours away from where we live, and stopped for lunch at a local famous restaurant. She was moving around some big items and was driving her white Ford pickup.  After lunch she hopped back in her truck and made it about 20 minutes down the road. A few things felt off to her about the truck, but just little things. It wasn't until she had to stop for gas that she noticed some junk in the bed of the truck that she hadn't had before. A quick check of the license plate, and sure enough, her key worked on some random other person's identical white Ford truck! She drove back to the restaurant and found the unwitting victim of her theft giving a police report.",
            "I've \"stolen\" my car before. I have a prius that has a mind of its own. I unlocked the car and got in and the alarm started blaring. I started the car and no matter what the alarm would just not shut off. So I called my dad and sped home. The thing about prius alarms are that they sound like British police cars. So as I was speeding home, *cars were pulling over out of my way.* I was so embarrassed. My dad was standing outside waiting for me, laughing the entire time. The real kicker is he got the alarm to stop in under a minute.",

            "I've stolen my own car before, sort of.   \n\nYears ago when I was younger, I had driven to a night club where there was very little parking.  But the Post Office across the street had a completely empty parking lot.  So I reasoned that the PO was unlikely to be using or enforcing (employee only) parking at midnight, so I parked there. A few hours later I came out of the club and my car had been towed (of course).  \n\nI got a lift with a friend to the impound lot.  When I got there, the gate was pulled closed but not locked and the security guard was sleeping in the guard shack.  So I basically pushed the gate open, found my car and drove it out.   Then, being 25 years old and a bit of a dick, I did a burn out and honked my horn to wake up the guard.  \n\nThat was over 30 years ago.  I've sometimes wondered if it is still accruing storage / impound fees.",

            "Years ago when I had an old POS Nissan pickup, I locked my keys inside by accident but I\u2019d done it so many times that I\u2019d worked out a system to pry back the door frame with some screwdrivers until I could pop the lock.  As soon as I finished I heard an \u201cexcuse me miss\u201d and turned around to see an amused RCMP officer who didn\u2019t know if I was a crafty owner or a really dumb thief. He\u2019d been enjoying the show from two stalls over the entire time. I showed him my ID and registration and we had a laugh and carried on our separate ways.",
            "I mean, as the concerned citizen, either option is bad. Either report it as stolen & wonder what kind of insane criminal you are, or conclude \"he must have been joking\" but then wonder that evening if you were actually serious & let a potential criminal go without doing anything.",

            "I can't remember if I've posted this before, but I was vehicle less for a little (car in the shop) so I was using my mom's car. Key fob, push start nissan altima. Went to the gym and worked out. Came out and was like alright need some gas! Drive about 7 minutes to the gas station where I open the center console to get my wallet out. Woman's wallet. Cool no big, my mom probably left it there. Then I notice that I can't find my wallet. Figure something isn't right so I check the name on the ID. Don't know who it is, fuck. I drive back to the gym, to see this huge MFer coming at me. I cracked the window and shouted,\" before you do anything, please give me a minute!\" Even though he was pumped up and ready to beat my ass, he obliges. I get out and explain my last 10 minutes and we look at where her car was parked vs mine. 2 cars down. He calmed down a bit, and his frustration then turns to the gf. \"This isn't the first time I've told her to not keep her spare key fob in the trunk!\" Apparently she didn't know the car doesn't lock with a key fob nearby so it doesn't get locked in. The guy and I had a cigarette to cool down while the police came and took our statements. Cops laughed and called a few more to come hear me tell my story. All in all things sorted themselves out, and the few more times I did go to the gym I had the guy say what's up to me and kinda laugh. My family lives to bring up that I've stolen a car before.",

It was a Jeep Wrangler with a soft top. I knew I could just unzip the back and crawl in. Before I started, I made sure to let the cashier know. \u201cHey I got locked out of my car and I\u2019m about to crawl in so just a heads up if you see me do that.\u201d It made her night",
            "Had a similar story, nearly shat myself. Borrowed my moms Volvo for some days, live in another town. Get the munchies and go to Burger king drivethrough, the car is marked with branding and very recognisable. Except one of my moms friends worked the drivethrough that day. She had never seen me and i've never seen her, and i dont share a surname with mom. On my way home a police car at fullspeed with sirens on flashes wildly as it passes me at speed, then does a 180 and burn up right behind me.\n\n\nSame story essentially, the irony was that they went to the Burger king and ticketed moms friend for a false police report tho (she made up some evil stuff in the call apparently)",

            "I once had to steal my own truck back from an auto shop. Took it to a chain muffler shop to get a quote on a new tailpipe as someone had rear ended me, snapped it off. I get called into the shop and the mechanic tells me how my vehicle shouldn't be on the road, that it is unsafe, etc. It wasn't and all I was missing is the rear sway bar (it is a 4wd that I take offroad). Ended up telling them I'll think about what to do, and came back at night and stole it back with my regular key (I always gave shops a crappy hardware store spare). It was a free estimate so I didn't owe them any money. They called the cops and I went down to the station to prove ownership and the \"free estimate\". Never had another call about it and drove that truck for another 5 years.",
            "One night, I got off work late, and was exhausted anyway bc 3 week old baby at home. Stop by the gas station, I pulled into a spot in front of the store. Go in, get what I need, come back out. \n\nI see this guy, with what I think is my car, unscrewing the gas cap. I start flying across the parking lot, yelling \u201cwhat the fuck do you think you\u2019re doing with my car?!\u201d Poor guy was totally confused and understandably a bit defensive. Probably some level of fear too. I get closer and start arguing with the guy that this is my car, what are you doing. \n\nAfter a moment, I start looking at the car. There\u2019s a car seat cover that I don\u2019t recognize, an energy drink in the console that wasn\u2019t mine. I start apologizing profusely as I remember that I hadn\u2019t parked my car here, but up at the front of the store. Ran to my car, jumped in and sped off, keeping an eye out for lights and sirens as I drove home.",

            "I was *busted* by the cops for \"stealing\" my 1991 pontiac firebird convertible.\n\nI had parked it on the street outside my apartment, and locked the car with the key in the ignition.\n\nHowever, I knew that it was possible to reach the release for the back of the soft-top by sticking my arm in through the side (having very thin arms helped tremendously!), lifting the fabric a little and literally pressing my arm in. To get the correct angle, I had to be on my knees.\n\nThat's when a cop car rolled up and the cops wondered what the hell I was doing.\n\nTo make matters worse, the car wasn't actually in my name, as I was around 22 and the insurance was way too high to have the car in my name. So it was in the name of a friend of my father, who lived in another town (insurance cost here is based on both the age of the owner and where the owner lives. A young owner living in Stockholm has the highest fee). And even worse, my father's friend was out of country working on some cruise ship somewhere.\n\nIn the end though, they were satisfied when I could name the apparent owner and give his address, and they could also see that the key was indeed in the ignition. I also mentioned some stuff I had in the trunk, then opened the car, and showed them the stuff in the trunk.",

            "I have a somewhat similar story. Years ago when I was around 20 years old started talking to a girl. Went out on a date and due to my work schedule (was on call) it looked like I was going to work at like 2 in the morning. So instead of dropping her off at her house and driving 45 minutes back home then coming back to the same area for work she let me sleep at her place. Mind you we had only been talking for a couple weeks and went out on our first date that same night which went well.\n\nSo we sleep in the same bed and me being the young horny dude I am I was probably dreaming about the stuff I would like to do with this attractive girl being that she was half naked sleeping right next to me. Next thing I know I wake up and my underwear and her blanket are soaked from having a wet dream. First time I've ever even had this happen and of course it's the first night I'm staying with this girl who I've not even had any sexual interaction with. I try my best to slip out of bed and go to the bathroom freaking out to see if I can clean myself up without her noticing. But of course she wakes up though because she's a light sleeper and I basically just explain what happened. \n\nTo my surprise she just laughed and said it was fine and proceeded to take the bed sheets and blanket to the washer and grab some new blankets. \n\nNever been so embarrassed in my life.",

I thought it was stolen or lost. It had been missing for close to 3 years. \n\nSo what happened. In the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. Simple enough i thought. \n\nNow with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. This is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. Not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. \n\nSeemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.\n\nAnd thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way Oh My God no fucking way. At this point im like wtf was that about. When i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.\n\nLIGHT BULB she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. \n\nHour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.\n\nGood to know it wasent a flat out no!\n\n\nTL;DR found a lost ring had bad timing GF thought i was propossing heart fell to floor hilarity insued.\n\nUpdate: texting with no thumb trying to keep up. Also i have learned how to spell wasn't!\n\nNsfw thumb\n\nUpdate 2: went for a walk with her after this happened and cut the side of my thumb off using  knife that happens to be very sharp!

        "selftext": "Obligatory this fuckup happened a few months back, but to be fair I did not realize the extent of the issue until today.\n\nSo back in June, as I'm sure you all remember, it had been a few months since any store in my area had been able to stock toilet paper of any kind. This was the kind of thing that was a big deal to most people, but not me. I had a plan. A secret trick up my sleeve that gave me an advantage over everybody else: Amazon. That's right, while these suckers were wrestling over individual rolls like Black Friday shoppers, I would be sipping cocoa on my couch and getting it all delivered right to my door.\n\nNow, I had actually stocked up on TP toward the beginning of the lockdown. However, I did not have any flushable wipes, and I was able to find a box of eight individual packs of Cottonelle Flushable Wipes for a pretty good price. I popped them in my cart, clicked \"buy now,\" and I never had to leave the couch. Win-win, right?\n\nA few weeks, maybe a month, after the wipes arrived and I began using them, I started noticing\u2026 a tingle. But not a pleasant tingle, more of an itch. A very very distracting itch. Like, an insanely overwhelmingly frustrating itch that will absolutely not go away unless I sit on the business end of a belt sander. Not something that is easy to deal with when you're standing in line at the bank. I had to fight my hand from instinctively twitching toward my agonizing butthole with every itchy pang, it must have looked like the drugs I had keistered were slipping out.\n\nAs luck would have it, right around the time I began experience symptoms, I was laid off due to COVID. My healthcare was employer-provided, and while I now know that they are continuing my coverage for a few more months, the whole layoff was pretty sudden and at the time I had no idea where my healthcare coverage stood. Furthermore, I didn't feel like an itchy asshole was a great reason to go to the hospital during an ongoing pandemic when 1. I don't want to catch COVID; second, I assumed I had just developed some kind of sensitivity to the chemicals in the wipes that would go away on its own; and C. I feel like every doctor in the country has more important things to do right now than look at my asshole. So, rather than seek the advice of a medical professional, I decided to just not do anything about it and hope it would go away. Smart right?\n\nFast forward to today. Four months after I purchased the wipes. Butthole as itchy as ever. Seriously considering seeking medical help at this point. I wake up in the middle of the night in great discomfort, and check my phone to see the time. 4 AM. I also have an email from Amazon about a recent order I placed. I open the email, and it reads as follows:\n\n>Greetings from Amazon.  \n>  \n>We have recently learned of a potential safety issue regarding the following product that our records indicate you purchased from Amazon:  \n>  \n>Cottonelle FreshFeel Flushable Wet Wipes for Adults, 8 Flip-Top Packs, 42 Wipes per Pack (336 Wipes Total)  \n>  \n>**Cottonelle has informed us that the product might contain bacterium, Pluralibacter gergoviae, which was detected during product testing.** More details, including how to determine if your purchase is impacted and what you should do next can be found in the following notification:  \n>  \n>[https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq](https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq)\n\nThis was an option I had legitimately never considered until I got this message. The very thing I had purchased to clean bacteria off of my ass had **contaminated my ass with bacteria.** I feel so betrayed. Also, super gross. Super, super gross. Time to go to the doctor.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 Bought flushable wipes so my butt would be clean. Wipes made butt angry. Months later, I find out that the wipes were contaminated with bacteria, and I might as well have been wiping my ass with leaves from the yard, and now I need medical attention. Cool.\n\nEDIT: please for christ's sake don't spend money on reddit awards for my butthole, if you want to make me feel better [donate to Jaime Harrison](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_harrison_fr_homepage_2019?refcode=MS_HP_FR_X_X_homepage_X__F1_S1_C1__X&recurring=auto&amount=25) and kick Lindsey Graham the fuck out of the Senate\n\nAlso for those concerned, I do now have a bidet attachment, got one a month or so ago. At the time I bought the wipes, due to the societal TP freakout, bidets were out of stock too. Rest assured that no more wipes will be purchased.\n\nDOUBLE EDIT, just to make it super clear for the (relatively small) number of you that still seem to be confused:\n\n* Donald Trump is a fat bald lazy racist bitch.\n* He's a stupid loser with no money and no friends.\n* He's a gross old welfare queen living off daddy's money and the taxpayer.\n* He's too dumb to even be a fascist correctly.\n* If you voted for Trump, or you are planning to vote for Trump, fuck you.",

Same thing can happen to your butthole.\n\nBest treatment? Bidets work well but what you really need to do is wipe gently, and apply some kind of barrier paste like OTC diaper rash cream. Give it a week and most peoples symtoms will clear up.\n\nIt can get more complex (underlying bacterial and or fungal infections) but a good colorectal surgeon can help you treat that. \n\nHope this helps!",

But first I just wanna say thank you to everyone who helped me see an embarrassing situation as something that would be a great story one day. I\u2019m happy that the most horrifying moment of my life could make some of you guys smile. I also want to say thank you to those who said I ripped off that one Friends episode. I might be one of the few people on the planet who hasn\u2019t watched Friends but I checked it out, and definitely laughed :) I was a little bummed out reading some of the comments about my boyfriend. I promise you all he\u2019s a really great guy and he was just in so much shock that he didn\u2019t react the best. I don\u2019t really blame him though. Anyways\u2026 On to the update!\n\nThe night my in-laws walked in on me, they were supposed to stay for dinner and then go back to the hotel they were staying at. After I was ahem\u2026 caught in the act, my boyfriend and them left and went back to their hotel. He said it was a very quiet car ride. When he got back a few hours later, we got into a fight where he questioned my motives and accused me of purposely getting caught to prove a point. I denied it and the argument ended there. He slept on the couch that night. The next morning I woke up and he had made breakfast for us. He apologized to me and basically explained that he was so embarrassed and in shock that he didn\u2019t know what to think. He said that he did appreciate the effort though, and that had his parents not been there with him, he \u201cwould\u2019ve jumped\u201d me. I apologized for surprising him at an inappropriate time and for not checking my phone. I then asked him what his parents thought about all of it. He told me that they weren\u2019t angry at all and that they decided not to come for dinner because they didn\u2019t want me to be uncomfortable and they thought it\u2019d be best to give us the night to sort things out. He told me that they did intend to come for dinner tonight which I told him I didn\u2019t think I was up for quite yet. He understood and called his mother to let her know. I didn\u2019t hear much of the conversation but it ended up with him handing me the phone saying \u201cShe wants to talk to you.\u201d As soon as I got the phone I started profusely apologizing and telling her that it wasn\u2019t my intention for them to see that. She just laughed and said \u201cI imagine it wasn\u2019t\u201d and said that embarrassing things happen, especially in front of family and that they would never hold something like that against me. But that I would never live it down. She then proceeded to tell me of the many times my boyfriend and his brother had walked in on them doing the dirty. Which was uncomfortable but kinda comforting. She then said that she and her husband were really looking forward to dinner and wondered if I\u2019d reconsider. I realized that I was going to have to see them at some point and that it would be shitty of me to not have them over after they drove all this way to see us. So I agreed. They came over, it was awkward. But after a few jokes about if the couch was steamed cleaned and if the adult movie I was watching was included in our cable package, everything went really well!\n\nTL:DR Boyfriend apologized, parents don\u2019t hate me.\n\nOriginal post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i59mtc/tifu\\_by\\_trying\\_to\\_surprise\\_my\\_boyfriend\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i59mtc/tifu_by_trying_to_surprise_my_boyfriend_and/)",

I got super high, was playing games with my friends when Bop It got brought up in conversation. So, my high ass turns to my girlfriend on the couch next to me and signed (without speaking) \"Did you ever play Bop It growing up?\" My girlfriend so innocently just signs back \"wtf is that?\"\nEdit: for those that don't know, Bop It is a speed and coordination toy from the mid 90s that requires hearing to play.\n\nGuys, it took me a good 20-30 seconds before I realized what I just asked my 100% DEAF girlfriend of 2 YEARS. The shame I felt. \n\nAnyway, I told the boys online, everyone had a solid laugh including my hellova good sport girlfriend. \n\nTL;DR I got high while playing video games w/friends when Bop-it was brought up in convo.

He lost his hearing in an accident when he was 2, so he didn\u2019t even remember being able to hear. One day my mother was outside cleaning the gutters and my grandfather was over. When she\u2019d been up there a while, my grandfather ran outside and told her the phone is ringing. She was waiting for a call, so she panicked and ran inside to answer it.

I think?\" Her being so nice just made me feel worse.\n\nThat's not the worst example though. I was once sitting next to the same girl in the school auditorium (we were both often taking part in the school productions) and another, relatively tall, girl sat in the row in front of her. The tall girl, worried she was blocking our view turned around and said \"Sorry, can you still see?\" Then realized she was talking to the blind girl, panicked and said \"Oh no.... You can't.\" Then realized what had just come out of her mouth, went bright red and turned around.\n\nBrutal.",

        "selftext": "So I'm a pretty average person all around, with the exception that I'm tall (6'4\").  I consider myself of average intelligence, average looks, average sense of humor, average dick size.\n\nReally the only other dicks I've seen are a) in porn, and b) a couple of buddies on a skinny dipping night.  In all cases I'm smaller.  I already know some comments are gonna be all \"But what about in the locker room?\" what locker rooms are you in that everyone is running around balls out naked?  My gym has individual showers and change areas, there's very occasionally someone getting changed in the common area, but I'm not staring at their junk, and yeah, every so often I see someone smaller than me, but that reinforced my viewpoint that I'm extremely average.  Okay, back to the story.\n\nRecently I got divorced, I had been with my ex wife for 16 years.  She was my first, and the only woman I'd ever been with.  Whenever we used condoms I'd always dread it.  I mean, all guys say the same thing about them right?  There's no feeling, difficult staying hard, everyone hates condoms.  I just assumed that was the universal truth, and it never occurred to me to investigate further.  Every time I had to put one on I'd start to go flaccid, apologize, and work really hard to perform.  Sex was bad, often way more work than it was worth.\n\nWell, recently I met a woman on Tinder.  She has more experience than I do.  Before meeting she asked about my size and I answered honestly, I'm super average.  She said that's cool, and we went on a date.  At the end of it we hooked up, and there I am trying to put on a condom, same thing as usual happening, struggling to roll it down, starting to go flaccid, getting embarrassed, when she points out that apparently I'm incorrect, not average, and am wearing the wrong sized condoms.  I wrote it off, I thought she was just being polite and trying to give me an ego boost to help be not feel so bad.  At our next encounter she handed me a larger condom.  Holy fucking shit.  What the fuck.  I no longer feel like I'm about to be swung into battle by an enraged Gimli.\n\nYes, I recognize the humble brag, but what a fucking waste of 16 years.  I'm more pissed about that, then I am 'happy' about my dick size.  I'm elated about this problem being fixed, and want to jump for joy and tell my friends, but who can I possibly tell without sounding like a giant bragging douche?  Nobody, so instead I'm telling you, I'm fine with sounding like a douche to you.\n\nTL;DR - Wasted 16 years having terrible sex cause I was wearing condoms that were too small.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit - A lot of people are reading this as though I'd never had sex without a condom, which isn't the case.  My ex wife was on and off birth control for a myriad of reasons.  When she was on all was good, when she was off I was in a frequent battle with the Scranton Strangler.",

            "Man I feel you. Something like this happened to me, but in my case it was not 16 years, I realized when I was about 21. In fact it happened twice. I don't know if it's the same in your country, but in mine, you go to a pharmacy/drugstre to buy condoms. However, there they usually only have regular size, and XL (L doesn't exist, probably because of marketing).\n\nIn order to buy bigger condoms you have to go to a sex shop, and I had never been into one, so it didn't even cross my mind.\n\nI had always used those XL sizes that pharmacies sell. But I always struggled to put them on, I always tought that I was just clumsy, and that feeling my dick opressed was the normal thing. Of course around 20 y/o was when I was the most sexually active, so when 4 different girls told me that my dick was thick, and that probably I should buy bigger condoms, I started taking it seriously. As you said, at first I thought they where just saying it because I would like it. \"She probably says that to every guy.  \n\n\nBut when I gave it the cance, I tough \"Holy shit! so this is wha I've been missing! Now it's way easier and the sex feels really great in comparison! This is definitely my size.\"  \n\n\nFast forward about 4 years. Sex is good, but sometimes the condom pressures my dick hard enough for me to lose my erection fast. So I think, what the hell, I don't think that's the case, but I will give it a try\". I bought a small box of the biggest size they had in the sex shop and oh fuck, it happened again. I've been using the wrong size. Don't get me wrong, the last ones weren't nearly as uncomfortable as the first ones, but this was clearly an improvement.\n\nI won't deny that realizing that my dick is actually really big has boosted my ego, but yeah, it has a little bit of a downside when you don't know it.\n\nAbout the \"Locker room\" thing. I've been doing sports all my life, mainly martial arts, and its not uncommon (at least in my country) for communal showers. We all see each other naked. However idk why this isn't mentioned when this is asked: When people are naked in locker rooms, THEY ARE NOT ERECT.  You cannot judge a dick's size if its not erect. In fact, even though I have a thic dick, when I'm not erect I'm on the small side of the locker room. If anyone where to judge my penis for what they saw there, they would get the wrong impression. So yeah, dick comparison is not something that can be done.",
            "Sex ed STILL doesn't cover this!  Condoms really are NOT \"one size fits all\".\n\nAlright... so MySize condoms mostly figured this out.  2.37 is the golden rule.\n\nA penis not a regular cylinder, it's more oval, so just measuring your penis from side-to-side isn't important.  The circumference is the key factor here.  That's the distance around the penis at the widest point.\n\nYou'll need a tape measure wrapped around the widest point, or just wrap a strip of paper around your erect penis and mark it and hold against a regular ruler.\n\nDivide that circumference by 2.37.  Get a condom as close to that width as possible.  \n\nCondom widths are not stated on the box (which is basically criminal, IMHO).  You need to look them up online:\n\nhttps://www.condom-sizes.org/condom-size-chart/condom-size-chart\n\nThe standard for stating \"width\" is to lay a condom flat.  So a 2\" wide condom would rest on a 4\" circumference oval but with no stretch at all, which isn't good.  Dividing by 2.37 targets 15.6% stretch of the latex, found to me the median \"sweet spot\".  This seems to be a consensus for both comfort and safety.  It's a guideline/starting point.  Different condom materials do stretch differently.  \n\n[MySize/OneCondoms](https://www.onecondoms.com/pages/myone) has custom-fit condoms.  They go by length and circumference (girth) and sell exact fits based on actual dimensions rather than vague, useless brand names.\n\nMissized condom use does tend to increase the occurrence of slippage, leakage, or breakage, as well as being uncomfortable and leading people to believe that's just the way they are.\n\nLength is not actually that important, since any extra just doesn't get unrolled that far and thus the mfgs are pretty generous with the length.  In the rare case where the condom is too short for a man, you're probably talking like >8\" and it's pretty unlikely you'd be engaging penetration further than that anyways.  We do like to protect exposed skin but, well, everything else in that area is exposed to some degree.",

            "NSFW ANSWER\n\nI had a similar situation as you for my first time in a condom. I had bought regular size rubbers for a date that I one was going to end in us hooking up. When it came time to wrap it up, it felt like the damn thing was squeezing the life out of me, I felt absolutely nothing and it was probably a site to see as I tried to navigate her lady parts. I would push up and miss or simulate a bird ramming into a window, simply because I couldnt feel a damn thing. Eventually I lost the stiffy and it was game over, she was pretty understanding of it. Next time, put on a magnum and it fit perfectly.\n\nNow the regular ones fit right, go figure lol.",

            "You go, man!  \n\nSo you know, the 'locker room' comment can only be explained by an old man like me.  Prior to the 1970's, high schools had locker rooms with group showers (no curtains) and the toilet stalls did not have doors.  50% of the locker room bathrooms had urinal troughs (like you see in seedy old bars or if you travel to rural areas of the former Soviet Union).  Everyone saw everyone naked.\n\nFailure to 'suit up' for gym (change to shorts and a T shirt) and then strip and shower before getting redressed to go back to classes either earned you a detention or dinged your whole semester grade down a letter.  In those days, there was no 'health class.'  The lectures about hygiene, as well as the four food groups, came from a big guy with a crew cut and a beer gut.  (e.g.,  \"What in the Sam Hill is wrong with you?  Do you WANT to stink and get zits like that Baker kid whose Mommy writes notes so he doesn't have to climb the knotted rope?  DEODORANT Johnson!  Where is your deodorant?  How are you gonna get a date smelling like that?\")",

            "Trojans got smaller. I started dating someone a year ago and it was the first time I had used condoms after getting out of a 6 year relationship with someone who had an IUD.

I got sick of of the randomness and went to a different brand for a few months.

She works for a website development company writing code and such. I'm an essential worker, with bright and early days and a 21:00ish bedtime.\n\nCue about 3 months ago, her boss issues \"Crunch\" for all devs. She has been working 10 to 14 hour days Monday - Friday. Naturally, she has been hard at work and our personal lives took a bit of a step back. We would still do things together during the weekends, but not as often.\n\nOn to last night, we were watching a bit of some bullshit show on Netflix. It was really boring so we went right to the \"chill\" part of things. And this is were things took a wrong turn.\n\nHorny brained me decided it would be a fantastic idea to tickle my dangerously ticklish wife (horny brained me is an idiot), so I tickled. She yelped and (deservedly and unintentionally) headbutted me right across the face. As I'm laughing and holding my face, I notice she went pale. I look at my hands, blood. So I head to the washroom.\n\nAs I'm cleaning my face I notice my lip is slightly lower than it should be so I turn it inside out to find a gaping hole near my two front teeth. So off to the emergency room we go.\n\nShamefully explain to the attending what happened. She laughs. I get 2 stitches inside my mouth and am told to not eat anything hot or solid for the next 24 hours.\n\nWhen we get home she looks at me and says: \"You still horny?\". Me: \"Yup\". Good times...\n\nTL;DR: Horny brained me tickled my wife. Ended up with stitches in my mouth.\n\nEdit: Spelling.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the awards and upvotes! Y'all are amazing!\n\nEdit 3: Some people asked what was the show. I'm not sure on the English name since the show is in Turkish. Translating it directly from my native language it would mean \"The Guardian\". Hope that helps!\n\nEdit 4: Thanks again everyone! Did not expect this post to blowup the way it did! ",

        "selftext": "TIFU, that actually happened about 2 weeks ago. I needed to run into Walmart really quick on a Saturday. It's always busy on weekends so I parked pretty far away and decided to walk instead of try to find a close parking spot. I'm a female in my 20's, I was by myself. I ran in, grabbed what I needed and was out within about 20 minutes.\n\n\nWhen I walked out to my car I got in and a male in his mid-30s knocked on my window and let me know that my tire was flat.\n\n\nI got the creeps because I've heard plenty or horror stories of weird ways guys lure women out and grab them, but I wanted to check. I keep mace on my car keys so I made it obvious that I was holding my mace as I did. Sure enough my rear passenger tire was completely flat to the rim. He offered to help me change it, I said it was okay, that I would call AAA but he offered again and he seemed nice enough, so I accepted and said thank you.\n\n\nAs he was changing my tire, he told me he saw me in Walmart and then asked me a lot of questions like how old I was and if I had plans, a boyfriend, and so on. I deflected most of them but I did tell him I had a bf and that my friends were expecting me. I noticed he had a gas can towards the front of what I assume was his car.  I asked if he ran out of gas and he said yes but he forgot his wallet at home. (Now looking back, I'm wondering why he'd be in Walmart without a wallet).\n\n\nIt seemed like he was fishing for me to offer to give him a ride which of course I would never do. But I did give him a little money towards gas and he insisted on trying to get my information so we could meet up and he could pay me back. I said no thank you, a good deed for a good deed and I left it at that. As soon as my tire was done I got in the car and left.\n\n\nWhen the tire shop opened during the week, I went to get my tire fixed thinking it was simply a flat, but it turns out there were three intentional stab marks in the sidewall of my tire.\n\n\nI'm pretty sure this was not a coincidence and I think having my mace, keeping my distance, and saying people were expecting me saved me from something very terrible. I normally avoid Walmart at night, but this was broad daylight. \n\n\nTL;DR: TIFU by trusting a strange man to change my tire, when it turns out he was the one that stabbed my tire and was probably going to try something shady if I had been more naive. For all the ladies reading this, don't be naive, stay in your car and call AAA.\n\n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE!!! \n\nI feel like I'm at an award show! Thank you kind strangers for all of the love and awards, I'm overwhelmed with how much attention this post got! I tried reading through most comments but I'm going to address the most common replied here.\n\n\n\nI felt like TIFU was an appropriate thread because I feel like I was too nice and didn't want to offend the guy, I'm not going to ever feel that way again!\n\n\n\nI went to the police today, the officer I spoke with said something similar has recently been reported at this particular Walmart so he is sending my info and description to the seargent of the precinct in charge of that area. I should be expecting a call from him. \n\n\n\nMace=pepper spray. I should definitely look into the legality of carrying a midevil mace though \ud83d\ude1c\n\n\n\nI actually do know how to change my tire, put on chains, check my oil etc. I even have changed my own alternator and brake pads! This particular day I was in a hurry and already ready to go see my friends so I didn't want to get dirty. I have roadside assistance, so I figured I might as well use that.\n\n\n\nTo the people saying this is fake, I really wish it did not happen. There is no point in lying to all of reddit, I simply wanted to share my story because I really feel that had I been more naive, I might not be here today. I was going to post a pic of my tire but I don't think I can since I didn't post this as a picture type of post.",

Personally if I see someone who's car is broken down I'll offer to help but if someone refuses the help I'm out of there. If someone is persistent you should see them as a threat because something is up. In the future the best thing you can do is ask him to leave and if he does anything that seems out of character you fucking scream and attract as much attention as possible. You are never overreacting because getting that attention and putting him on the spot may very well save your life.",

I showed her where the hole was and explained where and how much it would take to plug it. I was really happy to be able to help someone out who needed it. \n\nIt makes me mad that people take advantage and do things like this that cause people to be jaded to help out to receive it.

If you don't know anybody that can teach you watch a youtube video, make sure your vehicle has the right equipment (More than likely your car  already has it. A cheap portable air compressor that plugs into your car isn't a bad thing to have either.), and spend half an hour practicing swapping a tire out.

I told her to call AAA to get a tow but I would be down to get her since due to Covid, they were not allowing passengers in their trucks.  Plus, with the storm that was hitting, the car wasn't going to get towed back to town till the next day.  \n\nAs I was heading down there, she called again that the guy had tapped her window to 'make she she was okay' and when she told him that I was on my way. he got even more upset and stormed off. finally leaving all together.\n\nI showed up about five minutes later and the tow truck fifteeen after that and then we headed home.\n\nTurned out the starter had crapped out on her.",

            "Life Pro Tip: I have often been that person to stops to help when someone has a problem on the road (not the tire slasher guy). I've been doing it for years. There are safety issues on both sides when it comes to creepy or dangerous people. When I stop I take a picture of the car with plates and text it to my SO with a note that I'm stopping to help. The picture has the location I've stopped at embedded and my SO knows that. I then offer whatever assistance I can. If the person is weary of my intentions I pull out my drivers license and tell them they can take a picture of me and my license and text it to someone they trust. I cover my address with my finger but have my name visible. If that doesn't make them comfortable I just offer the number for a set of tow companies / etc. in the area or to call for them. If they are a hazard on the road or at risk I'll call the local cops or patrol and let them know the description of the car and the location of the breakdown so they can check on them. I find it sad that there has to be so much fear around. \n\nLPT2: Carry a road safety kit! Modern cars are awesome and cell phones are great - but things happen and there are dead spots.",
            "Pro tip - even if you never plan on changing your own tire, go to any local store that sells tools and spend 15-20 bucks on a 25\u201d breaker bar for lug nuts and and a deep socket that matches the lug nuts for your wheels. \n\nIf anyone approaches you when you have a flat, grab the breaker bar and be like \u201cI\u2019m good\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also perfect for college kids on campus when they aren\u2019t allowed to have protective weapons.",

            "I once left my keys at home and the call system to our apartment was not working. My phone was dead and I could not contact my husband. We had just moved to a new country and I did not know his number by heart. I was waiting and a guy came out of our building and I asked if they lived in the building thinking he can let me on my floor, but he said someyhing about not living there and only using the car park in the basement. And then he said he has a coworker who lives in the building and to come with him to get the keys just around the corner. I would not go with a stranger, declined and kept waiting for someone to come out or in who lived on the same floor. He waited with me the whole time while people came and went. He seemed very helpful but in hindsight he could have phoned his coworker or went and got the keys by himself. Also if he was using the carpark to work why did he just wait for over an hour. In the end, after it was very late , a group of us found someone who lives on my floor and got in. I just thought people in this country was nice. But a little later I saw him while on the bus, he definitely was not mentally healthy or seemed like he had a job or even a home. It gave me the creeps that he tried to take me around the corner to posing to help me",
            "In the zodiac (and I assume this really happened) he flashes his lights behind a woman to get her to pull over. She does, and he says that something is going on with her tire and offers help. She accepts and he loosens her lugnuts. The wheel comes off later and he offers her a ride, saying \"I guess it was worse than I thought\". In his car he says he's going to murder her.  \nYou legitimately might have met a serial killer or rapist.",

            "So creepy. I don\u2019t hesitate to make small talk with other people nearby if I feel like someone is watching me or following too close. I live in the south where people tend to be more nosey/friendly, maybe that makes it easier. But don\u2019t be afraid to ask another person or couple walking past to stick around in case you need extra help or something. As soon as you say you had a flat tire and this guy is being really helpful (and give them a look) most people will get it. Nothing foils a creep\u2019s plans like multiple witnesses!",

Thanks for the warning story, stranger!",
            "This doesn't sound like a TIFU at all, sounds like you actually saved yourself. That's a pretty terrifying encounter. I wouldn't have thought of this on the spot, but thinking about it now, maybe you could've told him you don't have a spare?",

Also, thank you for having the courage to open up and share your experience, a reminder that we all need to constantly watch out for creeps like this. \n\nDoes your Walmart have cameras in the parking lot? If so, make sure to mention this when you\u2019re filing your police report. And yes, do file one. Doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s been 2 weeks. Call and talk to Walmart security/loss prevention as well, tell them what the dude looked like and where you parked. You likely aren\u2019t his first (or last) victim. \n\nGeneral PSA: before accepting help from a good samaritan, call a friend and keep them on the phone while that person is helping you. Tell them exactly where you are and let yourself be heard doing so by the helper. If the person offering help becomes agitated or fucks off, you\u2019ll know their intentions were not pure. \n\nStay safe everyone!",

            "I'm an old dude now, but when I was younger I would ALWAYS stop and help someone who appeared in need. Tires, batteries, overheats; what-have-you. I am good with cars and didn't mind getting dirty to help someone out; the whole karma thing, you know? It is awful that we now as a people are so fucked up that you can't even trust to someone to help you anymore...",
            "Not the same thing but sort of similar story. There were 2 stop signs on the road from the center of town to my parents\u2019 house, and they happened to be within ~300ft of each other. The  road the stop signs were on did not have a shoulder to pullover as it had a deep trench/creek on one side and a hill on the other.\n\nAfter stopping at the first stop sign, I go to accelerate. I hear this \u201cthud thud thud thud\u201d. For sure there is something wrong with my front right tire. It\u2019s pitch black, probably about 1am and I\u2019m still miles from home (note: I am probably 18 years old). I think to myself I will stop at the next stop sign to check instead of in the center of the road. \n\nAs I pull up to stop sign #2 I get the horrible pit in my stomach. I go to open the door and hear my dad\u2019s voice in my head telling me I should not get out here, something seems weird here. I accelerate from the second stop sign, pull over about .5 mile further. Get out to check to ensure I\u2019m not riding on the rim or something. And taped to my tire with duct tape is a ziploc bag full of sand. It was like a long strip of tape with two cross shapes on my tire with a section that was perfectly double taped so it could fly around a bit and then the ziploc bag. It must have been laid, sticky side up, on the road at the first stop sign. \n\nI was scared at the time and I\u2019m still scared now. Had I gotten out to check who knows what would have happened. I likely would have left the keys in the ignition and the car running.. I would have been looking at my tire that was literally inches from a 7ft deep trench thing. Ugh, yikes. I cried the whole way home. Should have taken the weird little bag thing to the police. \n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019m so grateful for how anxious my dad is as a person, it was his anxiety and multiple safety lessons that told me not to get out.",
            "Go talk to the security staff at Walmart. That have obscenely good security cameras covering the entire parking lot. If this guy slashed your tires, the police should be made aware. He WILL do it again to someone else.",
            "Ask Walmart to check the security cameras and get his plates if he is on camera stabbing tires, it would save future victims.",
            "I would report this to the police, just in case he is doing this a lot and taking women. Could just give a description, his whereabouts, car description and evidence that the tyre was slashed, they\u2019d at least file a report, just in case. Very glad you\u2019re ok.",
            "I\u2019m a guy who stops anytime I see a car broken down (male or female). I always ask if they want help and if I hear no once I tell them good luck and leave, but if they accept my help I NEVER ask personal questions such as relationship status, age, or even their name. I keep 100% of the conversation about the vehicle.\n\nI had one time I gave a women a ride to a gas station, and her friend stayed behind and I let her take a picture of my drivers license as a precaution. Not a fool proof plan but the point is a guy shouldn\u2019t be offended by women taking precautions.\n\nSorry this guy was a creep. Do your best not to be jaded but I understand where you\u2019re coming from. Trust your instincts. Better you offend some guys ego then become a victim.",
            "The ole gas can and \"I forgot my wallet routine.\"  There was a guy by my work that did this same shit. He would come dressed in nice clothes and do this near the restaurants across the street. I could see him doing it from my work window. He did it all day long to the restaurant patrons.. I called him out when he came up, really stealthy like, as I was getting in my car. I laughed and said \"yeah right, I see you do this everyday.\" The funnier thing is, We ended up running into each other around town. Lol. He would have a full blown Kramer moment(the guy kinda looked like Kramer) and shake at the knees and run the other direction. It was getting funnier until I ran into him and he looked liked absolute shit. I guess the meth finally caught up to him.",
            "You did well. \n\nThis is another reason to \"park with the herd\" instead of parking on the outer part of the lot. \n\nWhen you separate yourself from the other vehicles, you stand out and that makes you a potential victim. \n\nML",
            "This is actual nightmare fuel.",
            "My first thought was that he had let the air out of the tyre so he could \"help\" you out. It's terrible that someone genuine offering to help out will be seen in the same way, or that chatting to a cute girl/guy and asking for their info can be seen as you trying to kidnap them. It's all down to freaks like that.",

            "You didn't fuck up, you were alert and avoided a very bad experience.",
            "That is absolutely terrifying.\n\nI feel bad because I have a tendency to help people if they look like they need help. I remember last year pulling over to help a younger woman on the side of the road (I\u2019m 27), as I got out of my car she zoomed over to her door and said \u201cit\u2019s ok I\u2019m calling CAA you can go\u201d. I noticed that she was scared so I apologized for frightening her and got back in my car.\n\nI don\u2019t blame her at all to be honest.\n\nMy best advice for people who like to help, please do not press forward if someone declines your assistance.",
            "Man, I hate that these dudes do this and make it hard to be a decent human. Glad you stayed safe and were vigilant. I\u2019ve got three teenage girls I\u2019m preparing for life and this is a lesson I wish I didn\u2019t have to teach.",

            "Sadly, yes, this was a TIFU. It's just not a good idea to interact with strangers. Twenty years ago or so, I was in Florida on a business trip. I was in a rental car on a two-lane highway when a mid-afternoon tropical downpour suddenly occurred. I saw some poor devil hitchhiking on the side of the road, getting utterly drenched. Even as I pulled over to pick him up, my brain was telling me this was a bad idea. \"You've got a wife and kid who depend upon you! You can't be picking up strangers!\" ...but I did it anyway.\n\nThe guy said he was going to his job in an orange grove about fifteen miles up the road, but I could just drop him off on the highway. \"It's raining like crazy, man,\" I said. \"I'll take you right to where you're going.\"\n\nAs we're cruising along in the deluge, we're talking a little. The hitchhiker is saying some racist stuff and some vaguely criminal stuff, like how bad the cops are in this county. Not feeling good about my passenger. I noticed he had a huge bandage on his left forearm. It looked professionally done, like you'd get being treated at a hospital, but it was a bit grungy from wear. To make conversation I asked him how he hurt his arm.\n\n\"So, I went to kill my cousin...\" he began, shaking his head and rolling his eyes. \"I could see him in his kitchen window doin' the dishes, so I went up and put my pistol right through the window...but the busted glass cut right through my tendons!\" (He's saying this like, \"Can you believe my shit luck???\")\n\n\"My three-fitty-seven drops right in his sink!\"\n\nI have no memory of what I said in response. A little while later the guy said, \"Never got it back, either.\"\n\nWe come up on the turnoff to the orange groves. It's still raining like crazy. He again offers to get out on the side of the highway... but I had told him I'd take him right to where he was going, and a man has to keep his word. If you say you're gonna do a thing, you do it, right? So, we pull off the little highway and then I'm driving down these dirt lanes between rows of orange trees. There's nobody in sight. It's the middle of nowhere, and I've got a potential murderer in the car with me.\n\nHe directed me to a small warehouse where I left him. He kind of grunted his thanks, and that was that.\n\nIf he'd killed me it would've been my own fault for stepping into harm's way. Like OP did when she accepted that \"help\" from a stranger. I wish it wasn't this way, but it is this way.",

I zoomed through the chores so I could spend a couple of quality hours on my hobby.\n\n\nMy hobby is model painting and for my recent 40th my amazing wifey got me an air brush and a compressor to run it. I tootled around with it for a while before realising that the air brush and compressor were different makes so I needed an adaptor to make them work together. I found one online and duly purchased it.\n\n\nJust a short while later I received an angry call from my wifey wanting to know why I was looking at niche porn\u00a0 when tonight is date night. She was quite upset and asked why when she went on Google during her lunch, the most recent searches were for \"1/2 inch female nipples\", \"nipple enhancers\" and \"hose extensions\".\n\n\n\"You see honey, the screw on part that sticks out the compressor is called a nipple and it's only 1/4\" when I have a 1/2\" airhose to attach to it so I need a half inch female nipple adapter to connect the two... Yes that is a silly name... no, your nipples are perfect...yes I'm sure, I love you too.\"\n\nUPDATES: just to answer the regular questions. \n\nI was painting models from the fellowship of the ring and finishing their bases off. \n\nNo, my wifey has no issue with me looking at porn. She just was concerned I was looking at something to do with nipple resizing and that I only liked a specific type of nipple. She got self conscious and worried so phoned me in an angry and upset panic. \n\nYes my wifey is self conscious about herself. Show me a part of a lady we guys don't sexualise and you'll finally have found the part of a woman's body that they don't have hang ups about. \n\nNo she wasn't snooping through my search history, Google just brings up our last 5 or so things we searched. \n\nYes I know there are other ways to share calendars and the like. I'm 40 so not interested in learning new apps or functions, this works for me and that is fine. \n\nFor those who felt calling my wife by her nickname was cringy, that's something I really hadn't considered before. Now that you've made me see it in that light I can realise I should have wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey. \n\nDate night is my idea. Since I work shifts I make sure and put aside time just for the two of us, it's one day every 3 weeks. \n\nDate night was great, thanks for the well wishes. We played a couch coop game on the console for 8 hours, chuckled together at the comments and got a ruler out as one of the comments suggested. Twas a fun and precisely measured evening for all. \n\nTL;DR the correct technical term for the metal coupling adaptor I needed for a compresser was a 1/2 inch female nipple, leading to Google search confusion.",

Because of this every time I would go to a certain NSFW website I would type the link into a Discord (basically the new Skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. I only send the links to him while it said he is offline. I did this so my Chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website I decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. I would then click on the link of the website through Discord and delete the message. Little did I know that my friend has Discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. He basically had an alert for every time I masturbated.\n\nSo after I had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these NSFW links in the middle of the day. I start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. I told him about the whole process I go through just to get to a website. After that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on Chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. After more laughing we moved on.  \n\nI'm glad to know about incognito mode though I will probably keep doing it has I have been because I'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   \n\n\nTL;DR: I have been sending NSFW links to my friend on Discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search.

        "selftext": "This happened earlier today. So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I'll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I'll rest for 3 minutes. I'll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I'm feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. \"I can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds\". So I go and I'm feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I'm feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I'm struggling. Like I'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but I'm going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I'm seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. Lecture still sucked after that. \n\nTL;DR Tried going for Olympic gold in breath holding. Failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall. \n\nEDIT: A word \n\n",

            "Reminds me of a related story but mine was unintentional stupidity. In 7th or 8th grade I was in biology class. Bored out of my mind and really tired. See my grandfather was the kind of person that if you're not early you're late. And he drove us to school. I used to get to school before the teachers got there. Hell, once I got there and the doors into the school **were locked**.\n\nThat day was one of those days. I was tired as usual and not interested in the lecture about cell membranes. I could not keep my head up.\n\nSo I rested my head on my hand. It felt better. Cue a few minutes of this and I start to get woozy. Ignore it, assume I'm still tired.\n\nNext minute my vision is blurring. Fuck. Suddenly my vision turns into the white noise on a tv and I can't see a damn thing. First time this has happened so I'm freaking out but remaining still. I lift my body up from resting and am at full attention.\n\nVision comes back and the teacher is looking directly at me. Finally she asks \"are you ok? You don't look so good.\"\n\nI reply no I don't feel well so I get sent to the nurse. I lay down until my mom shows up. I feel 10 times better. Nurse and mom asks me what happened and I explain that I was resting on my hand.\n\nShe looks at me and says \"where did you place your hand?\". I point to my neck. I basically cut my circulation by doing that and almost blacked myself out. \n\nMom is disappointed that she was called out of work for this. But I got an unintentional biology lesson out of it.",
            "One time I was super tired and had math first period. I had taken a caffeine pill in the morning to help, then I forgot I took it and took another. I totaled out at 500mg of caffeine in an hour and a half, in pill form, and I skipped breakfast.\n\nSo fast forward to math class, I'm sitting at my desk still barely awake, and my hand starts shaking back and forth while I'm trying to do a worksheet. I can't stop it, so I just give up and sit there for a while. A minute later (this part was relayed to me after the fact) I was having a seizure on the floor. Next thing I remember is EMTs trying to give me an IV while I'm losing my shit. First ambulance ride and I didn't have to do the worksheet. 6/10 overall.",

For added realism, I wouldn't stop until she let go. \n\nOne slow day in class when the class was in a playful mood, we demonstrate. She force chokes me from across the room and I'm giving it  my all. She wasnt letting go but i stayed with it.

        "selftext": "Posting here by suggesting from AITA.\n\nLast week my (24F) boyfriend (28M) and I got into an argument about which one of us puts in the most effort to keep things adventurous sexually. He argued that 90% of the time, it\u2019s him. I told him that I didn\u2019t think that was true and he responded that not once in the 3 years we\u2019ve been together, have I ever caught him off guard sexually. I told him that he was gonna eat his words and the next time I proposed sex, it would be a surprise. \n\nNow, I knew that he was going to be expecting something after that so I decided today would be the best day to do it. The reason being was that his parents were coming to visit from out of town and when they do, I\u2019m way too stressed out to even think of sex so I knew he wouldn\u2019t be expecting anything. He told me that he would be home from work at 4 and they would be arriving at 7ish. Perfect, that would give us some time to do the deed, clean up, and then have ourselves a little secret for when the in-laws visit. So I set myself up on the living room couch (which was a clear view from the door) wearing only a pair of heels. I decided to put some porn on the TV (which I never typically watch) and touch myself to it so when he came in he would surely be surprised. I had my head tipped back when the door opened and all I heard were gasps. I looked up and stood there was my boyfriend and his parents. I flipped over and scrambled for a blanket to cover myself and heard the door slam. I checked my phone and saw that my boyfriend had texted me that his parents had left earlier to avoid traffic. He came home a few hours later and was extremely angry and is convinced I did this to get back at him for saying I don\u2019t try hard enough. Dinner with the in-laws is going to be a bit awkward. \n\nTL;DR Boyfriend said I don't surprise him enough. Decided to surprise him naked, watching porn, and playing with myself in the living room.

She forgot to give the permission, spoke on the phone for 15 minutes and then went to watch tv. Then she started to wonder where the dog was. The poor guy was still sitting in the kitchen, drooling and waiting for permission to eat.",

They think something is seriously wrong but they don't know what.\n\nMy dad, completely straight faced, \"well did you ask her to go potty?\" The vet said \"um... no...be right back\".

            "I used to have a dog, who was a very good boy, but he wasn't what you'd call obedient. He never really acted up he just minded his own business, but he'd only listen to commands when he felt like it, which was fine, because like I said, he minded his own business. Still, one time I he gave me the proudest moment I've ever had as a dog owner.\n\nOne day I'm walking him, and he stops to take a poop on someones lawn. I'm a responsible dog owner, so I had a bag already in hand the second he started to do his poop ritual. An old lady comes out of the house and starts yelling at me not to let him poop on her lawn. By that point it was too late and she didn't want to hear it. If you've ever spent any time around dogs, you know you don't really have any control over where they shit. They just hunt out the perfect patch of grass and go for it. Whatever, I ignore her, pick it up, and get on with my life.\n\nNext time I was walking him that way, I jokingly told him to take a shit on her front walkway. I guess he didn't have to poop, but he immediately cocked his leg and peed all over the walkway.\n\nNever been so proud of any dog I've owned.",

This one time I needed to pee really badly so I ran to the bathroom then I went to do other stuff, totally forgot to unleash him. Cue ~10 minutes later, I was wondering where my dog was and I found him obediently sitting by the door, still leashed so he couldn\u2019t go anywhere, he didn\u2019t protest or anything, just casually waiting for me to unleash him.

It all evolved, of course he's super now, no trigger words needed for that.  \n\n\nWhen he was just a kid, one morning I'm sitting on the toilet and he comes wandering in to say hello and walks into the shower sniffing around, and I said to him  'do your business, it's ok to do your business in there, do your business, what a good boy, do your business'.  \n\n\nNever had another accident anywhere else in any other house we've ever been in, and I have never ever yelled at him for 'doing his business' in the bathroom.

I've learned so much from her, not just about caring for someone else, but for myself as well. We are truly connected. When She's not feeling good I can't feel good, cause that's my child hurting. Even when I've been fucking up She's always at my side. If I were to get another dog I'd want to be while she's around cause I want her to help me train/raise it.

        "selftext": "Trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and I don't know how to make it up.\n\nMy girlfriend and I met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. Since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. Yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. She was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. So expecting some good news, I took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and I arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that I now have to look in the same area as her. I totally lost my mind when she told me that. I explain that I understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that I had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. The situation then became very tense, she told me that I am selfish and that I have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. I then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because I really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. And that, guys, she took it really hard, I've never seen her so upset in my life. She then gave me an ultimatum: either I follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if I'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. Maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment I fucked up.\n\nI still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer I could find was : \"Perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation\". I could have made long rants to show her that I love her, that I care about her. I could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. But no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. She looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, I realized how much I fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. She just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. I sent her a very long message of apology, adding that I hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.\n\nI am now staring my Thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : Whoah, this blew up far more than I could imagine. I took time to read all your comments, and I spend a big part of my day speaking with my GF about the situation. So here's the situation : 1) She's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) She thinks (and she's not the only one from what I read) that I'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.\n\nTo clarify some things I'm living in a small country in Europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. Then I admit it, I may not be ready to start my professional life. In my head I'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my GF. For me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. That's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. Also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.\n\nToday we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. For my GF, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. She told me that it would only be a matters of months. I explained my feelings and what I wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. We even reached an agreement : I will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. She also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  Now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.\n\nOh, I saw some people were wondering : when I left her house yesterday, I didn't take back the sushi\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR : GF finds a job far away from our city and I doesn't want to leave my life to live this far. She asks me if I'm really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was \"Maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation\".",

Getting out of unemployment is a huge step, and you don't know when the next chance comes. If she feels it's not working out for her, she'll come to that conclusion by living it, and if it works out for her but not you, then you simply need to part ways.\n\nAll that aside, getting some experience from new places, being working holiday, a couple of years in another time for a job or holidays/traveling can be very good for life and getting a better view of the world. I personally also want to remain in my hometown as base, but do not mind leaving for a couple of weeks to months, or even years, because I know I'll eventually return. But yeah, two people together should have common ground in regards to those matters (and religion/politics/childraising etc.), else they are not a good fit.",

            "To be honest this might be for the best for both of you. \n\nShe finally found a job after looking for one for months (years?), turns out it's not near your city but at least it's something! Your response to that was saying that you weren't moving despite not having a job in your area and that she should look for a job in your city, although it seems clear that was hard as hell. So basically you were telling her that you'd only be with her as long as you both lived in your hometown (meaning that you were not willing to pay a small price to be with the girl you're in a relationship with). Then to make matters worse you say that losing her= small price, staying in your hometown without her=salvation. So I can definitely see why she's hella pissed especially if you've been in a relationship for 4 years.\n\nI'm guessing that resolving the situation means, to you, for her to find a job back in your city?\n\nI can also kind of see your point of view of not wanting to move and staying near your friends&family but that means that your SO is below them in your priorities.\n\nAnd final point, don't blame thanos, this mess was due to the fact that your gf thought moving 400km away was trivial and you think it's impossible. Hope you'll be able to find someone that you get along and that lives in your hometown.\n\nAlso good luck with your job hunt, it can be hella tough. I know you won't like this but you might want to expand your search geographically as to have more opportunities. In any case goodluck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: if you want that sweet sweet internet karma you might want to post this on the am i the asshole sub",

You aren't some teenager anymore. If I were unemployed for 4 years I would take the job right away too and if my unemployed SO refused to move with me because they prefer languishing in unemployed obscurity then so be it. You should not expect her to sacrifice her future because you're too scared to move a few hours away from where you grew up in order to become gainfully employed. Then, when faced with this very sobering adult moment you quote a damn comic book movie. If I were in her shoes that would make me take a long hard look at my life and relationship and realise that the person I am with is just not ready to take that next step into adulthood.\n\nEDIT: Apparently I thought he said they graduated 4 years ago instead of them having met 4 years ago and graduated at some unspecified later date. We don't know how long they have been unemployed, but they have both obviously been trying to find work in his hometown and neither one has been successful.  Four years would make the situation much more drastic, but really if it's 6 months it doesn't change much. It sounds like she really needs this job and thought her boyfriend would be excited that one of them now will have an income. Him saying \" I then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because I really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city.\" was the real ultimatum. He effectively told her that he would try a long distance relationship but only if she was willing to keep job hunting and eventually find a job in his hometown and move back. That is an ultimatum. Her ultimatum was in response to his and it was completely acceptable given the circumstances.",

That's a big decision and you should have stressed to her that you'd have to carefully weigh the pros and cons of each choice.   Of course you don't want to break up with her, but you could have bought yourself some time to think through and rationally figure it out.   \n\nAnd yea, if she takes you back it won't last if you don't move and you should not put expectations for her to move back eventually because by that time she would likely find someone in that area that will let her grow.   Also, 400 KM isn't really that far away from home, especially if they have better career opportunities for you.",

I grew up in a very small town, and it was always an expectation that people who grew up there just sort of stayed there. \n\nWhen I was 18 and prepping for college, my girlfriend let me know she had no intention of staying in our state, let alone our town. She welcomed me to come with her, but she wanted to see what else was out there.\n\nIt was unrealistic that I'd be able to just move back there after college and have a good job in my field, but I just assumed I'd make it happen. I was shocked and offended that she didn't want to move back to our quiet boring town. \n\nIt unfortunately took me another 5 years to realize how badly I wanted to get out and experience what else life had to offer, and I really regret wasting those years.",

You could find your friends eventually moving away too.  I'm interested to know where you live. 400km away isn't that far. You make it seem like such a distance somehow removes all chances of you ever being able to go back home, when that's a 4hr drive for a lot of people. So unless half that distance is by water, this seems like am excuse to let things end. If after 4yrs, this is what ends things, then so be it. It was never meant to work out.

That is really not a great distance, in the grand scheme of things, and, while it\u2019s completely understandable that you would want to stay where you\u2019re comfortable and close to your established life, even your purple savior would have told you that the hardest sacrifices require the strongest wills. You definitely fucked up by freaking out. \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for putting you into an ultimatum. I understand she was wound up by your completely unexpected reaction, but her ultimatum was absolutely *not* the way to solve that problem. Yes, it\u2019s definitely a shock when the person you love doesn\u2019t react the way you expect them to when you tell them objectively good, though admittedly bittersweet, news, but, considering it happened, the best thing for both of you to have done was to walk away and talk about it later. \n\nShe *could* have accepted a long distance relationship until she found a job where you guys live, or you finally became comfortable with the idea of moving. \n\nOr, you *both* could have taken a breather and expressed yourselves in a much more constructive manner. \n\nBut, I\u2019ll admit that\u2019s a much harder thing to do and learn. I went through the exact same type of thing with my ex (though for different reasons), and it ended up completely wrecking the relationship to the point that I became bitter about it until recently, when we were finally able to talk through what happened as adults, without yelling at each other, guilting each other, or manipulating each other. \n\n**YOU CAN START READING AGAIN**\n\nI honestly hope for the best for you guys. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re bad people, you guys just talked past each other, and that happens to everybody. \n\nI would genuinely wait a couple of days, offer to talk to her, and open by saying that you\u2019re willing to think about moving with her. Ultimately, you saying you don\u2019t want to move away from friends and family is telling your girlfriend you\u2019re still not ready to put her above all else in your life. *That\u2019s* what has her upset. You two have been dating for 4 years, and you kind of admitted that you don\u2019t think your relationship with her is at a level where you two can actually have a life together. \n\nRegardless of whether or not that *is* how you feel, by freaking out at her, you communicated exactly that. As much as I hate ultimatums and think they\u2019re generally a poor way of resolving relationship issues, that\u2019s what she was telling you, and you seriously dropped the ball with your Thanos quote, which basically said to her \u201cI think you leaving would be my salvation from this problem.\u201d\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nDon\u2019t try to talk with her without being willing to admit this and without being able to consider the possibility of moving. You two have spent 4 years together, so you obviously love (loved?) each other. She *clearly* wants you to be a part of her life, and the only reason she considered/accepted that job was because it would mean a better life for the both of you. \n\nRemember, *she is leaving her friends and family too*, and she\u2019s doing it because she loves you and wants to spend the rest of her life with you.",

        "selftext": "This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.\n\nMy (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don't know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.\n\nWe had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.\n\nHowever, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)\n\nOn my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.\n\nHere's where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean \"you could hardly see your own hand\" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can't say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn't want to be in more trouble so I just yelled\n\n**\"HEY LET ME IN!!\"**\n\nThe entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).\n\nNow of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and I'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said\n\n**\"GET ON THE GROUND!!!\"**\n\nThere was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill!

            "First of all, that teacher should have known not to send you out because there was going to be an unexpected drill where you and other students weren't aware of the situation. Because it will cause panic to you and others. Thankfully, nothing crazy happened and definitely you shouldn't be punished. \n\nIt's crazy to me that there are active shooter drills in schools now where back when I went to school there was no such thing. But it sure is a good thing to know because anything could happen.",
            "It's a plausible enough scenario that some unlucky person might get stranded in the halls if there really was a shooter.  And they'd probably be panicked enough to do what you did: bang on the door to a classroom and beg to be let in.  Though it would be a bad idea for anyone to do that in case you were the shooter, but still.  Maybe your school will develop a contingency plan for students in the halls\n\nBasic protocol I learned was run, hide, fight:\n\nIf you can get out of the building, get out.  If you pass by any police officers, hold up your hands to show you are unarmed.\n\nIf you can't get away, hide somewhere where the shooter will not be able to shoot you easily.  Find a shadowy place in a stairwell or a bathroom: if you find a way to put up a barricade without giving away your location, do that.  When the police find you, hold up your hands to show you aren't armed.\n\nIf you do get cornered by the shooter, fight back with all you've got.",
            "What you did couldn't be more perfect.\n\nYou showed all the weaknesses that occur in this situation:\n\n* There's always someone in the hall\n* Kids will panic when when things go belly up\n* You can't expect everyone to remember the school's layout in the dark\n* If you get one kid screaming it'll start a chain reaction\n\nThis is exactly why these drills will never work out. The teachers barely know what's going on, you can't expect high school kids to know what to do or to listen. The best you can do is prep the teachers as much as you can an get the local PD on speed dial and have a set of plans in place for different scenarios. \n\nAlso, kids shouldn't be force to go through assault training.",

One of the books was the invisible man.\n\nSo the kid went to the bathroom to dress up. Ace bandages wrapped around his face and a trenchcoat.  Well when he was walking back a teacher saw it through the window and though it was an intruder or shooter.

No. There\u2019s a door to the parking lot like 5 feet from us. That\u2019s where we would really be, down the street. Am I doing that for a drill? Hell no.

If someone bangs on the door, and a bunch of you start screaming, what the fuck do you think is going to happen? Your school's lockdown drills, or at least their teaching of how to handle a lockdown to you all, is awful, not to mention how poorly they communicated with not only you all but with the office and in turn the officer as well.

We took I-75 all the way down, but when the time came to go back home, my dad decided that he wanted to take the back roads.\n\nWhile driving through Georgia we kept seeing signs advertising boiled peanuts. At first we were like \"WTF is that?\" but as time passed we got curious and eventually we stopped at a roadside stand and my parents bought a large cup of boiled peanuts for all of us to share.\n\nHere's the thing, though:  nobody in my family liked the boiled peanuts except for me. The more I ate, the more I loved them. Because nobody else wanted them I got the honor of eating the entire cup. I spent all day eating boiled peanuts while my dad drove.\n\nAs night fell, the boiled peanuts started to hit my colon and I started hitting my family with the most glorious smelly farts. It was also right around that time that we got lost. Now, my dad is the kind of person who gets very frustrated and irritable when he is lost, and we were in the middle of nowhere without a streetlight or a road sign in sight. As we drove and drove, looking for someplace we could spend the night, my farts got worse and worse and my dad got madder and madder. He rolled down the window for some fresh air and we were immediately hit with the stench of fresh skunk. \"GODDAMMIT U/JESUSGODLEAH!\" my dad roared. I had to explain throughbgales of laughter that that one wasn't actually me.\n\nEventually we reached a town and found a hotel with a restaurant next door where we could grab some dinner. My mom and I were laughing hysterically the entire time we were in the restaurant and all the locals were giving us weird looks. I still love boiled peanuts to this day.",

The guy who was over the demonstration eventually to our group and he was demonstrating throws to us, he asked for a volunteer and when nobody stepped  up he picked me to be part of the demonstration, I was maybe 6 or 7 so I didn't  know any better, he got in position  to throw me and from the second my feet left the ground to when I landed again my ass let out the angriest loudest fart I've ever made! It sounded like a wild animal getting attacked by a chainsaw, when I got up again everyone in the hall was looking at me and I think the dude who threw me was in a mild state of shock, he didn't  say a word and just moved onto the next group with his demonstration.",

His room was actually an uninsulated addition that was meant to be a seasonal porch, which meant when it was freezing out, you were practically freezing too. Which is where the story starts...\n\nHe had this sleeping bag that was guaranteed for sub zero temperatures, so I would hang out, watch movies, or whatever until he got off of work. I was watching Men of Honor (Cuba Gooding Jr., DeNiro, Navy divers and whatnot) and wound up falling asleep at around 9. But right before I did, I farted. Personally, I thought I could do better; I would have given it maybe a 6/10. But it was hot. Red hot. This thing was akin to a tin roof in the summer sun. But I made sure to not fart in the sleeping bag, because I'm not going to risk smelling up his stuff, so I figured the scent would dissipate long before he came home. \n\nI was wrong. So wrong.\n\nHe came home just shy of midnight, and I woke up to the sound of him throwing open the window and dry heaving from the smell. Apparently this thing lingered all night and just clung to the cold air because we left that window open for over an hour before it finally cleared enough to be habitable again.

There was a machine where you cut them, then you push them off the spindle down a slide.  I packaged the tubes up at the end of the slide. One night I let out a rank fart.  I surprised myself with the odor but was glad the other girl cutting the tubes was at least six feet away.  So,  when I felt another rumble, I let it rip. Kind is chuckled to myself as it stunk.  Thank goodness for old, smelly paper factories.   Well, I guess the odor wafted further than I thought.

            "So just adding to the joy this thread is bringing to the world, here\u2019s my favorite fart story.\n\nMy partner and I, two large Australian men are traveling around Japan.  First  night in Osaka we go looking for a place to eat.  I used to be in hospitality so I suggest finding a place busy with a lot of locals.  It is normally a good strategy in an unfamiliar city.  We find this cute little bar restaurant with heaps of people packed inside and all I could work out from the menu board out the front is they had a 4500 yen deal for 1 hour of food and drinks.  The place was heaving so we went in.\n\nWe both order the 4500 yen deal and get some sake to start.  When the food arrived we realized our mistake.  It was chicken sashimi\u2026 raw chicken, for an hour\u2026 we kind of looked at each other and convinced each other that it would be fine and gingerly starting eating the thinly sliced chicken with soy sauce and real wasabi.  It was actually ok.\n\nAnyway, the next day we are doing some shopping,  in Japan a lot of department stores are in small footprint buildings with several floors and we are on the 7th floor of one such building looking at electronics.  I start feeling the bubbling of beelzebub in my colon and suggest to my partner we need to go NOW.  We get to the small elevator and wait for what seems like an eternity for it to arrive and then we get in and start heading down.   My brow is beading sweat and I\u2019m pinching my ballon knot trying to keep whatever was trying to get out in.  It was no use, the elevator was so excruciatingly slow and at each floor people would get in and push the button for one or two floors lower so the trip down was taking too long.  Finally on the first floor everyone else got out and it was just me and my partner.  I apologized in advanced and let out the loudest and longest fart I have ever done and as the elevator slowly moved down to the ground floor the stench hit us both.  We were laughing and gagging at the same time, it was so ripe you could taste it.\n\nAs we arrived at the bottom floor the doors slid open and we tumbled out of the hell stench, just as a petite and beautiful Japanese woman stepped between us and to her death.  The doors quickly closed and she was gone.  My partner and I laughed so hard we were crying by the time we staggered into the street.  To this day we think she is probably dead, or in a coma.  We may never know.",

            "This reminds me of my own TIFU involving a campervan and shared bathroom facilities.\n\nAt the time I had just been diagnosed with IBS abs was following a strict diet, called the FODMAP diet. As it was holiday and in deepest, darkest Cornwall it was hard to get FODMAP friendly food. My then husband decided to surprise me with a FODMAP friendly meal. He did gluten free pasta with spaghetti bolognse, made with canned button mushrooms, tomato and basil sauce and a small red pepper (bell). We eat it's lovely. What I didn't realise was the pasta was soyabean based which is major trigger for me and hubby didn't realise as he just saw gluten free and thought great.\n\nSo we go for our usual after dinner walk. We're staying at a touring park with our old VW camper, and it's about a 10 minute walk to the beach. We walking along fine, about halfway there, when all of a sudden I get the most insane stomach cramps. My bowel is spasming and I immediately get the, I need to use the loo right now feeling. We immediately turn around and start racing back to the campsite, though for me it's more of a speedy waddle. My bowels are spasming like hell and I have my sphincter as tightly shut as I possibly can, even though it is spasming like crazy. By the time we get back on site I am literally holding my arse cheeks together. I beeline straight for the bathroom block and waddle as fast as I can. This is where it goes really wrong.\n\nI don't know if it's just me but the moment I see a toilet, I immediately need to loo even more. I'm undoing my boardshorts even before I reach the block, sprint into a cubicle and let the entrance to hell, open. I have never had an episode like it, it was like a poop volcano. It was poomageddon. It was The Crappening. I immediately know something is wrong. I can feel some wet on my butt cheeks and a god awful smell. That's when I looked behind me. I don't know whether it was that I hadn't sat properly on the seat, or whether the sheer amount and force of it had blasted it out of the toilet bowl, but there is now liquid poop all over the back of the seat, all round the bottom of the cistern, down the back of the toilet bowl, and onto the floor, over my boardshorts, my underwear and the back edge of my flipflops. I'm am utterly horrified and humiliated. As soon as the gates of hell close I run, naked from the waist down to the cleaning station and use 2 entire loo rolls and about 16 flushes to wipe it all up then use the disinfectant to clean it all down and then ended up walking full clothed into the shower and disinfect that down too.\n\n45 minutes later I appear back at the campervan, dripping wet and as red as a beetroot. The bathroom block and the surrounding area absolutely stank for almost 24 hours afterwards. It was so bad that the next day a sign was put up saying do not dispose of animal waste in the bathrooms.

            "My Dad once cleared out the entire White Elephant toy store in Spokane. It was brutal. There were about 25 people standing outside on the sidewalk waiting for it to clear out, a number of gutless others went home defeated without toys. My Dad thought he was the funniest thing in the history of ass-gas and stayed in the store shopping and laughing to himself the whole time. Everyone knew it was him and he was thrilled about it. That was one the most embarrassing moments of my young adult life, but in retrospect, I wish I would have been as proud of him as he was of himself. I would have puked for sure had I literally stood by his side, but I feel like I could have been more supportive of his lifetime achievement award.",

It\u2019s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.\n\nOne of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.\n\nOn this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.\n\nApparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.\n\nMy wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that\u2019s fair.\n\nI\u2019m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.\n\nTL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family.\n\nEdit:  Dang, my first gold!  I feel weird taking this blood money, but thanks anyway!",

He took the hen's remains home where his wife prepared it for his dinner that night. After the long day in the duck blind, the hunter was ravenous. Instead of taking his time, he gulped down large chunks of meat satisfied that he had done his duty as the provider for the family.\n\nBut midway through his meal, a breastbone broke off, lodging in his throat. Coughing and sputtering, he grabbed his water goblet and drank every last drop. But it was to no avail. The hunter gasped his last gasp and fell dead to the floor.\n\nBut what isn't known to the observer is that the hunter and his wife would have had a meatloaf that night and he would have survived that meal unscathed. What's more interesting is that his wife feeling a bit frisky and for the first time in a dozen years would have initiated sex that night. The resulting pregnancy would bear a man-child in nine months.\n\nAs the years went by the parents would have noticed how unusually bright their son was and eventually witnessed him graduating from the college that had awarded him a full scholarship.

            "I'd like to think that this is actually a happy story whose ending you accidentally brought about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, what you didn't know, is that the \"happy family\" you saw was the result of a heart-breaking situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe drake that showed up at the end - let's call him Marty - had grown up desperately in love with Helen the hen. Unfortunately, the other drake - who I will refer to as Biff - had always been a bit bigger and tougher than Marty growing up. Whenever Marty started to work up the courage to let Helen know how he felt, Biff would swoop in, beat him up, and basically humiliate him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut none of that mattered to Helen. Because she had always thought that Marty's feathers were the softest, and she was in love with his heart. If only he had been strong enough to fend off Biff, the Fowl rules of the Honkbladt Standards of Duckling Security would make their union permissible. But Marty had spent more time honking hauntingly beautiful songs to her than he had spent making his body savage, and so time and time again Biff stood triumphant. When he eventually claimed her, as was his right within duck society, there was no joy in her heart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis devastated Marty, because Biff was an obvious savage. Beneath the veneer of civility lay a Demon in Drake form. He would constantly berate and abuse poor Helen. Saying that her feathers lacked their original luster, telling her she was going to become too heavy to fly, and pecking at her whenever she failed to please him even in the smallest of ways. All while Marty could do nothing but watch on in horror.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut love is more powerful than any amount of pain, and so Marty and Helen would meet in secret, whenever possible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the moment that finally changed everything was when a human being pulled out a strange box, and played for all the world to hear a recording of the fowl treatment of Biff against Marty's beloved Helen. Perhaps this human could understand, or somehow knew... or perhaps it was just the hand of fate guiding his hand... but the video was actually a series of recordings of Biff verbally abusing Helen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarty, sweet, compassionate, caring Marty... when he heard the vial deprivations that Biff was inflicting on his beloved...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe flew into a rage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhereas his normally sweet nature was constrained by his concern for harming another, only a righteous anger remained for his nemesis. And so it was with a fury that Biff had never seen before that Marty challenged him to a Honkbladt Reckoning, the likes of which had never been seen in all the history of Duckdom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat fight for Helen's honor... it was no splitting up of a happy family. It was the reunion of pond-crossed lovers who had been torn apart by the rules of a society that was intended to make sure that the young would have parents capable of protecting them from the horrors inflicted on their kind on the streets of Chinatown and beyond.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it was the serendipitous hand of OP that allowed the truth to be revealed to a heart that contained enough passion to bring about justice and love once more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ducks have heard your call OP, and they thank you.",

Saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got \"called into work\" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.\n\nThis made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. \nMaterials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags\n\nI started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. \n\nAnother detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. \n\nNot today\n\nHe left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight\n\n[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.\n\nI heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words \"what the fuck are you doing\". I couldn't decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly \"sorry^sorry^sorry\". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said \"don't clean that; im throwing it away, now.\". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.\n\nTL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected \n\nEDIT: Typo\n\nEDIT NO.2: HOLY SHIT YALL BLEW THIS UP.\nI really, really, REALLY appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not.

            "I had a septoplasty a few years ago, and it was the best decision of MY LIFE. Seriously life changing. I made this list afterwards though, of stuff i wish I'd known:\n\n* Use the saline spray afterwards!!\u00a0 Once or twice an hour, from the very beginning.\u00a0 Splurge for one with a misting pump. Make sure you get simple saline solution, not medicated decongestant spray, I made that mistake.\u00a0 ~~You can make your own saline by mixing baking soda with distilled water.~~ Edit: Don't be a cheap bastard and do this, it's dangerous, and not the same as proper saline solution.\n* Irrigate your sinuses with a neti pot just as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, this provided HUGE relief during recovery, and I believe it accelerated the healing.\n* Buy a humidifier if you live in a dry climate.\u00a0 Run it 24/7 where you sleep.\n* Trim your nose hairs before the surgery.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think they bother the surgeon, but with all the clotting that\u2019s going to happen in there, hair can really complicate things. If you have facial hair, shave that too. Your nose is about to Kill Bill the lower half of your face, so a nice smooth cleanup surface is a must.\n* Before you have the surgery, prepare your surroundings for a convenient recovery.\u00a0 Do laundry, get a haircut, stock up on food (especially light stuff, soup sprite, crackers, etc).\u00a0 You\u2019re not going to want to do anything for a couple days, so plan to not have to. As far as arranging for help, I needed someone to drive me home immediately after surgery, but I think could have managed alone after that.\n\nI have a huge 10 page blog post of the whole experience if you want more details, I can PM you.\n\nEdit: Guys, I posted the whole blog post [right below this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cv3n0y/tifu_by_breathing_with_one_nostril_my_whole_life/ey1szbb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), just scroll down a bit, no more requests please!",
            "I had this surgery at 16. No broken nose or anything, I was born with a fucked up nose apparently. After it healed, the first time I breathed through my left nostril (in my life, ever) was a weird, cold feeling. I don't think I can describe it adequately. But now I no longer snore!\n\nLemme tell you though, the after-surgery healing sucks. Ever sneezed and sprayed an entire hospital room with blood at midnight? (nurse was not happy). Ever blown your nose and had a chunk of solidified blood, snot and bits of bone - the size of your pinky - fly out of your nose? Hope you're up for new experiences. \n\nI had to do twice daily sinus rinse (basically neti pot) for 3 months. Years later, I would move my head to one side and feel and taste a small trickle of saline neti pot water.\n\nHAVE FUN!\n\nNah kidding, totes worth it in the end mate.",

            "Glad to hear you're getting it fixed.  The same thing happened to me; nose busted, deviated septum.  Fortunately, mine isn't as severe, and I am capable of breathing through both nostrils, unless I lay down on one side, then the weight of my cheek is enough to close the channel.  Sucks being a side sleeper in this regard.  Sucks even worse if I get a cold or sinus issues.",

Prior to the surgery, I\u2019d have to breathe through my mouth to \u2018catch up\u2019\u2014and he waited a decade to mention it.",

I start a new job in just over a week so I figured in that time while I wait for my medical benefits to roll over, I can at least start doing a little research. \n\nAnd then this thread pops into existence. Dont take this the wrong way, but it feels great knowing I'm not the only miserable oaf in the world with this issue. I'm glad you're getting the help you need and I did read u/groundhog_day_only 's explanation which has me both reassured, and doubly-terrified due to the long healing process.\n\nBut I think I can dedicate a month of my life to dealing with the recovery phase just for the opportunity to live the rest of my life without totally blocked sinuses day in day out.\n\nI've been dealing with this for 31 years... x_x\n\nThank you for making this post. It reassures me I'm definitely making the right decision in getting this looked at. Hope all goes well!",

            "Damnit. Good post. After reading all of these replies, I decided to look up info about deviated septums. Evidently, one site stated that about 70% of us have a deviated septum without even knowing about it. It can happen from just getting hit in the nose, and not even with enough force to \"break\" your nose. Difficulty  breathing through one nostril, that's made worse with a cold/infection, and frequent nose bleeds from one nostril due to air being focused upon on area more so then usual, resulting in excess drying of the nasal cavity in that area, leading to drying and cracking, thus bleeding.",

The recovery was rough, complicated by the fact that I had a bad reaction to the antibiotics they gave me. Still, I\u2019d do it again - it was the best decision of my life.\n\nPrior to the surgery, I was having 6+ sinus infections a year. The doc scrapped out a lot of scar tissue and made room for the fluid to actually move back out of the sinus cavities whereas before the fluid could move in but couldn\u2019t move back out. I have not had a single sinus infection since the surgery.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware that my breathing was so poor until I had the surgery.

            "Had that surgery in January, same thing. Went 20 years without being able to breathe through one nostril. Fucking sucked, some tips tho:\n\nNot sure if they will be giving you support grafts, DONT blow your nose very hard when they remove the splint, again you might not be having this part of the surgery I had a couple things but if you do you might blow em out like I did and need another minor surgery :)\n\nThere was something else I was gonna tell you but I can\u2019t remember I\u2019ll just come edit the post if I remember. Good luck dude",
            "I had a deviated septum my whole life too and had a septoplasty when I was 16 going on 17, just before my birthday. However, I didn\u2019t see any improvements at all in my breathing, and it turns out that I\u2019ve had a recurrence of a deviated septum. \n\nAnybody who is under 18 and needs to get a septoplasty should be wary since the cartilage that makes up your septum doesn\u2019t stop growing until you\u2019re around 18 years old. My doctor didn\u2019t tell me this beforehand and now I pretty much still can\u2019t breathe with my nose (my septum is deviated on both sides, making an S shape) and wasted a ton of my mom\u2019s money on surgery. \n\nRecurrence of septum deviation is rare, but a lot more common in adolescents than adults (around 21% for kids and 7% for adults). I don\u2019t mean to be a downer, I just wanted to let people know what can potentially happen if you get a septoplasty too young. I\u2019m really happy reading everybody else\u2019s comments on how they can breathe better now though :)",

            "Had a similar surgery at 12 years old, I had tissue blocking 85% of my nostrils. I felt like I had constant stuffed nose and I considered it normal. 14 years later and I still catch myself marveling at how I can breath through my nose with my mouth closed. Wishing you a speedy recovery and a new view on breathing lol",
            "I had this too. A lot of people's septums get smashed during birth. I was pulled out with forceps mom said, hooked right on my nose. My septum was s shaped. I had 70% blockage on one side and 90% on the other.\n\nOkay... When you wake up after surgery you will feel like you got hit in the face with a truck. I cried and asked why I did it. My nose packing started seeping blood as soon as my panic set in. Nurses had to give me more drugs to settle me down in recovery. The pain was intense.\n\nIt's going to suck balls, you won't be able to breathe at all through your nose until the sinus packing is out. It will be 7-10 days of hell. \n\nMy tips:\nSet up your favorite chair for living in. You will be unable to sleep laying down. So find the most supportive c shaped travel neck pillow for sleeping etc. Set up your humidifier there too. You live here now. Buying a nice pillow for your ass helps too to keep your tail bone from hurting. You will be sleeping like the dead between pain pills and wishing for real death.\n\nYou will not be able to work till unpacked. You will be a mouthbreathing, open mouth eating, gasping miserable pariah. And your nose will be wrapped, and you'll look hideoud, maybe with someme bruising on your face. No one wants to see that, stay home.\n\nBending at the waist sucks, gravity is now an enemy. I could not bend over nearly at all at the waist without eye watering pain. \n\nOnly wear easy fitting clothing preferably loose or button up, pulling things over your head sucks. Nose must avoid being touched at all costs.\n\nFood will have no flavor until the packing comes out. Chicken noodle soup, popcorn and chocolate are all aroma food. They have no flavor at all, none, if you can't smell. Stick to easy eat softer foods, chewing can make your nose wiggle, wiggling nose is death. Or hurts like it. I ate a lot of chef boyardee. Had some flavor, went down with little chewing. Skip crunchy foods for first days.\n\nTake a scarf or one of those medical masks, or a air warming mask, with you to the doctor when you get unpacked. Even if it is warm. The air in the doctors is cool, and the inside of your face hasn't had air passed through it in a week. It will feel like someone is spraying icewater in there. It will be an issue for a few days.\n\nThe unpacking process is the oddest sensation ever. They will pack both nostrils in  like six feet of rope cotton completely filling the nasal sinus cavities. They pull it out in one long pass, is slimy covered in mucus and blood and you feel the tickle of it passing in your spine and toes.\n\nTouching your nose is a torturous act for a few weeks. Even just a lightbtap to the tip made my eyes water.\n\nAll said and over a decade ago, I'd do it again, it really improved my life, but doctors don't tell you how miserable the recovery is.\n\nAll in all it was worth it. The down side is now when you get a head cold it actually has impact, it never did before because I was always stuffed up, when you get used to breathing having a sinus infection is the worst!",
            "This isn\u2019t TIFU this is just life changing",
            "Oh man I've had a blockage for years, are you happy post surgery?",
            "I had a deviated septum which got treated. Honestly, no issues with the recovery for me. I spent a night in the hospital, next morning they pulled the packing out and then I was good to go. Zero issues or problems following it.\n\nIt's great, I'm rarely ever fully stuffed now even with a cold. It's insane how much nicer it is.\n\nThe only downside is when they remove the packing. It's... a lot more than you expect, it doesn't feel great, and you get a rush of blood after (the the feeling of heat that comes with that). The worst part is you have it done on one nostril, feel that horrible feeling, then realize they have to do it to the other one too.",

Single most disgusting thing I think I've witnessed come out of my own body. 3-4\" long clot, followed by dried mucus that gets gradually softer (mixed with blood, of course) and various shades of green. It'll become uncomfortable enough at some point to do this. Usually for me it was first thing in the morning and then sometime before bed. But that air passing through the nostril that's always been plugged is an awesome feeling. It's like a deep breath without the effort.",

            "I had a septoplasty and turbinate reduction in January. \n\nWhen I was a teenager (I'm now 47), my orthodontist first recommended the surgery. It never seemed like an urgent need, but I've always been prone to colds and sinus infections and kept it in the back of my mind as something to take care of one day.  It was my wife's complaining about snoring that led to finally scheduling a visit with an ENT. One look in my nostril and he was ready to schedule the procedure. Apparently the septum was deviated and the turbinates on the opposite nostril overcompensate, so both passages are reduced.\n\nThe procedure is done under general anesthesia, so you go to sleep and then wake up, eat some graham crackers and go home. I think there were 4 people in the OR in addition to my surgeon, so the whole thing would have cost around $13k, without benefits. With my Blue Cross insurance, I paid $120, minus a few copays for follow up visits to look at the healing (I was 100% healed within 2 weeks, but still went back at 4 and 6). I'm in the US (MD/DC area).\n\nI was prepared for pain and swelling and the doctor and nurses advised me of it and called each of the following two days to check on me and asked how things were. The thing is, there was no pain or swelling, really. I had a sore throat from the breathing tube for about 24 hours and that was all. I had to keep a gauze pad taped under my nose for about 48 hours. This caught the oozing of blood and the dissolving gel/packing stuff they use. I had the surgery on a Tuesday and was back at work on Friday, but did some work email at home on Thursday. Otherwise, I binged TV and ate soup with oyster crackers. It was a pretty nice vacation actually.  The biggest challenge was not blowing my nose for 2 weeks, but I was able to manage that urge.\n\nRight away, I notice easier airflow, particularly when lying in bed in the morning. The air feels cooler, fresher somehow. But, I don't have any superpowers as a result -- the additional oxygen didn't make me smarter or thinner.  Once or twice, I've blown my nose and some air has puffed out through my tear duct and that's a strange new feeling.  I can report (and will probably regret putting this in writing) that I haven't had a cold since the surgery 8 months ago.  I'm glad I did this.",
            "Same happened to me. Had an accident broke my arm and nose when I was 5. My left nostril was blocked since then. I am 24 and realized it last year in December. Had surgery this year in January. It's a small one but had to take a lot of antibiotics and pain killers for a week.",
            "Had effectively the same story. One doctor told me it wasn't worth trying to fix. Next doctor recommended a septoplasty and turbinate reduction and MY GOD the feeling when you take that first breath after the stints come out. It legitimately felt like going from half throttle to full throttle, I instantly started feeling better in general.",
            "I had a rhino, and two septos, and they actually reverted and redeviated both times. I'm back to About 80% left side blocked. I just gave up and blow smoke out of one side of my nose.

            "Thank you, OP, for posting this.  I've been wondering for years how much this could help me.   Just didn't really push on doing the research.  This post and the comments really made me realize it could be pretty life changing for people like me who can visibly see the septum deviated, and breathes outta one nostril.",
            "I went in for a check-up about 3 years ago after not seeing a doctor for over a decade.  She told me the same thing and recommended I see a specialist to get it fixed.  Never went to The specialist. Frankly scared of surgery and don't want the expenses although breathing better would be nice.",
            "I had an entire sinus blacked my entire life. Combine that with a slightly deviated septum, and extremely severe allergies, and I basically lived daily with the level of congestion a cold patient does.

Dr said I should have done a dose about an hour before arriving to help.\n\nI can still taste the nostril spray you have to take as well.\n\nFun fact: your nostrils actually take turns breathing throughout the day to help clear the resting one.

My mouth was the only place I felt pain. I absolutely second the saline bottles. My doctor prescribed them for me and I still use them. You can find them at any drug store, too. It was annoying at times to remember to do, but it made recovery so much easier",
            "I was born with a deviated septum and it got worse with age to the point i couldn't breathe through my nose most of the time. I did the operation when I was 25 but had I known I would have done it as a kid.

            "I've been through 3 septoplasty surgeries because of mistakes and it's still not fixed fully. First time I had it when I was too young (19) and apparently my nose was still growing. 6 years later did it again but now I also didn't do the proper saline cleaning treatment after surgery. This ended up with my right nostril healing by fusing with the septum making the situation much worse. So just like you I was breathing almost 100% only through left nostril. I actually didn't realise this until 10 years later. By this time I was addicted to afrin/otrivin decongestant  sprays and had to use them 5 to 6 times a day which ended up permanently swelling and required a radio frequency turbinate reduction and also to sever the fuse.  I still use Afrin but only if absolutely necessary and never more than 1 day consecutively. \n \nSo my strong recommendation is to get this done if you are older and make sure you do the proper post op care. And stay away from afrin! Good luck!",
            "I had the same thing happen to me, broke my nose and only got told years after the fact that it's fucked up and needed surgery.\n\nThe only advice I can given that hasn't been said before is don't miss the opportunity for a great video, bring a magicians wand and a camera to the post-op.\n\nYou'll never have the opportunity again to pull literal meters of tissues from your nose. There quite some room in sinus cavities apparently :)\n\nAlso the world stinks if you had your nose plugged for a week.\n\nGood luck with the surgery, have fun breathing the right way afterwards!",

I'm 21, I like Starbucks, I wear leather leggings and hoodies, I'm blonde, I have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy I'm sorta dating didn't believe me when I told him I've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. Instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. It kinda pissed me off he thought I'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so I figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  \n\nHe kinda laughed at the idea but I made him accept.  \n\nWe got to the gym, I met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. The dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. There was no way I'm saying no to that. My plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that I've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. I got mad.  \n\nWe begin. He's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like I'm some kid-- and I'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. The cheering was the boiling point. As soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere I decided to head kick him with everything I had. I literally grunted as I kicked him. In the ten or so years I've been kickboxing I don't think I've EVER kicked anyone that hard. He was out cold before he even hit the ground. \n\nNeedless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that I've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- I also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the KO.  \n\nSurprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. \n\ntl;dr: My date didn't believe me I've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. I head kicked him and knocked him out cold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit; This kinda blew up and I can't reply to everyone! I know what I did is fucked up and bad and I realize how bad it'd look if the genders were reversed. I didn't post this to gloat and brag nor do I think he had it coming-- I thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. I didn't realize this would offend so many people.\n\nEdit 2; Guys, I can't stress this enough- I posted this because I fucked up. He's fine and his coach took him to the hospital. I'm really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it's on me for writing it up like this. I hope someone reads the edits because I can't reply to every individual comment.",

            "I'm trying to imagine how my old sensei would have reacted if one of us tried to take some noob into the ring without protective gear. Ears would have gotten blistered, at the very least. The man had an absolute genius for invective. \n\nWorst beating I ever took at that dojo was from a cute little curly haired girl who stood about chest high to me. We were sparring, and I was grinning, thinking, \"awww, she's such a little bitty thing...\"\n\n I was new and didn't realize her other hobby was ballet. She came up off the mat like she was levitating and hit me in the head with a spin kick that rang my bells and knocked me on my ass.\n\n I looked over at the sensei, because it really was excessive contact for that level. He just shook his head and told me \"you deserved that for laughing at her. Get up and learn not to underestimate your opponent.\" I did. \n\nHope your guy's okay. ",

Which could have really hurt him with no gear on. While he definitely should have known better than to not wear gear, I think if you knew you were going in there to kick his ass you should have demanded he put on gear too or you wouldn't step into the ring. Being a fighter means knowing how to hurt somebody, and knowing how to hurt somebody requires a certain degree of self control.

If you really kick-boxed that long and are truly experienced in sparring, you should be able to easily demonstrate your dominance to a total beginner without knocking him out. I\u2019ve sparred against total beginners by just tapping them on the head and body while they try to take my head off. By the end of round two they\u2019re huffing and puffing and usually haven\u2019t landed a significant punch and often can\u2019t make it to round 3 because they\u2019re just tired.

Also just as a fellow martial artist it should be drilled into every fiber of your being that you only use martial arts for self-defense. And even if you wanted to teach him a lesson, why the head specifically? There were so many other options that were possible which you should know if you've sparred (Partly why I'm not 100% sure this is even real but if it is I'd rather give real advice to keep someone from endangering someone's life).\n\nDefinitely a fuck up on your part and the other to other people saying it's not a fuck up: yes he was being a jackass but that doesn't mean he deserves possible permanent brain damage for the rest of his life.

            "I did taekwondo for 3 years in high school, we were literally trained on how to kick the shit out of someone\u2019s head. We were also taught never to actually do it because not only can you easily kill someone, but the risk of brain trauma is very real. I can appreciate he was being annoying and you wanted to prove yourself, but winding him would have gotten the message across loud and clear. Kicking him as hard as you can in the head without padding? Reaaaally bad idea",
            "While I'm sure you and the dude made up and enjoy each other's company, you need to do 3 things:\n\n1. Get him to a hospital YESTERDAY. He may not agree, or think that getting checked out is a weak move after being knocked out. Doesn't matter. As other comments have mentioned, losing consciousness can be an indicator of real neurological damage.\n\n2. Inform your kickboxing instructor about the incident. Losing your cool like that isn't how an experienced fighter should act. If I was your instructor, I would want to have a very serious talk with you about how you are using the techniques being taught to you, ESPECIALLY the important of using gear and having a calm mind.\n\n3. Let it bother you, which it sounds like it already does. Kicking someone in the head even WITH protective gear isn't a good idea. Doing so out of anger shouldn't be your response to someone getting under your skin. From one martial artist to another, it is our responsibility to keep a lid on it, for the safety of the people around us. No excuses, no exceptions.",

I'm disappointed in whoever taught you kickboxing for not ingraining the responsibility of quite literally being a weapon into you, and in you for not keeping to that responsibility.\n\nFuck that guy, sure. But you should have walked away instead. He's already shown that he can't take you seriously, and you've already shown that you're not responsible.\n\nTIFUs are usually amusing.

I had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.\n\n\"You know, it's extra sharp. It really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.\"\n\nAnd that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. I hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that I have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that I've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that I always assumed *everyone* had it. \n\n\"What the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if THAT'S not what you're talking about?!\"\n\nI figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods.

There's Irish Americans, Anglo-Americans, Spanish-Americans, French-Americans, Italian-Americans and so forth, all with their distinct heritage.\n\nNow take African Americans. Firstly, they're not really a homogeneous block, they came from hundreds of different cultural groups across West Africa. Then their languages, traditions, religions and so forth were all taken from them as they were fed into an economic meatgrinder that viewed them as disposable livestock. Even their family units were broken, parents couldn't teach their children about their heritage when the father was forced to rape the mother for breeding stock and the children sold to raise capital.\n\nThere's basically nothing African about African Americans, the institution of slavery took that identity from them. What they have is what they built in America. Those of us who didn't descend from slaves get to be X-Americans, for example Obama really is a Kenyan American, that's a part of his cultural background. But African Americans? They're Americans.",

We're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. Anyways, I'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, I end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. His family counts me as part of their own family.\n\nSo his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. It was one of those \"even when I'm sick and can't hang out, I still need help with word puzzles\" things. Classic couple. Well I take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. So I swipe up and I'm thinking of what it could be, when I realize the letters could spell out \"nudes.\" Eventually, I send it off as \"nudes? lol\" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what I mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.\n\nA few minutes later, I get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says \"oh my!!\" I think to myself, \"well that's weird, I haven't talked to her in forever\" so I open up Instagram. Turns out, while I had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, Instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. My heart immediately sunk. I realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. She said she understood, but at the very best she figures that I was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.\n\nTL;DR Was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was \"nudes\" so I accidentally sent \"nudes? lol\" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.\n\nEdit: thank you for my first silver!\n\nEdit: and gold!!

My ex-fiance (22/m) worked long hours as a fabricator/ welder building railings & elevator shafts for casinos as well as, not sure what you'd call it, sets (?) for Criss Angel and Blue Man Group here in Vegas. It was busy season so his work hours went from 8-9 hrs to 12 -16 hrs a day. Horny, missing my guy and having a camera phone meant I could SHOW him just how much I missed him. Well I text him, express my need for some lovin' and start taking pictures. Like most phones, all the text messages I sent and received are still listed and this is where my luck changed. I didn't realise our mutual male friend had replied from a message I had sent hours prior, putting his messages at the top of the list - right where my ex's name just was. Not paying attention, I send an X-Rated picture to him instead of my fiance; thank God it was only one! My ex and I were sponsored tandem street bike stunt riders and earlier that day I was setting up a practice session before our weekend competition. Needless to say he got an eye opener and it made things extremely awkward the next time we saw each other. Being the dip he is, when we see him next, he says, \"So, do I get to keep it? Cause I wanna keep it.\" Pffft This just set the mood for our weekend too. \n\nSide Note: We kicked ass at the competition, we should have come in first place and the audience and other competitors alike agreed. The team who came in first was related to the guy who put the competition on; rigged. The entire time the cheater couldn't perform a single trick, literally failing and off balance the entire time. We were kicking butt, going over and beyond. Our last trick - we each had to do a long nose wheelie. I haven't a clue who thought up the bogus measuring system but the rear tire had to be higher than a pack of smokes. The schmuck goes, barely gets his wheel up long enough to measure and smashes the pack before he gets anywhere; the girl, not properly dressed, falls off and the schmuck nearly drops his Pepto Bismol colored bike. Our turn - We take off with me sitting backwards on the tank, I'm holding on to my ex with my arms and legs. We're balanced on the front tire beautifully, nearly 5 ft off the ground. The crowd is screaming, \"Let go! Let go!\" So I do. I let go of my ex (holding only with my legs), lean all the way back and drag my fingertips on the ground as we end in a 360. The crowd goes wild, we're celebrating knowing there was no way this fool could have won but we were wrong. The schmuck and his \"tandem\" partner walk on stage to collect their first place price, acting like they deserved it and their shit didn't stink. The crowd, bless them, started booing, throwing empty plastic cups and trash - they knew what was up! Needless to say we got second place but we did get headlined in the paper. ",

I didn't realize it until she commented back \"Oh hey...thanks, kind of weird timing.\" I felt so fucking embarrassed. I didn't know how to tell her why that happened.

        "selftext": "\nMy wife went out with work friends tonight. I knew she would be back late but stayed up anyway just in case she needed to be picked up or whatever. Well she rolled in about 1:30 drunk af. I promptly turn off the movie I\u2019m watching and we head to bed. I barely have time to get undressed before she says goodnight and rolls over. Now this struck me as odd because this woman gets RIDICULOUSLY horny when she been drinking. But I guess not tonight. Rather frustrated I climb into bed and try to write it off as her just being over tired and over served. Well I\u2019m just about asleep when her phone loudly goes off startling me back into consciousness. Seeing no reaction from her, and knowing her notification will go off at least one more time unless it is dealt with, I reach over and grab it to flip the silent mode button. And here\u2019s where shit gets fucked up. You see the notification was triggered by a text. A text from a guy who picked her up tonight, from some other random guys house bc random guy was super drunk and she was scared. His text, \u201cGoodnight darling.\u201d \n\nWhat followed was me doing what I\u2019ve never done, but obviously should have, a deep dive into her phone activity. What I found is as follows: she\u2019s fucked at least one of my, now former, friends. She is involved in an emotional affair with a friend of hers from college (also married) who seemed VERY eager to take advantage of his wife\u2019s absence so that he could spend time with mine (He was the noble knight who rescued her from rando drunk guy) And she has an impressively active tinder profile. Oh yeah and at one point this evening it seems she briefly considered hitching a ride with a stranger to Colorado. The texts, snaps and dms took about an hour to get through. \n\nSo now I\u2019m sitting here, house quiet, nauseous and internally raging, drinking cheap beer, trying to figure out how we got here. I\u2019d wake her up to confront her, but the kids are asleep and I just don\u2019t have the energy to fight tonight. There\u2019s 6 years down the fuckin drain bois.\n\nTL;DR - Found out my wife\u2019s been fucking other dudes when I tried to silence her notifications.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for the kind words of support and mostly sound advise. Y\u2019all are the best.\n\nUpdate: Since I\u2019ve been asked a few times I\u2019ll try it on this thread. Idk if anyone will see if since it was taken down but oh well. I confronted her Sunday night. Eventually she admitted what I already knew. I assume there\u2019s more I don\u2019t know about. I got set up to start counseling next week. Broke down at the office today and left early to save myself the embarrassment of crying at work. Staying with at a friends while I figure out which way is up.",

If you have siblings or parents who will hold on to your secret, talk to them. It's important that your wife not know what is about to slap her in the face.\n\nBegin to quietly separate your finances (and the rest of your life) as much as you can without creating suspicion. If you think doing some kind of thing will cause your traitorous wife to ask some kind of question that will set you off and blow your cover, don't make that move.\n\nIf you use Facebook, use your local mom & dad groups' anonymous poster feature to ask about the best sharky divorce lawyer, because sir, you do not need a nice guy for this one, you need someone with teeth.\n\nDo not shit-talk your wife to your kids. Let me say that again: as difficult as is it and as awful as this all feels, do not, shit-talk, your wife, to your kids. They will be the ones to suffer- now, and later, and you will never be able to repair that damage. \n\nI'm so sorry that you're going through this.

            "Sounds scarily similar to what I went through 15 years ago. I handled a few things wrong. I confronted her, naively tried to work things out for the sake of the kids. Her response was to say I was delusional, paranoid and obviously had some things of my own I wanted to hide. She demanded I leave which I refused, a week later there's a knock on the door and I'm ordered by a court official to get out that day, and appear in court a few days later. She claimed repeated domestic abuse as her reason for wanting me out which came out of nowhere! Despite her having zero medical evidence of multiple alleged broken bones etc. I was advised to not fight the order to leave, to avoid any findings against me. She immediately started divorce proceedings while I was still trying to process everything, find somewhere to live with no spare income, etc. These allegations made anything I had to say about her behaviour in the marriage irrelevant, and repeatedly forgotten about even by my own lawyer due to being nothing to do with the legal fight. It was HER divorcing ME, over MY alleged behaviour! To cut a long story short, I lost the house and the life savings I'd invested in it. After a further 4 years constantly fighting in court to see my kids she managed to turn them against me with some seriously underhand tactics. They're at the end of their teens now and I've not seen/heard from them for 10 years. \n\nWhat I'd do now (with hindsight) in your shoes:\n\nDo NOTHING without getting legal advice first. Good advice in one region can be illegal in another. If nothing else, the lawyers have seen these situations, and how they pan out, countless times.\nUse your \"undercover\" time to gather more evidence. Once she knows you know you'll lose this opportunity. Local laws MAY prevent you using screenshots etc but that doesn't stop you quietly saving them in case they're useful in a non legal setting in the future (shared friends etc).\nKeep calm and rational. I know how I overwhelming this feels right now. But one day this will just be a brief period in your past, try to make it one you'll be proud of.\nAvoid the booze. I was lucky I didn't get caught up in the drinking but looking back it was a close thing. Life isn't great now but would be a while lot worse with a drink problem. Also it's just a matter of time before a drunk you acts against all advice/common sense and wrecks everything.\n\nYou're one step ahead at the moment, do everything to keep u that way and best of luck.",
            "You hold the high ground. Now it's time to keep it. You've already saved the screenshots, that's good. Now copy them. Send those copies to yourself in an email. Make a new email address and send to that one as well.\n\nStop drinking, it'll make things worse. Get a lawyer. Make sure your lawyer has the screenshots, etc. Don't have sex with her anymore. When you do, you'll feel emotionally vulnerable and try to justify HER actions to yourself. Don't do this. \n\nAlso, go get an STD test to be safe.\n\nYou'll be tempted to take your anger out on others and I'm guessing your children stand to be the first at bat for your anger. Resist that temptation and take your anger out at the gym or get lost in a hobby.\n\nDon't think about it as 6 years wasted. Think of it as a future saved. I'd rather lose 6 years than 30 or 40, plus everything that comes with it.\n\nKeep your head up and know that this will pass.",

There is nothing wrong with trying to make it work either, but know that it is not an easier path to take, and that it can lead to a lot more pain than a clean break would.\n\nThirdly, your wife is likely about to say some very nasty things about you, or things that you did or didn't do which caused her to cheat.  Do not listen to that.  She did not do any of this because of you - she did it because she's selfish.  She did something terrible, and will say whatever she can to try to make herself feel less terrible. \n\nLastly, things are going to suck for a bit, but they will get better.  The pain that you feel now will be there for a long time, but it will lessen over time, and you'll learn to deal with it better.  No matter what you do over the next dew years, make sure that you have a support system of people (family, friends, a therapist) that you can talk to.  You may want to shut yourself off to other people, or you may think you can do this alone, or don't need help.  That's what I did, and I regret it.  \n\nBest of luck.

You're gonna need to do one very important time and two optional but highly recommended things before confronting her:\n\n1. Find a well-reviewed divorce and family law attorney in your area. The very important part is shopping around. As ironic it may sound, don't take advice from Reddit strangers because an attorney may advise you to do something completely different. Proceed with confronting her when the attorney tells you to. \n\n2. Find yourself a good therapist. Start as early as you can. They will help you cope, keep your head on straight, show you the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\n3. Find your children a good pediatric therapist. As soon as your children find out, send them.

Immediately go to a post office box, or private mail-box and open an account. (I had box number 21 as an example) and I wrote the address of the private mail-box business with \"Apartment #21\"  (half of their customers do that). Check with them first, of course.\n\nGo to a completely different bank than your wife and start a checking account with $100, have the checks, ATM card and credit card sent to the new mailbox. Start a new Gmail account with a completely different password. \n\nShe has your mothers maiden name and social security number. Start a new account with lifelock, and lock your credit score at the three credit agencies.\n\nIf your paycheck is direct-deposit, change your deposit address at the first opportunity.

It's not for her, it's for the kids and the court.\n\nFigure out which car she will want and which one you will want. Sometimes people lash out and do things they regret later, so get her name off the title of the car you need, so she can't get drunk one night and sell it.\n\nDepending on what you might respond with, I have more advice, but...the main theme is to prevent a bad situation from getting worse for both of you.",

Betrayal is some of the worst pain to go through. \n\nAlong with this, as everyone is immediately telling the OP to arm up, this is war, etc. etc. I wonder, what about the marriage? What was it like? Is there respect, care, love? Has something been happening recently to drive the two of you apart? How do you imagine she'd respond if/when you confront her about the affairs? Affairs are alarm bells that something in the marriage is not right, but affairs are typically only symptoms, not the cause. \n\nI'd say, yes, follow some of the advice people mentioned. Being prepared for the worst is smart, particularly when kids are involved. But also this can be a time to reflect on what you want: do you want to fix things, or are you out? Can you see yourself working through this pain together with your spouse? As the pain settles a bit, what would you want to do?\n\nI know in our culture is easy to cut people out when we get hurt and peace out.

            "I'm going to echo a lot of different people here. In order of course.   \n    \n - Hold off on drinking any more for the immediate future if all possible. If you start increasing the amount you drink. You run the risk that she might see that as a way to try to divorce you herself under the claim that you're a drunkard.   \n    \n - Before doing anything, talk to a lawyer and with his/her guidance. Come up with a plan with their help of how you are going to address this. If you're going to go the route of divorce of course. Definitely check on the legality in your state about using the screenshots while you are there. Right now she doesn't know you know and you want to keep it that way as long as possible.   \n    \n - If you were going to be talking with friends about this in the meantime. Please make sure they are someone that you trust. If you have any concern. Just keep them in the dark until things are ready.   \n    \n - Do not do anything with joint accounts and joint property in the meantime. Again, she doesn't know you know. Only start doing things with them on the timeline/plan you and your lawyer have come up with. If you need to start opening up a separate accounts for yourself to prepare for things in the meantime. Find a way to do so with money outside of your normal finances if possible. Obviously just make sure the extra money is sourced from legal ways. Opening yourself up a PO box in the meantime might not be a bad idea either. That way you have somewhere you can have mail sent that you don't want her to see.   \n    \n - As for the people she is sleeping/having a relationship with. If they too are in a relationship. Hold off on letting their significant others know what is going on. Again your wife doesn't know that you know. So if you inform their significant others what's going on now. She's going to know that you're on to her. Wait to drop that bomb until at least papers are served. It may seem cruel not to let their significant others know right away. However you need to protect yourself at the moment. At the same time. When things are ready, you should definitely let them know.   \n    \n - Get tested for STDs. However try to do so in a way that doesn't end up with your wife knowing. Pay for the visit in cash if there's a copay if possible. Use my suggested PO box idea if you are concerned about the mail reaching the house.   \n    \n - As for the paternity test idea that was shared by someone else. I would only go that route if you have legitimate concern that they may not be yours. That is an entirely different can of worms. If you do choose to go that route. Consult a lawyer before even doing it.\n\nAt the end of the day, IANAL. Just someone offering suggestions a clear and level head.",
            "Some advice for the next few weeks:\n\nIf your kids are younger than 17, don\u2019t ever tell them what happened. Let them discover all this garbage as adults. Do not speak ill of your soon to be ex wife to them. If you work hard to be amicable, your kids can be spared some of the uglier parts of divorce.\n\nStart working out whenever you have free time. Forget the beer. Instead drink a pre workout and hit the closest 24 hr gym. If you\u2019re angry, even better. Blast some music and hit it hard until you can\u2019t anymore.\n\nBoth of my parents were divorced several times before they had me. Life isn\u2019t over, just a relationship with a single person. If you put yourself out there when you\u2019re ready, you will find better. My dad had me at 50 years old. My older siblings are both nearing that age right now. I\u2019m in my mid-20s. \n\nDon\u2019t do anything stupid. Also, don\u2019t do anything your kids will look down on you for doing when they\u2019re your age.",

It's only a temporary solution that will make you feel worse afterwards, and could potentially be used against you when/if you go to court for custody of the kids.\n\nLast, try not to think of her having sex with other guys.

            "When filing for divorce, it's important to remember that the main goal of divorce proceedings in many states is strictly to settle the distribution of assets and custody. In these states, evidence of cheating makes no impact on the result.\n\n\nDivorce has nothing to do with justice. What often happens is the partner who got cheated on ends up having to write the cheater a big fat check for half the value of what they had together. A big dump of salt in a gaping wound. We often refer to it as \"the price of freedom\".\n\n\nPeople on Reddit like to pretend that evidence of cheating is some kind of magic bullet in divorce, but your lawyer will no better. By all means gather the evidence, but don't be surprised if the only satisfaction it brings is being able to throw it in her face.

Before I could gather myself, my ex wife spent all my money, refused to move out of the house, leaving me basically homeless. She totaled the car I had bought for her, leaving me with payments on a vehicle I no longer possess. Then a month before we got divorced, she got pregnant with dudes baby, which, in the state of Texas, means we cannot get divorced until paternity is determined. So I was stuck like this for over a year total. Because of the custody order, I had to sacrifice my good job for one that pays 1/4 of what I got before, due to being unable to travel any longer and having to take kids to school and do homework with them in the afternoon, etc. Im struggling like a MF and she's getting all these grants to get free food and free college, plus child support, she doesn't work at all.

And I realized today that it was horseshit and I got hoodwinked.\n\nBefore that, like most people, when someone asked me why the Civil War happened, my answer would have been \"slavery\". And that definitely was an issue. But my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. They gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the North, what Europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --There was a lot. And it made sense, because I found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. So they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. Again, super plausible. This was all being presented with an attitude of \"Now let me tell you what REALLY happened\". \n\nIm SIX semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the Declarations of Secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. I had no idea they existed. I read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. They were ALL about slavery and how it was \"the greatest institution ever conceived\" and that it had to be protected. There's no way this wasn't THE forefront issue, after reading those papers. I messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, I wasn't. I told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the Secession declarations either. Ugh.\n\nReddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong I was. I don't care about people calling me dumb, I'll own that. I just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and I got this...propaganda. I am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. I hope my stupidity is isolated, but I wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? \n\nTL;DR I thought the Civil War was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.\n\nEDIT: The FU part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the Reddit community about how completely stupid I was for me to learn about the documents, or the Cornerstone speech.

            " \n\nOn the Northern side, the rose-colored myth of the Civil War is that the blue-clad Union soldiers and their brave, doomed leader, Abraham Lincoln, were fighting to free the slaves. They weren\u2019t, at least not initially; they were fighting to hold the nation together. Lincoln was known to personally oppose slavery (which is why the South seceded after his election in 1860), but his chief goal was preserving the Union. In August 1862, he famously wrote to the New York Tribune: \u201cIf I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.\u201d\n\nThe slaves themselves helped make the case for emancipation as a military aim, fleeing in droves beyond the lines of approaching Union armies. Early in the conflict, some of Lincoln\u2019s generals helped the president understand that sending these men and women back to bondage could only help the Confederate cause. By the fall of 1862, Lincoln had become [convinced](http://www.history.com/news/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-lincoln-slavery-and-emancipation) that acting to end slavery was a necessary step. A month after his letter to Greeley, Lincoln announced the Emancipation Proclamation, which would take effect in January 1863. More a practical wartime measure than a true liberation, it proclaimed free all slaves in the rebel states, **but not those in the border slavery states, which Lincoln needed to remain loyal to the Union.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReddit tends to forget this and downvote anyone who challenges their ideas.",

            "Ok ok please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. When I took AP US History, my textbook and teacher explained that the main reason the states seceded was not mainly because of slavery but the contrary idea of American Nationalism vs Southern Nationalism. The south didn\u2019t agree with the idea that someone (the north) should be able to control their way of living (the north was trying to prevent the expansion of slavery into western territories but not remove slavery in the south. Southerners thought it wasn\u2019t fair as they should be able to bring their \u201cproperty\u201d where ever they go). The south also thought  it was unfair for the United States to tax southern states to pay for the debts of the northern states. Because of this conflict in nationalism, the south decided to secede WITH British support. Basically l learned that the war began with the argument of states rights over national superiority. However since the British (whom was heavily against slavery) was supporting the south (due to economic reasons), the union decided to pass the emancipation proclamation to turn the purpose of the war from states rights to slavery. This changed the purpose of the war and caused Britain to stop manufacturing ships for the south thus crippled the confederate navy (also, Britain was in a very bad economic recession and the Union sold food to England. It\u2019s a bad idea to bite the hand that feeds u). Anyways that\u2019s what AP US history taught me. I might be completely wrong. College board is bull crap anyways.",

            "I think, just like with basically everything in history, it was a little bit of both. (But that doesn't mean it's not misinformation to downplay slavery as a factor in the war.) Slavery was part of the economic problem, as the states that clung to slavery and held on to it with their teeth did so for the free labor they provided, and for the very low cost of business and living that entailed. If you think about the big landowners in the South actually having to pay their workforce (both agricultural and industrial, and household), you realize how much that would have cut into their profits. Free labor has probably been the main drive behind slavery, forever. Humiliating those conquered in war was more of a symbolic, case-by-case use. When talking about large numbers, it was always most likely about free labor. The South wasn't about to give that up without a fight.  \n\n\nYou're still an amazing person for being open to better information, and accepting that you were wrong, OP.

They wrote in those secession declarations that slavery needed to be upheld etc because the slave owning Elite  in the south where essentially lobbyists for southern politicians, if not the southern politicians owned slaves themselves. It's very easy to view the institution of slavery from our cushioned modern perspective, but to derivitize the sole cause of the civil war to be simply for defending the institution of slavery solely for the sake of keeping slaves isn't true. There are undeniable economic tensions between southern and Northern elites that drove the Northern Elites to want to completely destabilize the South. In doing so they destroyed the southern economy and drove workers to cities, particularly Northern ones where they could be exploited as indentured servants in factories,living in tenement housing. Like every war, the victory lies in the interests of elites, and the commoner is just reintegrated into a semmingly less draconic system that nonetheless, exploits and seeks to make them disposable.",

One, there is nothing new that can be said about the war with the current historical school of thought. Two, the stigma that comes with it. Our Civil War professor actively pushed us away from making it our focus of study because of these reasons.\n\nThe reason that your, and sadly most Americans, education was FU was because of the State Gov. most of whom grew up in the time of the \"Lost Cause\" and are unwilling to read the new histories because it conflicts with what they believe.\n\nNo, you didn't FU, the State Gov did.",

Add to that the fierce antipathy towards slavery. \nThus, the dynamics of the different economies and their social and ethical positions both created a dynamic that would inevitably lead to war.\n\n\nYou will find, when you study history, that many factors interrelate and shape events.\nTake the fall of Rome.

Bleeding Kansas  and the bloodhound bill were manifestations of this disagreement, and the ultimate manifestation, the secession of south Carolina, was in response to Abraham's election as the south believed he and his fellow republicans would abolish slavery. \n\nHowever, its important to understand why the south were so bent on maintaining the 'peculiar institution': their economy. The plantation owners had an IMMENSE amount of capital poured into slavery. When the 13th amendment came into being, the south's economy collapsed, not just because Sherman broke some railroads and some other general burned Shenandoah, but because millions of dollars of investments were set free. Slavery is wrong, but it takes more than a feeling of guilt to motivate people to throw away their entire investments, especially since agriculture was the only way to live in the antebellum south.

        "selftext": "This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.\n\nNeeded to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. \n\nWhile I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.\n\nWalking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.\n\nKeep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.\n\nGirl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.\n\nAbout half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.\n\nThen we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:\n\nHer: \"Wow that's a big knife.\"\nMe: \"Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.\"\nStares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.\n\nHer: \"Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.\"\nMe being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. \n\nShe quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.\n\nShe says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.\n\nShe gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)\n\nI get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.\nI say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.\n\nI get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.\n\nI was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.\n\nGirl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.\n\nTold my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.\n\nTL;DR: \nBought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer.",

            "A friend of mine's sister passed away a couple of years ago. Some time afterward, he went to clean out her home. Everything was in very bad shape, not much was worth keeping, everything was very dirty. He hadn't realized what he was getting into (she lived in a neighboring state and they hadn't had much interaction in awhile). So he went to the hardware store for supplies. He purchased:\n\n* trash bags (to put everything into)\n* rope (to tie everything down in the truck)\n* tarp (to cover the load of stuff, it was winter and very windy)\n* Benadryl (because he knew all the dust would cause problems with his allergies)\n* Heavy-duty cleaning supplies, the good stuff, and lots of it.\n\nWhile checking out, he asked the cashier directions to the local dump. The cashier (this was almost Christmas) was dressed as Santa Claus. He noticed Ms. Claus seeming nervous but didn't think too much of it.\n\nThe dump wasn't far, so upon leaving the store, he decided to drive there to make sure he'd understood the directions. On the way, he saw a police car with its lights on coming up behind him. He wasn't speeding, so at first he was just waiting for it to pass (there was nobody else on the road), then he realized he was being pulled over. So he pulls to the side of the road. Suddenly a second police car whips in front of him, blocking him in, and a third pulls up beside him.\n\nHe was surprised and not really thinking things through, so he hops out of his truck to see what this is about. And, this being cold winter weather, he unconsciously has his hands in his jacket pockets.\n\nBad idea.\n\nTurns out, Ms. Claus had called the police and told them about the \"suspected serial killer\" that had just left the store. Now, the police are pretty sure this hardened criminal is about to pull a gun on them. They've all pulled their weapons and are shouting commands while he's just trying to figure out what the heck is going on.\n\nMuch yelling and confusion followed, and fortunately the police did not shoot him, although it could have easily gone that way. After everything gets sorted out a bit, it turns out that one of the responding officers handled the 911 call when my friend's sister died, and was able to verify that my friend's story checked out.\n\nSo, OP, at least you didn't get pulled over and have weapons drawn on you.\n\nThat's not quite the end of the story.\n\nTurns out, he didn't need all the supplies he bought. While all this was going on, his sons, who he had brought along to help, put up a sign for \"free stuff\", and people came and hauled off almost everything. So they had basically nothing to haul off. Being a frugal guy, he goes back to the hardware store to return the things he didn't open.\n\nWell, Ms. Claus was at the return desk helping another customer. She sees him and panics basically just drops everything and runs away, apparently in fear that the serial killer got away from the police, figured out who turned him in, and is there to kill her. After quite a while, the manager comes out and they have an, um, interesting conversation sorting things out. The conversation ends in laughter and the manager telling my friend that Ms. Claus watches WAY too much TV.\n\nSo, all's well that ends well, I guess, but quite the little adventure.",

I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.\n\nI started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best \"prepare for a police shift\" album of all time: \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST\". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.\n\nMy vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.\n\nAt about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said \"I need to talk to you at the department.\"\n\nOblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant's office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, \"Close the door\". At this point I knew this wasn't good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.\n\nAfter a preface from my Sergeant, he says, \"Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.\n\nI didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. \"Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito.\" Then I just heard \"Guess what, that's theft.\"\n\nAfter a \"Come to Jesus\" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn't want to press charges.\n\nAlthough nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. \n\nOn a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me \"The Burrito Burglar\" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.\n\nTl;dr: I'm a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in \"autopilot\" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it.",

I felt really awkward telling my training officer about it. He got red faced, drove back to the store, apologized and paid for the map.

I was just holding the cold box in my hand. I tried to remember why that would have happened and then it hit me\u2014I didn\u2019t pay. I just walked my happy ass out of the store with the pizza without even thinking. \n\nI just stopped on the sidewalk and stood there for a second in disbelief and then finally, super exhausted and very grumpy with myself, I did a 180 and went all the way back and paid. My husband still teases me for going back, but (aside from the fact that stealing is wrong blah blah blah) I shopped there nearly daily and I didn\u2019t want to lose that privilege by being an idiot. \n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not just you, man.

Dude lost his shit, and said  I was going to pay him now, or he was calling the cops. \n\nI grabbed a notebook that was on the counter, scribbled a note in big letters.

        "selftext": "So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.\n\nI visited Thailand in September '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.\n\nOne morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn't think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai.\n\nI suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn't want any \"rug and tug\" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.\n\nThis wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything \"extra\") and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.\n\nThe first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had \"awoken the beast\" to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those \"I've not jerked off in three weeks\", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.\n\nCum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.\n\nEdit - Typos  \n\n\nEdit 2 - After desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as I could, I received a notification that I'd hit the front page. So, I guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, I still need to work too. In all honesty, I wrote up this event because I had been told I had to during one of the many times I have regaled people with it. I had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so I posted it typos and all. I did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and I am grateful beyond words. Every little complement and giggle is doing more good than I think most people would realise. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL; DR - Got a massage whilst forgetting my underwear, ended up shooting my wad all over myself, a poor masseuse and her equipment in a furious display of penile theatrics.",

        "selftext": "Throw away for obvious reasons.\n\nI'll try to keep this short as there isn't much to say. Our medical school class has to do sensitive exams (pelvic, genital, rectal) toward the end of our second year, right before we are allowed to go into the hospital wards. The idea is that these people are paid to have the sensitive exams done, each person has 15-20 students examine them. The vast majority of the time the people getting the exams done are elderly or former healthcare workers who are comfortable with their bodies, want to help educate students, and make some money at the same time. The patient our group had was an uncharacteristically young woman, she was probably in her mid twenties. This shouldn't have been an issue at all, but my medical school class is very conservative, nearly half is already married and the other half is still waiting to have sex until marriage. At least three guys in my group had probably never seen a vagina, let alone touched one. This made the experience way more awkward than it had to be for the patient. Anyway, we do the exam, thank our patient for volunteering her time, and leave for the day.\n\nFast forward about 4 weeks to yesterday, I'm at the grocery store buying some oatmeal. And I see a young wman near the cereal. She looks familiar but I can't quite figure out where I've seen her before. I know with 100% certainty I've seen her, just not sure where. She looks at me and makes eye contact, not the polite eye contact you make, smile, and look away. The type of eye contact where it's prolonged, like she was also trying to figure out where she saw me. We both smile and I walk toward her. The exchange was basically this.\n\n**Me:** \"Hey, you look super familiar, where have I seen you before?\"\n\n**Her:** \"I was thinking the same thing, I'm not sure. Are you from *insert city we're in.\"*\n\n**Me:** \"No, I'm just here for school.\"\n\n**Her:** \"Oh, I just graduated from *local univeristy.* What are you studying maybe we've had a class together.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Oh I don't go to *local university,* I'm a medical student at *different campus.\"*\n\nIt was at that moment I realized I had fucked up. We both immediately stop smiling. We both instantly knew exactly where we had met before. I have no idea why, but instead of trying to diffuse the situation and acknowledge the humor in what just happened, my dumb-ass-awkward-self thought it was a good time to say \"wait a minute, this isn't the canned food isle.\" And I just walked away.\n\nGod, please kill me and end my misery.\n\n**TL;DR:** Examined someone's vagina in medical school, ran into her at the grocery store later. We both recognized each other but couldn't remember where from. While talking we both immediately figured it out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: as u/squirrelybitch and u/azellnir pointed out I shouldn't have been so awkward about sex or the encounter in general. And I completely agree, society in general treats the human body as some taboo that shouldn't be talked about. The reason we were both so awkward was because as doctors we are trained to never initiate contact with our patients in public. If they are the first ones to recognize you, that's fine, you can say hello back, but we can never admit or even imply they are our patients. So just the whole situation where we were both completely caught off guard and didn't expect to have encountered each other in a clinical setting.",

But(t) the whole experience just seemed kind of gross. \n\nI felt bad for both of my patients, especially the female, because I was headed into psychiatry.  I knew I was never ever going to do a pelvic exam again and the whole thing was incredibly awkward.

I had a horrifying feeling when I looked around and suddenly realized that *every person at that table* (with the exception of the psychiatrist, of course) had seen my vagina.",

I understand that, for now, this may be an uncomfortable situation to run into people that you\u2019ve done a pelvic exam on or otherwise seen their body, but in the future, this will be a normal situation for you.  You will see many patient\u2019s bodies and you will come to understand that the people who come to see you are making themselves vulnerable to you, as a professional. You, even as a professional, are also vulnerable to normal human feelings of discomfort when you run into people outside of the clinical setting.  However, those feelings will fade. You will eventually understand that, as a professional, there is a huge difference between the social setting and the clinical setting.  Then, it will be completely normal for you to see people in the social setting that you\u2019ve seen at their most vulnerable. Your feelings and reaction are probably \u201cnormal\u201d for your stage of training.  You will, hopefully, be able to separate these parts of your life in the future. As doctors, we have a great responsibility to examine and treat other people when they are the most vulnerable, and separate those experiences out when we see people in normal social situations.

One day after having sexy time with my bf, he mentioned that my lady parts looked \u201coff\u201d. Naturally I freaked out. I had been using a western gyno, but since I was enmeshed in massage school I thought the best thing was to get myself tested at the naturopathic school that my own school constantly recommended. \nSo. I made an appointment. I got a discount. I show up, freaked out, spread my legs, and the doc asked me whether or not I\u2019d be willing to allow students to observe my gyno appt.

When asked who will go first, the other two med students conveniently found spots on the wall to become interested in so I volunteered. The first part of a pelvic is the speculum exam (duck bill looking device), and it goes fine. The second part is the bi-manual exam. This consists of using two fingers in the vagina and the other hand sweeping the uterus and bilateral ovaries towards the fingers to check for cervical tenderness, uterine abnormalities, and ovarian tenderness. While performing this exam, the SP decides it\u2019s a great time to discuss pelvic floor health and how to educate my patients on proper Kegels.

            "Congratulations on the weight loss- I myself lost a total of about 80 lbs 10 years ago now, and kept it off.\n\nAs I fellow aficionado of the Emperor's New Groove who enjoys bursting through household hallways dramatically, I truly appreciate your enthusiasm and highly recommend you work on mastering the hip check door open.\n\nIf you look at the scene in the film, you will notice that Kuzco is tilted slightly to one side as he bursts into the room - as far as I'm concerned if you swivel your hips and check the door with your side it will still be canon. The key is to stretch the legs and rotate the hip as you move the crotch forward, masterfully avoiding any bony parts and sort of hitting with your upper thigh to avoid further screaming pain or manberry damage. In fact, Kuzco technically kicks the door open - though I can't advise as to proper technique for doing this safely in your house, it seems like you have lots of options to continue opening doors while yelling \"boom baby\" in a manner representing the proper pizzazz of the original scene.\n\n\nEdit: wow, so much love! A perfect world begins and ends with us you beautiful redditors.",
            "80lbs -- that's amazing!  Well done!\n\nIt's funny how you don't notice at times, and then suddenly notice at others.\n\nI've lost 26.5kg (almost 60lbs) myself.  I was in the gym for the first time in many months on Monday and saw myself in the gym mirror when lifting weights and the was a different person looking back than when the gym closed for lockdown.  The context put it into perspective for me.\n\nNot as good as your belly story, though.  Love it.\n\nAlso, ow...!",
            "I \"popped\" early in my pregnancy and (after a brief \"wtf\" period where I'd whack into things) I adjusted to my newly rotund form. I started using my belly to hold things up for me whenever I needed an extra hand while opening doors and whatnot. Fast forward to about 6wks after giving birth and my daughter was going through the early stages of colic. It was 3am, I was exhausted and trying to haul ass from the kitchen back to the bedroom with a warmed bottle, warmed blanket to swaddle her in, and a freshly santized pacifier. Without thinking, I went to balance the bottle on my belly as I opened the bedroom door.\n\nMy partner rushed out of the bedroom when the bottle crashed to the ground and I let out a little cry because the bottle broke and precious breastmilk was EVERYWHERE. I lied my ass off and maintained that I simply dropped that bottle. I have never admitted what happened to another soul until now lol. You get used to your body being one way and it takes *awhile* for your brain to catch up!",

When my father was diagnosed with diabetes he worked super hard to lose a lot of weight, went from needing insulin to not even needing to take pills every day because his blood sugar got so much more in line with normal! He needs to take his pills if he has a big dessert but short of that he's doing pretty good. I know how difficult it was for him to lose that weight but I'm so proud of him for working his butt off to do it. I'm sure your family is very proud of you as well. Good on you for doing what you can to take care of your health.\n\nAlso want to note, obviously everyone with diabetes isn't practically cured just by losing weight. Everyone's situation is different and I don't want to imply that if people just lost weight their diabetes would be gone. My grandmother was quite thin and ate super healthy and she still needed insulin. So yeah, not implying that overweight people deserve worse diabetes or \"they'd be cured if they just lost a few pounds\", from what I understand though if you can manage to lose weight the disease is more easily managed.",

The \"cushion\" helped a lot too. \n\nThe first time I hit my hip bone on the corner of the counter I thought I'd broken the skin and damaged a few ligaments or tendons or something.

Recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. Well last night was the first time we decided to use them. We read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. Everything went well but afterwards we couldn\u2019t find the plug. This is where the TIFU begins. \n\nWe figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. Woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. GFs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she\u2019s a little extra hungover no big deal. We arrive at McDs to get some greasy hangover food. I order while GF heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. As i take our order back to our table, GF walks over in a panic saying we need to leave NOW.\n\nShe found the butt plug. In our drunken state, we managed to put the ENTIRE thing in her ass. Handle and all. And now it\u2019s sitting at the bottom of a McDonalds toilet in all its glory. \n\nTl;dr: Did not use a butt plug as directed.",

I asked my mom if she wanted them and she gladly accepted. \n\nI work nights and got home around 6:30am this morning, I get to my room and decide to wank one out before I fall asleep. I turn on a nice video and get to work. Halfway through, the sound stops, so I try turning up the volume with no success. As I\u2019m trying to figure out why the sound stopped, I see the tiny earphone symbol in the corner of my screen. I quickly realize that my mom is getting ready for her morning walk and put the AirPods in her ears and heard my nice video... on full blast. \n\nLater that day she gave me back the AirPods and said she didn\u2019t like them either. \n\nTL;DR: Gave my mom my old AirPods without realizing they were still connected by Bluetooth to my phone and she heard the the porn I was watching at 6:30am on full blast.",

After a few seconds (maybe minutes) he realises that the audio came from the soundbar from the living room. He didn't knew what to do, so he just shut down his computer and went to a friend and didn't came back home untill the morning. I think the father did say something awkward during breakfast, but I can't remember what exactly. I might ask it to my friend.\n\nTL;DR: my friend forgot he was connected to the bluethooth soundbar downstairs and turned the volume all the way up when playing a porno.

        "selftext": "Throwaway.\n\nLast night I (28m) managed to convince an attractive girl (25) to come home with me. It was the end result of a successful first date. Well, successful-ish. As soon as the two of us were naked in bed, she froze and asked if I lost a loved one recently. That question caught me off guard because my face was buried between her legs at the time. I didn't answer at first, but she asked again. The second time she literally made me stop eating her out so I could respond. For the record, she did mention that she had a sixth sense when we were getting to know each other, but we never discussed it in detail. \n\nTo answer her question, I said my grandma passed away not so long ago. My date nodded her head and said she sensed my grandma's presence. I said I didn't believe in ghosts and continued eating her out. My date said my grandma had a message for me. At that moment, I was doing everything I could in the pussy eating department to distract my date from talking about my dead grandmother, but sadly, my oral sex game did nothing to prevent her from telling me that grandma wanted me to forgive my brother. I stopped what I was doing and asked my date what she meant. A few years ago, my brother hooked up with my gf (now ex). I hated him afterwards and our relationship basically became nonexistent. I never shared that information with anyone, let alone with a girl I just met, but somehow she knew. \n\nWhen I asked my date how she knew that, she said my grandma. She knew my grandma's name, which was another detail I never shared. As my scepticism began to fade, I asked my date if my grandma could actually see what we were doing. She said yes. My penis automatically disabled its erection function and shrunk in shame. My dick has been soft ever since. Sex was no longer possible for me when I imagined ghost granny not only watching me during sex, but also feeding my partner sensitive information about me from beyond the grave. I didn't sleep at all. My first proper date of the year and I get fucking haunted during sex. \n\n**Tl:dr Hooked up with a girl who can communicate with the dead apparently. She ended up \"making contact\" with my late grandma while the two of us were being intimate and made me aware that ghost granny could see what we were doing. I was unable to get it up or go to sleep after that.**",

        "selftext": "So, this didn\u2019t happen today but a few months ago, but I never told anyone. It\u2019s a long story so you can find a TLDR at the end. \n\nA while back the company I was working for was tearing out and removing an old waste treatment system that was shut down in the \u201970s. This was basically a massive underground pit where the waste solids (aka shit) would settle on the bottom of the chamber and the liquids would be pumped out. The thing is when they shut it down it was left full of shit and is by far one of the nastiest jobs I have ever done. \n\nWe opened the pit up by tearing off the top with equipment and were bringing in trucks to pump out the waste the pit was about 16 feet deep and filled to the top with solids. And when I\u2019m talking solids, I\u2019m taking shit tons and tons of shit, condoms, and for some reason pumpkin seeds which I still don\u2019t understand to this day.\n\nOne weekend we got a bunch of rain. When it rained, we would pump the water out into the new sewer so we could remove the solids. Since it was the weekend and we had so much rain my boss asked me to swing by and turn the pumps on, so the water didn\u2019t get out of hand. \n\nSo, I went out to the job site alone to turn on the pumps and suck the water out. When I got to the job site, I turned the pumps on, but they were clogged up. I decided to walk into the structure alone and clear the pumps and that is the start of my fuck up that almost cost me my life. \n\nSince I took my personal vehicle, I didn\u2019t have any of my equipment so instead of using a harness I went in without one which is the first fuck up. This structure was underground, and the pit had large chambers that were broken into basically large upside-down V\u2019s that you could walk on the point which was a foot or two wide. When I got down to the pumps and was crouched down cleaning them my phone rang, and I went to answer it and that was my second fuck up. Being crouched I had to turn my leg and try to get my phone out of my pocket and my foot slipped on some gravel and I slipped off the ledge and fell in. At this point, I didn\u2019t really wasn\u2019t worried about anything besides the fact that I just landed in straight 40-year-old shit up to my knees, however, when I tried to move to get to the edge to get out, I started to sink. Like I said this pit was 16-foot-deep and it was like being in quicksand. I tried to reach for the edge, but it was just out of reach and when I tried to move again, I was now a little over my waist-deep. At this point, I was still fine yes, I was covered in shit but normally the city work guy comes around once or twice a day to check the site so just chill there wait for him to come and he can get me out. Sure, I\u2019m going to be embarrassed more than likely to get in trouble, but I would be fine. The thing is while I stood there covered in shit, I noticed that I was still sinking and that\u2019s when the panic set in. I couldn\u2019t wait I had to get out or I was going to die, I was going to drown in 40-year-old human shit my whole life had led to me drowning in shit. So I instantly tried to get out I tried to kick my way out, I tried to pull myself out, I tried to swim on the top of it all while sinking deeper and deeper and nothing but the thought of the absolute crazy way that I was going to die. \n\nAt this point, I had sunk to my chest and I had pretty much lost all hope and had started to accept my fate and broke into a combination of historical laughter and cursing myself for my stupidity of going down there with a harness. I finally calmed down while I\u2019m reading the wrapper for a condom from like the \u201960s and I noticed a piece of rebar sticking out of one of the walls that we had started to tear down. I reached out and stretched myself out more than I ever think I\u2019ve done in my life and was able to grab it. With every ounce of my strength, I managed to pull myself free, and then pull myself to the edge and get out.\n\nI got out of the pit and fell on the ground and looked up at the sky and laid there covered in shit and smelling worse than I ever did in my life and laughed. I was alive, my story had not ended by drowning in shit. \n\nI got up found a water hose and washed myself off. I threw my clothes away and drove home naked and took what was the best and longest shower of my life and never told a soul how close I came to drown in 40-year-old shit. \n\nTLDR\n\nI went out to a sewage treatment plant alone without a harness tried to answer my phone and fell in a pit and almost drowned in human shit.",

            "Dude...\n\nI was in Iraq and nearly drowned in an effluent ditch that led to a pit/pool with literally everything bad in the world all in one place.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to describe why this pit existed.  We drove by it everyday and just thought it was a shallow area that water just pooled in from the wadis (farming irrigation ditches) \n\nIt\u2019s in the middle of this business district,  butchers, automotive, and medical.  Near FOB Falcon if anyone is curious, outskirts of Baghdad. \n\nIt\u2019s 3am, we\u2019re heading in from patrol, it had been really rainy in the recent days.  The area had swollen up with water.  As we\u2019re driving the convoy takes a tight turn and our driver kept going straight.  We stopped when we didn\u2019t see the convoy ahead as they were out of sight. \n\nThere\u2019s trash everywhere on the ground in Iraq, The trash in the water met the level of the trash on the ground and made it look like just a muddy field.  \n\nDriver goes to turn around and plows straight into what he thinks is just a muddy area.  \n\nIt was at this moment that we all knew he fucked up.\n\nThe HMMWV (Hummer)  angled down violently into what we found out was a 15 feet deep cess pool of water, oil, gasoline, animal fluids/entrails, human waste, and medical waste... *everything bad in the world*\n\nIt instantly filled up with everything bad in the world... it was black, blacker that burnt oil, just pitch black water up to my neck... \n\nAs it\u2019s happening the only thing I\u2019m think is... **NO, NO, NO, NOT LIKE THIS!!!** \n\nNo life flashing before my eyes, no thoughts of loved ones, none of that. \n\nLuckily, the vehicle rolled as it slid in, catching on the gunners turret and sticking on the ledge... \n\nThe only thing left not submerged is the back half of the truck diagonally, and A single door, which is uparmored and weighed like 300 lbs... all I can see is the window and some light from the inside... \n\nWe all amazingly egress through said door and claw our way into the bank, which is littered with needles, expended medical supplies, automotive trash, entrails, etc... \n\nAll of our weapons and sensitive items are lost to the pool of hell... the convoy ahead of us is a quarter mile away... we\u2019re in the middle of Iraq unprotected... we squated in a tight 360 and made it look like we were armed until the convoy finally realized we were missing and came back. \n\nThey spent the next 24 hours dredging the cess pool to recover the weapons... they hauled the truck back, pulled the engine, drained it, refilled it, and put it back in service... we spent the next 6 months riding around in the shit truck and every time we got in it all I could smell was the shit mud... \n\nThey gave us all Army Commendation Medals for saving our own asses...  \n\nTL:DR \nAlmost drowned in a cesspool in Iraq, got awarded medals for not dying.",

            "Wow OP. The brings me memories of a time where I heard something kind of similar.\n\n I was working as an electrician I'm Arizona at the time, mainly doing new home construction. That being said I typically worked with many different contractors regularly that I knew in a frequent basis.\n\n One day a plumber and his helper showed up on the job site mid-day. His Hispanic apprentice looked \ndisheveled and it appears like his clothes were muddy (it ain't mud my friends)\n\n I said hey man what's up with your helper and then he told me the story.\n\n They were working on a very old home in a old mining town called Bisbee in Arizona. A lot of houses there are typically from the late 1800s to early 1900s (I could tell another story in which an actually intact Model A car was found under the subfloor by a contractor)\n\nThey were at one of these houses which had a cesspool underneath the flooring of the basement.\nThe floor was made of wood which was in a rotten state.\n \nLong story short the helper fell through rotting wood and was then neck deep in shit.  I was told screaming ensued, for obvious reasons, and he pulled him out.  \n\nThe guy wanted to go immediately home for the obvious reasons but they were an hour away so his lead plumber didn't want to as he was more concerned about losing 2 hours job time for the travel. Dick move, yes, and I'd have probably quit.\nBut anyways he made him hose off with water outside and continued to work. I guess when they got back in town the guy wasn't concerned about going home anymore (ewwwww) but to each his own. And yes, he stunk, and BAD!\n\nI still shudder to this day thinking about it.",

While excavating one of the footers for the larger building we came across the septic tank for the hotel. I know exactly what you mean about condoms floating on top. In our case, the tank was older and made of concrete but had to be broken before we could fill it in. It surprisingly did not stink very much. As I was standing by watching an excavator with a hammer attachment sink to the bottom of the tank to punch holes in it, the solids oozed up to the top and almost made me lose my lunch.

        "selftext": "Not actually today, but yesterday. \n\nBut first, some background. \n\nMy almost 8 year old son with autism will fixate on certain things he hears (and the more related to body parts or functions the more he fixates) and repeat them. Over. And over. And over.\n\nOn the day in question I sat down on the couch and started watching The Office. My kids love it so they eventually all ended up in the living room with me watching. The episode in question was one where Michael and Dwight trick Jim in to driving with them to the Utica branch to \"prank\" them for trying to steal one of their employees. During the drive Dwight pees in to an empty soda can in the back seat. Michael notices and starts driving badly which causes Dwight to loose his balance and eventually say \"I think I cut my penis on the lid!\" \n\nI think you probably know where this is going. \n\nThe rest of that day and today my son repeated that line approximately 8 thousand times. He's still saying it to anyone in ear shot, including the neighbor kids and my super conservative mother. There's also nothing I can do about it. Bringing attention to it will just make it go on longer, so I just have to wait until it loses its comedic effect and wait for the next, highly inappropriate but hilarious phrase he decides to fixate on. Hoping by the time he goes to therapy tomorrow night he will have stopped saying it. Fingers crossed. \n\nTl;dr: my autistic son heard a line from the office that said \"I think I cut my penis on the lid!\" and won't stop repeating it to anyone and everyone within ear shot.\n\nEdit: first of all, holy smokes, I didn't think this would get the amount of attention it's getting and I'm totally blown away! Front page! Wow. Thank you for those of you who gave me awards and shared similar stories. I've loved reading them all! When I saw it getting so much attention it really made my night!\n\nSecond, it was pointed out by someone (sorry, I don't have time right now to find the comment and credit you, but I will later when I have more time to go back through the comments) that the correct usage is \"person with autism\" so I edited the body of the post to reflect that, thank you for the gentle reminder. \n\nThird, to all the people telling me I'm not a good parent or telling me that I shouldn't be letting my kids watch the office I just have one thing to say: you are a thief of joy.\n\nEdit 2: so I guess I should have looked more in to it before editing. The majority of replies have said that the preferred way to say it is \"person who is autistic\" or that it should be up to the individual on the autism spectrum to decided. So, I'm just going to leave it as is, but thank you all who have commented kindly on the topic.",

Little dude woke up and saw about 45 seconds of an episode. In that 45 seconds, Michael makes a comment about his relationship with Jan, summing it up by saying something like \"don't ever sleep with your boss.\" Little dude had no idea what it meant, but ever since we told him Michael was the voice of Gru, anything he says is gold. Well I bet you can guess which line he repeated to his teacher at preschool a few days later.",

One of the kids on her team missed the goal and she yelled \u201c(kid\u2019s name), you ignorant slut.\u201d \n\nIt took everything I had in my power not to laugh my ass off to the school administrators. Just repeatedly told them I\u2019d talk to her, hung up, called my husband and we both ended up in a crying laughing fit for a solid 10 minutes. \n\nParenting is interesting. Parenting an autistic kid is a whole other level. Interesting with a giant side of hot sauce. You have to laugh where you can. Obviously we told her that was inappropriate, but it was hard to keep a straight face for about a week.",

That being said, I should have known better. \n\nRelishing in my opportunity to channel David Attenborough, I explained that the elephant\u2019s skin is too thick around the body to eat, so scavengers begin at the butthole, which is the thinnest part of the elephants skin, and go from there. \n\nThe whole rest of this lovely family reunion was spent with my cousin taking the rest of the animals and re-enacting the scene during dinner, sound effects included. \n\nLesson learned.",

It is part and parcel of how he feels and thinks. I really think, no, I know, he would be a completely different person if not for his autism. Not a \"better\" person, or worse one, but still entirely different.\n\nThe people that come up with a lot of this stuff may be doing so with the best of intentions, but then THEY are deciding what is a good thing to be, or a bad thing.\n\nWe have no problem saying, \"he's handsome\". No one \"corrects\" us to say, \"He has handsome features\". We have no problem saying, \"She's a genius.\" No one corrects us to say, \"She has a genius I.Q.\"\n\nAll of these are correct and socially acceptable because they are accepted as positive. And using either version IS fine.. By communicating about autism differently, we are saying it is negative, something that should not be considered part of the person, but rather an illness, like a cold, or the flu. Something the person affected should try to disassociate from, or suppress. How insulting!\n\nIMHO, both \"has autism\" and \"is autistic\" are correct and acceptable.",

He started \"talking\" but nothing he said was understandable, especially to strangers...except one word. We were in a meeting with my military husband and some officers so they could decide how disabled our kids were. The youngest was jabbering away and suddenly looks at one of the officers and says \"A$$hole!\" We tried to pretend we didn't hear it, but everyone busted up laughing. \n\nBTW it is really split in the Autism community whether to say person with Autism or Autistic.  No matter what you say, people will tell you the other way is correct. Just use the wording you prefer until your son is old enough to have a preference. My oldest is 23 and she prefers \"Autistic\", so that's what I use. My other two don't care either way right now.",

            "The most important thing you can teach an autistic student is what\u2019s inappropriate and what\u2019s not. Rather than allow it or make excuses for his behavior (like he has an incurable mental disability so it\u2019s ok), these are teaching moments. As he gets into later school years, even in special needs programs, not knowing what\u2019s appropriate will separate him from his peers and teachers even more than his disability already does. (Picture obscene comments being made in a class of late middle schoolers while the teacher is talking). I\u2019m sure you already know this, but I wanted to encourage others to consider it more of a priority. The repeating thing is tough. Autistic students describe it as a movie that won\u2019t stop playing in their heads, over and over again. Being the parent or teacher of special needs students is a challenge that is hard to truly convey to someone who has never done it.\nSource: special needs teacher",

Bad news, you guys did me dirty by blasting my still fresh embarrassment  on the front page and apparently on a famous Portuguese radio show this morning. Cool, cool, cool. \n\nSo, on to the meaty love update. Once I realized the text blunder, I quickly texted him that it was not meant for him, with a crying emoji for good measure.

The Gods are cruel, but not that cruel. \n\nThis is where I should clarify that the original post was obviously a tad hyperbolic (just like that text, go figure). I slept well last night, and I also laughed. At myself, the blunder, just the ridiculous timing. What also got imprinted on me was that exact moment I wrote and sent that text. The moment he leaned and kissed me good night, I looking at him as I closed my apartment door, locking it and at once turning around and heavily sighing and smiling, keys still in hand. \n\nTwo weeks ago, he had proposed going on a walk at the park. I had an inkling somehow that after knowing each other for three years, he was going to finally, perhaps, become vulnerable and share a few things. I had been in a serious relationship when we met, and, what I know now to be out of respect and my iron clad boundaries, he never made any advances. But I was single now, and at the park, sitting there, together, he looked at me and said he had feelings for me. Long time, three-year long feelings. And right there at Prospect Park, on a clear night, under some 35 visible stars (we counted), he kissed me. Last night, it was my turn to be vulnerable, even if accidentally. \n\nFor once, I think I understand Ted. He was always the guy I wanted to throw my shoe at whenever his ridiculous face showed up on the screen (which was a lot).\n\nAs for the \u201clibrary\u201d, I\u2019m not Jane Austen, but I\u2019m a New Yorker, and the luxury of ample space is not something I recognize. My dream as a child refugee, growing up in deep poverty, was to have a dedicated place for all the books I could buy when I would grow up and have money. Here\u2019s a pic of my library nook that I built through vintage thrifting, DIY projects and patience: [The \u201cLibrary\u201d](https://imgur.com/gallery/20IAaXU) \n\n\nThis is it, folks. The update. \nI might prefer this life over any rom-com. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nThis just happened to me. Literally 10 minutes ago. I am dying. I am dead. End me now, O Holy Ghost. \n\n\nI thought this only happened in some poorly written rom-coms. The kind where life hardly imitates the real one. I want to bury myself and never come to see the light again. Why me? Oh, why me?! \n\nTen painfully long minutes ago, I, exalted by the wonderful date I went with this handsomely gorgeous man who also happened to be a friend of mine for the last three years, against my apartment door that I had just closed on his beautiful face, I typed these words that will fiercely haunt me now : \u201c Bitchhhh, I think I\u2019m going to end up marrying this guy!\u201d. \n\nThis was meant for my best friend, the only other soul I could muster to express my vulnerable feelings. \n\nI sent this deeply poetic text to him instead. \n\nDo you think there is a void big enough in this planet to hold all my misery? All the embarrassment? \n\nDo you think I can make a pact with the devil to turn back time? I would just need 10 minutes. That\u2019d be really nice. \n\nCan I please die now? Literal and metaphorical death is the only relief I might know.\n\nI am currently in my library, sprawled across the floor intently starring at the ceiling. Man, I think I\u2019ll be here forever.\n\nTL;DR - I mistakenly texted my date that I might end up marrying him as we just ended our date. Realized too late the text meant for my best friend was sent to him instead.",

Keep in mind we had only met for the first time 2 weeks ago.\n\nUnfortunately I exemplified my fuckup even more, as instead of playing it off cool, I messaged her a string of texts apologising for the slip of my tongue and that I didn't love her at all.

I put the bill in my wallet until I could get to the bank in a couple days\n\nOn my way home, I stopped at a sit-down restaurant and tipped my waitress with a five-dollar bill...you know where this is going, don't you?  The waitress was surprised and very happy and thankful, which I thought was a bit over the top for what amounted to about a 30% tip.\n\nComes time to deposit the $50 and guess what, it's nowhere to be found.  After puzzling for several days over where I might have put it, the neurons fire, the connection is made, and I realize that I had to have given it to the waitress, which would explain her reaction.\n\nWell, shit!  I hope she really needed it and I hope it was a blessing, but all I can think is I'm a dumbass.\n\nTL;DR  I was given a $50 bill which I gave to a waitress by accident, thinking it was a $5 bill, and I'm a dumbass.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the kind words, as well as the silver and gold.  Thanks too for the silly comments that made me laugh.  \n\nClearing up a few points:\n\nMy bill was a bit less than $15.  I *thought* I was leaving a $5 bill (about a 30% tip) but instead I left a $50 bill.\n\nI'm American.  All our bills are the same color and size.  Its extraordinarily rare that I've ever had a 50 dollar bill. Yes, yes, I acknowledge that those countries with different size / color paper money are onto something monumental.\n\nI'm a woman, grandma-aged, with grey hair and poor eyesight.  Not a dude.  In my college years I was a waitress, so I'm well aware of the hard work and the struggle.\n\nThe loss of the money is not a hardship by any means, but thank you to those kind-hearted souls who offered to reimburse me - your kindness made me want to cry.  I was just feeling so stupid for having made such an easy mistake.\n\nI do indeed believe in karma, and I hope that the $50 helped fill some of her needs.  The karma has already come back to me in the well wishes given here by my fellow Redditors.\n\nAs for all those commenting about losing money in a strip club in a similar way, Imma shake my head and say tsch tsch in a grandmotherly way.",

On our way out, I went back to the waitress and told her how sorry I was for my friends' behavior and gave her a $100 tip. At first she declined it and said there's no way she could accept it considering I was one of the less obnoxious ones and that their behavior wasn't my fault nor responsibility. I insisted and folded it up and put it in her hand. She just looked at me, smiled, and with tears welling up in her eyes she whispered a thank you as she gave me a big hug. I was kinda taken back by her reaction at first and when she pulled away wiping the years away she said \"I'm sorry! That was too much, I know. But I wasn't sure if I was gonna make my car payment this month and the bank would've taken it, and I have a two year old, so I can't be without a car\". My heart dropped and I suddenly understood her reaction.  Since I was making good money at the time and had little responsibility, financially speaking, I half turned, thought for a second, threw another $100 bill on the table as she was cleaning it up, pointed to it and said \"hey, you missed one.\" She looked up at me with her arms hanging, kinda shaking her head and I just walked away smiling at her. I wasn't trying to get anything out of it, although she was cute, it just felt good to help someone in their time of need. She needed it way more than I did and as I said, it just felt really good to go out of my way to help her, especially since my friends were being such tools to her.",

Everyone else was asleep. \nIt's a bit rainy and chilly, if that matters.\nAnyway, I felt something like a lump in my slipper. I took it off, shook it.. nothing came out. \n\nThen I felt something, very subtle, near my ankle. I reached down, but couldn't locate it. \nI tried to ignore it but kept feeling these tiny wiggles. I started panicking, thinking it was a spider. I began slapping my leg. At one point by my knee I felt a little lump, and that sent me running into the house screaming. (I am very afraid of spiders).\n\nI burst into my sisters room, turned her light on and removed my pants, all while shouting that something is in my pants my She woke up screaming- scared at my sudden intrusion. \nThe dogs promptly ran into her room, as well, confused.\n\nI tossed my pants at her and just kept shouting 'something in my pants!'. She first said it was nothing, then at my prompting she shook my pants (sweatpants). Nothing happened, she told me 'it's nothing, see? Goodnight.' \n\nI was relieved. I went to grab my pants again, to put them on ( I had been wearing no underwear under my pants, not my best decision).\n\nAnd my sister started screaming. I look and clinging into the crotch of the sweatpants was a fucking MOUSE. I tossed the pants at her because, well, I panicked. \n\nWe were shouting at each other, both saying do something! The dogs were barking at the confusion. Finally, our parents entered the room. We just shouted at them that there was a mouse. \n\nMy father was like ok. And my mom asked why I wasn't wearing pants and then I started shouting it's in my pants! All over again.\n\nWe put the mouse outside. It was very much alive. \n\n\nTL;DR  tonight I fucked up because a mouse was in my pants.\n\nEdit: So first of all I am still amazed at how much attention this received. I posted this after my family went back to bed, while I drank a hot tea to calm down a bit. I figured maybe a couple of people would upvote or comment, based on my experiences posting in the past.. When I checked Reddit this morning I was overwhelmed with the amount of comments and attention my experience  got. I showed this to my sister and she had me send this post to her. She absolutely loved it. \n\nI would like to address a few things brought up in the comments:\n  I am a woman. I wasn't wearing underwear, but I was wearing an over sized tee shirt that covered my vulva- only part of my butt was exposed. \n\nI am not sure why the mouse freaked me out so much. I think probably because a mouse was the last critter I expected to see. \n\nI am an adult (probably makes this fuck up worse) who currently lives with my parents because of financial and personal issues. I left an abusive spouse  and am working on a divorce. \n\nMy family and my sister are still laughing about last nights scenario. My dad had his own mouse experience when I was a  kid which he brought up today when the mouse in my pants was discussed at thanksgiving dinner. We went ice skating with my dad when my sisters and I were little and he suddenly exited the rink. He removed his hockey skate and a mouse ran out. All the kids sitting on the benches getting ready to go skate were shouting about the mouse. My dad said he felt like the skate was tighter than it should have been. Today he told me 'welcome to the club' and high fived me, haha. \n\nAnd I have been enjoying reading everyones own stories about critters who got to close for comfort!",

Lol.",
            "Lol, many years ago I was sitting in my home office, which has a door that opens up onto our back yard.  I had turned my chair around and was facing the door when a little field mouse ran into the room and straight up the inside of my pants leg.  I too shouted and ran to the door kicking my leg into the air and the mouse was flung out into the back yard. \n\nIt freaked me out.",

            "I once had a gecko fall off the curtain rod that ran directly over the head of my bed, and land with a splat on my cheek as I was sleeping.  \n\nNeedless to say, I stopped sleeping, flew out of bed while swatting at my face and reaching for the light switch at what felt like the speed of light thanks to the adrenaline.  \n\nGecko just sat there on my bed looking at me with a befuddled expression on its face.  \n\nAfter I caught my breath and reassured my testicles that it was safe to descend again, I scooped up the little guy and plopped him back out of my bedroom window.  Which I promptly closed.",

            "I got knocked when I was about 7 by my mum cos I accidentally threw a mouse at my sister. We were sat round the breakfast table and I could feel like a string and assumed it was from my brother's coat which was hung on the back of it. But it didn't feel right. So I picked it up to inspect it and it was a dead mouse the cat had brought in. I just panicked, went ugh and threw it. It landed in my sisters cereal, splashed milk all over her face and started screaming. It wasnt like I did it on purpose.",
            "Ha, same thing happened to my daughter a few years ago!  Yes it matters that it was rainy and chilly, those mice just want to stay warm and it ran right up the inside of her jeans after she stepped in some tall grass.\n\nShe had no idea what it was and said \"there's something in my pants\", then she started dancing and screaming and crying \"there's SOMETHING IN MY PANTS!\" as this lump wiggles higher and higher up her leg. \n\n As a concerned dad I dutifully fish out my phone and start recording video while my wife who thinks it could be a smaller and is deathly afraid of snakes (she's jumped into my arms after noticing a large earthworm next to her) dutifully reached down the front of my daughter's jeans and pulls out this little mouse face.  It scampers back off into the brush and everyone breathes a sigh of relief before they start scolding me for having lousy dad reflexes.",
            "This happened to my Nanna once. Our cat brought a mouse in but didn\u2019t have the balls to kill it, so we were all frantically trying to catch it before it had a million babies. \n\nMy Nanna reached down to grab it but it just disappeared. We were all confused looking for it until my Nanna shouted \u201cI think it\u2019s in my pants!\u201d\n\nLuckily the poor thing was too traumatised to run anymore so she was able to grab him and put him back outside.",
            "wow that reminds me of my childhood trauma, when I was living in Africa, I was 8 and just came back from school. I decided to take a short nap when I awoke to a sudden tickle in my ear. I was thinking why is my ear tickling? But before I could finish my train of thought, an ear wig came out of my ear and flopped onto the floor. I screamed like a girl.\n\nHere's what it looks like :\n https://imgur.com/NEGZe0F.jpg",

I screamed, it bit me twice as i was trying to smack it away. My mom, without thinking, reached up my pants and pulled out A FAT ASS CENTIPEDE. it was HUGE. She threw it directly into the fire, ya know, like a badass. I will forever be afraid of centipedes",

            "One time I saw a big spider crawling around my hockey gear. I tried crushing it but it escaped and got inside my bag full of equipment.

Both of us have worked for the company for several years and have a great relationship. She\u2019s was 41 and I was 29 at the time this happened, both happily married. Her name is Kate and my wife\u2019s name is Kari, similar names on my phone...\n\nSo, I usually stay late in the office to get myself ahead for the next day. Usually her and I are the last to leave the office.\n\nThis was one of those occasions and she texted me she was leaving and to go out the back door. In the meantime, my wife was going on a trip with her sister the following morning and she was texting me about some stuff to pick up from the store in the way home. I jokingly texted her \u201cok but we need to fuck before you go.\u201d \n\nMe half paying attention to my phone I accidentally texted that to my boss after she had said she was leaving for the day.....talk about matching the context perfectly. But it was too late.....Verizon\u2019s 4G network shot that into the sky and in her inbox before I could pray to Jesus to take it back. \n\nI realized what I had just done and said to her before she responded \u201cKate...I don\u2019t expect you to understand, but that was for my wife.....\u201d\n\nI could hear her laughing from across the office and she responded to the text \u201ctry again, I\u2019m out of you\u2019re league ;) I\u2019ll see you Monday\u201d \n\nSo yeah, story for the grandkids about grandpa being a dumbass.\n\nTL;DR: was having a conversation with my boss and wife at the same time and accidentally texted my boss a sexual advance.\n\nEdit: wow I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up like it did.  Yeah my boss is very relaxed and I work for a great company. We\u2019re all cool with each other for the most part. Jury is still out whether I could smash though....",

I didn\u2019t think much of it since I assumed he just smelled the leftover fragrances of cooking garlic in the house.\n\nMore time goes by, and I start emitting more odors, and he asks me how much I ate so I told him.

            "A few years ago right after moving to Florida, I was being ravaged by mosquitoes. I read about the benefits of garlic intake as a natural deterrent. So I got a bunch of garlic pills and added a bunch of garlic to most of my meals. A few days later I went for a walk at lunch, in about 90 degrees. I had a bit of sweat build up but was very happy to get back into the AC. While sitting in my office a number of people were walking past asking about who had garlic \u2018something\u2019 for lunch. It wasn\u2019t until then I got a whiff of myself and was hit by a sweaty garlic stench. \n\nFor the next week the smell got worse and worse, even with the slightest perspiration. Being in FL, basically anytime you\u2019re outside, you\u2019re going to sweat. I basically stunk 24/7. I very quickly cut the pills and limited my intake after that, and it probably took about a week to clear it out my system. The garlic kept the mozzy\u2019s away, as well as any other human being.",

            "Could you have not roasted the garlic enough? I eat A LOT of roasted garlic, precisely because it doesn't do the same thing fresh garlic does, namely, it doesn't smell the day after.\n\nMy dad - a wonderful man - loves garlic, but roasted garlic is not a thing where I'm from. He eats it fresh, all year long, but especially in the winter, because of its \"germ-repelling properties\" (I have no idea if there is anything to that claim). The point is, he loves garlic super extra very much and it isn't unheard of for him to finish a whole head in one sitting.\n\nI have learned my lesson as a kid - NEVER EVER enter my parents bedroom in the morning (before it's been aired out) after dad ate garlic. I cannot describe how awful the smell is. It is most definitely not the awesome aroma of garlic we all know and love. It's a foul and corrupted version of it. I'm gagging just typing this out. Blech.\n\nRoasted garlic, however, is a perfection. Also garlic comfit and there is this one recipe for creamy garlic chicken where the cloves are used whole and they become so soft and yummy that... god, I'm hungry now. LOL.",

I love garlic (always have) but until I was in my early 30s I satisfied my craving by sprinkling garlic powder onto my food prior to cooking. When I got married, my Husband (who is a Saint in many ways, including not minding my garlic fetish and resulting stench) found out that Costco had huge jars of peeled garlic cloves for sale. He bought me one and I happily munched on the cloves as an accompaniment to certain meals (pork steaks, pasta). I brush my teeth and shower regularly, but I wasn't aware that the garlic aroma was seeping out of my pores. I was alerted to that fact one Friday at work when my supervisor called me into her office at 5PM and first asked \"Do you keep garbage in your desk?\" \"Huh? No, of course not.\" \"Well, 'Cindy' complained to 'Zack' \\[the owner of the company\\] that you, well, have an odor and that it's unbearable.\"\n\nOh my, I was so humiliated I could barely contain my tears as I left (and, to her credit, the supervisor did apologize to me on Monday and said that she'd worried about me all weekend because I'd seemed so upset). I bought a big bundle of raw parsley at the supermarket and ate most of it by Monday, because I'd read that parsley is supposed to \"neutralize\" garlic aroma.",

Meals were the only time we were allowed in the same room, albeit social distanced on other ends of the dining hall with about 20 feet between us. Suffice to say, the boys smelling us for 3 hours a day outweighed reducing our risk of West Nile.\n\nEdit:  In all fairness, at least the woman tried.

I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.\n\nI parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.\n\nThat is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, \"huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I'll be in it?\" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, \"ACTION!\"\n\nI start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, \"I'm not suposed to be here, am I?\" He immediately shook his head no.\n\nSo, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. I think to myself, \"if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby.\" \n\nI make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn't screw anything up!\n\nAfter a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they're blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!\n\nOnly at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells \"CUT!\", and the two people in front of me turn around. \n\nTurns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, \"Uh, I'm sorry.\" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.\n\nTL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation.",

After a particularly striking part of Mr. Lawesa's speech, my little 12ish year-old self became overcome with pride, and I leaned over to my dad to say, \"spoken like a true polack!\" The look of horror, anguish, fury, and disgust coming from my family and those around me followed by a seething, whispered rebuke from my dad quickly informed me that Polack is not actually interchangeable with \"Polish person.\" \n\nThe problem was, I'd heard many jokes and stories (many from my own dad) told in my childhood where polack was thrown around as if it weren't a terrible, derogatory term.

The entire class, made up of mostly black people, gasped. I looked around and they were just staring at me in shock and horror. One guy pulled me aside after class and said that 'nappy' was sort of like another 'n' word and that white people shouldn't really use it, as it's typically used by white people to insult black people's hair. Black people used it in jest, but it wasn't cool for a white person to say it. \n\nI had no fucking idea and I had basically been calling everyone with messed up hair 'nappy headed' for my entire life. Granted I went to a mostly black school (I was one of like four white kids for the first six years) so I guess I just picked this up as a phrase and people knew me enough to know that I didn't mean it racially, so no one had ever bothered to say 'Kevin, you shouldn't say that.' \n\nWell hearing that felt awful and made me feel gross. The guy could see that and was really cool about it though, and I think he told everyone else and it turned out to be a fun job.

        "selftext": "**TLDR: Two years ago, I forget to pay a speeding traffic ticket while roadtripping through a rural state. I got pulled over for speeding again and was arrested with a warrant for the unpaid ticket. I just spent two nights in the slammer and now have a criminal record with multiple misdemeanor convictions \u2013 and a crazy story for life.**\n\n**LMK in the comments if anyone wants to see my mugshot! I\u2019ll link to it if enough people want to see. May as well own it at this point! \\[Edit: Link below\\]**\n\nI \\[28 F\\] live in NorCal. My best friend from college lives in the Midwest. We're super close and have a long tradition of traveling back and forth to see one another.\n\nI've often done multi-day roadtrips to visit her. When driving through, I've gotten pulled over a few times in small towns in the middle of nowhere. But they always just let me go with a warning or speeding ticket. NBD and totally worth it to see my bestie.\n\nEnter 2020. We're stuck in quarantine and don\u2019t get to see one another. We decide we'll do a road trip as soon as we both get vaccinated. We flip to see who has to drive to see who. I lose and have to travel to her. All good.\n\nSo a few weeks ago, we're all set. I cash in my vacation days at work, load up my car, and am off to see my friend for the first time in forever. Yay!\n\nAfter a few days on the road, I'm driving down a stretch of interstate in the middle of nowhere. I have the cruise control on and am rocking out in my Prius going about 85. (Little do I know, the speed limit is 60.) Eventually, I hear a blaring sound over the K-pop in my car. Police sirens. Followed soon by flashing reds and blues. Damn.\n\nI pull over and turn off the keys. All good. I can charm my way out of this one. Easy.\n\nOut steps this \"bubba\" who looks like the stereotypical patrol cop. I queue up the doe eyes. He's going to let me off with a warning, I can feel it.\n\nIn Midwestern accent, he says, \"License and insurance ma'am.\" Very abrupt. Something is off.\n\nAs he runs my license in the squad car, I get a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Then it hits me. The last time I came through this state, I got a speeding ticket. And it's still sitting in my glove box. Unpaid. More than two years later!\n\nOkay. No big deal. That's going to be a crazy fine, but nothing I can't handle. What's the worst that could happen?\n\nWell, as it turns out . . .\n\n\"Ma'am, I need you to step out of the vehicle. You have warrants for reckless driving and failure to appear.\"\n\nMy heart sinks. My hands are shaking. The words don't come out. All I can muster is, \"Wait, no.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, step out of the car.\" I'm about to throw up. I open the door and get out.\n\nThat's when he says the words I never in million years thought I'd hear: \"Ma'am, put your hands behind your back, you're under arrest.\" Before I know it, I'm sitting in the back of a squad car, handcuffed and bawling my eyes out. Goodbye, Prius. Goodbye, roadtrip. Hello, criminal record.\n\nAt the jail, I finally piece together what's going on. I have bench warrants and misdemeanor charges from that unpaid ticket two years ago. (It was another 85+ in a 60!) When I originally got the ticket, I had a spaz moment, stuck it my glove box, went to see my friend, and completely forgot about it. Whoops. Apparently they sent me court notices to an old address that I never checked. Double whoops. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\n\nI get fingerprinted and have my mugshot taken. It's like an out-of-body experience. They stick me in a cell with a bunch of methheads and tweakers (who actually turn out to be kinda friendly). I wonder if I should make up some badass cover story about why I got arrested. I tell them the truth. Before long, I've got a jailhouse nickname: \"Cali space cadet.\"\n\nIt all goes downhill from there. Long story short, I end up staying in the podunk jail for two nights. They won\u2019t let me bond out because the bench warrant was from another, nearby county that requires in-person appearances and picks up defendants on rotation. At 4AM, they come and pick up a bunch of us at the jail. I \u2013 along with about 30 other people in the same boat \u2013 get transported into court, decked out in orange and fully shackled.\n\nOne by one, the judge starts calling people up. When my turn comes, I shuffle up to the bench and bawl out the story. The judge looks pissed. She starts giving me a longwinded lecture about how I should have paid the ticket. I\u2019m thinking the same thing and just nod along. I feel like an idiot and barely hold it together. By the time it's over, the judge seems to take pity. I bond outta there.\n\nEventually, I get in touch with my BF. After flipping out, she helps me rescue my Prius from impound and find a lawyer to deal with everything.\n\nAll-in-all, with the three charges, court costs, and fines, my original $300 ticket ends up costing over $4,500!\n\nAfter more than 48 hours behind bars, I get my car back and meet up with my bestie. I tell her I owe her bigtime for helping me get out of the joint and ask what I can do to repay her. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2013 post this to r/tifu!\u201d\n\nEdit: Reposted for length.\n\nEdit2: Thanks to everyone for reading and commenting! I'm learning alot. Here is my mugshot: [https://i.imgur.com/pfDfa7W.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pfDfa7W.jpg)\n\nEdit3: Thank you all so much for the comments! We are totally blown away by the reception of this post. I had no idea so many people had similar experiences out there. I'm touched by all the stories. I'm really taking your comments to heart. I am never - ever - going to drive that way again!\n\nChanged some offcolor word choices in response to people's comments. Also, for both tickets, I was driving on a straight rural highway with no other cars around. I still completely fucked up by speeding and 100% deserved to get arrested for the warrant, but just wanted to clarify that since alot of people brought it up.\n\nEdit4: Thaaank you all so much! I really appreciate all the awards and thoughtful comments. This was super eye-opening. I never thought this post would blow up but am so glad to have learned from this experience. \u2764",

            "Small towns and counties in the Midwest make a good portion of their revenue from speeders on the major highways.\n\nI'll guess that you were in Kansas on I-70 or Nebraska (maybe Iowa) on I-80.\n\nThey live for this shit.  Local cops get reviewed on the number of tickets they write.  Local judges enjoy being a source of revenue.  Local lawyers get a payday when you hire them to deal with it for you.  They make \"excessive speeding\" a reckless driving thing because then the fine is more.\n\nHere's a tip.  When you get a ticket from a rural area, when you get home, find out the Prosecuting Attorney's name and number and give their office a call.  Tell them you'd like to plead guilty and ask if you can get a break on the fine and maybe the reckless driving reduced because (insert good excuse here, money's tight, insurance will go up, points on drivers license, etc.).  Many times, if you're pleasant and obsequious, they will allow you to enter a plea to a lesser charge and maybe reduce the fine.\n\nFun thing is, when you write your check, it'll be made out to whoever the Prosecuting Attorney is, not the court.  At least in my experience that's what happened.  They don't want you in jail, they want your money.",

They get away with it in CA because everyone goes 20 over, and with all the cars on the road, the police can't do much about it, so it just sort of happens and everyone is used to it.\n\nHere in flyover country, we haven't developed that culture of speeding, and you *absolutely will* get pulled over for doing much past 5 over. \n\nWhen CA-ifornians relocate to, or travel through, places outside CA, they generally have trouble understanding that. They very casually talk about driving 20 over, and most of us around here are half horrified at that.\n\nI can see this same misunderstanding in OP. The fact that she was going 25 over the speed limit and thought she'd just get a warning is hilarious to me. I'm not degrading or demeaning here, she's from an area where 25 over is kind of a cultural norm. \n\nThe other attitude is that they are \"in the middle of nowhere\" and safe to speed, when in actuality, the ratio of cops to motorists in \"the middle of nowhere\" is considerably higher than it is in most urban areas, and the cops have less to do.

The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.\n\nI am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.\n\nThe day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.\n\nAbout an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.\n\nI have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. \"I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today.\" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.\n\nOther than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.\n\nIt took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.\n\nI was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.\n\nI came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.\n\nTL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting.

We didn\u2019t expect it as soon as we got it though, which was earlier in this week. He starts dialysis Monday. \nAnyways, in the heat of explaining to me the medical call he had earlier that morning, he said something along the lines of, \u201cI have two years to get the transplant.\u201d \n\nThe pessimist in me took that sentence and ran to the darkest depths, thinking \u201che has two years left of LIFE.\u201d I\u2019ve been a mess for the last two days, and that\u2019s putting it sweetly. \nSo today, I was pressing him about all the places we needed to apply, ways we could get the word out, etc, and I mentioned that we only had a two year deadline. His face fell into confusion, and he was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I explained to him what I THOUGHT he had explained to me, that he only had bittersweet time left. Let me tell you that this poor man instantly came to me in pure concern, telling me I totally misunderstood and that he, in fact, would not die in two years. \n\nI have never felt so happy to be so dumb in my entire life. \n\nTL;DR: I misunderstood my fianc\u00e9\u2019s diagnosis for a death sentence. It\u2019s not.\n\nsmolEDIT: the \u201ctwo years\u201d thing was apparently just the time frame to reapply to stay on the transplant list! \n\nEDIT: HOO BOY I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO BLOW UP.

Also I would suggest anything nice he could leave at home just in case it gets bleach or blood on it (tiny accidents could happen.)\n\nPlease stick to their dialysis diet, it may require a huge amount of time and energy spent initially, but once you get used to it his body will appreciate it.\n\nThis one is important and it goes for everyone who is going through something difficult. Remember who is in the chair. Sometimes we can get lost in our daily lives and start to get stressed out or irritated with the little things that get asked of us or that we go through in our days. It helped me to remind myself that no matter what I am feeling (stress, frustrated, sad, emotional, irritated, etc) that they may not only be feeling the same, but that they are the ones going through the pain/suffering of the treatments. This refocusing has helped our relationship and their health as well as mine, because through all this please remember to not only keep them healthy, but yourself as well.\n\nAlso remember to listen. Listen to what they say. Whether its asking how dialysis was that day for them or just anything else in their lives. Its important that through this all not to just have a helping hand but a genuine listener at you side, and this goes for anyone really. This will be a key factor in really being there because you might notice some things they don't or are able to come up with other ways to help them in this process.\n\nI hope the years go by with the best of wishes and I hope you two take care of yourselves well after the transplant op. \n\nTldr; dialysis tips: gey them warm things, time killers, keep them comfortable, keep in touch with their doctor, keep to their diet, refocua every now and then, keep yourself healthy too, and listen to them.",

He flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. He even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. I really wanted to show him how I much I appreciated all his gestures, so I thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. I start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. He gives me the signal and I activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view I can. That's where the fuck up occurs. I tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. It took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time I figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. At this point, I just sit there and take it up the nose because I'll be damed if I let man gravy get on anything. I immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but I didn't get it all. Not long after, I feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. I still have the smell of semen in my nose. \n\nTldr: A dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.\n\nEdit: Holy fuck, I did not expect this to blow up like it did.

Although it\u2019s normal for us to shower together, we have to share a standing shower with minimal space so it can get pretty cramped. Things started getting a little steamy, and not just because the hot water. I decided to kneel down and give him head. I\u2019ll spare the details because I\u2019m definitely not an erotic writer (sorry!). We finished and he reached around me for a hug with a smile on his face, and then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to pass out\u201d in my ear. \n\nIn the seconds before the next series of events, my first thought was that he was joking. Then his head hit my shoulder and I was left with a 6\u20193 man\u2019s full weight in my arms. The shower is wet, everything is slippery, and the next thing I know is the weight of both of our bodies crashing into the shower door, which opened, and out spilled my naked body. I look over - my hand is still supporting my husband\u2019s head whose body is slumped inside the too-tiny shower. His eyes flutter open, realizing that he is on the floor of the shower and his wife is laying halfway outside of it. We both immediately get to each other and repeatedly asked \u201care you okay? I\u2019m okay, are you okay?\u201d. \n\nThankfully, neither one of us were really hurt. My husband bit his lip and I have a giant purple bruise across my butt cheek where I landed. He said he remembers having a long dream, even though he was only out for a few seconds. He compares it to when you\u2019re about to die and you see your life flash before your eyes. \n\nTL;DR - I gave my husband a blowjob in the shower. He climaxed, passed out, and we both collapsed in a naked mess, bruising my bum and our egos.",

She's over it today. \n\n-----\n\nEdit 2: This was the first and only time the screensaver had ever popped up on the TV. The TV is never left idling, it's only really ever used for streaming tv or music. If it's not doing that, it's turned off. No, my kids did not see it. And the feature was immediately turned off. \n\n------\n\nI get a text today at work from my wife talking about how the kitchen TV(we have a 49\" fire tv mounted on the wall near the kitchen island) is showing family photos as a screensaver. I didn't think anything of it, and just continued on with my day at work. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later all hell broke loose. \n\nMy wife calls me and screams at me that my mother in law was washing dishes when a picture of my very hard dick shows up on the screen next to her. Now, I don't know about you guys, but when I send my wife sexy pics, I tend to close crop them for effect. So she got an eyeful of about 3 feet of cock. \n\nI immediately start cry laughing. I'm one of those people with a REALLY dark sense of humor. My wife is not amused. She's screaming at me, and all I can think to say is, \"Well, it's not like she's never seen a dick before. How do you think you were made?\"\n\nYeah. \n\nWrong answer. \n\nBut at least at this point I can hear my mother in law laughing in the background. \n\nOh yeah, forgot to tell you that she lives with us. So this isn't something that I don't have to live with immediately. \n\nSo I get home just before dinner, and it's SUPER awkward. Like everyone is quiet. My kids are none the wiser, they have no idea what happened a while earlier. So I finally look at my mother in law and ask her how her day was. Both of us were laughing before I even finished the sentence. My wife is still pissed. She went to bed and didn't even watch any TV. \n\nTL;DR\n\nMy mother in law saw a blown up 3 foot image of my cock while washing dishes.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn't happen today but when I was in the 8th Grade.\n\n8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the \"Birds and the Bees\" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.\n\nOne day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let's just say I was a little too rough with my ding\\-ding.\n\nAfter I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had \"spatooshed\". I just assumed I over\\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.\n\nI was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said \"Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you'll be fine in no time.\" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says \"Thats it, I can't take it anymore. We're going to the hospital.\"\n\nOh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.\n\nWe eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. I didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\\-dangle. So they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. At this point it's been 2\\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum \"Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda.\" Right away she yells WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look.\n\nThe nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.\n\nThe surgery was quick and I didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to \"normal\". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would've lost him.\n\nI ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.\n\nLesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.\n\nTL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the Gold kind stranger! Glad my story could make your day. :)",

I take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my Dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. Today was just a routine visit. My folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so I visit with Dad while driving their garbage to the dump. As we are talking I bring up a video I had seen and suggested I share it with him. He agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests I find the video while he does something else. \n\nCommence Fuckup. \nMy Dad has an older model Desktop PC that is quite temperamental and only likes to use Google Chrome. I go to open a window and see that my Dad has 20+ tabs open. All of them were different profiles on FetLife. For those who don't know, FetLife is like MySpace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). I just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. Unfortunately the tab I opened Chrome to was my parents profile page. I not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; I also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. So now, not only do I know my parents are pretty kinky, I also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey. \n\nTL;DR:\nOpened Google Chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular. \n\nEDIT:words\n\nEDIT2: WOW my first Gold!

So I was doing that...turns out, there wasn't a separate t-mobile album for each number, just one folder for everyone. And in that folder I found out that my parents were into taking suggestive photos. I saw my mom posed naked and I saw my dad's genitalia. They took these pictures IN THE KITCHEN. The images are STILL burned into my mind and it will rear its ugly head every once in a while just to ruin my day.\n\nOh and then my sister and I went looking for presents once and so we opened a closet that was usually locked in my parents' room. I can't even tell you how much porn was in there--like shelves of it, and I can still picture some very kinky ones that my poor young eyes shouldn't have seen. And then the sex toys... there was a dildo that had to be like 5 inches wide. Where the hell were they putting that thing?? And which one of them was using it??? These questions haunt me.

I thought the visits to the sites have decreased.   \n\\- Another few weeks pass by and I realize that things had now moved to Incognito as I found that the download folder was filled with porn videos.   \n\\- I was impressed with my dad going incognito because it was just the two of us that use the PC and he did all that so that his son wouldn't \"discover porn links\". \\*Ahem\\*I've got\\*ahem\\*a hard disk\\*ahem\\*full of\\*ahem\\*porn\\*ahem ahem ahem\\*   \n\\- A few months went by and one day I see that the downloads are all gone and there's no porn anymore in the downloads folder on the PC.    \n\\- I couldn't believe this. Did my dad stop watching porn? Nehhhh! I opened the download manager and see the logs and the visit was consistent. But the videos were deleted.!  \n\n\nNote: I find it cute and funny that he would delete all that just so his son wouldn't discover things. I've never left any signs that I have noticed his activity so all that he did was out of his own thoughts.   \n\n\nSuper Note: Although awkward, I find it really proud that the porn that he had in there, all the vids and the links, were the kind porn that I preferred watching. Each time I opened a link, I hoped I didn't end up on a kinky / fetish video and I never did. Much of the porn that he had were the ones I had liked before. I'm my dad's son! :)   \n",

            "This happened to me too! I had wicked diarrhea and constipation and I felt my diva cup come out while straining my sphincter. I started panicking because I couldn\u2019t just flush it, and I wasn\u2019t bright enough to think of gloves. So I stood up and looked in the bowl and I saw it floating there, amongst my shit. I closed my eyes and reached in, only to turn up empty handed. I started pawing at the shit water, but I\u2019d reached my limit. I was done. I flushed my shit and off my diva cup went. \n\nI washed my hands, scrubbed them clean and hopped in the shower. I was really upset that I just flushed away $40. But I started thinking \u201cwhat if it never came out?\u201d So I reached inside and guess what?! It was still in! I was relieved at first, but then I realized I stuck my bare hand in bloody poop water for no reason. \n\n:-) i hate my life :-)\n\nEdit: I wasn\u2019t wearing my glasses. I think, when I looked into the toilet, my brain just said, \u201cit\u2019s there! Grab the cup! Now!!!!\u201d It all happened so fast. Too fast. Wear ur glasses when u shit kids.",

        "selftext": "This happened in 2007 but I have flashbacks at every airport.\n\nI was living in Canada and my very frugal Polish girlfriend would complain about how expensive non-applicator tampons are. For men (like me) who didn't or don't know this, there are apparently two types of tampon; one that looks like a little spaceship that helps you launch the tampon up your vajayjay, and the other that resembles a cotton torpedo that you stuff up there without any plasticky assistance. She was very frustrated that, for a bit of tightly wound cotton, you had to pay so much to plug up the ol' punani.\n\nFortunately for her, I was going to Europe, where tampons were (and perhaps still are?) much cheaper. Specifically, I was going to Poland, where non-applicator tampons could be bought individually wrapped and in ginormous plastic bags for a handful of z\u0142oty. Always looking to save a loonie, my girlfriend insisted that she place an order with me for as many tampons as I could fit into a suitcase. Ever the loving boyfriend, I obliged.\n\nFor those wondering how many tampons can be tightly stuffed into a suitcase, it's about five thousand.\n\nLittle did I know of the carnage I'd face upon landing. As I approached baggage claim, I heard a mixture of confused mumbling and embarrassed laughter from around the carousel. From a distance, it looked like polystyrene packing pellets had come out of some unfortunate passenger's bag. It took a few moments for me to realise that those pellets were in fact my tampons. All 5,000 of my tampons.\n\nA strap on my soft-sided bag had got caught on the baggage delivery mechanism, and the bag was old and ragged enough that it tore open like a paper bag. My life flashed before my eyes. My instincts kicked in. And then, like the cheapest, thriftiest, most penny-pinching Pole, I launched myself upon the carousel and started grabbing up tampons.\n\nI think I must have stuffed a few hundred in my jacket pockets and down the front of my shirt before I even realised what I was doing. Needless to say, I'd garnered quite an audience, and nobody looked... amused. In fact, they all looked a bit alarmed that a scruffy, bearded man was snatching up tampons with no snatch on a wife or teenage daughter to be seen.\n\nBizarrely, I decided at this point that I could probably still get away with pretending it wasn't my bag to begin with, so I quietly skulked away with my other suitcase and headed through immigration. Which, in retrospect, must have made me look like an opportunistic tampon thief.\n\nInitially, my girlfriend saw the funny side, until her grandmother -- good ol' Babcia, God rest her soul --  insisted I was an abusive partner for having failed to collect them all. I failed her, apparently, and my lack of dedication to my woman reflected poorly on my already wavering image of manhood. Babcia drove me back to the airport and insisted I fess up and try to collect the rest.\n\nWhich is when I learned that the baggage staff had collected them up, and a bunch of employees had divvied them up to take home. So if you work at YVR and are still plugging up at the expense of my shame, you're welcome. My cheeks are as red as your tampons.\n\n**TL;DR:** Brought 5,000 tampons from Poland to Vancouver; bag burst open on the baggage carousel and I snatched up many of those tampies like a champ.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks so much for the awards and karma! No, we're not still together. Realised I was gay about a year later; can't help but think this had something to do with it.\n\nI also wanted to address the NSFW tag, which I added, not the Reddit mods. I did the \"would my own boss approve of seeing this on my screen?\" litmus test. I decided she'd have no issue with vaginas, menstruation and tampons -- as nobody should! -- but she certainly wouldn't approve of my writing style. In case yours doesn't either, it's NSFW!",

In case anyone else was  curious about how much 5,000 tampons REALLY is:\n\nLet's say a woman uses 3 tampons a day for a five day cycle. Therefore, 15 tampons are used per cycle. There are 12 cycles per year (roughly). That's about 180 tampons used per year. \n\nThis is all based in a fairly regular cycle, airing on the generous side. \n\n5,000 divided by 180 is about 27 and a half years worth of tampons. \n\nThis would easily sustain a 25-year-old woman to menopause. \n\nIn conclusion, lol.\n\n\nEdit: In my silliness, I did underestimate the amount of cycles per year (12 vs 22). If you have a normal 28 day cycle, 365 divides into 28 22 times. This ends up being 14 years as others have estimated. \n\nHowever, birth control, pregnancy, and other factors can mess with regularity, which could extend the supply's usefulness a significant amount.",

My skin is extremely sensitive and shaving it makes it worse so I'm constantly trying new ways to stop the irritation. I had the great idea of trying out coconut oil as a moisturizer. I had bought some that day and it seemed to work fine. I leave the shower and go to bed with my husband.\n\nAs we lay in bed one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. Everything is great and I feel nice and moisturized untill my husband starts complaining about his penis burning. He starts freaking out and the skin on his penis got bright red. He freaks out and goes to the shower to rinse it with cold water. The pain just got worse for him and I quickly drove him to the hospital. He was practically crying in pain. He had developed small red blisters all over his penis and the skin around it. We were both freaking out and I explained to the doctors everything that had happened.\n\nWell it turns out my husband is allergic to coconuts and had a severe skin reaction to the coconut oil I used. He is now in bed resting with a sore penis and a severe coconut phobia. So if anyone has any tips for a new moisturizer let me know.\n\nTL;DR I used coconu oil as a moisturizer before having sex with my husband. He had a severe skin reaction to it and developed burning blisters on his penis.\n\nEdit: Wow this is crazy thank you for all the awards! especially the golden coconuts, very fitting. I'm glad my husbands suffering has brought you joy, he is having a great time reading all the comments. And thank you for all the advice, all your tips are appreciated!",

A traditional wet shave will give you the closest shave possible, for a much smoother and cleaner feel. **It can also help reduce the uncomfortable effects of shaving, such as ingrown hairs.** Though many men think they have sensitive skin, as a result of suffering from razor burn and other side effects when shaving, in actual fact it\u2019s likely just down to the type of razor and products they\u2019re using. **Most of the negative effects from shaving come as a result of not having the proper lubrication, often down to cheaper modern products. Taking the time to do a wet shave can be much kinder on the skin and reduce any after effects.**\n\nBeyond this, wet shaving can work out far cheaper than using plastic multi-blade cartridge razors. Although a safety razor and shaving brush require an initial investment, replacement blades are much cheaper for safety razors and shaving soaps and creams will last much longer than a shaving foam or gel.\n\nThen, on the less scientific level, there are the other benefits from the traditional approach. For example, the aesthetics: a shaving soap in its wooden bowl will always look better on the side of the sink than an aerosol can filled with chemical gloop.\n\nOn top of this, a lot of men who have switched their modern razors for a traditional approach have found that **the whole process becomes less of a hassle and more of a pleasure:** carefully shaving with quality products that give a more luxurious feel will not only get better results, but warrant a more enjoyable process.\n\n**What it comes down to is a far better shave that reduces any possible skin irritation and becomes far more enjoyable overall than simply your morning hassle.**",

If I don\u2019t have that, I use body wash as a shaving cream. 4. Pat dry (don\u2019t rub). 5. Apply alcohol to kill bacteria and close pores (??) 6. Apply after shave (I like cool fix) and 7. Apply basic antiperspirant (externally, of course) to prevent sweat from irritating the exposed follicles. \n\nCoconut oil isn\u2019t non-comedogenic, meaning it clogs pores and is more likely to cause problems.

        "selftext": "This is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.\n\nSaturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. We just moved into our new place last week Monday and wanted them to see it. We were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. \n\nEverything is normal for the first few minutes. I\u2019m just playing some \u201cfree\u201d game I\u2019ve spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. Then it happened. A bug flew in my ear. Now this happens occasionally. A bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.\n\nI immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. The bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. My gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. I\u2019m helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. \n\nThe bug did not like the water. It dug deeper. The noise and feeling got worse. I used a qtip to try to dig it out. All i got was blood. My father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. Nothing but more digging and moving. I am literally screaming everytime it moves. Both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. \n\nMy mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. I barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. In the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. So my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   At this point my entire body is covered in oil. I could have used concrete as a slip in slide. I\u2019m naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. \n\nThe oil does nothing but piss it off. We are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. She has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. Apparently this is something used to suck out booger\u2019s from babies noses. My father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. He doesn\u2019t go deep enough because he doesn\u2019t want to pop my ear drum. I didn\u2019t care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. It sucks the bug but it\u2019s too big to get it out. Too heavy for it to hold onto. \n\nMy gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. After 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. I look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. At this point I\u2019m too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. She freaks because it\u2019s a moth. A good size moth. I again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. \n\nI can not do justice to this event in words. I can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. Picture it yourselves. Imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. Then realize it actually feels worse than that. \n\nIf this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn\u2019t do it again. \n\nI\u2019d rather be waterboarded while listening to Barney on a loop. Those terrorists had it easy. \n\nI now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. It shook me that much. \n\nTLDR: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. Stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. I finally did. It was more horrific than you can imagine.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve tried to keep up with the comments so I\u2019ll answer some of them here.\n\nI\u2019m still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. This morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. I\u2019ve made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone US). I\u2019ll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. \n\nI\u2019m now smoking a lot less and mostly when I\u2019m driving . I feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, I\u2019m sorry. I feel your pain. \n\nTo those saying moths don\u2019t bite, I\u2019m not exactly a bug expert. All i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. It\u2019s truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience.",

            "So something very similar happened to me in college and I can back you up, that it\u2019s the worst thing that ever happened to me. \n\nI was sitting at my favorite spot near the lake on campus, just relaxing and enjoying the nice day, when I feel something fly into my ear. Like you, I immediately and violently freaked out. I could hear it buzzing and feel it moving and I\u2019m just sobbing. I collect myself enough to take the bus to the infirmary on campus. Just silent tears streaming down my face the entire bus ride with some random twitches as the beast moves inside my head. Other students are avoiding me, probably thinking I\u2019m having a mental breakdown or on drugs. \n\nOnce at the infirmary, they flush my ear and drown the creature. From within my head, I hear a high pitched shriek. Literally it had a death scream. I could\u2019ve gone my whole life without hearing an insect death scream, but I guess we all have our crosses to carry. It turned out to be one of those flying ants.

The bug wants to escape the fluid before it drowns, and instinctively tries to \"swim\" up. \n\nSo the next 2 times I've had the displeasure of a bug, I used that trick. It works perfectly.",

It was LOUD. My parents saw something moving in my ear with a flashlight, we still didn\u2019t know what it could be.

They tried to get it with tweezers but only plucked some legs off and made it mad. We went to the urgent care and they took it out with long tweezers. \n\nAs we were in the urgent care prelinary check up room, the lady was saying people come in with bugs in their ears all the time, she\u2019s seen a few cockroaches. That definitely freaked me out more because we still didn\u2019t know what it was. Turns out it\u2019s a moth. They gave it to us in a baggie and it stayed alive for about a week after. I was happy to show off what was in my ear to friends! \n\nThe doctor said the moth scratched up my ear so bad that I couldn\u2019t get it wet for two weeks. Also there\u2019s still scaring in my ear from it ~15 years later. I have to explain it to doctors that look in my ears to this day.

If I remember correctly, that day was an easy day for the school. I think one of those field days. But as I'm running back something suddenly flies into my ear and it is the worst fucking shit I've ever felt in my life.  I tried digging it out, jerking my head back and forth to fling it out.  One of my classmates thinks I'm playing around acting goofy, so he's laughing at me as I'm flinging around crying. I struggle to tell my teacher because it seems that every little move I make, the bug in my ear gets agitated and moves around, which hurts so much I can't even describe it. The teacher is asking me what flew in my ear. I had no fucking clue at that time that it was a moth.  I didn't watch it go in. I just wanted it OUT.  And she was freaking me out too, theorizing that it might be a bee. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe teacher call my parents to let them know to pick me up, so I had to wait in the front office for my dad to come and pick me up. He picks me up and trying to tell dad jokes like \"what is the bug saying?\" while I'm in pain. I guess he was trying to cheer me up but I wasn't fucking having it. This shit hurts. So we head over the the urgent care. It sucked because we  had to wait too. And then once I got into the room, I had to wait for the doctor. And then when the doctor came in, he tried to tell some dad jokes too. It definitely wasn't the time for that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doctor takes his otoscope and peers into my ear. This is where he reveals that it was a moth that was in my ear. So he has the nurse prepare a funnel syringe and a solution of warm water and hydrogen peroxide. Its been about 4 hours at this point. He put the spout into my ear and squeezed. I felt INSTANT relief as the warm solution flushed out my ear and drip into a metal pan. I looked into the pan, and sure enough, it was a moth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doctor took another look into my ear, and it was a good thing he did, because that moth laid TWO FUCKING EGGS in my ear! The doctor filled the syringe and flushed my ear again to get the eggs out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo OP, you may want to check to see if any eggs were left in your ear.

            "This happened to me about 8 years ago. \n\nI was walking into my house, and there were moths circling a recessed light fixture right in front of the door. Evidently my timing was perfect, as one slammed into my left ear and freaked out, fluttering his way down into my ear canal. \n\nI tried for about 30 minutes to vacate my ear canal to no avail. This was an older house with a central vacuum system, and when I shoved my head against the wall port and activated the system it was evidently enough of a commotion to freak the moth out and caused it to travel deeper to what felt like my eardrum. \n\nIt was what is assume insanity feels like. \n\nMy SO (we had just gotten together) was so horrified by my slapping the wall, laughing maniacally, and sobbing, that she rushed me to the closest ER. \n\nBecause I had never been to this hospital and was deemed \"non-urgent\", I was forced to fill out all paperwork prior to treatment. This took about 45 minutes, as I was still acting violently insane whilst trying to verify my insurance information and fill out medical histories. \n\nThen, I had to wait about an hour and a half for my name to be called. Sitting in an ER waiting room intermittently screaming and laughing, I contemplated running to the highway and getting hit so I could be deemed \"urgent\". \n\nWhen I finally was called back, they turned me on my side and dumped lidocaine into my ear. The fluttering ceased immediately. \n\nAfter 20 minutes of laying there with a drowned moth in my ear, they finally returned and flushed it with saline. \n\nI kept the moth. It's in a jar in my living room.",

They can't see her until the afternoon.\n\nSo she decides to not let that bother her and goes about running errands, this moth wiggling and making a scene in her ear. Around midmorning, the moth stops moving and a long tone sounds out for maybe a minute or two. Silence.\n\nShe's convinced she just heard a moth's death song. Still, she happily goes about her business.\n\nDoctor sees her in the afternoon, goes \"naw, bro, you gotta go to the ENT\". Same day appointment is set up, she goes.

Superb acting and direction.\n\nThe bug crawls THROUGH his brain while he screams in agony for days.

            "My father died when I was 5 of natural causes. He is buried in the same cemetery as his parents, grandparents, and a set of great grandparents. The total number of my relatives buried here is over 30. So you would think such a long standing cemetery, with so many plots owned by one family, would be on top of things. You'd be wrong.\n\nMy father was a US Army veteran of WW2 and while his assignment never put him in a combat role, he wanted the traditional VA style of headstone. No problem, VA came through and the stone was erected. His plot was near a decent size elm tree that shaded many of the surrounding graves and was a very peaceful place.\n\nApparently in the mid-90's the funeral home that managed the cemetery was bought out by a large national mortuary company. The new company wanted to expand and incorporate some empty land. The problem was they needed a road to access this area. They plotted it out and it would run right up to the side of my father's plot and through the elm tree. They had a service come in and take out the tree. During this process some piece of equipment knocked down a couple of headstones, my father's being one of them. When the road crew came in, they went off existing headstones. As a result a two lane wide strip of asphalt was poured over about \u00be of my father's grave. The grave is now unmarked as a result.\n\n\nMy family has come to terms with it.

Going to tell my mom, and subsequently my grandparents what happened was one of the worst days of my life.

His bitchy ass wife wouldn\u2019t allow him to be buried with the rest of our family when he died so at least this was somewhere we could go and put flowers. I know it may sound silly but just having that headstone made us all feel better even if we still have no clue where his body physically is. \n\nJust to add to it...his widow got really pissed when she found out my Grandparents re-wrote their will to make sure she gets nothing.

Well sorry, I am not gay and I am not bisexual. I have a one time \u2018gay\u2019 experience and truthfully I regret it. I am not not have I ever been attracted to men in any shape or form. I\u2019m 25 years old and extremely secure with my sexuality and this is not something I\u2019d ever seek out again or repeat. Just something I randomly decided to do while I was drunk and horny. I\u2019ve been drunk thousands of times before and also horny and never done something similar to this. \n\nSo once again please do not tell me what my sexuality is. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis happened about 6 months ago but I ended up having to work with him again recently and the awkwardness came back fully. \n\nWell the story goes about 6 months ago I was in Florida on a work trip. My buddies and I went out and got drinks and got super fucked up and made it back to the hotel around 2am or so. I\u2019m not sure what compelled me to do so. Maybe being drunk made me super horny and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to do about it but I ended up downloading the app Grindr. If you\u2019re not sure what it is, it\u2019s basically a gay hookup app... I\u2019ve never done anything like this before but I guess I decided to say fuck it, I want a blowjob. So I made an account, signed in, and immediately got a few messages. Well Grindr has a distance reading and one of the guys that messaged me was 60\u2019 away from me. So I was kinda interested since he was just a few rooms away. He offered to let me come by and he\u2019d turn on some porn for me as long as he could give me a blowjob. Told me he doesn\u2019t do this very often but being away from his wife he likes to explore a bit. Well, I decided to just say fuck it and told him sure I\u2019d be over there in a bit. Stumbled over to his room and the lights were kinda dim which made it slightly easier but he sat me down and gave me head. I finished, he swallowed, shook me hand and I went back to my room and passed out. \n\nTwo days later we\u2019re told to report to work end I show up with my friends and there\u2019s a group of men in a circle talking and we approach them and sure enough I recognized the main boss man. He just looks at me and I look at him and we just awkwardly shake hands again and he lays out the plan for today\u2019s work. I don\u2019t think any of us expected to know each other let alone work together for the next few weeks and it was a super awkward three weeks of working together... Definitely a secret I\u2019m taking to the grave with me. Well besides with you guys lol\n\nTl;dr: I got drunk in Florida and ended up downloading Grindr and meeting up with a stranger for a blowjob. Turns out he was going to be my married boss for the next three weeks.",

        "selftext": "Tifu ...omg Reddit, I'm such an idiot. I'll start off by saying that my wife has very weak tastebuds. She can hardly taste anything unless they're on extremes of their flavour. Stupid salty, stupid spicy, ect. \n\nWell it's my job to get the kids ready for school, make lunches, get them dressed and out to the bus, then I go off to work. Well this particular day my wife was working an early shift so i decided to make her a lunch as well. I made ham sandwiches for all 3 lunches, 2 normal sandwiches for my daughter's and one sandwich with THE LAST DAB spread across thickly on both sides of the sandwich. I put them all into baggies and packed up.\n\nIf you don't know what The Last Dab is, its a hot sauce made by a popular YouTube channel that sits at 3 million SCOVILLE. It's not for the weak. It's powerful, it sets your whole body on fire and there isn't much to do but try milk and wait for the spice to pass. \n\nToday around 11:30, I got a call from my oldest daughter teacher saying she was in agony, that she vomited all over the floor and is in the nurse's office being assessed. I immediately knew what I did, left work and rushed to the school. I stopped at a gas station to get some whole milk and some thick milk chocolate to try and help her. I've heard chocolate works but never had the misfortune to try it. When I got there, the nurse had figured out what had happened and I got an earful from her about the dangers of spicy food for young kids and I could have done some damage. I agreed and I just let her go off on me while I was comforting my daughter becuase frankly....I deserved it.  \n\nI explained what happened to the principal who wanted to fill out and incident report. He was understanding that mistakes happen but also said this mistake could have been worse. Again, I agreed. Im so embarrassed.\n\nWhen I told my wife what had happened when she got home, she went to comfort our daughter, jokingly called me a huge moron, (I agreed) and we had a bit of a laugh with my 2 daughters over it.  My daughter has since recovered and I've learned a valuable lesson. \n\nDon't make radioactive sandwiches around food for your kids! \n\nTL:DR - I made my daughter sick by sending her with a supper spicy sandwich meant for my wife.",

It was unbearable, even with abundant washes with milk. But the worst was yet to come.\n\nThe worst was when I could feel that tiny bite of pepper travelling through my digestive system. In the beginning I could exactly pinpoint its position through my esophagus, then in my stomach; then, as it started being digested, the very localized pain became just a nightmare of suffering, as every part touched by its fiery essence were slowly liquefying.\n\nThat day I had to have a lunch with a couple of friends. I ended up leaving earlier and crawling home, at one point seriously thinking of calling back one of them and ask her to get me to the hospital. I don't know how I managed to get home. I was folded in half for the pain, profusely sweating a cold, icy sweat, and burning at the same time.\n\nNeedless to say, I was in for an ever worse experience.\n\nThe expulsion.",

One morning after I handed her the cup and she started to drink, she spit the juice into the sink and gagged.  She protested loudly about the gross taste I pulled the tetra pack out of the door again to smell, figuring it had gone off. It smelled like chicken.  I looked at the pack in surprise.

I'm like there's no way it's still hot, now just eat.  You asked for it.  You don't have to eat the whole thing, but you have to eat more than that.  So, he chokes some more down, complaining how hot it was the whole time.\n\nEventually, he's eaten enough that I don't care if he eats more.  I pick it up to finish it off and take a bite.

Kids are like us, they just need to build up a tolerance to these sorts of things.

I learned this through the international school I had my son enrolled in for a time.  Little toddlers were running all over the place with the scent of fresh curry on the morning air.  I asked around, and both the caretakers and administrators were happy to share their findings.\n\nThat said, going from no spice exposure to The Last Dab is a pretty huge leap.

        "selftext": "This happened about a couple hours ago and I still want to shrivel up into nothing. So today was a new co-worker's first day on the job, hopefully not her last. My job is primarily male dominated with only a couple female employees and one female manager. Obviously it's nothing against women, it's just not often that we get female applications due to the physical labor we do on the daily. Plus it's pretty much in the middle of nothing, so not many people just stumble upon our workplace unless you already know it's there. \n\nI'm usually the trainer for all new employees since I've been with the company and travelled to other locations to train new hires. I've spent all day with my new co-worker, showing her the ropes and just getting to know each other. All is going well and we already started to break the awkward ice/first day jitters. \n\nMy male coworkers and managers are very loose and carefree around each other. We joke around and talk about pretty much anything with each other. One of my coworkers, let's call him Jack, and I have this run on joke between each other where we say, \"Hey check out this meme,\" and it's just an \"avant garde\" porn gif or something vulgar like granny titties off of a subreddit. I had just pulled this stupid joke with Jack, had a good laugh, and proceeded with my training.\n\nThe new hire and I start talking about what we watch on Netflix, hobbies, and social media. I tell her that I don't have any social media, just a reddit account. She's never heard of Reddit and I didn't know how to explain it to her. So I decided to just show her what Reddit is. She's literally right next to me as I open up the app, and to both of our shock the gif of the old lady getting absolutely railed was still opened. I immediately close the app, apologising profusely, and stumbling over my words trying to explain myself. She just says, \"It's fine,\" and walks away to probably second guess her new job or tell her friend who got her the job about what just happened. I hope she believes my excuse and that I'm not into GILFs. More importantly her mindset on the workplace. \n\nThis will be the last time I pull that joke with Jack. At the end of our shift, she thanked me for training her and that she'll check out Reddit when she gets home. I still want to call off tomorrow since I'll still continue training her tomorrow as well. (I told her that I'll be posting this incident on r/TIFU, so if you're reading this Daniela again I'm so sorry, it won't happen again)\n\nTL;DR. Tried to show a new hire what Reddit was and instead showed her someone's grandma getting railed into oblivion. \n\nEdit 1: She made a reddit account, asked for help on operating the app, and I brought up the incident again to apologise once more. She said she thought it was funny and that she was not offended. We're getting drinks with a mutual friend tomorrow as well. HOWEVER!!!! I still learned a valuable lesson about professionalism in the workplace. I also learned that this type of behavior happens a LOT on purpose, my accident made me realize that there are men that act like this on purpose on the daily and it's not okay at all for women to have to endure or relocate due to zero consequences of some douchebag that thinks men are superior to women. Furthermore I learned that there's a lot to accomplish in the safety and comfortability in the workplace for women, people of colour, and members of the LGBTQ community. I'm not Scott free from this incident as it will stay with me for all my years in my career to come and uphold the responsibility to make all people love coming to work and not dread/fear it. PLEASE don't just upvote this post for a laugh at my stupidity, but bringing attention to this type of behavior and how it can make someone question their workplace. Sexual harassment is not okay. Discouraging others is not okay. It will not be tolerated, and it must not go unspoken. \n\nEdit 2: Calling me a simp, a faggot, or a libtard clearly shows that some people don't understand the severity of sexual harassment and y'all are part of the problem, not the solution. Yeah I just wanted to give you all just a good laugh at my stupidity, but hearing personal stories from actual victims in the comments and messages made clear to me that my actions can hold a lot of weight on someone. I just don't want to be the reason someone quits or doesn't want to come into work. YOU just might be someone's reason. Peace!",

At this point I had become aware that he was a porn actor, but didn\u2019t really care. So we went to the studio and he proudly showed me his new movie DVD cover. It was his first cover and he was fully nude and I just thought man this is wildly inappropriate.

            "Years a go I worked with a guy that had a relative as a porn actress.  He used to email porn memes to his work buddies, including me.  One was particularly funny, so I forwarded it on to another co-worker that wasn't copied on it.  Let's say his name was Paul Marin.  Well, I pulled up Outlook, typed in Paul, selected the first match, and clicked send.\n\nAfter sending it, I looked at the attachment and laughed a bit... until I noticed the name.  The first name was similar, but a woman's name, and the last name had an extra letter-- like \"Paula Marrin\".  I then checked her profile and saw that she wasn't from our local office, but was in our corporate headquarters.  I felt a heat wave of panic wash over me as I realized I sent a porn attachment to a random woman via corporate email.\n\nThat was it.  I was going to be fired.  I started thinking about what I would take with me when they walked me out.  2 hours later, and nothing.  4 hours later and still nothing.

Let's just say it involved a gentleman behind a nice lady--the gentleman was using one foot to shove the nice lady's face into a couch while his other foot provided support and leverage. \n\nFriend immediately saw it and started laughing, then asked if I needed to go to the locker room and grab a stall for a few minutes. I politely declined as my brain scrambled to find a way for me to no longer be the butt of the joke... so I weakly shot back that I could go approach the girl he had been checking out and gauge her interest/set him up to move in when she's getting water or otherwise not actively going through her workout. Ya know, that sort of middle-school tier fuckery \"LoL wHAt iF I gO TelL uR CRuSh u LiKe hEr\"\n\n(side note--don't approach someone in the gym while they're in the middle of a set or moving towards their next exercise. 99% of people don't go to the gym with sexual intentions. Repeated awkward eye contact isn't a green light, but that's a story for another time.)\n\nI may have referred to her as purple leggings, referencing to her clothing choices that day. My voice may be noticeably deep, and it may carry much farther than I intend in the vast majority of situations. \n\n'Purple leggings' may have heard me say this, since she didn't have headphones in that day. \n\nMaybe it broke the ice in such a way that my friend had an excuse to approach her at my expense and apologize for me being a chauvinistic pig. It's also possible my fiend managed to get her number after said apology, and it's further possible he took her on a date afterwords.\n\nAnyways, that's my embarrassing story of how me watching porn got my friend laid, and how I learned the valuable life lesson of double-checking my phone in such a way I'm the only one who can see it before using it in public.\n\nTL;DR: watched porn.

            "Hey good on you for the lesson learned.  I used to hate the term micro-aggression and all the other buzz words around \"pc culture\" (thanks a lot South Park), but the issue it describes is very real.  I'm still a vocal supporter for speaking up if/when something offends you when it happens, but I know many people don't have the confidence or fear repercussions of speaking up and/or addressing the issue directly.  I've always considered myself to have a high tolerance for \"offensive content,\" but I've realized that my tolerance can't be an excuse for putting up with others spewing hateful things...  It's my responsibility to speak up.  Especially with the accidental/unintentional stuff - that should be easy to correct.  The malicious stuff, well it's harder but I don't feel near as bad at calling them out.",
