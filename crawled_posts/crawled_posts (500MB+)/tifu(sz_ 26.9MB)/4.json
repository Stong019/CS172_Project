        "selftext": "I guess this is more of a positive fuck up, but still a fuck up.\n\nAnyway, I've been smoking (just cigarettes) regularly for a bit over 4 years now. I really like smoking, it relaxes me, clears my head, and I love the taste of different tobaccos. Well, loved.\n\nI don't smoke a lot unless I'm out with friends, which as you can guess it's something that's just not happening during this pandemic. As a result, I've spent the last month or so smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day, which really enhanced my sense of smell.\n\nWell a couple of weeks ago, I've had a terrible sore throat, to the point of not even being able to talk; smoking was out of the question, as it was simply too painful. My cravings were easy to manage, as I already didn't smoke a lot.\n\nFast forward 10 days, I'm feeling alright again and I finally grab a cigarette. I light it up, inhale... And it tastes like absolute shit. It feels like I've licked clean my ashtray, nothing at all as what I'm used to! The smoke itself that's coming from the cigarette has a barely tolerable smell, I just can't stand it.\n\nSo here I am now, almost a week later. I'd really like to smoke, I loved it so much, but it's just so disgusting I can't bring myself to do it. I've tried, but it's just horrible and the taste just seem to get worse. I had no plans to stop smoking anytime soon, this was 100% not intended and I'm actually pretty annoyed by it.\n\nI guess it's good for my health and everything, but I'm probably one of the only idiots in this world that accidentally quit smoking. This whole thing sounds so stupid.\n\nEdit: holy hell somehow this reached r/all I\u2019m getting a lot of comments and while I might not be able to reply to all of you, please know that I\u2019m reading them all. With so many people sharing their positive experiences about quitting and showing support, I\u2019m actually quite happy this happened to me now. I might be pissed off today but I\u2019ll probably be happy about it in the long run. Thank you!\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019ve literally just received the results of my Covid test: I\u2019m negative!!! I saw a lot of you guys were worried since altered taste and sore throat can be Covid symptoms, so I thought I\u2019d update on my test results here. No Covid for me, the cigarettes taste bad for real!\n\nTl;dr: Had a really bad case of sore throat that forced me to give up cigarettes for 10 day. Now they taste like absolute shit and I'm actually pretty pissed of because I had no intentions of actually quitting.",

            "This is such a win - you're awesome! I smoked cigarettes for over 20 years and battled to quit. I had a tumour the size of a golf ball cut out of my jaw and still didn't quit - wounds hadn't even healed before I lit up again! Until I started thinking about it as escaping rather than quitting. (Credit to Alan Carr - Easy way to stop smoking) Never looked back. Enjoy your full lung capacity and functional taste receptors! Good luck with the covid results and look after yourself.",

He had a sore throat for about a week and then after he said everything tasted terrible and wrong. Turns out he had a brain tumor the size of an orange.

            "This kind of happened to me too. I used to go out a lot when I started college and started smoking as an excuse to go outside away from all the people and the noise. I used to smoke occasionally at home too just as a break from whatever I was working on. I loved sitting on my porch and having a cigarette and coffee, enjoying the view. I don\u2019t know what caused it but one day I lit a cigarette and couldn\u2019t even finish it. It was the same pack from a few days prior, my usual brand. Nothing had changed, they just suddenly tasted like garbage. I went and bought a new pack, thinking they may have gone stale or something but same thing, tasted awful. I was kind of bummed because I liked the nicotine effects but it just wasn\u2019t worth it anymore",

            "I was a smoker pack a day for twenty years, i always loved the smell, but I could tell my health was deteriorating, but I was hopelessly addicted.    Started to vape to get off cigarettes, been smoke free for two years now.   I still occasionally vape but I got rid of all my mods and tanks.   And now I just use a little vuse Alto with 1.4 menthol to get me through any lingering cravings, or when I just want to calm my nerves a bit.\n\n\nTrust me, you did yourself a huge favor, and your future self will thank you.  Not just from a health prospective but a financial one as well.     I can't believe my wife, non smoker, tolerated me smelling like I did for so many years.    And I foolishly believed I was able to cover up that smell for the most part.  Wrong.\n\nI swear I can now pick up the smell of a cigarette a half mile from me and even from passing cars.  I cannot stand it anymore, and i wasn't able to within your time frame.  About 10 days without was all it took.\n\nI will never buy into the anti vape propaganda.   It saved my life.    I wish kids wouldn't start vaping because they will have a harder time quitting.  I found vaping much less addicting then cigarettes and easier to ween myself down.    I don't know how kids will manage with nothing to compare to",

I don't want to smoke anymore but being the stubborn dumb ass I am I haven't quit. it's a bit more than that though, my mom and I both, it's not good and cancer took my mom in 2011. stress and that minute bit of satisfaction is just too much for me to put it down I guess.",
            "I actually suffered from severe acid reflux disease when I used to smoke, where the acid entered my lungs which led to severe asthmatic symptoms.. So I couldn\u2019t smoke for like a week. I urged myself to go further and now I am happily 2 months smoke-free.",
            "Let me give you a sneak peak into what your future would have looked like: horrible!\n\nI\u2019ve been smoking for 17 years and I just realized how much damage has actually been done to my body. \n\nI was trying to run after my dog who managed to slip from his collar. I couldn\u2019t even make it to end of my street and I\u2019m only 32. My lungs were on fire, my chest was on fire. And it didn\u2019t return back to normal for close to an hour. \n\nMy dog was probably wondering why I didn\u2019t chase after him because I just sat on the curb feeling like I was going to die and all of a sudden I feel his nose on my arm. \n\nSo yeah, I would suggest not going back. Lol",
            "Try to find something to replace the habit, chew gum, eat a fruit or vegetable instead of a cigarette, most of the habit seems to not come from the nicotine but the \"break\" you get while smoking a cigarette, and having something in your mouth/hand.\n\nFind something that fills these criteria, but is not a cigarette, and hopefully not unhealthy.",

You don\u2019t inhale the smoke, you only pull it into your mouth, like drinking soda through a straw. Good cigars are premium quality tobacco, and 100% tobacco; no paper wrappers. The smell is invigorating and the taste delicious; you may find you get all the enjoyment of cigarettes without the ill effects.\n\nWorth a try, or perhaps not. Good luck.",

Like I get if you got addicted when you were too young to understand but wow, there is just no forward thinking.\n\nReally great to hear though that\u2019s awesome for you.\n\nAlso I get it if they\u2019re old and pre-war on cigarettes",
            "I smoked for 13 years or so and tried quitting a few times but never managed to do it until I tried vaping. After a few months of vaping I was out drinking and my vape was out of batteries so I borrowed a cigarette. \n\nWorst taste I've ever had in my mouth. \nSo fucking gross. Couldn't even finish smoking it. \n\nHow I or anyone manages to have that death flavor linger in their mouth all day is beyond me, yet I did it for over a decade somehow and thought it was no big deal.",
            "Yeah, like 3 months ago I was like 'I wonder what a vape is like' after smoking pretty close to a pack a day for 7 years so I smoked it for like a week and was like 'fuck it I want a butt'. Literally had one puff and was like 'what the fuck is this?' I probably tried 3 or 4 more times and they straight up taste like shit. \n\nFunny part is I got bored of the vape too, so I was just like 'I wanna smoke but they taste like smoked asshole, and I don't wanna vape'. Haven't smoked a cigarette in like 3 months.",

Finally quit 2 years ago and now I can\u2019t even have a cigarette with a drink once in a blue moon. It taste disgusting, it makes my mouth dry, makes me feel like I cant breath and omg\nthe smell. Idk how anyone tolerated being around me or in my car. \n\nBelieve me you won\u2019t regret it. Ive saved so much money, I feel better, look better, me and all my stuff smells better. It was 10/10 worth it.",
            "Smokers are revolting to be around. Also, secondhand smoke kills thousands every year. Definitely stay off them. If not for yourself, do it for the others around you.",
            "I quit about 2 years ago in quite literally almost the exact same way. Got bronchitis, and my throat hurt to much to smoke. Didnt smoke for 2 weeks then when i felt good i smoked. Coughed up black shit and i figured ill stop altogether.",
            "The moment I became pregnant I couldn\u2019t handle smoking anymore.  Plus I couldn\u2019t abide smoke on anyone\u2019s clothing!  Even my husband had to shower off the smell of tobacco and brush his teeth to get near me.  We are both non-smokers since 1973, the year our son was born.",
            "Smoke weed not cigs.",
            "I totally get the not wanting to quit thing. Smoking was my ritual. It takes the same amount of time, no one bugs me, and I can\u2019t do much other than hit pause and think for a sec. it was my happy place. Then I had a surgery and had to quit a month in advance and now after the fact they\u2019re just near intolerable. Again, better for my health and well-being, but fuck do I miss smoking.",

            "Smiliar boat: Smoke for 3 years, got sick, tried smoking and dry heaved. Suddenly found myself disgusted with them and quit.",
            "To other smokers reading this, please note that many, many of the non-smokers around you are similarly \\*repulsed\\* by the smell of cigarette smoke. I can't tell you how revolting I find it, and catching even a tiny whiff of it throws off my entire senses of taste and smell.\n\nSo, if you're a smoker please keep that in mind. In fact, I'd rather smell farts than cigarette smoke because a) farts are natural and an inevitable result of the necessary, life-sustaining digestive process, b) other than in very rare cases, your farts aren't going to cause me any medical issues, and c) as disgusting as farts are, I (and many others) find cigarette smoke even more revolting. Seriously.\n\nSo when you see me (and other non-smokers) gagging and choking and waving smoke away and looking around for the source so that I can get upwind or away, that's not an act or an exaggeration to try to send a message, it's me trying to not have my meal/day/chill/happiness ruined by inhaling a putrid, offensive odor.",

            "If you smoked because you liked the taste rather than habit, maybe try cigars/cigarillos. I smoke a couple of times a month, and it will be one of those. \n\nEither a nice cigar or if you just want a little smoke (rather than a 2 hour cigar), a little pack of 10 Romeo & Juliet\u2019s. Or something similar. \n\nVery enjoyable without the harsh reality of buying a 20 pack of Marlboro.",
            "You're a stronger person than me! After getting Strep/Bronchitis, I couldn't smoke for over three weeks. Finally I felt better and went to enjoy a smoke...like you, it tasted like shit! But stubborn me, pushed through it. Finished it. And continued to light up until it tasted normal again. Dammit. Now I want to quit and its been one of the biggest struggles of my life (I'm six years clean off heroin and opiates, you'd think I could quit nicotine)",
            "What a quitter.  Real smokers just power through that horrible taste in your mouth.",
            "Haha that happened with me for juul when they banned the flavored pods and replaced them with the Virginia tobacco flavor that I hate",
            "Many years of light smoking amounted to moderate smoking in the first half of the pandemic, so I moved off to light vaping to control cravings.\n\nHad a cigarette two weeks ago, and it tasted like my junior year math teacher's breath, which I still remember 20+ years later, and I just couldn't continue it.\n\nOne of the best things about quitting is realizing how deadened your taste buds were while you were still smoking.",
            "God damn you, I wanna quit so bad",
            "I quit a couple years ago too from getting a bad cold, I guess getting that nicotine out of your system really makes a huge difference!  \n\n\nAlso congrats again keep it up :)",
            "This happened to me- ish. I smoked cigarettes at work to take breaks. Was never actually addicted where I woke up in the morning and needed a smoke. It was very social. But I had to stop when at work I was fixing bikes in a building that had mulch inside of it all summer and must have had some sort of mold that made me really ill. I get sick and my O2 levels dropped anytime I exerted myself and I definitely couldn\u2019t smoke since I was struggling to breathe. Fast forward to dealing with that a few months and finally getting better and then trying to smoke and feeling like I can\u2019t breathe again. It\u2019s been 7 years since I last had a cigarette and while I miss the occasional drunk smoke outside of a bar, I don\u2019t miss how much I stank after it.",

            "My parents have always smoked. My mother has had a triple bypass and still smokes. When my brother and I were in highschool they smoked in the house so we always stunk (not that highschool bathrooms were any better) but good on you on. I never understood the allure. Just an awful habit all around. Where I'm at instituted no smoking in bars years ago and it was one of the best things",

            "I can sympathise.  In my 20's I started to cut down on smoking for health reasons (I was a runner and didn't want reduced lung capacity).  At my lowest point, I was having 2 Marb Ultra-lights per day.  It was a luxury at that point,  and one I had to remind myself of frequently, but I still loved the taste and rush too much to just give up.  Then I started a study abroad trip to Japan.  With the flight, socializing with all the new students, new experiences, orientations, jet lag, and dorm-to-host family changeover, by the time I even realized that I was a smoker, 2 whole weeks had blown by.  So I hit a local vending machine and buy a pack of my brand.  In Japan at that time, a pack of Marbs was 220 yen, about $2.00 American.  They were SO cheap.  I took them back to my host family's place so the host father and I could smoke together and it was like I was trying smoking for the first time ever! I gagged and gasped.  I didn't even like the flavor or smell.  Japanese Marbs were made with a different process apparently.  They were awful, like stale chemicals.  Needless to say, I quit on the spot.  I still smoke a cigar here and there.  That's quality.  But never cigs, never again.",

            "About 20 years ago now, my grandfather decided to quit smoking. He started smoking in WW2 and had smoked since then, so most of his life. One day he finished the last one in the pack he had and just didn\u2019t buy anymore. Decided he\u2019d had enough and quit cold turkey, never had any issues after then, sometimes he would be reading the paper and go to reach for one, and would just think \u201coh, that\u2019s right, I quit\u201d and continue reading, lol.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how easy he was able to quit compared to what some people go through.

            "I feel your pain. I quit for my health but I miss it. I don't even think it's the nicotine but I just liked the flavor and even the smell. I wear tobacco scented perfume and burn tobacco scented candles. \n \nApparently I have chronic bad breath (even with having clean teeth. I think it has to do with Sunnis drainage) and smoking covered it up. It wasn't noticeable when both my husband and I smoked but since we quit, well...bless him he loves me anyways.",
            "The best way to quit smoking, or to quit anything really, is to do it accidentally.\n\nYou see, this is actually the advice that I often give people who are trying to quit something: Don't try to do it. Because the more you try to do it, the more it becomes a struggle, and you are only making it harder for yourself. What I often tell people is to follow the desire to its own conclusion, and go along with it until you are completely satisfied -- that is when the addiction will stop on its own.\n\nThis doesn't apply to everything, of course, but in a way it kind of does. Because when you think about it, how does anyone force themselves to do something? Even when you try to ease yourself into doing something, if it's not something you really want to do, eventually you just end up doing whatever it is you want to do anyway. And so nobody can really succeed when they try to control themselves, because the one trying to control is also the one who needs to be controlled, and the whole thing becomes rather laughable when they realize this fact.\n\nIf you're observant, you might even notice that the people who keep saying \"I want to quit smoking\" or \"I want to quit drinking\" don't really want to do it at all, and so they all inevitably fail. Instead, they want to say it to feel better about their own \"addictions\" (in quotation marks because this is how most people describe it, and the term is usually meant as something negative, while I don't mean it as either a positive or a negative) -- and to justify to others who criticize their \"addictions\". They might try, of course, but no matter the amount of effort put into it, it's all but a vain attempt to keep up the act. Because, really, unless it's an honest attempt to do what they say they want to do, the effort becomes irrelevant. And the honest attempt doesn't actually require much effort at all, since after all, if it's something you really want to do, it should come naturally to you.\n\nIn a sense one could even draw the similarity between quitting a so-called addiction and learning to swim. It doesn't matter how hard you try to learn to swim, you can't swim until you realize all your efforts to follow instructions are pointless, and you just let your body move the way it should. When you swim, you might think and talk about swimming, and you might think that thinking and talking about it is important, but in fact it is completely irrelevant. The best swimmers know to trust their instincts instead of relying on their reasoning mind all the time, in exactly the same way the best decision-makers rely on a hunch more than the data on which they supposedly base their decisions, and so on. How do you start or stop loving someone? How do you get into the flow of music, of dancing, or ignite a certain passion for video gaming? The answer is you don't, and it just happens by itself. If you enjoy eating good food, you can't decide that the food suddenly doesn't taste good anymore. So if someone has been trying to lose weight, and they can't seem to resist the food, the best way to do it is to learn how to enjoy the food properly; and once they are really satisfied and know that the only way to really satisfy themselves is with moderation, they find the balance and don't eat as much as they used to, and instead of the quantity, they are now able to find quality in it.\n\nThe theme behind all of these examples I'm relating this to, has to do with following one's own true feelings. Nobody can go against their feelings, so the only thing to do is to find out what it is. Once someone is onto this, they stop being fooled by ideas altogether, and they can do anything.\n\nSo don't worry about this being a fuck-up because you quit smoking even though you didn't mean to. This is instead a funny story that has a lot of insights hiding in it, and it is something that happened because it was the only thing that could have happened, without anyone's decisions.\n\nYou know, just like any other thing in life.",

            "I used to work in a restaurant kitchen. I'd love to smoke a Natural American Spirit on a break (one definitely lasts multiple smoke breaks). I would also smoke spliffs because I'm a weed lightweight. I'd roll like 90% tobacco and a tiny bit of weed. My girlfriend knew about my smoking, but I never smoked around her. Sometimes when I'd stay over her house I would have to go outside to smoke, while trying to keep the cigarette away from me so I wouldn't smell like it. Then I'd go inside and wash my hands like crazy and brush my teeth, use mouth wash, etc. She didn't like the way it smelled and I didn't want to be a dick and kiss her with cigarette breath.\n\nWe were getting closer and we were ready to move in together.  I was getting a new job so I figure I'd make some big changes all at the same time. I quit smoking and bought a Juul. I vaped weed too (not a heavy user). After 2 weeks of not smoking, I figured I'd try a Natural American Spirit again for the hell of it. It was disgusting. It made me salivate like crazy and it was gross to swallow the spit because it tasted so much like cigarette smoke. I could only take a couple puffs before putting it out. I immediately gave the pack away and haven't smoked since.",

        "selftext": "TLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now they\u2019re gonna sue me. \n\n[edited to fix spelling / grammar / weird ass sentences I used]\n\nMy 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so it\u2019s been difficult to deal with. I\u2019m in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. She\u2019d be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She would\u2019ve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first. \n\nWhen she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had a generous amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I did not know that she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired.  She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She left nothing to my parents but as they didn\u2019t know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and I\u2019m very low contact. We are their only two children. \n\nAt the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them I\u2019d continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didn\u2019t know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them I\u2019d be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them it\u2019s my home and it was willed to me. They couldn\u2019t sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time. \n\nCue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now we\u2019re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this. \n\njust some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.\n\nedit: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. I\u2019ve gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. It\u2019s fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, I\u2019ll be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so I\u2019ll be continuing her business too and I\u2019ll need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s overwhelming.\n\nedit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesn\u2019t say anything about them but I\u2019m leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.\n\nFinal Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but won\u2019t push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and I\u2019ll give an official update at some point.",

If they tried to sell the house, a title search would reveal they don't have title to it which would stop the sale cold.  Presumably, haven't your parents bought a house in the past (you mentioned they're in the country club set, so I would assume they're homeowners)?  Don't they know this?\n\nThey can contest the will, but will contests are rarely successful if the will has been validly executed.

Like, they didn't \"loan\" or give your sister money to cover the down payment when she bought it, or co-signed anything to help her get it.

That way they can't claim they were \"forgotten\" or \"overlooked\" instead of straight up snubbed.

Her 2nd husband, no biological relation, who married her AFTER she accumulated her wealth, also died before her. She left me almost everything, and her 2nd husband's family very little - half the liquid capital after selling some real estate assets.\n\nOn the morning that my mother told me that my grandmother had passed that previous night - on my grandmother's advice the first thing I did was head down to her estate lawyer's office. The relatives from my step-grandfather's side of the family were pulling in in front of me. I was gracious to them - as we entered into the office together, the attorney's assistant greeted me by name with a knowing smile and told me the lawyer would see me immediately, and told the relatives to have a seat and they would join momentarily. The other relatives did not leave that meeting ecstatic.\n\nWe left EVERYTHING in the house we were in and took up residence in my grandmother's house immediately on the advice of the lawyer. It took a while and there were challenges - but in the end - if you've got the document (protect that) - the courts are unlikely to reverse the last wishes of the deceased.\n\nYou absolutely have the high moral ground here - and you'll be disappointed in how quickly people reveal their true nature when it comes to the free money of someone who isn't yet in the ground.  \n\n\nOh.

I suggest talking to a counselor just for occasional mental health check ins.         \n2. Was your sister's heart condition genetic/hereditary? If so, you should go see a cardiologist and get checked out. It could be something you can manage or fix if you catch it early.        \n3. Unless you are already married (which it doesn't seem you are yet) you should also make up a will stating unequivocally where and to whom you wish to direct your assets; (also get youself some convertible term life insurance now, clearly listing beneficiaries, while you are presumably healthy) to ensure your parents don't get any undue windfall should something happen to you as well.         \n4. Look into the retirement accounts and see whether they are tax qualified (IRA/Roth/401k, etc) as those type you will have a brief window (10 years) to liquidate them.        \n5. If the assets have significant value or equity, like over $500,000; assuming you are around or younger than 30; find a local financial planner (typically a fee only or fee based) who is bound to act in a fiduciary capacity. Also find a highly rated CPA and if your current attorney is not already specialized in estate work, find one. This way they all can advise you on how to work with this unexpected financial windfall and set yourself up in the way your sister intended. You can honor her memory by being smart and strategic with this money, property, and assets.",

I mean, I can see you *maybe* offering to pay a portion of those costs (say, one third). But otherwise, they chose to pay for their daughter's funeral and that should really be the end of it.\n\nI get the impression from the way you talk about them that perhaps they paid under the assumption that her estate, or at least the bulk of it, was coming to them. If that's true then that's even more of a reason for you not to contribute.\n\nAnd while you don't say this, if there's any part of you right now that's thinking, \"I'll pay for that stuff and then maybe they'll get the message and back off\", trust me when I say that that isn't going to happen.

I had always dismissed this finding because I\u2019m young with a horrible diet.\n\nI have always been taught that black stool is the worrisome stool, as that\u2019s indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, whereas stool that has bright blood just indicates hemorrhoids.\n\n**My logic for dismissing the bright blood on my stool:**\n\n\\- I\u2019ve had a diet consisting of high sugar + high fat, processed foods with low fiber in addition to being very inactive causing constipation and straining \u2013 So, bleeding from straining just \u201cmade sense\u201d. I\u2019m 6\u20191 @ 225\n\n\\- Blood was not consistent-- It came and went.\n\n\\- There was not a lot of blood, and when there was it looked like skid marks on the stool (something I thought was \u201cobviously\u201d related to hemorrhoids\n\n\\- I\u2019m young (29)\n\n\\- Family history of hemorrhoids, so I thought me having hemorrhoids was just part of the family business\n\n\\- Lack of education \u2013 especially knowledge relating to polyps (an abnormal tissue formation resembling a skin tag in the colon).\n\n**Why I eventually met with a GI specialist:**\n\nThe blood in my stool became more of an everyday thing that lasted for a month. From my perspective, that frequency was abnormal.\n\nMy GI doctor thought it was more than likely hemorrhoids, but still recommended a colonoscopy because no matter what, blood in stool, especially in young adults, is not normal should ALWAYS be inspected.\n\n**What was found from the colonoscopy:**\n\nA 20mm polyp. To put in perspective, a 10mm polyp is considered big. The polyp was sent to pathology and in a few days I received a call.\n\n**Pathology:**\n\nThey discovered that cancer had formed on the polyp. It\u2019s more of a rare cancer (<1% of colon cancers) that is unfortunately a bit more aggressive than the average colon cancer. At this point, I\u2019m had been staged at stage 3a. After getting part of my colon (large intestine) removed and six weeks later, I will now be starting chemotherapy in five days. The doctors do feel I have an 80-90% chance of being cured with chemo\u2019s assistance.\n\nBut what\u2019s more interesting about this cancer is that it is most common in younger people (around later 20s-30s).\n\n**The doctors mentioned that they are seeing colon cancer arise more often in young people.**\n\n**TL;DR:** If you have blood in your stool, you more than likely do NOT have colon cancer. But you should get yourself checked by a doctor if you are having this symptom just to make sure there is nothing going on.\n\nEdit- some clarifications: \n-cancer formed on a polyp relating to the length of time it had not been addressed.\n\n-i now have no blood in my stool after the polyp was removed\n\n-the type of cancer I have is adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells\n\n-I've decided to document myself as I progress through chemotherapy for myself, but also to help increase awareness.\n\n Link to my first video basically restating everything I've stated here. I will additionally answer questions in a video response format to help save time, as it might be more bearable to respond in that manner than time during chemo.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DJCkUGaN6eU\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/nursedaveith is another place you might be able to find me if you have any questions.",

New Year's Eve  he was in the ER and they found a mass in his abdomen.  They told him not to worry, they were pretty sure it was lymphoma and that they caught it early and would be easy to treat.  Today they admitted they have been completely wrong and this is extremely serious.  No one believed him or did the tests that needed to be done. 4 months of waiting for someone to listen to him and do they right thing. I am so sad and so scared.",
            "I remember years ago I went to the hospital because the toilet water was completely red. Every time I went to the bathroom after that there was always blood. Thought legit I was gonna die of internal bleeding or some other disease something, but it turned out to not even be an internal problem. I ended up having a pilonidal cyst on my tailbone area, which turned into a pilonidal abscess. Eventually had to have surgery because it wasn't healing on its own and I was in MASSIVE amounts of pain due to where the abscess was. Despite reading that there's a chance they can come back, it's been quite a few years and I'm still doing good.\n\nVery good lesson in this story though, never take blood in the toilet lightly lol.",

            "100% agree with OP. Two and a half years ago my gastroenterologist had me get a colonoscopy because I had blood in my stool just once. They were looking for ulcerative colitis or Crohn's, but they found a pre-cancerous polyp instead. They said it usually grows slowly, but I was only 25 and I wouldn't have had a routine colonoscopy until I was in my 40s or 50s. I for sure would've had cancer if not for that colonoscopy.

Came back with blood in there as well. After a colonoscopy he discovered a no joke, 40cm polyp among numerous other smaller ones. Luckily it was precancerous and I got off with a warning. He told me that I have to come back in 3 years for another colonoscopy. If that one is clean, then 5 years after that. Said that I'll never go longer than 5 years without one. The worst part is that my children now have to get one at the age of 23. 10 years before my polyps were discovered. Blood in the stool is no joke. Thanks for putting your story out there.",

We see 45-50 Year olds with advanced Colon cancer present to the ER regularly. Maybe one a month at a medium sized hospital.  It\u2019s a really really shitty and hard conversation I have to have too frequently. \n\nIf anybody in your family has had colon cancer, we start colonoscopies 10 years before the age of when the youngest person got diagnosed.\n\nThere\u2019s other subtleties, so if you\u2019re near 45 or have intestinal cancer in your family, talk to your pcp about colon cancer screening.\n\nBlood in your stool, anemia of unclear source, unexplained and unintentional weight loss, stool that becomes thinner, only liquid bowel movements for long periods of time, and intermittent crampy abdominal pain (usually low abdomen like period cramps) are all other symptoms associated with colon cancer. \n\nVirtually always when we find people who present to the ER with advanced colon cancer, they\u2019ve never had a colonoscopy. Colonoscopies absolutely catch cancers earlier so we can remove them and treat appropriately,  survival excellent if caught earlier",

            "My dad went through cancer treatment after surgery. Radiation and chemo. A few bits of advice he shared with me. Take your anti-nausea medication before you start to feel nauseous, when you start feeling sick it hits fast and then you can\u2019t keep the meds down. There is some expensive skin cream that significantly decreases the damage tone to your skin at the treatment site. Last, the doctor works for you, if they are taking care of you to you and your family\u2019s satisfaction, fire them and go somewhere else.  The whole process can be so Overwhelming that you can easily lower your standards and accept mediocre services. It is normal for the treatment to completely wipe out your energy and desire to be productive, this is normal.

            "Sorry you're going through this and thanks for sharing your experience.\n\nMy experience mirrors yours very closely. I was diagnosed with rectal cancer in December of 2018 at the age of 51. Had not had a Colonoscopy until then. They found a golf ball sized tumor in the upper part of my rectum that had started to bleed. Pathology deemed it stage 2. They did an embolization to stop the bleeding and then I started pre-op chemo and radiation. Surgery in June. \n\nSurgery was a little crazy. Because they were taking the entire rectum due to the size of the tumor, I had to decide whether to have a temporary colostomy while everything healed with a reconnect of my colon to my \"outdoor plumbing\" at a later date OR a permanent colostomy. After a lot of research I chose the permanent option. In this case they also want to take any tissue that would be susceptible to cancer in the future...that meant the sphincter. Basically it was like coring an apple down there. The surgery was done with a DaVinci robot guided remotely by the doctor. It looked like a frickin' robot spider and it was placed over me with three of it's \"legs\" inside me via tiny incisions. Two were the remote controlled arms on each side and one was a camera inserted right above my belly button. Yeehaw! So, now I have what the doctors and nurses called the Ken Doll Procedure. Left me with nothing but a scar in my crack. This was the most difficult part of recovery by far. Hard to sit on the part you're trying to heal!\n\nBTW, the colostomy has been the best choice I could have made for myself. It's been so easy to deal with. I needed to be able to be in control of things, not have my body control me and this allows me that. Recovery was about 3 months in my case so almost 9 months from diagnosis to going back to work.\n\nMoral of this story?\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE GET YOUR COLONOSCOPY WHEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO!",

            "Have had two colonoscopies at a young age for them (wasn\u2019t the routine screening).  And I always like to tell people that it is not the worst experience most people imagine it is going to be.  First off, the procedure itself is nothing to be worried about.  You\u2019re put under, so you won\u2019t feel anything.  The hard part is the day before prep.  Although guidelines can vary, you basically cannot eat anything solid or that isn\u2019t see through.  So you are looking at a day of clear liquids.  Two tips about that, if you miss chewing, gummy bears technically count as a clear liquid since they liquify at body temp.  Just steer clear of red, orange, purple ones.  Also technically white wine counts as a clear liquid.  The liquid prep is kinda gross and yes you will have literal liquid waterfall diarrhea.  Your butthole will hurt (A&D ointment will help with this.). Ever had stomach flu?  That\u2019s the kind of diarrhea you\u2019re going to experience but at least no vomiting.  By the time your procedure rolls around you will be so glad the prep is over.  \n\nTl;dr colonoscopies get a bad rep but aren\u2019t as bad as you imagine.

        "selftext": "Happened about a week ago, but I've been hesitant to post this as I wasn't sure if it really fits. No one involved in this story is a minor. Tl;dr at bottom.\n\nI am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. There are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. We were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iPhone. She was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.\n\n\"What?\" the collective asked.\n\n\"There's some dude's DICK here!\"\n\nWe gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). We laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. We looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. We also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. We couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.\n\nBefore I turned the setting off, everyone using my family iCloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos I saved to my phone. This got annoying after my mom started questioning things I had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so I turned it off.\n\nWithout thinking of the consequences, I asked her if she shared an iCloud account with anyone. She said she shared one with her parents. She got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.\n\nI've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. The rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. We sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.\n\nThe image is burned into all of our minds. I've never met her father but I'm terrified one day I will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and I'll know exactly what his penis looks like.\n\nTl;dr: Friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, I can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through iCloud, and now none of us are okay.\n\nEdit: Clarifying the tl;dr\n\nEdit 2, electric boogaloo: Why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. Also thanks for the silver\n\nEdit 3, freud enters the chat: Since like half of the comments are \"why would you cry from seeing your dad's dick\":\n\n* We are all Americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us\n* We are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn't really how we like to think about our parents\n* It wasn't crying like OH MY GOD WHAT WILL I DO, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like \"I can't believe this is what just happened\"\n\nEdit 4, the (provable) finale: I\u2019m not posting a picture of this man\u2019s penis you nasties",

I don\u2019t believe OP is talking about sharing a single iCloud account (username and password). OP is talking about a feature where multiple iCloud accounts can be linked via Family Sharing. This allows purchases on one account (apps, music, movies, etc.) to be accessed by all, without the need to share account credentials with multiple individuals (which, as multiple commenters have pointed out, is colossally stupid). Family Sharing also allows for the sharing of photo streams which is where OP\u2019s story comes from.~~\n\n~~So to all of you saying, \u201cWhy would you ever share an iCloud account?\u201d That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. Family Sharing has its uses, but it can also be problematic.~~\n\nEDIT 2: Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I re-read OP and it does sound like their friend was sharing a single iCloud account. Yeah, that\u2019s stupid.",

I was scared my grandma was going to somehow fuck up her indestructible first gen digital camera and insisted.  She handed it over and I saw them look at each other before I looked down to the camera screen in my hand.

        "selftext": "(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)\n\nThis happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.\n\nSo this is a throwaway, I have \\*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.\n\nSo I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the \"nudes\" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).\n\nShe is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office \"XXX,\" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.\n\nMost importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.\n\nSo along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office \"XXX\" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.\n\nSo I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this \"guy\" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say \"Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!\" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says \"OMG COUSIN!\" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.\n\nI race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.\n\n\nedit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.\n\nYes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.\n\n\nedit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i\u2019m going to be honest.  I don\u2019t know.\n\nedit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can\u2019t really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)\n\n\u2022 She doesn\u2019t have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.\n\n\u2022 She lives in NYC, it\u2019s big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn\u2019t occur to me, I guess I was worked up.\n\n\u2022 I come here often, it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t call her, but sometimes when i\u2019m here she\u2019ll dm or comment on my insta story and say \u201chey come by and visit next time\u201d\n\n\u2022 In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don\u2019t know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.\n\n\u2022 We didn\u2019t actually say \u201chey cousin\u201d lol, i\u2019m just censoring our names for the post.\n\n\u2022 Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)\n\n\u2022 I\u2019m 35, she\u2019s 26.\n\n\u2022 I deleted my account after freaking out, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll post again and I\u2019ll let you know lol.\n\n\n\noooookay, so now onto drinks.\n\nI decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn\u2019t fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn\u2019t buy the \u201ci just popped in\u201d.  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn\u2019t, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it\u2019s a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we\u2019ll get drinks one more time before i leave.\n\njudge away, people.\n\n\ntl:dr - Post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin.",

I didn\u2019t mean it but I knew that didn\u2019t matter. She turned bright red with tears in her eyes and stormed off.

They were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I'm in a shitty ghetto town that I've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I'm getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.\n\nThe husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don't do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn't care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I'll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.\n\nI take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like \"yeah it's been a while since she's had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain't she so fuckin wet?\" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn't help I was wearing a condom but I'm extremely glad I was. The entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.\"How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?\"\n\nI decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn't going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left.\n\nI BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm really glad I was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, I'm laughing with you. A lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. I hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",

            "Hello, friend. Thank you for sharing your story with us. I think it provides us all a deeper understanding about the decisions we make when we are not in a healthy state of mind, as they lead to self destructive behaviors. You are not alone in this. Undoubtedly, all of us have performed some self-defeating/destructive action. \n\nAs a community, let\u2019s make a promise to live a life that encourages proper mental health. Seek help, perform self-care, eat healthy, exercise, maintain healthy relationships. If all else fails, trust your gut-you are given this metaphysical/evolutionary tool. Even the great film Pinocchio tries to teach children this...listen to that little voice in your head-it\u2019s there to help you! If you find that you\u2019re not listening to that voice and decide to go ahead mix up that poop stew, it\u2019s time to seek help. You may not realize it, but I hope someone telling you makes you aware that you should be!\n\nFinal Thought: We all have the power to overcome and seek peace from our short comings (pun very much so intended). Whenever your tires blow out (in a metaphorical, yet actual sense), take some time to regather and think about the path you\u2019re heading towards. The universe has a weird way of working...pay attention to the signs. There\u2019s an African proverb that relates to your traumatic experience, and I\u2019m totally using it to help while also make a sex joke: \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d\n\nTake care, bro. Hit me up if you need.",

Me, father to a 16-month-old\n2. My wife, mother to the same 16-month-old\n3. Our 16-month-old\n\nFor the past couple of months, Kiddo has been saying \"Dada\" and \"Da\" quite a lot to refer to me. He says it when I walk into the room. He says it when he hears my car pull into the driveway. He says it when he wants my attention. A dozen times a day at least. Let me tell you, there are few pleasures in the world as great as coming home from work and having a toddler look at you and exclaim \"Da!\" with a huge grin on his face.\n\nNow, he's said \"Mama\" and \"Ma\" before to refer to his mom, but it's rare. I know she wishes he would more, and I want her to get that feeling as much as I do, so I decided that I was going to work with Kiddo on saying \"Mama.\"\n\nIn my 16 months of parenthood, I've learned that my kid picks up skills ok from watching and listening, but that they stick best when he learns by doing. With this in mind, I've been trying to get him to say \"Mama\" on his own accord. He has already demonstrated in the past that he knows his mom's name is \"Mama,\" so I've been working with that. Whenever she walks into view, I'll excitedly say \"who's that?\" He basically never says that it's \"Mama,\" but he does run over and give her a hug. At least there's that, I guess.\n\nAfter a week of no progress, Kiddo came running into the kitchen yesterday morning, looked right at his mom, gave a big smile, and said, \"who's that?\"  Ouch.\n\nMaybe he learns better by listening after all. \n\nTL;DR - My toddler now calls his mom \"who's that?\" because I tried to teach him using the Socratic method.",

And of course, there's the possibility that it happens to stay-at-home-moms a lot because baby doesn't feel any need to find a word for the person that is around 24/7 as quickly as the one who isn't. \n\nBut yeah, my kid didn't use mama for a full 6 months until after he said dada. I didn't mind it. I definitely subscribe to the \"I was barely ever apart from him, so he didn't need a word for me\" theory. OP is sweet for trying though!",
            "[Insert *wholesome* award]",
            "It's a short phase. We also say \"who's that?\" But we follow up with \"mama!\" Or \"dada!\" so maybe that's how we dodged that bullet. A few more months and you can point at your toddler, ask who's that and they'll say their name.",
            "Maybe your son is just a Russian spy who keeps saying yes to you. So he doesn\u2019t say \u201cMama\u201d a lot because he doesn\u2019t use names",
            "Many babies seem to have an easier time saying Dada than Mama and many say that first. My kid did too. He didn't call me Mama until well after he was calling his dad Dada. You can't take it personally. My husband helped out too though. We just started calling each other Mommy and Daddy and he soon picked it up. Only problem now though, we can't seem to stop and it probably seems a little gross to other people. LOL",
            "This isn't here or there, but you should give sign language a shot with your kid (I tell this to most new parents I come across). Anyway, motor skills come in quicker than speech. Children can pick up sign language as early as 6 months, while speaking usually takes around a year, give or take. This doesn't apply to you guys since your kid is already 16 months, but it's still easier for them to learn more words with hand movements than to learn the different speech for each word. Keep teaching them to speak, of course, but with sign language they'll be able to communicate with you better while their speech abilities still come in.\n\nJust something I put out there and suggest for new parents so they can have better communication with their child sooner than just relying on spoken words. This also gives them a second language they'll be able to speak, which is always something beneficial. It's also easier to learn a second language as a young child because you learn the language naturally instead of learning a translation of the language into your first language.\n\nSign language is also a more logical way of communication. When you think about it, spoken languages are really just sounds that we attribute meaning to, they have no inherent meaning. But in sign language, you're often making physical representations of whatever you're talking about, for instance to say \"cup\" you literally just make a cup shape with your hand. And if \"moved the cup\" you literally show the \"cup\" hand sign and move your hand to show you moved the cup. The language just makes sense. Without us giving meaning to spoken words though, they're just random noises.\n\nAnyways, this whole thing was just to suggest trying to teach your kid sign language so they can \"talk\" with you even while they can't talk with you. Good luck if you give it a go. It's a really cool language and any deaf person you run into will be ecstatic that you can sign, even if you are just staring and don't know that much. Because they see it as you taking the time out of your day to learn their language so you are able to communicate with them, while they live in a world where they can't communicate with nearly everyone out there. Most spoken languages have a country or large area of land where the language is home to, but sign language doesn't have that situation, deaf people are just dotted here and there.",

            "You could try saying \u201cHey mama\u201d whenever your wife walks in the room. And when you refer to her while your kid is around. Then he\u2019ll realize that\u2019s her name :]",

        "selftext": "So this happened last Sunday night.\n\nSo I was organizing the storage closet at my apartment, and pulled out a hard case containing my .308 bolt action deer rifle. I haven\u2019t touched this thing since 2018 when I last took it to the range to sight in my scope. The storage room isn\u2019t climate controlled, and the house is super old, so I decided to crack this thing open to make sure it\u2019s still in good shape. \nI laid it on the floor, opened the case, and cleared out the old paper target that was folded up in there. I came back and knelt down at the front of the case (I.e. the muzzle-like a dumbass), grabbed the rifle by the foregrip, and picked it up. The sling must have caught on the trigger, because it immediately went off and shot me through the thigh and dug a tract out of my calf. \nFuck. \nWords cannot describe the amount of fear and pain that coursed through me. I reached back and gently touched where my hamstring should be, and it felt shredded and wet. My ears were ringing so loud I couldn\u2019t hear myself screaming \u201cOh fuck, I\u2019m shot! Oh my God, I\u2019m shot, call 911!\u201d\nMy ex gf was there getting some of her things-we had broken up days prior but remain friendly. As she was calling 911, I had enough composure about me to direct her to grab a tourniquet that I had from my Army days as a medic, put it high and tight in my groin, and immediately began losing motor function as I slipped in and out of shock.\nI remember a few things from what ensued as emergency services arrived on scene. I remember the feeling of bones in my femur grinding together as they moved me onto a spine board. I remember being repeatedly shoved back down as I kept sitting up trying to assess the damage for myself. I remember my family being outside in a panic as they brought me outside to the ambulance and hearing the police tell them there was no time to speak to me because I was dying from blood loss, and that I\u2019d be lucky to keep my leg.\nThe rest of that night is a blur of narcotics and panicked health care personnel, and me holding the hand of a nurse who kept me reassured that I was going to live. \nI woke up in another hospital after something like 6 hours of surgery where they drove a shaft up the length of my femur, followed my 3 screws to hold together what was shattered. I\u2019ve had 3 surgeries this week to include a 7\u201dx11\u201d skin graft, and I am remarkably recovering well. \nI have so much ahead of me in terms of recovery, and I am blessed to have the support of my family who completely packed up my apartment today, since it has stairs that I won\u2019t be navigating any time soon. \nI fucked up you guys. I am such a stickler about firearm safety and never carry a weapon with a round in the chamber, even when carrying concealed to prevent things like this from happening. My rifle didn\u2019t have a magazine in it, the mag was loaded and packed in the case with my rifle. I should\u2019ve never even been oriented at the muzzle of that weapon, but I got complacent. \nMy message to everyone is this: firearms have a place as an important tool, but they are inherently hazardous as their only intended function is to maim and kill. With that being said, double, triple, hell clear your firearms as many times as it takes to make it a habit EVERY time you touch a weapon. Even if you briefly put it down, clear it again when you pick it up. Practice firearms safety 100% of the time because it only took a fraction of a second to really fuck me up and that could be you. Just please use my story as a lesson to encourage proper safety practices because this week has been the hardest, most painful days of my life. \nThank you. \n\nTl;dr: shot myself in the leg with a .308 rifle because I had a lapse in safety and almost died. Please be safe with guns because if they hurt you it really fucking sucks.\n\nEdit: For those grilling me about storing a loaded gun, I never said I packed it up at the range. We were alternating between a few rifles and I didn\u2019t go behind and open every case to double check that they were all clear once we got loaded up. Don\u2019t be dicks about me making soldiers look bad or questioning my competence therein. I\u2019m a responsible gun owner who made a mistake that anyone could have which led to an accident. I never even got the rifle in my arms to check it, which would\u2019ve been my first move.\n\nEdit 2: No, you can\u2019t have pics right now because it\u2019s literally just one big ace wrap from hip to toes. I\u2019ll see what I can do about getting you some pics of the X rays though, and if you guys are really into it, I\u2019ll take one when they change my bandages. All I can say is that I had an entry hole the size of a golf ball. Some shit band aids can\u2019t fix.\n\nEdit 3: Picture from my dressing change today. This is the most that the doctor would let it be exposed without setting up a sterile field. I\u2019m hooked to a wound vac, and we\u2019re just trying to keep everything clean while it heals. \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/vi8LBYy",

Never aim a firearm at something you don't want to destroy or kill.\n\n4. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.\n\n\nIf you screw up three of these rules, the fourth one might save someone's life, including your own. There is no such thing as an \"accidental shooting\", only a negligent discharge.\n\nBy the way, if you're carrying a piece concealed, but with no round in the chamber, you're really just carrying an expensive club. The way you're carrying is a holdover from single action revolvers, and semi-automatics before the invention of firing pin blocks, trigger safeties, and drop safeties. Good quality modern firearms can be carried fully loaded, with a round in the chamber, in a safe condition, and be ready to fire as soon as you draw.

Yet you describe total rookie moves like carrying concealed on an empty chamber, and putting away your rifle dirty, round chambered, safety off, and handling a weapon without the action open. With your training and experience, popping the action open on a rifle before handling it would be a reflexive action, and you would never, ever have pointed one at yourself. Not accidentally, anyway.\n\n  I'm still trying to envision the sequence of events that led to you NDing into your leg. You had the rifle in a hard case, popped the latches, opened it, then moved to the muzzle end and picked it up? Why would you do that?

Slings don't pull triggers, at least none that I've ever seen. \n\n You are not telling the truth about part of all of this story.

This just makes it look like you are as irresponsible as someone who would do this type of thing again even after this. Its not a mistake \"anyone can make\" its negligence people who get lazy about firearms safety eventually make. Thinking about it for a second you can easily see the dozens of signs you intentionally ignored out of laziness or I suspect with the knowledge you just broke up, probably duress assuming you are as trained as you claim and ex military.\n\nHear me out before you downvote, especially if you are an owner yourself:\n\nI'm sorry for going in on you and I hope you feel better soon, but this isn't about you as I believe was your intention posting this. The warning is that this doesn't happen to just anyone, it happens because of the attitude you adopted over time as your story clearly indicates, and a choice to be negligent that is available to every single person who owns a firearm every time they interact with it. Making the decision to be negligent when you are informed of all the possibilities and trained properly is a decision you make with full knowledge of what can and will happen to you. The decision all the old heads warned you about with eyes so serious it made you uncomfortable all the years ago.\n\nIt's the time when you are upset about breaking up with your gf and shes in the other room and your brain is stuck on that and not addressing the weapon, its the time when you get evicted, its the time when a family member dies. Its the time when you aren't going to give enough of a shit to check chamber that's going to get you. When you become an owner you're agreeing to set your feelings aside for that 10 seconds during these times and in exchange you have the right to be trusted to own one. In fact the reason its legal to own one is precisely because it doesn't happen to just anyone, that's exactly the oppositions argument for making guns illegal. It can just happen to anyone. If that were the case they would have to be illegal because your neighbor couldn't be trusted to not just blast you on accident while you're browsing reddit across the street. Our argument as owners is that if you train proper habits AND practice them your entire life, you can be responsible enough to never have an accidental discharge.\n\nIts a big agreement, annoying, inconvenient, at times seems ridiculous and silly after the millionth time the chamber is empty when you check. I know. It gets soooo old checking every time. You just stop caring eventually. Thats the moment to catch yourself. That's when you have to tell yourself oh fuck, its actually getting old. Thats scary shit. I need to double my efforts and make my habits even tighter. This was why when I had a ridiculous collection I sold most of them. I just had to be honest with myself about the upkeep. Good habits saved my ass the one time the chamber was loaded. I unloaded and racked a .380, but it was just stuck in the barrel for whatever reason didnt catch the ejector rod. In that moment I understood why the old heads always said \"Put your fucking eyeball in there and LOOK. Don't trust it.\" After it seemed so absurd and the tens of thousands of times I had checked and nothing was there and I thought how stupid of a habit it was. Well I just about shit my pants when I saw the back of that brass stuck in there. I would have pulled the trigger for function check and blew a hole through the side of my house.\n\nBro, when you heal and everyones going to ask whats up with that big ass gunshot wound and you go \"ah yea, made a mistake... but I am a responsible gun owner and it could've happened to anyone. I am really careful\" what would you think of that guy? Just own it. Yea it sucks and its tough. You aren't a disgrace to the military ignore that shit.\n\nFolks, please, if you haven't touched your weapon in 3 months or more, you shouldn't own it. Period. Sell it, get rid of it, or kick yourself in the ass. You are not responsibly maintaining safe habits with that weapon anymore. Especially if you live with other people. We all agreed to doing at least weekly function checks and monthly takedown cleaning just to remain familiar with operation right? If we aren't willing to commit to that 30 minutes a week of upkeep per weapon, we need to get rid of it and admit that we aren't responsible owners anymore. Can you be a responsible owner? The reason you do these things is to MAINTAIN THE HABIT not because the weapon needs it. Yes it would shoot if you don't clean it for 5 years, that's not the point. The point is we're all dumbasses that need habits for safe operation.\n\nFinally, lets break down how this went wrong so people can learn from it:\n\n\\- Stored a weapon loaded and knowing this at the time, decided to leave it for over a year self admittedly. Thought about it multiple times that you should really check that rifle you never checked, or at least clean it. Chose not to. Eh I always check, I probably checked. Its probably fine. Multiple times ignored securing the weapon from the range to home, and again storing it in the closet.\n\n\\- Addressed a weapon you had not touched in longer than you could remember muzzle first. Being a responsible gun owner you got the butt pucker of sweeping yourself through the case but decided to ignore it. We all pucker when being swept. If you don't, sell the weapon.\n\n\\- While the muzzle of a weapon you have not cleared is pointed at you, you decided to interact with it in spite of all the training otherwise and I would bet money a little voice in the back of your mind yelling at you.\n\n\\- Ignoring the strap wrapped around the trigger, or failing to evaluate the condition of the weapon before interacting with it. This wasn't the moment the mistake was made, and thats why it was negligent. This was over a year of conscious decisions that lead to negligence.\n\n\\-  Good habits make for safe weapon ownership. They must be respected and kept every single day. That's what we all signed up for. Breaking this contract turns the weapon into a time bomb for everyone around you. You don't get to be lazy, you don't get to do whatever you want. Its not just about you.\n\nTL;DR\n\n DO NOT address a weapon under duress (breakup, death in the family, anger)\n\n Address the weapon from a safe position and evaluate condition before handling. \n\nCheck chamber every. single. time. no excuses. \n\nRack and lock, Get your fucking eye in there. Use a flashlight if you can't see CLEARLY.\n\n It doesn't just happen to anyone. Guns don't shoot themselves. Responsible habits are the difference between ownership and negligence.",

            "A friend of the family -- someone I called Uncle John -- taught me \"it's the unloaded ones that get you\".\n\nAccordingly, every time I handle a gun, I open it up and check it's unloaded. Even if I know it's unloaded. Even if I am 100% sure, such as handling a weapon from a safe I myself locked away. Even if I just saw someone check it themselves and I know, for sure, it's unloaded. Pull back the bolt, double-check, always.\n\nThis makes it a habit. An important habit because one of these times, one day, I KNOW that I'm going to pull back the bolt/slide/charging handle and a round I did not expect is going to pop out. It will happen eventually and on that day I will be shocked and embarrassed and angry and a whole bunch of emotions but I won't be physically injured, and that's the key.\n\nSorry about your leg, mate.

We were alternating between a few rifles and I didn\u2019t go behind and open every case to double check that they were all clear once we got loaded up. Don\u2019t be dicks about me making soldiers look bad or questioning my competence therein. I\u2019m a responsible gun owner who made a mistake that anyone could have which led to an accident. I never even got the rifle in my arms to check it, which would\u2019ve been my first move.\n\nbuddy I know people who have owned guns and taken literal dozens of guns, of different types too, to a range on a single day and even had other people help put their guns up. Still they checked to make sure each gun was empty before leaving the range. You made an an irresponsible decision and a stupid mistake and paid dearly for it. You were not a responsible gun owner, but I'll bet you will be now after shotting yourself in the leg."

I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered 20% off as a new customer, and applied the discount. However, this then took me below the amount I needed to get free postage. So I decided to get one more thing to push me back over that limit. \nI did not know how far I had pushed the limit until it was too late.\n\nI kept browsing and then decided I would get a new buttplug, maybe a slightly bigger one than current just to try it. I found a reasonably priced one in 3 sizes, 3.5 inches, 4 inches and 4.5 inches. I, the anal NOOB that I am, assumed this was in reference to LENGTH. So I clicked on the largest one to add to cart, because you know, new experience, the length doesn't seem that bad, worth a try.\n\nFast forward a couple days and my delivery arrives! I'm excited, I don't know what's coming. I wait for my partner to get home and we unbox it together. It's all fun and games and lighthearted until...\nWe unearth a MONSTROSITY of a buttplug, it is quite literally the SIZE OF MY HAND. Theres a stunned silence before I rush to explain this was an ACCIDENT and all my partner can do is crack up. (No pun intended). I tore off the packaging incase it was some sort of optical illusion making it look bigger but NO ITS JUST MASSIVE AND IT IS GOING NOWHERE NEAR MY SCARED AND NAIVE BUMHOLE.\n Hope this brings you all more joy than it brought me. Honestly the best part of this is I now have an interesting story to post on reddit.\n\nTL;DR -  I'm out a bit of money, own a MASSIVE buttplug and have caused a small injury to my partner when I jokingly threw it to him and the WEIGHT OF IT CAUSED HIM PHYSICAL PAIN.",

        "selftext": "So apparently I'm a genuine idiot. My husband and I sometimes send flirty pics back and forth when we haven't gotten to spend much time together because of busy schedules. Last night I was having some drinks while he was at work, but safe to say I was drunk. I took a few photos and went to send them to him, well to what I thought was him, but accidentally pressed the button for my snap story in my drunken haze. I didn't realize, went to sleep, and woke up to the tragedy\n\nFriends, family, co-workers, people from high school, etc. It's like f*cking D-Day. They all had access to my full frontal nudity and vagina on display just right up there for 8 damn hours overnight. I couldn't even bear to look at who all saw it. Excuse me while I go die. I'm just deleting that app from hell and then going to change my name, cut my hair and abandon my life, brb. I don't know how I'm going to recover from the embarrassment, I'm just going to go dark for a few months\n\nTLDR: I was drunk and stupid, went to send flirty nude pics to my husband but accidentally pressed my story. Went to sleep, woke up to seeing what I had done 8 hours later. Friends, family, co-workers, people from high school, etc, are all on the account. I'm going to change my name and move to recover from the embarrassment",

            "Had some friends who were in a relationship. They ended up accidentally posting a story of them 'finishing up' the act. Video, both nude, man's dick's out. Whole 9 yards.\n\nIt was a rough go. Everyone who saw it called them pretty quick but it was still an unfortunate occurence.",
            "When I was in high school we had a CVS that had a Subway shop inside. A girl in my grade worked there, and took a bunch of nude photos all around the Subway kitchen, posing on the prep tables etc. She then went to get the photos developed at the same CVS that the Subway where she worked was in. She got fired.",

            "So my dad (divorced from my mom since 1974) got on Facebook maybe ten years ago, give or take. And like a lot of Boomers, he had some trouble figuring out how to use it, Example of Boomer Facebook problems: My girlfriend's dad didn't know the status box wasn't a search bar, so for a full weekend he just kept posting names of his ex girlfriends he wanted to stalk. But I digress.\n\nAnyhow, my dad was posting pics and somewhere along the way I was going through them, as one does. As I do so, without warning... there's my dad's asshole and ballsack in high-def, hair and all. He's bent way over and obviously getting some help with the photo. I wasn't quite sure how to deal with this but eventually decided a \"rip the bandaid off\" approach was best. But I wanted to give him at least a tiny way to save face, so instead of saying \"Dad, your balls and asshole are posted on your Facebook profile. Maybe you could remove them before your granddaughters see them?\" I said \"*Somebody's* balls and asshole are posted on your Facebook profile...\" I was secretly hoping that somehow it would turn out to be not my dad's taint on my screen. Even though I knew better, *I was hoping it was anyone's taint but his.*\n\nMy dad wrote back and said. \"Huh. Will ya look at that. Good lookin' fella though, isn't he?\" He didn't give a fuck. It's like he thought anyone who got a look at his 63 year old balls was *lucky*.\n\nAnd so if there were ever any doubt in my mind that was my dad's balls and asshole, it's gone now.\n\n*Edit: Oh, Jesus. This is on its way to being my most popular comment of all time. Sorry, Dad.*",
            "Had a customer the other day tell me he was scrolling through snap stories and saw a female friend of his do a slow pan down of head to tits to cooch, and then do a PAINFULLY long zoom in of her swirling her bean. She meant to send it to her boyfriend, obviously. My customer personally messaged her so she could take it down before many people saw it, and she was VERY thankful to him because nobody else that saw it said anything. Just thought I'd share this in case you needed to know people have fucked up worse than you! We also had a girl share a nude to our aerial fitness group by accident (we're all female though, so it hits different) and she ended up getting a lot of compliments. She was embarrassed, but she was like, well, thanks guys.",

            "I once thought I popped my implant so I sent full topless pics to my Dr. Turns out my phone had that \"automatically post to Facebook\" feature so I'm blasting my titties to Facebook- so my old friends from HS and college, my parents, my kids friends parents, my AP English teacher, everyone- got a blurry pic of my bruised titty underneath my full legal name. Everyone responded to alert me, and my favorite was a one time crush who assured me \"they look pretty good tho.\" Four years later and everyone forgot about it and it's just funny now. Don't worry this too will pass!",

I was able to learn who my real friends were that day as a lot of them immediately texted me and let me know about my post. Still super embarrassing even though they thought it was hilarious",

It goes something like:\n\n\u201cDo you know who cares less about your embarrassments, problems, and insecurities?\n\u2026..\nEverybody.\u201d\n\nIt helps me to remember that most people are too tied up in their own problems to really care about our mistakes!\n\nHope this blows over for you and that you can start laughing about this soon!",

            "Ok I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. As others have said try not to worry, it was late at night & you deleted it. Fingers crossed not many seen it. Maybe put a post up saying your iCloud was hacked & they gained access to Snapchat. Explaining your posting as a warning to others to secure their iCloud accounts. \n\nI have a story that might make you feel better. \n\nA friend of someone I know was in a zoom meeting with his staff team & CEO of the company. He thought he had muted himself but clearly hadn\u2019t. Proceeded to go to the bathroom with his headphones/mic on. Took a dump with all sound effects included. He came back to tons of other staff on the instant chat telling him to turn off his mic. Yeah, so they heard the whole thing. The CEO of a massive company. I can only imagine the absolute awkwardness of the meeting, people continuing to talk over the noises of his bathroom visit. Them frantically trying to warn him. Some staff were genuinely annoyed as it went on longer and longer and they realised they couldn\u2019t get his attention to make it stop. Poor guy is currently looking for a new job- imagine the shame!",
            "There was a guy in my class in high school, who broke up with his then gf. He posted most of her nudes on facebook with something like \"she is a whore\".

It was hairy for a minute, but he's back at work.  \n\nA friend's spouse once accidentally posted a few private pics online for all to see. Most of us just shrugged and said 'Good on them for trying to spice things up'.  I went a few years without even thinking about it until I saw your post. Hang in there!",
            "Probably you made someone happy. Don't care. I have seen plenty of similar stuff and ppl don't care. At least some dickhead could joke on that. If that happens don't feel embarrassed, it's your body and for sure they won't ever touch it so fuck that stupid people and enjoy.\n\nAwesome you send nudes with your hubby. So scared this could stop after marriage. Me and my gf are quite open on our sex life so I hope fun won't end.\n\nEnjoy sis.",

My fianc\u00e9 and I have been together a few years but I know that our sexual attraction will never dwindle. I\u2019ve never experienced this level of intimacy before and when it\u2019s discussed with friends the only people that passive aggressively say it will pass are the ones in unhappy relationships.

            "It's a body, and while, yes, it wasn't who you wanted to see it, they've seen others and they'll see others beyond.\n\nIt doesn't make the cringing you're doing any more bearable, but might make it easier to throw away as you move on, having done similar things in the past.",
            "My female cousin did something similar, but kind of worse. She was having an affair with her friend's husband and accidentally sent the Parent-Teacher's Association at her daughter's school a bunch of her nude photos & messages about sex that included the guy's name. Both of their partners found out and it was semi-viral in my city, the infidelity aspect the real \"scandal\". I found out when a friend sent them to me, saying \"Isn't that your cousin?\". It just confirmed to me that she had implants. And after a few days, it had all died down. Embarrassment always fades away and one day it may even be just something to chuckle about with certain relatives.",

I accidentally tapped (big fingers) on the dick pic. Now normally, you could just send without a thought... but there it was on deck ready to go and somehow I was able to not send it and get rid of it.

I\u2019m sure you feel mortified, that\u2019s expected but don\u2019t beat yourself up. It was an accident.",
            "My best friend accidentally sent a couple nudes to a group chat instead of to her boyfriend. Group chat is a little weird because at the time, snapchat didn't offer the delete a message option, so taking them down turned into a huge pain- she had to leave the group and rejoin it, but even then there were already several people who had seen them. She is someone who is CONSTANTLY objectified because of her body, so in the 15-30 minutes they were up, she had a couple creeps in the 30+ people chat take screenshots of them too. I had to sit there and comfort her for awhile after her boyfriend was yelling at her and calling her an idiot (not the first or the last time). \n\nGood news, however, is they broke up and now she and I are seeing each other(:",

If anybody said anything, I don\u2019t remember that either. Oops.",
            "I did something similar but it wasn't nudes, it was a short video of me saying something super creepy sounding (it was an inside joke with the intended recipient).

Still fucking terrifying.",
            "I did this. Uploaded multiple pics to Facebook and my fat finger accidentally pressed one from my gallery that was NOT meant for public eye.

It'll blow over and eventually it'll be a fun story to tell at parties.",

            "From having received unintentional erotic imagery and also having been in uncommon and uncomfortable situations myself, as a lot of people have - owning up to it and not making it a big deal is the most neutral, less destructive and the adult way of handling it. People make mistakes and seeing someone ...prepped for battle isn't and shouldn't be a life changing experience. While it may be embarrassing, I quote a Casually Explained video discussing being faced with the question of what people think about him: \"You don't have to be embarrassed. Noone thinks about you.\"\n\nDon't stress too much. If you're super worried about it then it probably means your nudes are some good, quality shit and you should be proud.",

Don\u2019t worry about an accident. \n\nEmbarrassing, heck yeah.\nRecoverable, heck yeah. \n\nHusbands probably proud as a peacock right now anyways.",
            "Whenever I fuck up like this, I remind myself: everyone thinks other people think about them way more than other people actually think about them. Other people have other things in life.\n\nA good reminder is reddit itself. If you post something that goes through the roof and get 10k upvotes, it lasts for a day or so and then it dies off, never to receive a single upvote until the 6 month lock happens. Similar in real life.\n\nIn other words - embarrassing, but don't worry that much about it. It's going to go away.",
            "Yoo just keep uploading weird random preverted stuff with pictures that are not related to you and then few days later say \"my account was hacked\"",
            "\"My account has been hacked, do not trust it.\" Then start posting spam links and etc, it worked for my friend.",

Body shame stuff aside (everyone is right, it\u2019s skin, we\u2019ve all got our own bits and bobs!) but this will be forgotten. \n\nHad a friend send a full mast pic to a group chat on accident. Like group chat of 20s geek squad employees. A group that you think would be vicious and relentless with a screw up like that. He Spent the next month eating some jokes but nothing mean spirited or personally attacking. Now it\u2019s an occasional laugh but did not wreck his professional or personal life even short term. \n\nWe live in a crazy world, crazier by the day.

Just like my current wife, she had a son from her first marriage. My stepson was around 4 years old back then and he sees me as his real father, seeing his own father walked out on him.\n\nMy son from my first marriage was living with his mom, but I saw him quite often shop was on his way back from school, he dropped by occasionally to say hello or look at the cars I had in the shop. My wife and ex-wife actually got along well, there was never any issues with my son staying over or staying for dinner, he lived with his mom though.\n\nWhen I turned 17 my dad bought me a black Chevrolet Chevelle SS, through my entire live I've always taken care of that car. I loved that car to dead, 90% of that car is still consisting of it's original parts. Seeing I'm a mechanic I had no issues doing everything myself, this car was standing in front of my shop most of the time or in my garage at home. My son, loved this car as well. He always wanted to go along for rides and he knew everything about it. He even had a small model car that looked just like it.\n\nSo, where did it go wrong you wonder? My ex-wife remarried as well 8 years ago, but they moved a few states away seeing her new husband got a new (and better paid) job offer. After that, I spoke to my son mostly on the telephone and saw him maybe once every 3-4 months for a long weekend or half a week. The phone calls became less frequent and he said he wanted to focus on his schoolwork. Seeing he was a teen and I couldn't blame him for that. My stepson was already 10 at that time. When my son was 16 he went to univeristy a few states away, I barely had time to speak to him or to see him, my business was doing bad at the time and my wife had also gotten really sick at the time with E. coli and got kidney failures. It was a tough time keeping everything together, but somehow we made it through all of it and my wife is doing far better now.\n\nFast forward to april 2019, my stepson was turning 16 that month. My stepson always got on with my son, so he invited him. My son was busy at the time, but promised he would show up a few days later. After all that happened I didn't see him for almost 4 years, so I was glad he was coming over. Now here comes to part where I fucked up badly. My stepson was a grade A student, even when times where tough he managed to get good grades at school and even got into the university where he wanted to study Medicine. My wife and I where so proud of him. So I decided to give him my old Chevrolet Chevelle for his 16 birthday.\n\nHe was pretty amazed by it and so were his friends, it's a car that to this day still makes an impact. It so on my son as well, one that would cost my relationship with him.\n\nI texted him a picture of my stepson with the car on his 16 birthday party, not knowing what would happen next. My son texted me back with \"Is this a joke?\"\n\nI didn't understand at the time and texted him back with \"No, why?\"\n\nHe called me not a few seconds later, yelling at me to tell him that it was a joke.\n\nHe told me that I promised him the car when he was 10 years old, that if he did well in school I would give it to him. The part that made me yell back at him through the phone was when he called me a \"louzy father that didn't care about his real son\", let me tell you things were said from both sides that weren't nice from that point onwards.\n\nMy wife told me to calm down and to talk it out because there was some misunderstanding.\n\nI then did the most regretabble thing I've done and If I could take it back I would do it, I told my son in a fit of rage that \"he didn't deserve the car\" and that he could call me back if he changed his attitude. After I hang up the phone, I got into a fight with my wife, who stood up for my son. At that moment in time I didn't care, I was insulted for being called a bad father.\n\nI tried to contact my son a few days afterwards, but I wouldn't get any response. I think he changed his phone number a day after the fight. I couldn't care any less at the time.\n\nThree weeks later my ex-wife called, furious as hell. My son had apparently gratuated from University and I was (in hindsight) not invited by my son. My ex-wife already found it strange that I wasn't there, my son told her there and then what happened and that he wanted to invite me on the day he would come to visit for his graduation. The worst thing is, he was graduating as an automotive service technician and was apparantly one of the best in his class. I then realized that I was indeed, a bad father. In those 4 years of not seeing him and all the stress around me I didn't even bother to ask what he was studying. My ex-wife told me that he was heartbroken and felt like he was unwanted unlike my stepson. She started crying on the phone, saying he just wanted to be a mechanic just like you. He apparently wanted to move back and work with me in my shop and take over when I was going to retire. My entire world crumbled up in front of me, I felt and still feel so encridibly stupid for saying those things to him. My ex-wife wouldn't give me his new number and adress, seeing he wanted no contact with me ever again. She also told me to never reach out to her ever again.\n\nIt's been more then a year now, I've had a few fights about it with my wife. My stepson gave the car back and settled for something else if it ment that my son would come back.\n\nI've tried getting into contact with him for the last 11 month's. Until a few months ago the last thing I found out that he was probably working for some big car manufacturer, but they didn't want give out any information about the people working there.\n\nYesterday I got a package from him, unexpectedly.\n\nIt didn't come with a letter or return adress on it, but I knew it was from him.\n\nIt was a box with his old Chevrolet toy car, an old picture ripped up of him and me on the hood of the car and a videotape. I watched the videotape, he was probably seven years old at the time, in the video I was fixing a car. I cried halfway through this, because I then knew why he mailed me the tape.\n\nI said to him while he was filming it, if he wanted and kept up his grades that the shop could be his one day including my Chevie.\n\nTLDR: I didn't keep my promise to my son and gave away my sports car to my stepson.Things were said and now I will never see him again.\n\nEdit: a part I left out\n\nEdit 1: Some of you didn't clearly read everything and that's okay. I would be mad to while reading this. My stepson is not to blame here, he gave back the car and the car is now stored in a garagebox. This car has become a thorn in my eye and I can't look at it tbh.\n\nEdit 2: Me and family tried to search for him on facebook and all the other popular social media apps, seeing how he never was into any of those we couldnt find anything.\n\nEdit 3: I've been searching for him for quite some time already. If this virus clears out I can travel to some states to see if he actually lives or works there.\n\nEdit 4: After actually contacting my ex-wife a few times over the course of months, she told me half a year ago that she would ask him once to contact me. But she couldn't force him to if he didn't want to.\n\nEdit 5: Some of you have reached out to me, I'm grateful for the help from some of you to try to help me track him down. But as you can understand I can't give out personal information about myself or my family and my son. There is already to much at stake.\n\nEdit 6: Deleting this account. I know a lot of you people are angry. Believe me I know the feeling, I hate myself as well. I came here to share a story of how I fucked up badly, hoping some people maybe would learn of it. But the nasty messages and death threats I'm receiving in my inbox from other car enthusiasts and other upset people are really not worth it.   \nFrom one worthless father to any father or future one, please learn from my mistake.",

            "It's like that Cat's in the Cradle song. First the dad never has time for the son, and then the son never has any time for the dad. The screwup wasn't giving away the car to the wrong person (though giving such a nice old car to a 16yr old is it's own kind of screwup), it was in not seeing more of your son over the years. He graduated school, and you never had asked what his major was? How low was he on your priorities list? The car isn't the problem, the car is the straw that broke the camel's back.",
            "I dont even know how to respond to this, this is the biggest fuck up i have ever read. Sounds like that promise was one of the things that guided his childhood, something that guided his decisions through his life, and you broke it. Im sorry to hear about this situation with your son.",
            "Fucking hell. I don't think that you even really understand what your fuckup was yet. It wasn't that you gave a car to your stepson and not to him. \n\nIt's that you cared so little about his life that you could get to the point of giving away that car without even realising that it would affect him. You didn't know what subject he was studying for four years. You clearly haven't spoken to him about his love for cars during that time either or it would have come up at some point. I'm sure your son has had doubts in his mind for a long long time about how much his dad cares about him given the lack of contact. But he's been holding onto that thought of coming and working with you and building that relationship to get him through. The car being given to someone else is just the single moment that highlights in an instant how little his dad has cared about him in such a long time. \n\n\n\nIf you're ever going to repair that relationship you're going to have to do a hell of a lot more than give him that car. You're going to have to demonstrate that you care about him, as a person, and you're going to have to mean it. And you're going to have to do that for a long long time to ever repair that relationship and manage to convince him that you really do care.",
            "Your son has spent his whole life taking after you, idolising you. He worked hard to be just like you. He got good enough grades to get into university, and you didn't give him the car, despite your step son achieving the same and getting it. He chose to do an engineering degree to work with you and look after your business for the rest of his life, yet still you didn't give him the car. He was working for 4 years at the top of his class, you didn't give him the car. And then he graduated and you finally realised your mistake. \n\nYou didn't just disappoint him, you upturned his world. Everything he did he did for you. You need to type up a letter explaining everything, then hand write it out and send it to your ex wife for her to forward onto your son.",
            "Wow this is tragic. Especially since your actual son was far more interested in cars than your stepson.\n\n\nEdit: OP fucked up badly as a father, but the death threats? Really? I've heard of uncalled for, but damn.",
            "I feel so bad for your son.  All he wanted is to be like you but you didn't see him for four years, was not even interested in what he was studying and then you just crushed him by giving the car away to his step-brother.    \n\nIt's like you chose your step-son over him.",

Fuck the car.\n\nDo you know what I'm dealing with as a parent who had my son's mom not show up for years?\n\nYou didn't just fuck up today partner, you've fucked up for a very long time. Chances of you fixing this in this lifetime are slim.\n\n \"louzy father that didn't care about his real son\"",
            "You didn't fuck up by giving your stepson the car you promised your son.\n\nYou fucked up by not being the bigger person in a relationship with a duty of care (which you failed to fulfill miserably).\n\nI'm not trying to insult you, but I'm also not going to sugarcoat anything to make you feel better. Live with the consequences of what you've done.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSon of a Verbally Abusive Father",
            "This is absolutely devastating and has ruined my entire week",
            "That broken promise was the nail in the coffin. \nYou stopped being his dad years ago, probably without even realizing it. But that promise was his last hope of getting back his dad and you killed it.\n\nMy father did something similar and I will never forgive him and I don't see why your son should forgive you. Sorry",

            "If your son doesn't want you to find him, don't find him. If he wants to find you he'll find you. I don't want my bio father to find me. It bothered me when he did contact me. Finally, he'd tried to BUY his way into my life by telling me about all the child support he had saved, so if your plan is to try to use the car to bring him back into your life, don't, that's a stupid fucking decision.",
            "Dude.  He's your kid, and you let your relationship with him become virtually nothing.  The car is a symptom of the problem - The fact that he barely had your attention for years is the problem.\n\nI hope you find him soon and prove to him, consistently, that you can be an interested, available, and attentive father.\n\nHe's young and hurt and not wrong, although the car itself is a merely representative of his feelings of \"coming in second\" in your life. \n\nGood luck with making the changes necessary and creating a real relationship.

            "I am going to assume this story is made up. I read it twice and it seems like the guy was intentionally trying to make his son hate him. I mean, he remembered how much his son loved the car, never mentioned the step-son being particularly enamored with it, so why give it to him? A cheap beater would make a better daily if he just needed a car. Then he sends his son a picture of his step-son with the car, but never even thinks about his son\u2019s relationship with that car.",
            "Maybe one day he'll forgive you, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\n**Here's a copy since it was deleted:**\n\nTIFU by giving my old sports car to my stepson (16), instead of my actual son (20) who wanted it since he was a child.\n\nThis happened last year, but yesterday I got a grim reminder.\n\nBefore we start off with this trainwreck of a story, here is some background information.\n\nI've been a car mechanic since the age of 19 and I have my own garage/store since I was 28 years old.\n\nAfter my first marriage went to shambles, I remarried a few years later. Just like my current wife, she had a son from her first marriage.

My parent fucked up big time (on an issue very black and white) and I\u2019m waiting for acknowledgement of the fuck up and an apology. From my personal experience, I\u2019d recommend:\n\n1. Seeing a therapist to work through everything. This is obviously traumatic for your son and for you and this is not something I\u2019d recommend working through alone in your own head.\n\n2. Consider writing a letter to your son and leave it with your ex-wife (assuming you do not have his address and your ex-wife will hold onto it). There are some benefits to this: he can read it when he is ready and you can write multiple drafts and send the one that fits exactly what you want to say. It also prevents you from saying things in the heat of the moment. You\u2019ll get to very carefully think about what the message is that you want to get across. I\u2019d also recommend actually writing what you did wrong and apologizing for those things. Don\u2019t write excuses and don\u2019t skirt the issue. That will end up with your son more angry. \n\n3. See a therapist. I can\u2019t reiterate this more. There is a chance your son won\u2019t want to talk to you for a long time. He has things to work through too and he can only work through that on his own time and that could take days or even years...maybe even decades and you need to accept that. BUT it will also take time for you to heal and for you to be a better version of yourself. Give yourself the breathing room to learn from this experience and grow and see a therapist to help you with it.",

It sounds like the biological son didn\u2019t make too much of an effort to speak to the dad but yet the Dad is entirely to blame for this problem.

        "selftext": "This happened last month during a staycation in the U.K. with my (25M) girlfriend\u2019s (25F) family. \n\nMy GF, her mum and her sister decided to go shopping for the day. Her dad, sister\u2019s boyfriend and I headed for the pub. We were about 3 pints in when the FU began.. \n\nGFs Dad: \u201cOP, how long have you and my daughter been together now?\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cAlmost 6 years\u201d\n\nGFs Dad: \u201cWow, that long already. No 7 year itch yet?\u201d\n\nHere is where it started to unravel. I couldn\u2019t recall the exact meaning of the phrase \u201c7 year itch\u201d but i thought it was meant to be a tongue in cheek question, basically asking if my GF was getting impatient about when I was to propose and when we would get married. \n\nExcept, It doesn\u2019t mean that at all. \n\nMe: \u201cYes, in fact, I have been thinking about it more and more recently and I expect it to be on the cards soon. Of course, when the time comes, I will ask for your blessing.\u201d\n\nMy GFs dad choked a bit on his beer and stared at me blankly, visibly uncomfortable. I smiled and took another sip of my beer. We finished up, and headed home. \n\nAfter dinner that night, I asked my GF if her Dad was okay as he seemed off with me. I briefed her on the conversation in the pub. She stopped me halfway through, with a huge grin on her face, struggling to contain her laughter. \n\nShe went on to explain that the phrase \u201c7 year itch\u201d is in fact a saying or popular belief that after 7 years, a relationship or marriage declines and often results in one of both parties having an affair. \n\nSo in essence, I told my girlfriend\u2019s father that I had been thinking about the decline of our relationship and when the time came, I would be asking his blessing to sleep with other women. \n\nThankfully, my future in- laws are good people. Once I explained my FU and apologised, they laughed it off and we forgot about it :)\n\nTL;DR \n\nI misunderstood a common phrase and effectively told my girlfriend\u2019s father that our relationship was in peril and I would be asking his blessing to have an affair.\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow this blew up! Thank you kind strangers for the awards and all the wholesome comments. Just to clear a couple things up.. \n\n1) There are a few people calling me out and calling me an arsehole for wanting to ask permission to marry my girlfriend. First of all, I would like to say this is a common and traditional practise in the U.K. one which I don\u2019t particularly agree with. That said, my girlfriends family are very traditional people and would likely be offended if I didn\u2019t ask. I am going to respect their traditions, even if I don\u2019t agree with them. My girlfriend is fully aware of this and agrees it is the right thing to do.\n\n2) Many people have questioned why the hell my girlfriends dad would ask that and they are trying to somehow psychoanalyse the situation. I have known my girlfriends dad for many years, we are good friends and often go to the pub, watch football etc. He didn\u2019t ask the question seriously and was joking. I think it was meant rhetorically and my response took him by surprise (probably the stupidity of it) and was trying to make sense of it before the girls turned up shortly and we had to leave.\n\n3) I have changed \u201cpermission\u201d to \u201cblessing\u201d as it has been pointed out that the former implies it\u2019s ultimately the decision of her parents, which it isn\u2019t.

I keep my ID Card in my back pocket, so I just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. That sounds a little weird to write, but I promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and I'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.\n\nOnly issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. As a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our ID out to show him as we walked in.\n\nComing in at 8:00AM, after years of habit... I was on autopilot.\n\nI approached the security guard, he said, \"ID?\" and I nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (Obviously I didn't hear the beep, so I guess my brain thought I wasn't close enough to the \"reader\"?)\n\nIt all took about two seconds, and when I felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, I suddenly realized what I was doing... but before I could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all \"Woah woah woah! Miss! I just the need the ID, please, not a lap dance!\" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.\n\nI tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. Couple of other students saw so I'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.\n\nTL;DR: Decided I could bribe my way into school without an ID by giving the security guard a lapdance...

They are both rescue husky mixes that look fairly unusual and have really beautiful blue eyes. It's not out of the ordinary for people to stop me and ask about them, compliment them, and want to pet them. Having these ridiculously gorgeous dogs has somewhat desensitized me to people yelling out of car windows and across streets because maybe three times a week someone will yell a dog-compliment at us.\n\nSo we were walking along the sidewalk when a man working on some new construction across the street yelled, \"Oh my God, I love your doggers!\" \n\nI gave him a big smile and yelled back, \"Thanks! Wanna say hi?\" He looked slightly surprised but smiled and started walking over. When he crossed the street he was suddenly acting a bit awkward and not really paying much attention to the dogs. I had them sit so maybe he'd feel comfortable petting them, but honestly I was getting a weird vibe now and wanted to get on my way. We then had the following interaction: \n\nHim: So do you want to give me your Snap? \nMe: Um, no thanks. You can say hi to them here, and I'm going to get going. \nHim: Here? You just wanna... *mimes pulling down a shirt*\n\nHere's where I realize all at once that I'd fucked up. I had been desensitized by years of dog-compliments and am now putting the pieces together that this man had very-likely catcalled me and I was basically a cat-callers dream, friendly and receptive to his advancement by smiling and inviting him over to say hi. My mind locked on to what he had originally yelled. \n\nOh my God, I love your doggers!\n\nI love your doggers!\n\nDoggers!\n\nFinally, my dumbass brain puts the peices together and I squeak out a horrified, \"Did you say you love my knockers?\" He nods yes and I wish I could say I had some cleaver retort, but honestly I just gave him a firm point of my index finger and an exasperated, \"no!\" before the pups and I hightailed it outta there. \n\n\nTL:DR I thought a random man was complimenting my dogs.

I'd check on them every now and then and every time I saw them, they were doing these weird stretches with their arms over their heads or behind their backs. After a while, I asked, 'what are you guys doing?' They said it was a flexibility test they learned from friends at school.\n\nMove 1: [Clasp your hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/lSDPR7B) with one hand going over your shoulder and one going under.\n\nMove 2: [Prayer hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/VmJaqGY).\n\nMove 3: [Touch your elbows behind your back](https://imgur.com/gallery/v5kNu7f).\n\nMost of the kids could do 1 and 2, and they were laughing at each other's struggles to do 3.\n\nAfter a while, their video started and they moved on to more important things.\n\nThe next morning at work, I was curious to see if I could do the stretches. I stood in front of the full length mirror in my office and tried them. 1 was a little tough, especially in a button down shirt. 2 was easy and felt pretty good. 3 seemed to conflict with basic human anatomy. I tried different angles and wrist positions and didn't even come close.\n\nWhile I was doing this, a young female co-worker comes over and asks what I'm doing much like I did the previous night. I explain the stretches and figure she'll have more work since she's younger and in better shape than me.\n\nStretch 1, no problem. Stretch 2, it's like she was born to do this. Then she tries to touch her elbows behind her back and the buttons of her blouse completely give up. I'm staring at her in the mirror with her shirt split open with nothing underneath. She looked shocked and embarrassed. She covered up and walked out of the room.\n\nI run to the supply closet to grab a promotional t-shirt that we hand out at events and give it to her in her office. Then I go back to the room with the mirror to find her button, which I ended up sewing back on before anyone else made it to the office.\n\ntl;dr: I asked a young female co-worker to try a difficult stretch. Which led to her blouse splitting open while we were alone in the office.",

I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it's something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.\n\nI've been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say \"traces\" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. \n\nSee, since I'm not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email's \"Accounts\" folder and terminating the ones I don't use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don't bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn't seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn't get it by registering at the service directly. I'll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.\n\nLater in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn't even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won't allow me to do that, those buttons probably don't work, do they? It can't be this bugged, right? (I hadn't clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.\n\nI'm sorry. I didn't want to. Please, forgive me everyone.\nI'll commit Sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.\nIf somebody working for Imgur sees it here, please, report it to who it would be most appropriate.\n\n**TL;DR: I deleted Reddit's [#1 top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/62sjuh/the_senate_upvote_this_so_that_people_see_it_when/?sort=new) picture by playing around with Google sign-in on Imgur.**\n\nP.S.: resubmitted because it didn't have TL;DR in the beginning\n\nEdit: link for clarification (try clicking the original \"Senate\" post's title link).\n\nEdit 2.0: **I guess *I am the senate* now**\n\nEdit 2.6.5.32: I submitted the bug to Imgur's contact form just in case...\n\nEdit 4.1.15: **just got from work to find a message from [u/_BindersFullOfWomen_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_BindersFullOfWomen_) on the behalf of Imgur's team, so the bug seems to be closed by now, the picture's back too** That's pretty cool and fast of a reaction for such a huge service, especially for me since it's already post working hours for me (I know, I know, time zones'n'shiiieeet).\n\nEdit over 9000: [to all the guys telling me about the difference between Seppuku and Sudoku](http://i.imgur.com/fs3Lkmj.png)\n\nEdit \"I lost the count\": [666 updewts](http://i.imgur.com/ilXdUsJ.png)\n\nEdit from the high ground: What the heck?

            "On July 1st, 2023, Reddit intends to alter how its API is accessed. This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may have the appearance of increasing Reddit's traffic and revenue... but in the long term, it will undermine the site as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep its platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to populate its numerous communities with content. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools (which Reddit has frequently promised and then failed to deliver), moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either, and without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit \u2013 the foundations that draw its audience \u2013 will be eliminated, reducing the site to another dead cog in the Ennui Engine.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not posture for your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. Focus on addressing Reddit's real problems \u2013 the rampant bigotry, the ever-increasing amounts of spam, the advantage given to low-effort content, and the widespread misinformation \u2013 instead of on a strategy that will alienate the people keeping this platform alive.\n\nIf Steve Huffman's statement \u2013 \"I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users\" \u2013 is to be taken seriously, then consider this our vote:\n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.",

The front-end, which all the third-party developers occupy, costs almost nothing in comparison. So when third-parties harvest the advertising dollars without sharing the major costs of the backend, that's unfair. And it's not financially sustainable to whomever is footing the backend costs.I'd like to see something worked-out that works for everybody. But Reddit is not obligated to give third-parties free use of their costly system. And it's unfair to expect them to.  \n\n\nDisclaimer: I have no relationship, financial or otherwise ,with Reddit or any of the third-party developers.",

I had just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper and I was watching TV and browsing random junk on my phone to relax when I had a small itch on my testicles (This is a warning that this post will be getting a little graphic)  \nI went downtown to scrotum town to give the crown jewels a scratch and, in my unfocussed state, I missed slightly and scratched down the back of the tube-like thing that's attached to your balls. (which I later learned is called the epididymis) This made me flinch slightly as the sensation on my jubblies was completely unexpected.  \nI didn't think about it though, scratched the itch in the correct place and carried on watching TV.  \n  \nWithin about half an hour though, my lack of sleep started to catch up on me (very suddenly) and I felt myself drifting off to sleep at about 2pm.  \n  \nI woke up at 2:45 to a numbing, sort of dull ache on my left penny in my coin purse. I thought nothing of it though and hoisted myself upright to drink water and then went back to sleep.  \n  \nI woke up a little later completely keeled over in the fetal position with my arms between my legs. I don't remember waking up but I was in this incredible pain, like I'd snapped a muscle in my balls. I can't really describe it but my left testicle felt \"different\" almost. Like it had gotten lumpy, bigger and soft. As I tried to right myself, sit up and adjust my pants, the pain struck all the way up my body and I vomited onto the carpet.  \nAt this point I decided I needed to go to hospital so went on my phone and ordered an Uber there.  \n  \nIn what ended up being the most excruciating pain I've ever felt, I lay on the floor next to my vomit and waited an agonising 10 minutes for the Uber to arrive. Once it had, I bit my tongue and dragged myself (as upright as possible) to the front door and into the back of the Uber. The Uber driver didn't really give a shit as I groaned and clenched in the back of the car and sort of dumped me outside the hospital. The next thing I remember was standing in line for the emergency room before trying to sit down. (I found out later that I had actually collapsed)  \n  \nI woke up the next morning with one less testicle, a very scared mother and a lesson in something called \"testicular torsion\".  \nGentlemen (and people with testicles) of Reddit.  \n  \nPLEASE DON'T IGNORE YOUR DULL BALL-ACHES  \n  \nTL:DR - Ignored a panged ball.

            "The fucking flashbacks man. Poor little me was only 14 years old when I casually got up a little too quickly from the toilet seat one night and felt a little twinge of pain down there. I slept it off and woke up in the middle of the night with really, really fucking painful balls. But at 14 you're really shy about these things and I didn't want to tell my parents since, well, they'll think it happened because I was beating my meat, so I slept again and hoped this would go by morning. Well, it didn't, and I finally mustered up the courage to tell my dad. Thankfully he didn't ask too many questions, he just got really mad at me for not telling him sooner and zoomed to the ER.\n\nNeedless to say it was the most embarrassing experience of my life. About 10 people had a good look at my genitals which were shriveled up in pain and shame and asked me all sorts of questions that made me want to stab my dick and forget I ever had one. They figured out what it was but it took what felt like years before some doctor finally came, fiddled with my scrotum and magically untwisted them (I still have no clue how someone could muster up the nerve to just yank at someone else's balls so freely, when it could've resulted in much worse - but hey, at least it worked). They took me into surgery for good measure and they somehow tied something to my tubes to prevent this from ever happening again. I was later told I'm one of the really lucky cases where castration was not needed especially given that I waited for so long before coming to the ER.\n\nNow imagine 14 year old me trying to explain to his classmates (and repeatedly to every teacher that came into class) why he had to miss a whole week of classes.",

Why do men's balls sometimes play ring around the rosie and fucking choke each other out like some jiu-jitsu obsessed bros at a house party.",
            "I have a very similar story.\n\nDuring summer vacation before Freshman year of high school I had to go to the emergency room because of my balls. While I browsed my phone before before I went to sleep I used to keep my other hand occupied with my balls and I would move them around or whatever and that was it. \n\nOne morning I was woken up by a sick feeling in my stomach. I didn't think it was anything serious so I tried to go back to sleep. Probably 30 minutes later I started to notice I was feeling worse and that my balls were in minor pain. I started to try and think of anything that could be happening that was normal and taught in a Sex Ed class which would explain this pain. But I was never taught about what would later be revealed to me as \"Testicular Torsion\".\n\nAn hour later the pain was starting to get really bad. I decided it was time to try and get help. \n\nI got up slowly and moved down stairs to get to my parents room. However, walking while feeling like someone is kicking your genitals repeatedly is a slight challenge. So I only made it half way down the stairs. Help was going to have to come to me.\n\nNow, my next move was the only thing that comes to mind when you're in a lot of pain and helpless. You cry for mom. So i started quietly calling for her hoping she would hear me from the stairs since it was close by. But, she was deep asleep.  I tried again louder and louder until I was probably just yelling it.\n\nMy mom comes running out of her room in her pajamas with my dad right behind her. As she gets to me at the stairs the rest of my family starts poking their heads out of their rooms to see what is happening. My painful swelling balls are now going to be a family get together on the stairway. \n\nTo summarize the next hour or two so we can get to the hospital part all you need to know is that \n\n1. my mom consulted web md to try and find a solution since the doctors office didnt open for a few hours\n2. my dad insisted he examine my balls (my little brother witnessed it all and laughed the whole time)\n3. basically everyone in my family saw my balls at one point while passing by or something else\n4. went to the doctors office. he said it was Testicular Torsion and said to go to the hospital immediately. He would call ahead so they would be ready. I puked constantly the whole way there into a paper cup that I would dump out the window and some got one the door. (its gross but i was desperate and in pain please don't judge me)\n\nSo I finally got the hospital and i'm losing my mind because my balls are on fire and I'm constantly dry heaving.\n\nA nurse rolls me into the giraffe room (it was the pediatric section of the hospital and since I was starting high school soon I thought I rated the normal area since I was older. But, my balls hurt more than my pride so giraffes will do) and they placed me on my bed and started doing their thing. Eventually one nurse came in and gave me Morphine. That stuff is amazeballs. \n\nSo now that I feel totally normal again they bring me around the whole hospital giving me all sorts of tests. Eventually a doctor arrived. ( it was early morning on a weekend and I assume he was the penis doc on call PDOC)\n\nPDOC comes in and looks at all the test results and starts staring at my balls which are just chilling on display as I sit in my giraffe room (it was cold in the room). He put his gloves on and the with a flick of the wrist untangled my balls and it was over. Or so I thought. \n\nI felt so relieved and my Parents were happy that this would be over soon. But, PDOC was not done. He had more work to do. \n\nPDOC explained to us that my balls twisted around which had restricted the blood flow to them. He untwisted them but since it wasn't corrected for a while he was concerned that one or two of my testicles might have died. Either way my body would not react well to it and he would like to examine them during surgery so that if one was alive he could save the other. \n\nI was convinced he was gonna Lance Armstrong me and take one of my beloved twins. At least I'd still have one. \n\nMy parents and I decided to go to surgery so he could examine them and also stitch them down into place to prevent it from happening again. \n\nAfter waking up in the recovery room it was explained to me that everything was fine, I kept my twins, and all was good with my genitals. \n\nI left the hospital and went back to my room where I went to rest since I was just exhausted. But, before that I wanted to check my phone and see what was going on all day. \n\nI had a ton of missed calls and a text from my girlfriend. Ends up she broke up with me. \n\nAlso my friends found out eventually and called me dingleberries. \n\n\nTL;DR  Lose your girl keep the Balls"

            "Make a movement to start a costume contest for next year. It seems costumes just arent a tradition at your school, but it's one people usually jump right on board with.\n\nMy highschool had at least 5 or 6 days every year where about half the students would dress up. Usually seniors.\n\nIn college you can wear a costume any day you want and people will think it's for some history presentation or something. Nobody cares. Not to mention I saw some cool costumes today, too",

He also dressed up for Halloween. He applied makeup all over his face and added a dark black for a false beard and black eyeliner. He also dressed in a way that he described as a warlock/rock star. He was telling me that no one commented on his costume, not even his doctor! This disappointed him. I pointed out that the other patients were probably thinking \u201cI may be screwed up but at least I\u2019m not as crazy as this guy\u201d!\nEdit: my son loves to stand out and never wants to be one of the crowd.

I am the only one on my floor who dressed up. Hell, I was the only one on my entire commute via the subway who dressed up.

            "The people at your school are lame... when I was in high school everyone dressed up, from the principal to the teachers, the cafeteria ladies, and especially the students. We liked dressing up a lot we had lots of different events throughout the school year that had a theme to dress up as. I don\u2019t remember what the event was for but my friend and I dressed up as Cowgirls together, she was like a Barbie Cowgirl and I was Goth Cowgirl lol. Anyway enjoy your costume! Dressing up is fun."

By extreme luck, somehow, my dad found David Bowie, riding on a rented motorcycle. My dad, who's a really big fan of him, went to him and asked him if is it cool to take a picture with him. David agreed and even let my dad to seat on the motorcycle behind him for the picture. My dad, overly excited, set down on the motorcycle *really* close to David, and one of my dad's friends took the picture for him. \nBack for today, i asked my dad if it's cool if i'll upload the photo for r/oldschoolcool because i knew that sort of pictures are welcomed in the sub. So instead of thinking an extra second, i wrote in the title \"my dad with David Bowie in a vacation in Greece. 1988\"\n(I didn't even noticed the typo \"in a vacation\")\nBecause of my dumbass title and my dad sitting to close to Bowie, literally all of the comments are how my dad and Bowie had sex on that vacation and how my dad is actually gay. For now I posted the picture about 7 hourse ago, and it reached to r/all with 55k upvotes and 2.4k comments with with almost all of the comments are in the style of \"your'e adopted\" your dad and Bowie def banged bro\" etc. \nAt the start it was really funny, i showed some of the comments to my dad and he laughed his ass off, but now with like 2.5k comments like that it's just straight up chaos.\nThe internet is a beutiful mess.\n\n \nTL;DR: i posted a picture of my dad with David Bowie with a bad title and everyone thinks my dad is gay and he and Bowie fucked.\n\n\n\nThe original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/eltj5q/my_dad_with_david_bowie_in_a_vacation_in_greece/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",

        "selftext": "This is the most horrifyingly disgusting thing that has ever happened to me. Fair warning. \n\nLast week, I adopted my first dog. His name is Franklin Beans and he is the absolute shit. Apparently his last owner was the human equivalent of a wet sandwich without any condiments on it. My dude was not in great shape when the fosters got him a few weeks ago. Since coming home, Franky B has been a real treat though. He has, unfortunately, had some nervous shit. I took this as further proof that Franklin and I were meant to be. My butthole is also afraid of working in new places. \n\nYesterday morning, I woke up in bed with my partner and Beans. My alarm goes off around six and I wake up to start another glorious day of teaching first graders online (yes, I have recently developed a drinking problem). As I'm fixing my tea in the kitchen, I hear a tiny dog fart. Franklin Beans is taking a shit in my living room. Oh rats! This seems like a slide backwards in the progress we made this week. Whatever. I go grab a baggie to remove the dookie from my beautiful original hard wood floors and see that there are WORMS on it. Little flat white 1/4 inch MOVING GODDAMN WORMS. I freak the fuck out, quietly because my partner is still sleeping. As I'm cleaning this up, I remember a reddit post about a cat with worms and rush to my bed to find just what I suspected: HUNDREDS OF TINY LITTLE DEAD DRIED UP WORMS. I unsuccessfully do my best to coax my partner to the couch without scaring him. I take Franklin outside to let him get the evil out of him. He immediately starts shitting again. But wait, that doesn't even look like poop... it looks like...MORE AND BIGGER WORMS. DEAR GOD. Poor Frankin is now dragging his tiny little snake hole across the cement, desperately trying to get these fuckers to unlatch. It was breaking my heart so I tried to use the plastic bag I carry for his booty presents to pull the stowaway from his tunnel. Guys, this worm was at least six inches long. It was HORRIFYING. On our walk around the block, this happens about ten more times. By the time we reach my apartment, I'm honestly impressed that I haven't fainted or screamed or thrown the whole dog out into a neighbor's bin. \n\nI get back to my apartment and the poor little dude is still scooting all over those beautiful wood floors I mentioned previously. I call up the vet and start describing the nightmare that I am living, because at this point I'm pretty sure my dog is just a big cute bag of worms. While pacing around, I step in something wattery. I look reluctantly look down to see what appears to be a writhing fistfull of ramen noodles in a puddle of strawberry jam. I lose my ABSOLUTE SHIT and let out a blood curdling scream. This only frightens poor little Beans into releasing more worms from his bowels. I cancel my first live lesson and rush this spaghetti maker over to the vet for a drop off appointment, so I can get home and teach those tiny little psychopaths about verbs and shit. Around lunch time they call me to diagnose him as having a literal butt-ton of tapeworms. We talk care and recovery and I, still, am feeling slightly proud of myself for being as calm as I am. I hang up the call and return to my students, who are finishing up with lunch. As I log into the Teams Meeting, I see one of my students eating the worst possible food for this day: A fucking Cup O Noodles. I can no longer handle this situation. In a shameful display of squeamishness, I proceed to vom all over my couch. On camera. In front of students and parents. Children are shrieking. I'm shrieking. I have no idea how I'm going to explain this on Monday. \n\nTL;DR Unknowingly got myself a pup o' noodles and lost my lunch over a cup o' noodles.",

The first 2 weeks he had wormy diarrhea every single night in my bed and you could literally watch the little worm segments crawling out of his butthole. He slept burritoed up every night to catch all of them. I woke up with him several times per night to feed and clean him. Had such a heavy amount he had to be dewormed 3x before he was clear. I did so much laundry in those first few weeks it was insane. He's the best boy though, so definitely worth all of the gross.",

Not only was this little baby stinky, had a terrible looking stitch job from the spay, red ears from infections, she also had worms. \n\nCalled the vet as soon as they opened on Monday and had them squeeze us in the same day.

I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PUPPY WITH SO MANY ROUNDWORMS. Vet said my puppy had roundworms in gestation. She got 5 or 6 deworming treatments from the vet. We had to follow her around the yard and pick up her poops for the first few months we had her because roundworm eggs are in a shell and can lay dormant for up to 5-10 YEARS. We joked that she was more worm than dog. She'll be 5 in December. [Dog tax](https://imgur.com/a/hvrZV6D)",

I went to the vet but she still had them for a little bit after that and I found a very expensive over the counter deworming medication. I gave her one pill and ever since I haven't seen any. She would cry like she was in so much pain and it broke my heart but 4 years later I haven't seen any.",

Okay cool, it\u2019s a baby cat, we already have two, but why not another.\n\nClean him up, and he\u2019s good. After a few weeks, I see him come out of the litter box, with something hanging from his ass... what in the fuck.\n\nI grab him, and see it\u2019s a massive flat looking worm. I grab gloves from my aid bag, and hold the kitten, and grab the worms, and pull.\n\nI wanted to be sick. This worm was atleast a foot long. But when I pulled one. MORE came out in a bundle together. They started to crawl back in, so I quickly grabbed and pulled, he started pushing them out aswell thankfully.\n\nI felt so fucking bad. The poor baby was wailing, he must\u2019ve been hurting or scared. Eventually I stopped pulling them out, not wanting to subject him anymore.\n\nThe smell of shit, was horrible. Having to dispose of these worms was horrible. I gave him a bath, he bit my thumb so hard it bruised a black spot under my thumb nail.\n\nI knew this was out of my hands. Went to my neighbors and pleaded for help. They had plenty of pets and new exactly what to do and took him in.\n\nWe soon after moved out of that house. Later on I checked back with them as they were good people. And was so glad to see a happy, healthy, adult black cat. They had gotten the worms out of him and he was a very happy kitty.",

            "Oh, OP. I can commiserate. \n\nWe adopted our middle boy as a very wee pup fresh off the street. He and his siblings all had the bloated worm tummy, so I knew going in it that was going to be ugly. I have a thing about worms and anything worm-like. I can\u2019t handle them. Cannot deal. He went immediately to the vet for his checkup and deworming. I thought I was prepared: goggles, xxl puppy pads, dog wipes, rubber gloves, sanitizer. I was not prepared.\n\nRound 1 went smoothly. He goes on puppy pad like a champ. A few white specks here and there in his stool. Nothing moving. Happy puppy, happy owner. Round 2, same story. \u201cHey,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cthis isn\u2019t so bad!\u201d Mistake number one: never underestimate the enemy. \n\nRound 3 a month later. I\u2019m on the floor with him playing, he\u2019s being the cute jerkface he is, we\u2019re having a good time. Then he just stops and looks me straight in the eye all serious... and rips the rankest, loudest, wet fart that I have ever heard come out of a creature. \u201cDooooooood. WTF. You OK there, bro? You need to change your pants after that?\u201d I gently grab him and swivel his hiney around to see if might have popped a little and it might be stuck to his butt or something because it smelled so bad. Mistake number two: never point a loaded weapon at your own face. \n\nI get in real close for inspection and I see it. A worm on a reconnaissance mission, half in/half out. And it saw me. Saw my revulsion, my fear. Me, having sworn to always have my little dude\u2019s back no matter what, decides that\u2019s the time to put my worm fear aside, grab it and gently pull. \n\nAnd in that moment, it wriggled. It knew my weak spot. Knew I would be rendered defenseless in my disgust and slid back in to launch the attack. My little buddy let out a yelp. In an instant I was covered in hot, wormy diarrhea straight from the bowels of Hell. There was no warning. My body reacted the only way it knew how: I immediately sat up and puked all over myself and my dog. Hard. I let go of him and he tore down the hallway, crying and striping the carpet in a demon sludge of diarrhea/worms/my vomit. I froze in place and just sat there on the floor bawling, throwing a pity party for both of us. \n\nCleanup was disgusting. Pup and I were easy, although I ended up taking 4 showers that day. I panicked about how I was going to get wormy diarrhea out of the carpet and struggled with the morality of renting a machine from Lowe\u2019s for someone else to rent eventually, knowing the Lovecraftian horrorscape in my hallway it would have to suck up would weigh heavy on my conscience no matter how well I cleaned it before returning it. I ended up buying one to avoid a lifetime of guilt and shame. It has continued to serve me well.\n\nWe lost the battle that day, but ultimately won the War Of The Worms. It took a while to completely flush them out of him. Poor dude also had some residual GI problems and had to be on dog probiotics for months. Bonus for me was explaining to my doctor why I needed a dewormer. My bubbe eventually forgave me for puking on him and went from a little wormy dude to a great big fearless good boy that would do anything for me (and I for him), but he still runs away from his poop to this day. He has a clean bill of health, so I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s because the ghost of that one butt worm continues to haunt him. And when he farts, I NEVER investigate too closely. That butt worm haunts me too, to be honest. \n\nTL;DR: puppy had worms, I tried to pull one, freaked out, puppy shit in my face, I puked on self and puppy, puppy covered house in shit/worms. Butt worm ghost continues to haunt us years later.\n\n[Dog Tax, just in case](https://i.imgur.com/9JId4Xg.jpg)",

I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.\n\nSilly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.\n\nLaughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. \"we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.\"\n\nNow I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying \"heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job.\" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.\n\nThis was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.\n\nTwo weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but \"it does what its told\".\n\nI'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. \"[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?\"\n\n\"uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y'know sir?\"\n\n\"Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.\n\nApparently captains have no sense of humor either.\n\nUntil tonight, I've been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.\n\nThank you Army.

        "selftext": "So I have always had extremely long hair. Just yesterday it reached the floor when it was down. It was thick and healthy and well cared for. Recently my mother was diagnosed with cancer and it\u2019s been a horrible time for all of us. She recently started her chemo treatments and no one is sure what\u2019ll happen, but we all hope she\u2019ll be okay. She began losing all her hair from the treatments, it wasn\u2019t nearly as long as mine, but she still loved it and had really healthy hair. So I started talking with my boyfriend about donating it and we agreed I should. So yesterday I shaved my head completely bald even with a razor and everything. I had it all nicely separated and donateable and I went to a pretty highly regarded charity (I did ask if they could make one for my mother and they agreed). Afterwards I went about my day. Then I went back home and me and soon after my boyfriend came home, he was shocked to find that I was bald and thought when I was donating it I\u2019d only cut off a little bit. I thought this was weird since I mentioned buzzing everything off since my mother was bald as well. He said he never thought I\u2019d do it. But we changed the subject quickly and ate dinner before going to bed. This morning I woke up when he was getting up for work and he told me he couldn\u2019t be with a bald girl. I kindly reminded him it would grow back to which he replied that it would take too long. So he broke up with me and left my apartment. Leaving me alone, hairless, and scared. \n\nTL;DR: I donated all of my super long hair and my boyfriend broke up with me because he didn\u2019t want to be with a bald girl\n\nEdit: I\u2019m feeling a lot better now. The only thing I\u2019m sorry about now is that people keep giving awards to a throwaway account that I entered random letters into as the password\n\nEdit 2: Guys this is a throwaway, stop giving me all these awards lol. I do really appreciate all the kind messages though lol",

            "As someone who struggles with their weight  I want to congratulate you on losing 200 lbs of dead weight overnight in the form of your lame-ass immature boyfriend.",
            "Want a wife instead?\n\nSeriously, you know what decent people look for and love in a partner? Compassion and courage.\n\nIf your hair was that long, it obviously meant a lot to you, and it's impossible you didn't spend a ton of time on it every day. But you are smart enough to know that hair is just something that grows back when it is cut off, and kind enough to gift yours to people who don't wear their head bald by choice.\n\nThat is amazing. \n\nIf you were my girlfriend and did that, the only thing I'd change about the relationship is that I would go ring shopping.\n\nSo good riddance about the ex. That is completely on him.",
            "Looks like the trash took itself out. If he couldn\u2019t handle this, what sort of a spouse would he have been?\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m really sorry. You did such a selfless thing and deserve love and support. You\u2019re a beautiful person.",
            "Op PLEASE dont feel bad about yourself! You did an amazing thing and if your ex cant see through that and be there for you, he doesnt deserve someone as caring as you!\n\nItd be different uf you did this out of the blue, but since it was discussed, he shouldnt conplain about you having no/very short hair for the next weeks.",
            "Maybe he was already planning on leaving you and it gave him an excuse to do it, still immature but people aren't always straightforward :/",
            "For the record: you did the opposite of fucking up! I know how hard it is to find out that someone you care about is next level petty. But you know what? It frees you up to find someone who would find what you did courageous and sexy. \n\nIts important to remember that, like your baldness, all things are temporary. Process your breakup, treat yourself as kind as possible, call your mom and call on friends! You aren\u2019t alone! Last thing: identities change. We aren\u2019t meant to be the same thing always. Find strength in your ability to give and support others, which seems to be a core part of yourself. Everything else will find you.",
            "I'm absolutely not a fan of women with shaved heads, or even short hair to be honest - but breaking up with somebody for donating their hair to cancer sufferers is a new kind of fucked up.\nIn my opinion, it's you that's dodged a bullet here. This isn't a fuck up for you it's a win. This guy is just trash.",

I've seen too many posts with deep regret and then afterwards, insecurity.",

            "First off, girl...don\u2019t regret it! What\u2019s done is done and You just supported your mother in an incredible way, fuck however anyone else feels. People apply so much vanity and personal opinion on how other people looks it\u2019s ridiculous, those same people don\u2019t have a shred of the confidence to do what you just did! And that guy is a fuckin douche. That is not the way someone should respond to something so simple...if he brings his sorry ass crawling back I hope you snub him the way he just did you.",
            "Your hair was 5.5-6 feet long?",
            "Why do people believe these stories? OP claimed to have donated hair that is 67 inches long. That would put her in the record books for longest hair in the world - not #1 longest, but definitely very high ranking!",
            "Attraction is a big thing in relationships, especially young relationships.\n\nA lot of people just aren't attracted to bald or short-haired girls.\n\nAt the rate hair normally grows, we could be looking at two years before you would be attractive to your partner again.\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation but.. I feel like this was also a very rash decision to make. The fact that the communication was so unclear between you tells me that it was a very new relationship or that you're quite young.\n\nI don't necessarily think either of you did anything wrong here. \n\nThe people being all \"You go girl!\" here are definitely very biased. Doing radical stuff without being sure your partner understands it is definitely not praiseworthy behavior.",
            "How long were you with this guy? Sheesh. Did a bald girl burn his home down and kill his family? Such a petty reason for a breakup.",
            "What a chad",
            "Good for him for knowing what he wants and not wasting either of y'all's time.",
            "I think you really should have talked to him first about it. Changing something that drastic about yourself is a conversation that you have first. When people say that they\u2019re donating hair, usually that\u2019s only like half or so. You went and went completely bald without even asking him. I think he does have the right to break up with you because communication is so important in a relationship, and you didn\u2019t give him much. Both sides surely fucked up, and just made the situation awful. \n\nI\u2019m already expecting downvotes.",
            "I know I'll get downvoted for this, but I think the people calling your ex an asshole is a bit harsh. He is right in what he says in regards to hair taking a long time to grow. It would take literal years for your hair to grow to just shoulder length, let alone anything beyond your shoulders.\n\nIs it shallow? Possibly. But if he doesn't find bald girls attractive and as such wouldn't get into a new relationship with one, then it's really not fair to criticise the guy. It's no different to when people get less attracted to their partners when they gain weight, or any other physical attraction loss. People are attracted to what they are attracted to, and he didn't expect you to shave it all off. \n\nIt's a very unfortunate situation due to a clear miscommunication, but I don't think anyone was an asshole here. Some things are just deal breakers for some people.",
            "I'll take to downvotes but I think it's okay to break up with someone when they radically change their appearance.",
            "I\u2019m not here to judge anybody, but to all the people leaving hateful comments- why was the boyfriend obligated to stay with OP? Are relationships not something you have the agency to break off as you like? If he finds OP unattractive and no longer to be with her, regardless of how immature he is, would he not have the right to break up? \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think anybody should be forced to be stuck in a relationship they don\u2019t want to be in, regardless of how superficial their reasons are. I dunno, maybe I\u2019m the unreasonable one here.",
            "Your boyfriend isn't an asshole for leaving you because you dramatically changed your appearance.",
            "Be confident in your own body OP! Some people might be looking in shock, but some might just be admiring you! A lot of women would love to have short hair but aren't confident enough to go for it.\n\nYou took time to grow your hair out, and were so willing to donate it to support your mom, and that is AMAZING!!!\n\nI didn't donate my hair, (couldn't honestly, it's a mess) but I did shave off most of it, I only had maybe an inch left. I know exactly what looks you're getting, don't be scared! Rock your new style and no one will care!",
            "I get why he sucks as a person and all, but when I started dating my current girlfriend, a few weeks into our relationship, she got an unflattering, very short haircut. It really turned me off her sexually for a long time. I knew it will pass and her hair would grow, so I powered through it.\nIt really sucks when a partner does something like that. It means months of being unhappy every day when looking at your partner.\nThat being said,\nYou are brave, and your dedication to your mother is your *true* beauty, not some hair. I hope you found someone who sees your beauty, not just your looks. It sucks so much that you dated someone who couldn\u2019t see that.",
            "Don\u2019t understand why all the comments are about the bf being superficial, if he\u2019s not attracted to girls with no hair that\u2019s his choice. Same as not being attracted to a certain skin colour or being attracted to overweight people.",
            "Still dont get why you had to shave it all off. Thats just stupid and unnecessary.",
            "You should have asked your partner first. I don't blame him.",
            "I shaved my head and donated my hair when my grandma started chemo and my school thought it was a cry for help and made me see a child therapist, and a bunch of girls at school thought I was suddenly gay so they stopped talking to me (I was already gay, sorry girls). And women kept thinking I was a man in the woman's bathroom. \n\nDidn't stop me from shaving my head again two years later for the same cause when my grandma lost her fight. \n\nDon't let him come crawling back when your hair grows back. Thank the universe you don't have to waste more time on such a moron.",
            "Your \"boyfriend\" is a selfish prick. Good for you getting rid of him.",
            "Fuck that guy. You will be better off without him.\nDon't worry, plenty of guys will love you with or without hair.\nMy girlfriend lost her hair to alopecia two years ago and we're stronger than ever :)",
            "To be brutally honest, the only way this would be a true TIFU was if you posted that you just married him.",
            "You did not FU.  Apparently he didn't love YOU, he had a kink for your hair.  Get on Zoom or such with your Mom and roast hid butt. His friends may guilt him into coming back...be careful. It is not your fault that he didn't listen to what you were saying.  And, get your a nice bracelet (and maybe a matching one for your Mom) that you can fiddle with instead of hair.(edited to match this sub.)",
            "I know I'm getting downvoted for this, but I can understand his point.\n\nAt least if I were to be together with a girl with extremely long hair, I could imagine that a big point as to why I got together with her was her extremely long hair.\n\nNow if you actually said that you will cut off all your hair then yeah he is at fault for agreeing to it and then suddenly chickening out, but in general if my girlfriend were to say she would donate hair, I would imagine her donating like maybe half or something not everything, essentially still having long hair.\n\nEven with hair growing back, if extremely long hair was one of the reasons I got together with a girl, then I would consider that hair this long will probably take years to regrow.\n\nEdit: Yeah it is shallow and whatever, but I personally believe that emotions are only half of a relationship, the other half being actually attracted to one another. So all in all, the biggest asshole move on him was to be in support of shaving and then suddenly not, one should be open about their desires.",
            "Wow. What a douchebag.\n\nMy girlfriend had, what we like to call, A Britney Moment and shaved her head..she was going through a rough patch...and even tho I didn't find it particularly appealing, she was the same person I fell in love with so I dealt with it until it grew back...and now we poke fun at her about it occasionally",
            "Dude probably had a hair fetish",
            "You\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re obviously at minimum a decent person. Your ex would not have made a good partner in the long run. It hurts now but in a month you\u2019ll be laughing at this with a new bf.",
            "The weight off your shoulders from all that hair and a garbage boyfriend?   Girl you should feel like you can fly!!",
            "I can see the cause of the confusion because usually when people donate hair it\u2019s just the bottom 10, 12, 15, or at most 20 inches. But his reaction was way over the top and unreasonable. He can be unhappy with the decision and not act like it makes you unloveable.\n\nAll that said, I\u2019m gonna be the calm guy in the room and say that it might\u2019ve been a knee jerk reaction in shock. If he comes back and apologizes, it\u2019s worth listening to him.\n\nIf, however, even with time to think it over and process, he still feels that way, then it\u2019s his loss.",
            "My mother had cancer, went through chemo and lost all her hair, as you do. Sadly she did not survive. My friend had breast cancer, went through chemo and lost all her hair. Thankfully she did. They both got wigs that made them feel human during one of the most unimaginable experiences anyone can go through, and they were able to do that because of people like you. Thank you for being awesome.\n\nAlso, fuck that guy. You\u2019re better off without him.",
            "I shaved my head years ago to support a friend of mine.  Last week I randomly said.. dang i miss a bald head. And I figured it would suit 2020. Lol. So I buzzed it this weekend. It is shocking to see myself like that again but dang..it feels nice. ROCK ON my fellow bald friend!!!",
            "You got rid of some hair, got rid of an asshole (you only need the one \ud83d\ude01), and did a great thing all the same time. You absolutely DID NOT fuck up.",
            "You didn't fuck up. I don't know you and it probably doesn't count for much, but I'm proud of you OP.",
            "Not to say the boyfriend isn\u2019t an asshole but I could partially see why he made the decision. It would be difficult to be sexually attracted if you being bald made him uncomfortable. sexual attraction is a major part in romantic relationships. People say looks don\u2019t matter it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts that\u2019s not true. being sexually attractive can play major roles in relationships. If part of a woman being attracted to a man is because he has a chiseled body, and that man becomes round and out of shape and the woman is no longer sexually attracted that will cause problems in a relationship. Again not to say the boyfriend isn\u2019t an asshole but I see why he might have made his choice.",

            "Your good deed led directly to unmasking an ugly person. It would have happened at some point. So not only did you help those in need you helped you, your future you and many wasted years were saved. The bright light that you turned on eliminated a brighter more positive future. There's so many people like you out there. The world will be a greater place once you find your companion star.\n\n I hope your mother comes through it okay.

I was scared my partner wouldn't find me attractive or that I would look weird.

            "Honest question. I can see how this is bad as OP did this for an amazing cause (I donated my hair too back in HS) but realistically what is her now ex supposed to do if he doesn't find bald women attractive? Just deal with it? Growing your hair from a razor bald shave will take more than a year. Again serious honest question cuz maybe I missed something.",

            "I\u2019m going to be downvoted to hell for this, but I think both of parties are entitled to their actions and neither is \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m happy to hear counter arguments refuting my thought process. If there are good arguments I\u2019d totally change my mind.\n\nRegardless, my thoughts are that a person enters a relationship and has preferences - some women don\u2019t date hairy men or men shorter than themselves. Some men don\u2019t want to date women much older than themselves. People have preferences. Does that make them bad? I\u2019d say no. It makes them superficial, but not bad.\n\nRelationships have both a physical and an emotional component. Is it okay to break up because something physical changes? Well it\u2019s up to the person in the relationship and what makes them happy!\n\nIf your partner tried to change something physical about themselves, say they stopped brushing their teeth and taking showers but were still very caring and sweet. One person might say \u201cdon\u2019t give them up on them\u201d and another might say \u201cthis has been going on for too long. I can\u2019t do this.\u201d\n\nPeople have preferences physically. I don\u2019t think either party should be chastised for their preferences. Poor communication could have sorted this out before it happened. \n\nUnfortunate that OP and her boyfriend had to break up, but it\u2019s clear they weren\u2019t compatible. Not that she is bad / wrong or he is bad / wrong. He valued looks (specially her hair length) more in a relationship.\n\nThey weren\u2019t on the same page about it so they broke up.",
            "I would of bought you so many kinky wigs.",
            "Honestly depending on how he presented his feelings he\u2019s not as big of a villain as some people are making him out to be in the comments \nBeing superficial is one thing but attraction is a very real part of relationships \nAs a guy with long hair I can think of plenty of times where shaving my head would not have gone over well.  Obviously if you\u2019ve found your soulmate or something, details like that don\u2019t really matter, but if someone\u2019s significant other made a drastic change to their appearance it shouldn\u2019t be alien to think levels of attraction have changed with the look.  \nAll that being said, he should\u2019ve listened more and communicated his feelings before you committed to the shaving, and you absolutely shouldn\u2019t feel bad for choosing an extremely adult decision.  \nI hope you find the support you need in your times of baldness.",

        "selftext": "Happened years ago, but I was told to post this here.\n\nMy girlfriend (at the time) and I were dating for just shy of 6 years. We were high school sweethearts and still in school. She had always struggled with jobs and keeping them, and since we lived together, I usually had to pick up the slack. \n\nI was working as an assistant manager at a video game retail store at the time, probably not hard to figure out which one. It was honestly and easy job as long as you gave little effort, pre orders here, couple warranty sells there. As my girlfriend loved video games more than I did, I had the BRILLIANT idea to get her a job. She's an attractive girl while 80% of our customers were neckbeards who hardly get to interact with women. Should be easy for her to make sales.\n\n\"There's no way she can fuck this up\" I said, confidently to myself. There is a policy as of most companies that people in relationships can't work at the same location. No problem. We have 12 stores in our district that are within a 5 mile radius. \n\nThey seriously put these stores on every other block.\n\nI do a little digging and hook her up at a neighboring store that had a vacant position. She would also be working with the head store manager of the district (indirectly one of my bosses). Few weeks in, and its going GREAT, what took me about a year to get moved up she does in weeks. I'm not a self conscious person, so I didnt care. Plus she could help pick up her half of the bills. \n\nHere's where I started to realize I FU. Girlfriend comes driving in with a BRAND NEW CAR. Considering we were living paycheck to paycheck, I was pretty upset. I asked her where she got the car from and she told me \"I've been saving up\". Bullshit but okay. I loved her, so as long as shes happy, I'm happy. \n\nNext comes in with write ups. I started getting write ups and customer complaints left and right. I'm a very good employee and I very rarely make anyone upset. I couldn't even find where these customers were coming from. Even though my performance was the best out of most employees, I was starting to fear for my job.\n\nAs to be predicted, I ended up getting fired. I tried to fight it but I live in Texas, and the rules are that companies can fire anyone at anytime for any reason. I'm absolutely crushed. I turn to my girlfriend for emotional support to find her extremely distant. \n\nShe dumped me days later, double whammy. I loved her for 6 years. She told me she felt this way for a while, things are the same. I'm absolutely heartbroken, I'm angry, depressed, jobless. Felt like my life got flipped upside down. One week later her Facebook status put her in a relationship WITH HER BOSS. MY BOSS. \n\nNot sure when it happened, but he bought her a car, and then got me fired. Turns out all the customer complaints about me originated from that store somehow. Total BS. I set her up to absolutely f*ck me over and to bone my boss.\n\nTl;dr: I got my girlfriend a job only for her to f*ck my boss and to get me fired \n\nI'm still a little sad about it, but it is what it issss.\n\nEdit: perhaps the biggest FU is the fact I didn't sue. I was such an emotional wreck from everything it didnt even cross my mind. But I'm doing pretty well for myself now, and whatever money I'd get wouldn't be worth bringing her to court for. Just the thought of seeing her sends chills down my spine.\n\nUPDATE: A couple of you guys were wondering, but they dated a few months and broke it off. Neither of them work for the company anymore. A little detail I forgot to mentioned that when she came to take her stuff from our place, he was helping carry the stuff to her car. That was probably the most gut wrenching moment for me. Both of them are POS.\n\n2nd Update: I really appreciate all the positive feedback, I've been mostly over it but the love really helps. Some of you guys are asking where she is now, she's doing alright, shes engaged to one of my old high school friends (also slightly suspicious). Still driving that same car, too, from the looks of it. I'm doing pretty well for myself, and if theres any happy ending to this, is that I'm genuinely happier than I've ever been in my life.\n\n3rd AND PROBABLE FINAL UPDATE: Again, I really appreciate the positive messages. Reliving and retelling the story made me angry and I missed a few details.\n\n-I can't prove that he bought her a car, but I was pretty aware of her finances, and she couldn't afford a new car without significant help. It wasn't a fancy car, it was a new Prius that was worth about $18,000, in addition to trading in her old car. And the rumor around the block was that he did in fact help her. \n\n-i was not a perfect boyfriend, I got upset at silly things, I could have been more attentive, but I never raised my voice, and I was very loyal. \n\n-the course of when she got promoted to when she got the car was roughly 3 or 4 months, the separation and firing happened about 2 months after that. I didn't clarify that detail. \n\n-\"the boss\" was a DM in training, recently got promoted, and the kind of guy that would spend money to impress a girl.",

            "Wow!  This story was a deja vu for me almost. I once dated a girl for almost 6 years as well when I lived in Arizona. She had a hard time finding a job and piled up a big chunk of debt from student loans and cc. I helped her with rent, food, cleaned her apt, did her laundry, and buying a car as well. Then it also crossed my mind.. she should work at this video game store I used to work at as an assistant manager when I was in college (I'm sure it's the same one you worked at). Figured it'd be easy for a fair looking girl to handle the job there. I even taught her what to do and say at the interview. I would even visit her store and stay late with her after closing time when she couldn't get work done on time. Another time, her store was robbed at gun point and then I would camp outside her store in the parking lot for weeks until the robber was finally caught. Sure enough, she kept getting promoted and became a store manager in about a year. Eventually she became more distant also and started spending a lot of time with another store manager (whom I thought was a friend), and I meant A LOT. She would lie about where she went and sometimes be off radar for hours. I even gave her a chance to come clean about him since I became very suspicious but she still denied it over and over. Long story short, they ended up getting married (he even paid off her car payment). The only difference was I had a corporate job and not working at a video game store. I deeply feel for you brother. I now travel the world a lot and met many wonderful people. I saw your post because a dear friend shared it with me. (I actually just downloaded Reddit so I can write you). Remember though, people exit out of your life because they already served their purpose, you will have better things lined up for you.",

The time will pass and you'll be ok and perhaps you'll get a new girlfriend that deserves you.",
            "You fucked up even harder because you could have gotten paid so much by that company that you probably wouldn't have had to work for a year at least.\n\nIt doesn't matter where you live, wrongful termination is a thing. If it was that easy for you to deduce where the bad customer reports were coming from, HR wouldn't have had any difficulty either. A lawsuit would have been a slam dunk, and most lawyers would have taken the case for a portion of the payout.\n\nAt the very least you'd have been reinstated and they'd have both been fired.\n\nOh well c'est la vie.",

            "I\u2019ve got a pretty related fuck up!!\n\nI worked for a good friend at a game store. I fell in love with a girl who also worked there. We dated for 3 years and then got married. Only five months after being married I found out that she was cheating on me, with the \u201cgood froend\u201d/guy who hired me. It. Fucking. Hurt. \n\nThe good news is the hurt faded and now 4 years later I\u2019m married to a much *much* better woman and living my best life. Glad that it sounds like you\u2019re living yours too!",
            "Aw fuck dude, I know that sucks. When I was 19, I got my GF of 2 years a job at the pizza place I was a manager at. She ended up ghosting me on NYE when we had plans for the night. I went to her house and she wasn't there. Went to work and saw her car was still there like 8 hours after her shift ended but she wasn't there. After a lot of asking around, one of the employees spilled the beans that another employee had picked up my GF. I decided to stop at the nearest roach motel and sure enough, his unmistakable truck was in the parking lot. She tried to lie the next morning and has some convoluted story but admitted it when I told her what I knew. \n\nI'm 32 now and it's to this day, the most heartbreak I've ever felt. It wasn't the first or the last time I was cheated on but it was the one that hurt the worst. The guy she cheated with was actually one of my friends that I had helped get hired around the same time. I even helped him with his application! I loved that girl entirely too much and learned some valuable lessons. \n\n1.) Never help a girlfriend get a job with you. 2.) Never value your girlfriend more than you value yourself because it's probably not going to last forever and you're setting yourself up for pain. 3.) Nobody is above doing things to hurt you, even friends that you've helped. 4.) If something in your relationship feels \"off\", brace yourself because it's coming to an end. \n\nIt's not as gloomy as it sounds at first. These are things that will happen sometimes in life but it's easier to handle if you're prepared. Like how a sucker punch can mess you up more than one you're ready for. \n\nMy advice: Don't talk to her. If you do, dont talk about what happened. Don't even let her know you're hurt. If you do, she's likely to feel bad and try to get together again but she's a cheater you'll just catch her again. Don't become bitter towards women over it. Don't fight your boss. Don't tell the next girl about this unless you can do it casually. Don't make the mistake of saying like, \"my last GF cheated on me, please don't ever put me through that. Just break up with me if you're unhappy.\" Some women will take that vulnerability and use it to hurt you if they're upset.  \n\nMake sure that when this story comes up in the future that it can be told as \"u/beckmoon was so mature about it, I can't believe he handled it so well\". You don't want this to be a story that reminds people of a time when you were acting like a crazy person. You don't want to feel embarrassment on top of pain when you think about it. \n\nDo look into your legal options for unemployment, especially if you can prove that she's with the boss. I'd only do this if you really need the money because it will be a pain but they falsified complaints and wrote you up for them to cover their asses. Dept of Labor will not be happy with that if there's any way you can prove it. If you don't need the money that bad, please just move on from that job and girl as fast as you can. \n\nOne last thing. You need your friends right now. If you don't have anybody that you feel comfortable talking with, my inbox is open. Good luck to you dude!",
            "Wait.. suing her? No, dude. You would be suing the company and your old boss. What would you sue her for? Being a bitch?   \nYour boss fired you without cause, which might make him and the company civilly liable. But she can date whoever she wants for whatever reason she wants.",

I texted her my card number and apologized. She never texted me back.\n\nTL;DR - Tried to leave my phone number on a check. I left, and got a text from her saying I didn't pay.\n\n***EDIT: Ok guys I went through my phone history and found the texts. Yes it's embarrassing. https://imgur.com/a/531ds7h\n\n***UPDATE: The last text she sent was the end of the conversation. It's been over 7 months since this happened and I never texted her back after that. I did send her a link to this post though... and she replied!\n\n**** She commented on this post!

            "Not what I expected tbh. Expecting something more akin to what happened to me. \n\nI was a waiter back in the day. early 2000s and (not to toot my own horn) but I would get a fair amount of numbers, usually atleast one every night or two. I never would call these girls (I was in a relationship with a waitress most of my time at this particular restaurant) ,\nSo I just collected them, I recalled my manager freaking out when he found the stash of receipts with numbers lol... anyways,  the one and only chick I called ended up being a legit psycho. My girlfriend who worked their left for college, so I was a newly single young man and this particular girl was exceptionally hot. I'm no 10, I always considered myself a solid 7 with a personality that bumped me to a hard 8 on a good day, so I said what the eff and gave her a ring. It was a Thursday night and she didn't answer, so I left my home number with her roommate and that was that (i had a cell phone that cost a fortune and I had like 100 minutes and ever minute after was like a thousand bucks) \n\nWell, back then, during the winter time, I would usually got snow boarding on the weekends, my mom lived 15 minutes from a dope mountain, so I'd grab a buddy or two and we'd shack up at mom's and board all weekend. So I went to work the next day, and me and a friend left, right after work, directly for Tahoe. \n\nI get home Sunday night and I have dozens of messages,  I'm like \"shit, someone died\" and freaked a moment.  Played the first message and it was the chick (I think her name was Sandy or Cindy or maybe Shelley, this was over 15 years ago) she just wanted to return my call and hook up sometime... how sweet,  man she was cute and sounded sexy on the phone... next message, ohh, it's her again,  just making sure I got her message from 15 minutes ago... ok, she's thorough, I can dig it... next message,  ohh  it's her again,  making sure she left the right number... o..k.. she's a little eager,  3 messages in an hour... well for the next 15 minutes I listen to message after message as this chick slipped steadily into madness! Eventually turning into a bi polar series of vitriol induced insults, then tearful apologies swearing shed never yell at me again...it was fucking terrifying (I exchanged a handful of flirtatious winks and jokes while I refilled her drinks and brought her food, that's it). I legit was scared that I was going to wake up to her hovering over my bed with a butcher knife. She even called my work that Saturday and Sunday looking for me and then started telling everyone who answer how horrible of a person I was and i should die and all this crazy stuff. I almost got a restraining order against her but I didn't even know her full name or anything and ultimately she never called again after that weekend but I lived in fear for a few months,  just waiting for her to walk through the door of my restuarant with a 12g pump seeking out vengeance. \n\nThat was the last time I gave my number to a rando. I honestly dont know if she was just fucking with me, or maybe the roommate was or what but it was freaking terrifying. After that, I only dated women who I could vet through friends and acquaintances and never randoms.  \n\nWow, been years since I thought of this incident... makes me so thankful that im now married with kids and I dont have to deal with dating and crazy people anymore lol.",

        "selftext": "So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn't speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. So that's he kind of person I'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can't be that unfair. \n\nFast forward 15 years. I haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn't make any friends and I didn't develop Stockholm's. I looked him up on Facebook. \n\nHe owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can't get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed. \n\nTLDR: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than I ever will.",

Its also possible that this guys home life isnt as happy as it seems in the picture. His wife could be cheating on him, his kids arent his and dont love him, and the divorce he cant see coming is going to take all of that wealth away. \n\nDont bother with any thoughts of revenge. Anger and hatred is like a hot rock. To hurl it at your enemy you must first burn your hand, and there is no guarantee you will hit them when its thrown. Forgive as much of it as you can, and look only to how you are going to make tomorrow better than today. Keep doing that every day and not only will you be better off, but you will likely have forgotten him in the process.",

Ten years later, I'm only just starting to get it together while I watch some of my bullies succeed. However, I've also been around to see how it happened. Some of them were poor, struggling with kids and divorce in the first year, now established like your bully. They were humbled by a hard life at first, but they were also just kids, like we were. About one a year, some new one adds me to apologize. They remember me, and how they acted. Some are still struggling and some are dead or in jail.\n\nI had guns pulled on me, knives used on me, chairs broken over my head. Backpacks ripped, game boys stolen, drinks spat in. Now I have a panic disorder. About the best thing I ever did for myself was realizing that I was a strange kid, and I don't mean that to say I blame myself, but I realize I have changed a LOT and I have grown a LOT. Life beat me up a hundred ways and I am not the same person. Neither are they. The clich\u00e9s about quiet nerdy kids running everything suck, but it's not the bullies fault 10 years later.

            "OP - I see you have a lot of comments. If you make it to this I want to share a short story with you.\n\nWhen I was In high school I was well liked and considered popular. I wasn't an active bully, not the scenario you are talking about. I stayed out of seriouse trouble, but it was a small town so you couldn't get away with being a total idiot, without being ostracized . When I was a senior I had a run in with a kid who was a freshmen. My egotistical self thought he needed to be taught respect, so me and my friends actively made his life shitty. Shoving him in hallways, slamming into him, knocking his books out of his hands, and the more he fought back the worse we were. I knew this was wrong, and petty, but I justified it to myself. \n\nI graduated high school, and over the course of the next couple years I got some MAJOR life perspective. Not only was I now aware that I was in the wrong, but deeply regretted it. I tried to find him at a few local events, and tried looking him up online, but to no avail. Meanwhile things were going well for me. Married, house, decent job, etc. I thought about him atleast twice a week, and was sad, and ashamed every time I did. This went on for over 10 years. \n\nI was in my hometown one day, and he was in the same place of business as me. I froze, and did not know what to do. I watched him walk out the door - I stopped what I was doing and followed him out to the parking lot. I introduced myself, and asked if he remembered me. To which he immediately responded with a \"yes\" (cringe). I told him how sorry I was, how aweful I felt for doing those things to him, and saying those things to him. I told him I was immature, and was sorry I had tried to hurt him. I'll never forget his response - It makes me smile every time I think of it. He just smiled at me and said \"don't worry about it man - school is crazy.\"\n\nThat made my week, I went home and told my wife about it. I was glowing inside all week. I get to see him around town, and we always greet each other. I still think about him a couple times a week, but it makes me happy every time. The apology was in a sense self-serving, and in that moment he held so much power over me, because I think it would have haunted me the rest of my life had he not been forgiving in that moment.\n\nSchool is crazy, and maybe that guy is such a dick that he doesn't remember you. Or he feels he was in the right, and if that is the case he has his reward in full. I'm sure many have said it - but it's true. If this individual has a shred of dignity it still eats him up, and if he doesn't he is nobody to be envied. You sound like a wonderful person. Keep your head up, and stay focused. Much love OP.",

            "It is ok to evaluate yourself and your situation, but don't compare to others.   You can't have everything.  I try not to look on social media for that reason.  I am doing fine, but have worked more / achieved more than others and I get jealous of others who work less and travel/party/have more fun times.  They probably don't have as much $ or have some other issues but it makes me feel bad. I do try to change and do what I feel I am missing, but not everyone's life is going to be the same.  I also know some very wealthy people and my life is down right depressing compared to them.   They have it **all** and everything is first class for them, perfect kids, perfect wife, fancy cars, houses, world vacations.  Try to make some short term and long term goals and focus on your own situation and **getting to a place of inner peace**.  Do some reading (books) to achieve get started.  Respect to people who are down and having a tough time and who work to get back on track.  That can be a bigger achievement than having the easy life with no challenges.",
            "Ok here's a question for everyone replying saying just forget about him, etc... How?\n\nI'm in a eerily similar situation. The feelings of anger, hate, etc... because of what he and the others did still stuck with me. How do I let go of that and move on? It affected me and I became a recluse for many years during what many call are supposed to be the best years of your life. I still fantasize about what I would do to them if I saw them on the street.\n\nLol its funny cause last I heard of him he went to a really crappy college and I got into a pretty decent one, one day I was feeling particularly down and remembering those things and made the same mistake as OP and decided to look him up and assumed it would be like in the media- he would've been stuck at a crappy low level job and I would've felt better only to find out he transferred to a better school and ended up with a pretty high paying job as well.  The stereotype about the dumb bully ending up working for the nerd is just mostly not true. Chances are the bully ended up coasting through life with daddy's money and connections, joins a frat, has plenty of friends, ends up with some hot sorority girl, buys a nice house with nice cars, picture perfect american family just like OP said. While the nerd probably suffers from depression, anxiety, etc... while working some IT job and gets yelled at by his frat boy manager.\n\nMeanwhile I've now lost my job, no gf, still living with parents, and some of my closest friends recently just moved away as well. There's a hole in my heart that I've filled with anger, hate, etc... hate for them, myself, and god. I don't know how to move on, I don't have anything else, I don't know how to be happy.",

I've been so mad I want to kill people, those who have hurt people I love. But in this chaotic universe nobody really *deserves* what happens to them; justice is not inherent. Shit just... happens. Sometimes it sucks for us. Sometimes it's good to someone we hate. Honestly all we can do is make the best of it.\n\n(NOTE: The above advice does not apply to people who have hurt you in ways that are legally punishable. Feel free to press charges. Justice may not exist in a nihilistic worldview, but society has come up with systems to implement it to offer consolation when we are wronged.)\n\nJust live your best life, and forget about that sack of shit.

Remember that nobody's going to deliberately make themselves look bad online. I had a sister-in-law that was CONSTANTLY posting about how much she and my husband's brother were in love, how rock-solid their relationship was, how they were going to be together forever, she posted tons of photos of date nights, kissing, snuggling in bed, getting matching tattoos...four months later they were separated and he'd moved in with the 19 year old stripper he'd been banging. Turns out they'd been fighting for years, and she was massively in denial, and compensated by telling the world (and herself) that everything was great. \n\nMaybe your ex-bully's smoking hot wife is cheating on him. Maybe his kids despise him because he always works and never has time for them. Maybe his work isn't going as great as it looks, and he's drowning in debt from bad spending on all those fancy cars. Maybe his wife spends him into the ground with online shopping, or he drinks and gambles excessively. So while his Facebook may appear for all the world as if he's happy and successful, you can't know that for sure. Just a thought to chew on."

Before now I had no idea micropenis was a thing. Some people are big, some people are small. That was the extent of my penile knowledge. I\u2019ve only had sex with 2 people, so I\u2019m not very experienced, anyway. \n\nThis guy and I have mutual friends and have been flirting for months, and he\u2019s *so hot* with a great personality. Last night after a few of our friends canceled I asked him if he wanted to come over and watch a movie.\n\nHe comes over, I make dinner and we have a great time. We have a couple glasses of wine and I\u2019m not quite tipsy, but loose enough that I don\u2019t think about what I\u2019m saying. We move over to the living room to start a movie, and he starts making a move. I\u2019m thinking oh yeah, here we go. Finally. It\u2019s getting hot and heavy and I start making my way downtown because blowjobs are my favorite thing. I pull down his pants and for a minute I\u2019m shocked. He has absolutely no length at all, basically just a head. I think something happened to him and say \u201coh my god, what happened?!\u201d And he kinda freezes and says nothing happened. I\u2019m confused and he starts awkwardly kind of explaining that everything works, obviously, that\u2019s just his size. At this point it\u2019s awkward enough that it kinda kills the mood and he says \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t have to do anything\u201d and I starts babbling that no no, it\u2019s fine, everything is okay! I can tell he feels weird at this point and kind of sits up on the couch, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve ruined this and he doesn\u2019t want to hook up anymore. I say \u201care you still turned on? Do you want to?\u201d And he kind of gives me a blank look which prompts my dumb ass to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t tell\u201d\n\nWhat I *meant* was that I can\u2019t tell if he still wants to have sex by his body language, *not* that I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s turned on because of his lack of noticeable erection. This completely extinguished whatever we had going and he pulls his pants up while I\u2019m trying to explain. He won\u2019t let me talk and keeps repeating that no, no, it\u2019s fine, we should watch the movie. Not knowing what to do I sit back on the couch and we awkwardly watch the tv in mortified silence. Eventually when it\u2019s over (I\u2019m surprised he stayed) he basically rushes out the door. \n\nI texted him this morning asking if he wants to hang out again and apologized for making things weird. He hasn\u2019t texted me back and he\u2019s been on Instagram so I know he\u2019s seen it. I feel so bad! And it doesn\u2019t really matter that his penis is small, I\u2019d still go out with him anyway! It\u2019s not enough to deter me. But I totally ruined it and now he hates me\n\nTL;DR insulted my hookups penis and made him feel weird and now I not only ruined sex but ruined any future chances",

            "This sounds like a mortifying situation for the both of you, and for what it's worth you sound like a genuinely nice person, so don't beat yourself up over it. As someone else said, performance and size anxiety is common, especially if your main exposure to penises (regardless of gender) is porn. If you're serious that you're still interested in seeing him again in a sexual/romantic context, I suggest being more direct. When you say \"hang out\" it could be interpreted as you wanting to talk, or to \"friendzone\" him. Have you tried something more along the lines of \"Hey, I'm sorry about how the other night played out, if you're still interested, I'd love to try for a happier ending ;)\". I don't think you need to overly apologize or try too hard to r-emasculate him, he should be super flattered you're still interested, and also be super into making sure you're having a good time. There's the chance he could see it as pity sex, and if he's not interested don't push it. Also wouldn't suggest sharing this story with anyone in person. Good luck.\n**My first gold! Thank you kind stranger**\n\nEditing to respond to some common reactions (will I regret this?): It's more than clear to me that she did not intend to insult him. Could she have \"handled\" this better? Perhaps. By OPs own admission, she was still game for some sexy time that night. Performance anxiety is real and irrational so I'm not saying anyone could immediately bounce back from that situation, but it IS super flattering because how often do you get a do-over of the first time you have sex with someone? TBH they're set up for some amazing sex bc OP has already expressed enthusiastic consent(which she has the right to revoke at any point in time), they've gotten over the surprises and embarrassing parts, and now they can PLAN their sex date (anticipation is like 90% of great sex). Based on his reaction, I get the feeling he's not super experienced with sex himself, and this situation could be turned around to be a confidence booster for the both of them. OP has no reason to apologize.",

            "Okay I don't understand how people are blaming the guy for not first telling her that he has a micro penis. Especially in that moment. Sorry, but I can't see any possible way you could stop everything as the moments getting sensual, admit that you have a micropenis, then get back on track with the sexual tension like nothing happened. This dude has an insane amount of courage to even make a move to begin with and while he should have let her know somehow, I don't think it's really fair to blame him for not doing so.\n\nAlso, while the small dick jokes are funny, this dude is undoubtedly scarred after that. Just imagine spending the entire night before this only being able to think about how she's going to react, should I say something, is it even going to go that far, etc etc. Imagine all the anxiety and insecurity that he must have felt up to that moment, and imagine literally all of that getting worry getting reaffirmed in such a disastrous way. Like, I can't tell if that's worse than just straight laughing at it. Op isn't at fault, she said something wrong when she was tipsy and had less of a filter, but the guy is absolutely not the one to be blamed.\n\nOp, this is a lost cause. I can't possibly imagine him responding after what undoubtedly has been his nightmare situation since early puberty. Just apologize as earnestly as you can, say you're still interested, but don't expect anything in response.\n\nAs for the rest of the comments, I want you to realize that you're joking about an insecurity that isn't a persons fault, and has undoubtedly been the cause of countless hours of depression and anxiety. This is the equivalent of laughing at somebody because of the way their face looks. It's kind of a shitty thing to do, and I can't even begin to imagine what this guy would feel reading these comments.",

I wouldn't be able to tell you how many dicks Ive seen. I know my body count is in the triple digits and that's just counting P2V sex. \n\nI thought I had done everything. I was the Samantha of everyone's life. The Ginger Spice.  The Blanche Devereaux. \n\nNothing could shock me. Or so I thought.\n\nBut the first time I saw a micro penis, I was shook. In all my years of whoring and experience around servicing the dick, I was completely at a loss. I didn't know what to do. I asked them what they liked and they gave me absolutely no help. So I just left and never went back. \n\nDon't feel bad for not responding any better than when I, someone with a whore-lot of experience in the matter, could still make such a fumble.",

For context I live with my girlfriend in an apartment with one bedroom. \n\nMy sister was visiting from out of town. She said she'd sleep in the couch. I thought that would be that. We ate dinner, chatted, had a good time. When  it was time to go to bed, however, i was feeling horny. I turned off the hall light and then opened the door to crawl onto out Queen size bed. I don't see shit. So I crawl in on my side, wait a few minutes, and then it happens. \n\nI turn to my girlfriend. Her back is facing me. I grab her ass and whisper \"I'd love to fuck you.\" those exact words. \n\nTurns out my girlfriend is a good hostess. She had offered to sleep on my couch instead of my sister. I ended up grabbing my sister's ass and telling her id love to fuck her. \n\nMy sister turned to me. \"Max?\" I recognized her voice. \n\nI hoped out of bed. I was mortified. I ran into the living room and, sure enough, there was my girlfriend. I ran back into the bedroom and apologized to my sister. We both got a good laugh out of it, at least, even if I was laughing through the tears. \n\nTL;DR My girlfriend and sister switched rooms without telling me. I ended up grabbing my sister's ass and saying I'd love to fuck her.\n\nEdit: I am now single. 23 male. Bisexual.

First thing that pops up is an ad of a girl yelling \u201cOh Baby\u201d with the volume on my phone at full blast. I quickly turn it down and proceed to business. \n\nI return to my wife in the living room and all I see is shock on her face as he holds my son looking worried.

She looked at me dead serious and said \u201cSomething whispered \u2018Hey baby\u2019 to our son after you left and now I\u2019m freaked out.\u201d\n\nFor some background my wife believes in ghosts/spirits as crazy as it sounds. She has told me about seeing odd things in our house and believing she heard people talking before. So this did not help and she is even more worried with our new addition. \n\nShe is currently burning sage through our house to \u2018remove the spirits.\u2019 I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her I was just horny and she overheard me watching porn. \n\nTL;DR: I tickled my pickle with no volume discipline and an ad played where the actress said \u2018baby.\u2019 Now my wife thinks our house is haunted and ghosts want to talk to our baby.",

            "Yeah you did. \n\nBut, the tell tale sign that this story is a fictional piece was the phrase, \"so I decided not to bother my wife.\" You said your son was a week old. Every new parent knows you cant have sex for 4-6 weeks. So there was no decision to be made. \n\nYou may say that were just turning a phrase, but you spent an entire paragraph setting up that you needed to masturbate because you decided not to have sex with your wife.",

            "I do hope this is a joke. Seeing as she can\u2019t do anything sexual for *at minimum* 6 weeks (no joke, it could kill her) you should KNOW this because you talked to and listened to her and her doctor, right? She\u2019s exhausted and hormonal and nothing in her body is cooperating right now, the very least you could do is either think with your adult brain and tell her the truth. I have zero sympathy for any man that can\u2019t put his family before himself for a few damn weeks.",

            "> My son is a week old\n  \nThe way you frame this comes across as it's somehow your wives problem that the birth tore her vagina and that you are getting \"restless\" because you can't have sex with her.  \n  \nIt also seems you have some issues being open in your relationship, because you can't just tell her what you were doing and you're here, posting on Reddit TIFU for advice. Like wtf dude?\n  \nIf you can't talk about masturbation with your partner.. what kind of relationship do you really have?\n  \nAlso, just saying \"oh that was from my phone\" would have covered it, but you're in the comments joking about ghostbusting and freaking out your wife, who has JUST GIVEN BIRTH.

I think it would be better to tell her only if you notice she is excessively anxious or withdrawn. Give it awhile. If she believes the sage burning helped and says she hasn\u2019t experienced anything else since, then I see no reason to say anything just because it\u2019s awkward. It\u2019s your choice though",

It gaslit me quite a bit and made me think I was losing it until months later when I was inside the company vehicle and heard very clearly \"Bluetooth Disconnected\" and saw another person who used the vehicle walking away. I felt much better but when you start undeniably hearing voices you've got three options, people in your walls, some random electronics you're not aware of are running their mouth, ghosts or you're going crazy. If you can't explain the electronics, well, all the other results are uncomfortable.",

The fear is very real for her. That doesn\u2019t make her crazy.\n\nYou need to tell her you were jacking it and that\u2019s where the voice came from. bc she\u2019s probably terrified for your child rn and that\u2019s a shitty thing to let your wife go through post partum.",

I totally understand guys need the relief, just like us women can\u2019t get enough in the second trimester.",
            "Im probably 100% wrong but just in case I wanted to add this: hearing things and seeing things like shadows etc can be early signs of schizophrenia, and just after birth is a vulnerable time, so I would keep an eye on that, bc her believing in spirits and hearing people and seeing things might not just be an innocent quirk and if treated early schizophrenia can be well treated with medicine.",
            "It's a funny story, but on a serious note, the OP really needs to tell her the truth. It seems cruel not to, and certainly dishonest. And the longer he waits, the worse it will be if he ever does tell her. \nAnd if he doesn't, that's needless additional stress, plus encouraging a silly (and likely harmful) superstitious belief that she will pass on to their children.",

            "Nobody\u2019s gonna question why tf he\u2019s materbating to another woman? Wtf",
            "Seems like it's pretty unfair to let her be afraid for her own child's safety because you wanted to rub one out. Post-birth is an intense period, especially for the birth-giver. Stress could literally cause psychosis, depression or suicide. \n\nAnd those saying that her psycho-physiological state is a reason NOT to tell her are gaslighting assholes. Tell her BECAUSE she is in a sensitive state. She popped a child out for you, I think you can deal with the few (or many) tears that might come out",
            "So, I don't think the majority of yall are considering all the factors here.  Yes, her burning things is an act to repel what she believes are malicious spirits away from her home to protect her family.  But really, shame on yall and OP for thinking that's crazy.  One person's ritual acts are just as nutty as another's (my mother has routinely taken it upon herself to anoint every place I have lived - just because you don't subscribe to it; doesn't mean it doesn't work for them). \n\nSecondly!  Not everyone is cool with their SOs even the slightest bit masturbating to anybody  else other than them (porn).  Or even doing it solo thinking of them at all.  And also, recently given birth, could set that trigger and response to a much greater extreme.   We don't know, and OP didn't specify. The only person that can weight those 2 things are the OP.  \n\nSo, for some real advice, either you can simply fess up to your activities; or you can take it upon yourself to double protect the house in the manner of her choosing (face it, you called it crazy so you don't believe what she does) to ease her mind.\n\nEither way, you should support her and ask her how she'd like the house to be spiritually protected and do it.",

I told him I was pissed that scalpers were buying them up and flipping them for twice their msrp and just bitching like a bitch in general, when he tells me his nephew just got a ps5 for free, I was like what? Little ray ray? That little fucker got a ps5 for free? He doesn't even play his ps4 pro you guys got him for his birthday 3 months ago! that little dude is a mobile gamer. I ask my cousin how the hell he got a ps5 for free, my cousin was like \"cancer\"......FUUUCCCKKK......I totally forgot that kid had cancer, my cousin was like yeah dude make a wish hit him up and asked him if he wanted a ps5, he said sure. Now before the devil comes and takes me to hell, the kid is in remission, he's a little fighter from what I know and is overall a good kid. I don't hang out with little ray ray much but damn did I feel like a giant asshole after I got home.\n\nTL;DR called my cousins cancer stricken nephew a fucker for getting a ps5 for free from make a wish foundation\n\nEdit: woke up to this on the front page of TIFU, lots of different opinions on the matter, I obviously changed little ray rays name just in case some of his family is on reddit and comes across this post. Don't get me wrong, the kid is a cool kid but he isn't exactly family to me as he is my cousin's wife's sister's son. Just glad some of you all found the humor in this as I definitely laughed at my self for being such a dumbass about forgetting the cancer thing.\n\n2nd edit: so I guess this dude thought my story was good enough to rip off as his own.\n\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJxG2Tgx/",

But yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so I went there an hour earlier.\n\nSometimes after I come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.\nSo I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn\u2019t hear me.\nThat\u2019s when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.\n\nI busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.\nHer best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they\u2019ve never seen a man\u2019s privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. \n\nThe silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: \u201eGood plan, bad execution.\u201c Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.\n\nI even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.\n\nTl;dr: Busted naked into my SO\u2019s girl evening.\n\n**Edit:** Holy shit, rip my inbox. Thanks to everyone for their funny comments, upvotes and to the anonymous benefactors for their gold/silver.\n\nAnd now to answer the most asked questions:\n\nYes, I asserted dominance by slapping everyone with my dick and yelling \u201ePi\u00f1ata! Pi\u00f1ata!\u201c\n\nOf course I ran home naked to surprise my girlfriend.\n\nYes, I plan to marry my SO. Plan includes me naked-manning her girls evening again with her ring around my cock and a bow tie. \n\nYes, I will post an update when the time comes. Don\u2019t know how long that will take though.\n\nYes, the update will include a live stream.\n\nAnd the most asked question: yes, I\u2019m well equipped and stormed the castle with a raging boner and in helicopter motion. Dick stopped at 2 o\u2019clock, when I realized the fuck up.",

        "selftext": "Bit of context; I was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. I'm 26 now. \n\nWell it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and I had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. It's where I got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?\n\nWhile I sat amongst rubble and dirt, I had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.\n\nAgain, I wasn't bright. \n\nWell. I drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.\n\nThat said, I flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly I can't remove it. Not a single adult was even aware I was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.\n\nSo when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.\n\nI lost my mind.\n\nMy dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. Probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. Whatever really.\n\nEither way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that I was overreacting.\n\nOkay. Sure.\n\nLet's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and I'm in highschool.\n\nThis is where the real fun begins. Equalbrium (Equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. I could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. Plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. Was a nightmare, really.\n\nI get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that \"imaginary rock\" I had long ago forgotten.\n\nAll I hear is scrapes.\n\nScrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.\n\nI'll admit, I immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. That's another topic entirely.\n\nWell wouldn't you know, though? The doctor said I was faking, examined my ear, and said I just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. Right. It was probably June at the time.\n\nMy mom didn't really believe him, but I decided \"balls to it. Let's get some Hydro-Perox!\", because fuck hospitals really.\n\nSkip along the years a bit more, I'm 18 and I know for a fact there is something In-My-Fucking-Head. I'm losing it. So I hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, \"There's definitely blockage. I'm not sure if it's a rock, but I can certainly try to help.\"\n\nSo this Professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of Scissor-Hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. It was audio torture, hands down. Rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.\n\nThe end results? \"You'll need to see a specialist\", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.\n\nI'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.\n\nThe sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and I began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when I reflect back.\n\nLet's time jump one last time. I'm 22, couple months away from 23, I have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. Great.\n\nBut now, out of the blue, I'm losing Hand-Eye coordination. Well damn, you know? I attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.\n\nI lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that I could dig this chunk of earth out myself.\n\nThree different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. But that last one was phased from the situation immediately.\n\nThis was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and I locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.\n\nEventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. In an instant I froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.\n\nJackpot.\n\nNow, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.\nThe pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like I was passing a kidney stone from my skull.\n\nAll in all, 2/10. Wouldn't do again.\n\nBut now it's totally out and I have it put away in a ziplock bag.\n\nI had no real recovery issues I guess. As soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. Now it just rings occasionally.\n\nMy balance won't ever be the same I feel, but it's fine enough as is. Otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, I have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and I get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.\n\nNot a bad trade out.\n\n[Size reference](https://i.imgur.com/xAxLEG9.png)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**_EDIT_**: For everyone calling me an idiot, trust me I know. For everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and I've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. It's fine. This is why I can laugh it off.\n\n**_Another Edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. Had to check a few timestamps.\n\nI'm currently 26.\n\nAlso, spelling\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: I put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn't believe me, the other couldn't help. Pulled it out myself after 13 years when I was 22 and now I can't swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and I have poor balance.",

            "Here's what you do.\n\nYou make an appointment with an ENT. Don't think about the actual visit with the doctor. Just call the front desk and set an appointment to get your ears looked at.\n\nWhen you get there (and you will go), tell the doctor that you have an aversion to doctors. That you have had bad experiences. Take out your bagged rock and tell him it's been sitting in your ear for years despite seeing a couple of doctors. \n\nTell him that you are still experiencing dizziness, pressure, etc. That you just want him to make sure everything looks okay in the ear.\n\nAnd most importantly tell him to describe everything he is about to do. This will prepare you for any potential uncomfortable sensations. The fact that you absolutely freak out about sensations and not see a doctor tells me you need some extra care during examinations.\n\nGood luck.",

            "Hey man,\n\nHope this doesn\u2019t get lost in the jumble, but as one of the specialists who you should have seen over a decade ago, but you really should see an ENT. This rock may have perforated your drum in the past, and that trauma can cause something called a cholesteatoma, which is when skin gets past your eardrum, often from perforations and trauma, and just starts growing in your inner ear. This can cause a lot of balance issues as the growing skin actually can cause erosion and damage to your inner ear organs of balance and your hearing bones. Your symptoms are pretty concerning, and you really should get it checked out. If these things grow large enough they can cause real bad, irreversible damage including possibly even paralysis of your face on that side. It\u2019s a 15 min visit so we can look in your ear with a much better instrument than you\u2019ve had looked in your ear before.",

            "My dude... I went to one of those specialist doctors (the peanut up the nose kind) for something similar.  \n  \nHad a dream of a bug crawling into my ear, woke up panicked because for the first few seconds of being awake I swore I could still hear it scritch scritch scritch into my ear. Fast forward a couple days and I'm cleaning wax out of my ears with a cotton swab and suddenly \\*FUMP\\*  ... I can't hear shit out of my right ear. I thought I punctured my eardrum because the pain was absurd and I lost my balance and was *completely* deaf in my right ear. Quickly have my roommate rush me to the ER, they pull in a specialist that they just happened to have there (I assume it's because this hospital was the nearest to 5 separate really rural towns, two of which being in West Virginia so they probably have some not-so-bright folks coming in)  \n  \nAfter an hour of irrigation, suction, and alligator forceps prodding around my ear suddenly I can hear again all at once and something comes loose and falls into the dish they were holding under my ear with a loud \\*THUNK\\*. The nurse assisting the specialist does this sharp intake of breath and says \"You... You may not want to see this.\"   \n  \nLike fucking fuck I don't!! Let me see what was in my godd--OH HOLY JESUS MOTHER FUCK WHAT THE SHIT...   \n  \nThere, in the dish, covered in ear wax, was a big mother fucking dead spider, curled into a ball. They sent it off to an expert because they wanted to know what kind of spider it was and if this was in any way \"normal\" behavior for it, etc.  \n  \nTurns out, it was a brown recluse. Considerably farther north than it ought to be. It traveled hundreds of miles to my rural Virginia rental home, just outside of WV, and crawled inside my ear while I was sleeping to fucking die.",

            "Dude me and you are pretty similar. When I was 6 I decided it would be awesome to be a secret agent and have an earpiece, all I had were dried beans though. So I stuck it in my ear and every now and then I\u2019d press on it and pretend I\u2019m listening to someone in it. After a while I press the bean in and it goes all the way. I decide not to tell anyone because I\u2019m a dumb kid. When I was 13 I had a hard time hearing in my left ear so doctors look and get out \u201cthe biggest hunk of ear wax he\u2019d ever seen\u201d I knew though, it was the fucking bean. Kept my mouth shut still. When I was 26 my mom brought that up in a conversation and I started laughing and told everyone the full story finally. Man... I was a dumb kid sometimes.",

I can\u2019t imagine 13 years.   I would have                 Van Gogh\u2019d myself after 1 hour. Glad you got it out finally. What a relief it must be.",
            "Why didn\u2019t that genius doctor who accused you of making it all up and said that it looks impacted refer you to an ENT?\n\nHonestly even if he though it was impacted with wax he should have referred you because that is an ENT concern.\n\nThe ENT would have right away sorted you out and would have saved you all those years of stress. \n\n\nI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the regular doctor would be useless bc I had a somewhat similar issue. \n\nI had ear problems not bc of shoving pebbles in my ear but because of an ear tube not properly falling from my ear. Anyway fast forward to several years later and I\u2019m suffering from intense ear pain and every doctor could not give me an answer and would just act like it was all in my head. Eventually I asked one doctor if I should just see an ENT he thought it was pointless but said I could if I wanted to. \n\nI did and glad I decided to because it turned out my ear doesn\u2019t self clean bc of the surgery I had on my ear when I was very young.  No one predicted the issue because the surgery was YEARS ago. The regular doctor never told me my ear was impacted which he should have seen because he used the tool where you can look inside an ear. Probably didn\u2019t mention it bc there was nothing he could actually do about it as that is something only an ENT can fix. I only found out bc the ENT could clearly see the wax problem and solved the issue in seconds by clearing out the impacted ear canal with a nifty gadget. Sometimes GP docs can be so useless.",

For context, my boy is 5 and was done with it at 1.5yrs old, It seemed like a very easy and natural step for him,\n\nDifferent story for my little girl.\n\nMy wife is exhausted by it, we're not having more kids so she often blurts out she's so \"done with it\" and \"wants to cut them off\".\n\nYikes.\n\nI've suggested some other methods and even prepared bottles for her but she (my daughter) isn't having any of it. I'll even get up at 2, 4 and 5am to give her cups of milk. No go.\n\nToday seemed like a breaking point for my wife, she lashed out with a \"leave me alone\" to my girl who was really clawing at her shirt.

I was kidding. That stuff is \\*really\\* nasty hot.\"\n\n\"I have to do something.\" And I have to admit she really seems at her wits end but this seems.. Harsh.\n\nI'm now pleading with her to try different ideas, she can't be serious. But now my wife is dancing around the kitchen \"OUCH! OUCH! PSSSHHHTT! HOTTT!!! HOLYSHIT! OW! OW! OWWW!\" Half-laughing, she eventually \"cool's off\" but this goes on for a while and I'm trying not to laugh but she looks ridiculous bouncing around the kitchen clutching her boobs.\n\nLater on, we're curled up on the couch watching a show and, right on cue, my girl wants to nurse.

So, after I was done with my dinner, I was horny so decided to head back to my old room and have a little sausage massage session. \n\nI put on some ebony porn, and started to slowly play with myself. Halfway through, I lost interest, but I had a rock solid boner, so I decided to shift gears with it. So, I put on some manual transmission car racing videos on my TV, and shifted gears with my dick whenever the guys in the video shifted the gears. I was trying to match the timing, and it was fun. \n\nThe fun lasted for 10 minutes, until my dad barged into my room to ask me if I would fancy some ice cream. The puzzled look on his face said everything. \n\ntl;dr :- My dad caught me shifting gears with my dick to car racing videos.",

My dad didn't hear me, he is deaf.\n\n   That image has stained my memory and I spent the next hour lying in bed staring at the ceiling.

He comes in and holds my hair and cleans up the splatter on the toilet while I'm brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. \n\nSo, now I'm worried that I've hurt my husband or made him feel like he's unattractive or something. He's not acting weird about it but I'm afraid he's bothered and hiding it, even though he's assuring me that he's not. \n\nI feel like a shitty wife. Damn hormones and overthinking brain.\n\nTLDR hormones and overthinking caused me to throw up after giving my husband a blow job because I didn't want my baby eating her siblings.\n\n\nEdit: I did explain right away. He just said, \"Well, I guess we're not doing that for a while.\" Also, I've taken biology classes. I know it's an irrational thought. Pregnancy is full of those. As for brushing my teeth, we were headed right to bed and I didn't want to sleep with puke breath so I weighed the pros and cons and figured it couldn't hurt too much to brush right after once.\n\nAlso, he found this.

We found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.\n\nWhile I was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional Asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  That rest was very short lived.  The baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...\n\nWhen she read \"Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice 21/07/2019\" she lost her got damn mind.  She woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  Raised with no manners or respect.  She then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.\n\nMy wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  She passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.\n\nI didn't get upset because I'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.\n\nTL;DR  I labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  Now I have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks I embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",

            "I feel for you guys.\n\nBack in 2014 my husband ended up in hospital for 2 months with a very serious heart condition we had no idea he even had until it could have killed him. No symptoms, no warning. Naturally the episode that landed him in hospital was scary and when they didn't readily know what was wrong with him and that everything they initially tried did nothing, it was downright terrifying. Eventually they sorted it out, and 5 years on, he's doing well, but at the time we had no idea what he was up against. Hell, even the doctors didn't know. So we (me, DH, and our friends) did what we usually did when faced with a super stressful situation: made humorous, nerdy \"jokes\" about the situation. We talked about DH really being an alien, and then it ended up being that we were certain he was actually a Time Lord and therefore had two hearts which is why the ECG was so messed up. My mother told me off. Apparently this is \"no joking matter\", \"it's very serious\", \"he is not a Time Lord\", that joking about serious things like this is \"disrespectful and rude\". This is the same woman who, when I was asked if I needed anything and I replied \"If you find a fairy, mug her for her magic wand for me.\", she lectured me about how both fairies and magic wands aren't real. Because at 38 years old, I clearly hadn't figured that shit out for myself.\n\nCongratulations on the new bub. Good luck with your \"has no sense of humour\" mother-in-law.",

After reading the comments and your replies, may I suggest that you call/meet FIL and express your concern that MIL felt the need to wake up your tired, emotionally fragile wife and yell at her for something that did no harm to anyone?

            "As an Asian guy with an Asian wife with 2 kids, don't sweat it as long as you and your wife maintain a good relationship.  Asian old-school conservatism and culture is impossible to keep up with and if you try too hard you'll wind up insane and you'll be writing a TIFU every week. It's even worse if they follow certain Asian superstitions because there is absolutely NO reference to what these superstitions are. My personal advice is to never worry about being good enough for your mother-in-law.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're Asian, white, black, her own son, her son-in-law, or whatever -- if you grew up in a western culture you will always be disrespectful in some way.  I was born in North America, so there's a ton of conflict between me and my mother-in-law -- and it just took a lot of time before we both adjusted to the dynamic.  Do what you can to make your wife comfortable, and try your best not to make her the middle-person that has to pick sides between you and  her mom. Find ways to work with your wife to realize that you're going to make cultural mistakes, and that's not on you and there are some things you can learn and change, but in most cases it'll be your Mother in law's problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake posts telling you to confront your mother-in-law with caution. I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying that you'll be fighting a few things that you might not want blow-back on.  For one, in most Asian cultures it's like the biggest thing ever to talk back to elders. Also, there may be a stigma that whatever westerners do is WRONG, and you cannot change their mind about it. Third, as you have experienced, your mother-in-law will absolutely bring your wife into it, chew her out even more and it will just be a mess altogether. Pick your battles and make sure your wife is on board.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust clean your side of the street, make sure you feel good about who you are, and let her worry about her side of the street.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne note though, Asian parents are awesome when it comes to sacrificing their time to take care of grand-kids -- so always be appreciative of that (even if you don't agree sometimes on HOW they take care of them).

I had to watch my girlfriend's heart be broken because her mom was a narcissistic piece of shit who didn\u2019t give a damn if her daughter was happy.

She used to claim it was \u201cjust a cultural difference,\u201d but I know quite a few other Chinese women. Their moms aren\u2019t pieces of shit.

One day (before the pandemic) I was out shopping at a grocery store and I noticed that a man I had never met before, looking at me and smiling. I started to get creeped out, returned his gaze with a glare, and hurried through my shopping. When I got to the checkout line, he hurried over to be in the same line as me, and I really started to get freaked out. Finally, while I was walking out to my car, he rushed out and at this point I\u2019m shook. I pull out my pepper spray, point it at him, and shout \u201cfuck off dude!\u201d\n\nWith absolute horror and fear on his face he said \u201cwoah! I just wanted to say hi! It\u2019s been a while and I was wondering how work was going!\u201d\n\nConfused and freaked out, all I could muster was a \u201cwhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to ask how the UX Research Education Program is going! I really enjoyed that presentation you gave to my team and I just wanted to say that we\u2019re starting to do unmoderated A/B tests!\u201d\n\nI had given research presentations to engineering teams at my company before so I started to think he worked at [my company].\n\u201cOh my god! Do you work at [my company]?\u201d\n\nHe looked helpless. \u201cNo... wait did you leave [twin\u2019s company]?\u201d\n\nThen it dawned on me. I would have been embarrassed if it weren\u2019t for the immediate sense of relief I felt when I realized this man wasn\u2019t trying to wear my skin. I lowered my pepper-spray-armed hand and said \u201coh my god I am so sorry. You must know my twin sister [name]. I am SO sorry!!!\u201d\n\n\u201c[name] has a twin???\u201d He looked shocked and relieved.\n\nWe both ended up laughing and he apologized for his aggressive behavior. I apologized on behalf of my twin, who failed to mention I existed! Though in her defense, and my own, it\u2019s really hard to work into a professional conversation \u201cbtw, I have a twin sister that looks just like me and doesn\u2019t work far from here. If you think you see me out and about, be cautious. It may be my twin sister and she will pepper spray you.\u201d\n\nTL;DR I nearly pepper sprayed a man because he thought I was my twin sister and was being aggressively friendly, which I mistook as predatory behavior.\n\nEDIT: thank you for all of the love! Especially the hilarious twin stories. I smiled and laughed so much reading the comments. Always amazing finding people with similar experiences.\n\nSECOND EDIT: to all the \u201cmen\u201d who are now \u201cafraid\u201d of being pepper sprayed, try to remember that it is far less likely for you to maced for being friendly than it is for a woman to be sexually assaulted. \ud83d\ude42 now go suck an enthusiastically consenting BUTT",

During our conversation he brought up our escapades from last night. See, here's the issue reddit, my boyfriend is a great guy. Funny, smart, incredibly hot, but there's just one thing that is so hard for me to look past. Whenever we have sex, he makes these noises that sound exactly like a minecraft villager. Usually I can just ignore it, but last night Idk what happened but I just couldn't. \nAs he finished he made the loudest groan I've ever heard. This groan sounded like a bass boosted minecraft villager played at 100 volume through headphones. \n\nI lost it. \n\nI let out a little giggle and practically sprinted to the bathroom before I exploded with laughter. He heard and asked what was so funny, and I told him I just saw a funny post on my phone and that was that.\n\nWell that brings us to this morning. I was hoping he wouldn't say anything, but of course he had to ask what I saw that was so funny. At this point I figured I just had to tell him the truth.  So I said \"Babe, I'm really sorry, but last night you made a really funny sound and I couldn't stop.\" He's a good sport so he laughed, but then he asked me to describe it to him.  I told him that he makes villager noises whenever we had sex and he became very confused. So I pulled up a video on YouTube and it DID NOT sit well with him. He told me I was lying and there was no way. I told him that I wasn't lying and that really I'm used to it at this point, but then he accused me of trying to embarrass him and told me there was \"no way he could sound like that in bed\". I didn't step down, but I did tell him it was okay. He's pissed now though. He hasn't said a word to me since and we have to leave to go to see his family tomorrow for Christmas stuff.\n\nTl,dr: I told my boyfriend he sounds like a minecraft villager when we have sex and now he won't talk to me.",

There is a lot of stigma around guys making noise in bed, and a lot of insecurity and pressure to be some sort of sex god or something lol. I think acknowledging his feelings on the issue and making him feel valid would be a much better way forward than this \u201che should get over it\u201d attitude. Both people here are young, it\u2019s true, but instead of using that as an excuse, it\u2019s a good opportunity to see this as a learning moment and a chance to strengthen the relationship.",
            "The fact that he's not talking to you is a clear signal you deeply hurt him, regardless of how funny you think it is or he will just get over it. You owe him an apology, and a really big one.\n\nNext time you have sex, take note of how little sound he will be making. That'll tell you he's thinking about that painful moment instead of focusing on your time together. He might not even be able to finish. This is the stuff of nightmares for guys, the beginnings of performance anxiety. It's a horrible thing.\n\nSimple stuff like this can take all the joy out of sex and really poison the well between partners. Hopefully he can get past it, but don't be surprised if he doesn't. I've seen relationships end on stuff like that, unfortunately.",

A guy opens up about something and it's either \"why are you telling me this?\" or \"Omg, get a load of this guy!\"\n\nI'm definite that this could have been handled better, even if it was oblivious or unintended. It was a really tacky joke at his expense. Not to say that 19 year olds can be faulted for all of their behaviors and decisions, but this was probably a good example of a misguided juvenile one.",

But he also has a thing for big breasts, which I attribute to his \u201chentai porn\u201d fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. \n\nIn the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. He would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me I\u2019d be \u201cperfect\u201d if I got some saline implants to fill a DD cup, as a \u201cjoke\u201d of course. (DD is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34C, but still insulting to me.)\n\nSo I finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. I told him most petite Asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. He did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great I\u2019d look in a double D while we were out having brunch. \n\nSo I snapped, and I said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. Well he didn\u2019t take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. He hasn\u2019t returned any of my texts since. \n\nTL;DR: I underestimated how fragile my bf\u2019s ego is concerning his balls and I insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.\n\nEdit/Update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. I tried calling him to apologize since he\u2019s ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(\n\nMore Edit: I\u2019m very sorry if I gave the wrong impression of him here. Words are very limited. He really is a good guy otherwise. I know and I hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. But I really like him (AND his balls big or small!). I did not mean to hurt him this deeply and I\u2019m just so sad right now that I hurt him this much. I feel like a terrible person. I shouldn\u2019t have reacted with cattiness that I didn\u2019t even mean because I like his balls just the way they are!\n\nOne last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies.

I've been in so many emotionally/mentally abusive relationships, please, please dont think this is okay. This is FUCKED UP. \n\nHere is an example I have learned to use as a standard for comparision from the healthiest relationship I have been in:\nmy boyfriend and I are play-fighting. He pretends to hit my face. Nothing bad here. But it bothers me. I tell him (while we are still playing) \"hey this is all fine but just dont hit my face, okay?\" (And by 'hit' it was a VERY playful tap) he says \"really?\" And we both laugh it off and continue making dinner and tickling eachother/play-fighting. It's fun, but in the back of my mind it bothered me a lot. He does it again and i say, \"hey, quit it\" I got a little more bothered, but tried to ignore it because my reasoning is irrational (the reasoning is coming up)\nBut we continue with the playing. He does it one more time and I blurt out:\n\"I dont like it when you do that because I watched my dad hit my mom growing up and even though we are playing around it makes me feel bad when you \"hit\" my face because it makes me feel like you will hit me the way he did to her.\"\n\nWe both pause, since this was out of the blue. And after a few moments of both of us kind of becoming deflated he says \"Oh...okay\"\nMe: \"I'm sorry\" \nAnd I turn around a little awkwardly and continue making dinner. Feeling bad for ruining the moment and clearly making him feel bad. \nHe walked out of the room and after about 10 seconds he walks back in and hugs me fiercely and apologizes.\nHe said \n\"I am so sorry, I didnt mean to make you feel that way. You asked me to stop and I didnt. I only stopped when you gave me a reason and that's so messed up. I should have listened the first time, I shouldn't have to have a reason\"\nAnd I nearly cried at how sweet that comment was. \n\nAnyway the point is, you shouldn't have to explain yourself twice.

Tell him you have a similar fetish for foot-long penises if he ever gets back in contact with you, see if he's willing to look into any augmentation in that regard.",

It's not the point that you don't have a problem with his body. The point is that he does have an issue with *yours*, and he's pushing it on you, hoping that you will change yourself through surgery. Then when you - correctly - drew his attention to the fact that he may not be physically perfect he turned into a sensitive little boy. He's a total hypocrite. He wasn't stopping to think about your feelings before drawing attention to what he perceives as your imperfections, was he? So he needs to be able to withstand the same type of criticism, or else not dish it out.\n\nYou aren't in the wrong.

We always buy popcorn or whatever the boy scouts are selling since my son was once a boy scout and was a great salesman and won lots of prizes for his sales. So the boy scouts in the neighborhood can always count on us buying a few boxes from whoever shows up at the door.\n\nWe have three dogs. Two of them go into a barking frenzy when anyone rings the doorbell. To combat this, we keep a water gun by the door since being squirt a couple of times shuts them right up. One day, the doorbell rings, the dogs go into their frenzy, and my wife notices that the squirt gun is not sitting by the front door but had been moved to the kitchen. So she yells \u201cIt\u2019s boy scouts. Get the gun!\u201d to my son in the other room. \n\nWhen she opened the door the two boys were about to bolt until they see the small purple water gun in her hand.\n\nTL;DR Boy scouts at our front door thought they were going to be met with deadly force.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the generosity! [Dog tax.](https://i.imgur.com/tOHmu5r.jpg) They hate being squirt but get into water whenever they have a chance, even in the middle of the winter. Spike is the cairn terrier. He's over 15 years old and has never barked at people or the doorbell. Pepper is the schnauzer, and a true watch dog since he's a yapping machine. Annie was a starving stray we found living under a bridge about 7 years ago. She is likely part basenji since although she barks, especially when Pepper instigates her, she mostly whines loudly when she's excited.\n\n[The deadly weapon.](https://i.imgur.com/nUiTeJa.jpg) Highly recommended squirt gun. It has lasted for years, goes to about 20 ft, and is accurate. I heard about it on reddit to keep cats off counters.",

He was shouting, \u201cN-O-S-O-L-I-C-T...\u201d when his mom started panicking and yelled for him to get away from the door. At about that time, my dad opened the door laughing and told them it was okay and that they had put the sign up for the daily salesmen, not innocent fundraisers, and he bought a bunch of popcorn from the kid.",

        "selftext": "I (28m) started having sex in my mid teens, but stopped having sex in my early 20s, specifically after my first real relationship came to an end. I was 22. I never thought it would affect me as bad as it did for as long as it did. But from 22 until recently, I've been avoiding relationships, even casual hookups. As you can imagine, I did what most people do when they're alone and horny, I masturbated. For 6 fucking years. \n\nA few weeks ago I finally said enough is enough and decided to start dating again. After several unsuccessful dates and almost reverting back to my antisocial ways, I managed to make a connection. She was cute, funny, covered in freckles and I loved it. Towards the end of our first date we agreed to continue the fun at her place. Based on our body language, sex was definitely on the table. One of my biggest fears was cumming almost instantly due to the 6 years of zero sex. \n\nHowever, the opposite became my biggest challenge. I wasn't cumming at all. I could practically see the seasons change while I was fucking. That's how long it felt. After thrusting longer than I've ever thrusted in my life, I pulled out and apologized to my date. She seemed as relieved as I was to stop. We were both complaining about being sore. I explained my 6 year situation and made her understand that she did nothing wrong. It was all me. \n\nShe understood and said it must be \"death grip\". I never heard of it before, but when she explained it to me, it made sense. I Googled how to overcome death grip and the number one treatment plan was masturbate less. I opted for not masturbating at all and guess what? It didn't help. No money shot. I had sex with the same freckle-faced girl for 3 weeks and I think her vagina fucking hates me. Yesterday we were supposed to meet up but she called to tell me she's no longer interested in seeing me because I've made it uncomfortable for her to walk properly. \n\nI masturbated this morning just to see if I can still cum and the answer is yes. I've literally trained my dick to hate sex and now I seemed to have lost a potential girlfriend. \n\nTl;dr Avoided sex and masturbated for most of my 20s and now I'm unable to orgasm during sex and I'm losing potential relationships in the process.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**SHE CAME. HOLY FUCK. I didn't think that information was relevant until I summoned the council of female pleasure in this thread.**",

            "Okay, real talk - I had/have this issue.\n\nIt's (almost certainly) not entirely your death grip. You were nervous the first time and it took forever.

I was on SSRIs which gave me troubles. I eventually got off them and I should be fine but I still get nervous about it and then....

            "It takes time. You will overcome this. Keep faith and stay strong. \nNothing to be ashamed of. You can do it!",
            "To preface what I\u2019m going to say, I\u2019m just going to admit that I am not a person with a penis, and I am never gonna pretend that I know how dicks work. They confuse the shit out of me. I\u2019ve heard of all of the fixes people have mentioned, but I absolutely do not know how it actually feels to actually have a penis and be having that problem.\n\nI would like to help you understand how to better manage dating and sex while you\u2019re figuring out how to fix this issue. I have gone a year having very regular sex with a boyfriend who never once came. That ended 6 years ago for me, for reasons completely separate from the sex, and I still am very casual friends with the guy and still have no idea what was going on on his end. So some relevant background on my experience I guess is that I was 16, he was 17, we\u2019d been dating for months, were deeply in love with eachother, and were each other\u2019s firsts. We didn\u2019t know much about what we were doing but I was basically a TA for my high schools sex Ed program so I knew a lot of the theories about how to maintain a healthy relationship and sex life. So, I tried very hard to talk about what was happening in order to fix whatever the issue was for him. He never opened up about what was going on no matter how many times I asked him questions, assured him that it was okay and not to be embarrassed, and asked/proposed specific ideas of what might help him orgasm during our sex. \n\nSo, from what I\u2019ve learned, it is perfectly possible for a woman to enjoy sex without a guy ever orgasming. Like ever. I\u2019d be fine marrying and living for decades in this situation giving certain requirements are being met to keep it from making me feel physically and mentally shitty. Male orgasm isn\u2019t a requirement for female pleasure. Just like the many times that men have sex with women even if they have 0 intention of actually making her orgasm because that\u2019s just what the patriarchy taught them, it can still be sex that both individuals enjoy even if the guy doesn\u2019t cum as well. It just involves a bit more communication and effort mostly because of the pain aspect. \n\nSo, I\u2019d suggest being honest with women before actually having intercourse about whats been going on with you. Say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019d still like to try and I will definitely still enjoy it, but I might not be able to cum and that\u2019s fine with me. Just wanted to let you know to please tell me if/when it becomes uncomfortable for you so we can take a break or stop\u201d. If you really want to make her feel more into you, try to express how much you want her to enjoy the experience instead of making it all about your climax. And OMFG USE LUBE. I\u2019ve met many men who don\u2019t want to use lube because they think that womens vaginas are water fountains and that they can just magically be totally lubricated anytime that we\u2019d like them to be. A lot of society even makes this an expectation, and so some men think women who aren\u2019t as wet as they\u2019d like all the time are less attractive and therefore they don\u2019t want to be with a woman who wants or needs to use it anyways. Lube literally always makes the sex smoother, and less painful for a woman. Especially if you\u2019re going for longer than average periods of time. Say you\u2019re actually thrusting for an hour+ without cumming. Take a break, hopefully multiple breaks, and apply some extra lube. I\u2019m a girl who enjoys long sex. I think most do. I\u2019d love going for an hour but absolutely not without some lube breaks. If you go for this long. And do not reapply lube, her vagina will become dry, it will get painful, she will have a chafed vagina, and most likely will be incredibly unhappy with the situation afterwards. I don\u2019t know any other reasons for the girl you had sex with to be experiencing pain the way she is, unless there\u2019s additional issues on her end that you didn\u2019t mention or that she didn\u2019t tell you about, so really lube should stop women from pain if used liberally for your sexathons. \n\nThen there\u2019s the emotional reasons that this could effect women more than you realize. Basically it boils down to just communicate openly about it. Encourage her that you really don\u2019t mind stopping, that you don\u2019t  need to orgasm to enjoy your time with her, and want to make sure she feels good and is enjoying it or else you\u2019d rather stop and just try again another time. Also, idk if you\u2019d be worried about telling her that it\u2019s been an issue for you but it\u2019s way better to tell her beforehand because then she will believe that it\u2019s not her fault. If having sex with you is wrecking her sexual confidence, she probably won\u2019t want to continue. Also lots of people were basically taught that sex is about the guy cumming, and girls are frequently told that they\u2019re terrible people if they have any type of sexual experience where it doesn\u2019t result in the guy cumming. If she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, she will be less likely to tell you when she wants to stop, and it will become less enjoyable. She might think that it\u2019s her responsibility to give you an orgasm and if she doesn\u2019t than she\u2019s giving you \u201cblue balls\u201d which is apparently the worst thing in the world and 100% the fault of the women from what I\u2019ve heard lol. \n\nTLDR: So, overall, communicate the problem, do what you can to make sure it\u2019s comfortable physically (lube), and encourage her wholeheartedly to tell you when she wants to stop and make sure she knows stopping isn\u2019t a big deal. Honestly if you treat her well she might even enjoy the sex more than if you were able to cum.\n\nGood luck and lmk if you\u2019ve got any questions! (Feel free to dm)",

At first she might be enjoying it but at a certain point she will start feeling chafing etc this is when you stop (you can ask her to also inform you when she's not having fun anymore)\n\nThis way you can continue going out with her for more than 3 weeks..

            "You probably do need to dial it back and become more sensitive to less contact, but it can also have to do with how much you're into it, even subconsciously. Especially if you're stressed and worried about coming, it can get in the way and make you less engorged than you might otherwise be and therefore it's a sort of reinforcing loop. I've had to stop more than a few times because it was too much for the girl and the best thing you can do is have a positive mindset about it and keep an eye out for your partners comfort and engagement. If they're just along for the ride and you can't quite make it over the hill, just call it quits and finish outside, either with the partner if they want or while you're doing the bathroom cleanup routine. The relationship is more important and you'll eventually get over whatever the block is. Just don't sweat it if every so often things don't click.",

You'll have to overcome something that you programmed into your brain for 6 years, so expect at least several month of rewiering your brain. \nWhat usually works is, obviously, less fapping, but not only that. You'll have to replace the sensation of your tight fist with the sensation of a real vagina. Which will take a whole lot of repeating.\nFor one, don't do anything sexual for a while. Let your natural sexual tension to grow. Then try having sex. Even if you don't ejaculate, relax end enjoy the moment with your partener(which is actually the most important part of sex). \nIf your partener is understanding enough and willing to put up with that then you're lucky. But as long as she feels good with you and she's not toxic there is no reason to not help you too. \nThing is... even if it sucks, resist the urge to masrurbate if a vagina can't do it. If you use condoms go for the thinnes ones for increased sensation.\nIf your partener won't put up with it and you have to deal with it alone, you can do that too, by masturbating. But you'll have to change how to do it. Forget the death grip and only use a light grip, maybe only using a few fingers, to get yourself used to something looser(also use lube or something to simulate some wetness). A fleshlight or something similar may help instead of your hand.\nGood luck! Hope you will overcome it asap\n\nEdit: spelling",

But my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. \n\nSidenote: This happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.\n\nI work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. I had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. He was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes I get who tend to speak down to me just because I'm a girl who works in a hardware store. Anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so I said I could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. He agrees and he opens his wallet and I notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. Trying to make conversation I decide to comment on it:\n(OP: Me | OG: Old Guy)\n\nOP: Oh is that your granddaughter? She's so cute!\n\nOG: Oh no... That's my daughter.\n\n*FUCK, I basically just implied this guy was old.*\n\nOG: Oh cool! She's really cute! What grade is she in?\n\n*Guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*\n\nOG: She's dead. She was hit by a car. A week after the picture was taken \n\nIn my mind I FUCKING PANICKED. I literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. And this is what I came up with:\n\nOP: Oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! It's too bad she died!\n\nThe guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. In record time I get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, \"Have a nice day!\" And he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.\n\nGuys. \n\nI told him \"you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter\".\n\nAnd that, \"oh geez, sucks that she's dead!\" That's what my fucking brain came up with. \nFML.\n\nTL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.\n\n**UPDATE: Holy shit.**\n\nI did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). Appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).\n\nTo answer a few comments: \n*Why didn't you just say 'I'm sorry' and move on?*\n\nBecause that would of been the smart thing to say and as I have referenced, I am a complete and utter dumbass. Also, I am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so I was trying to backpeddle as fast as I could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.\n\n*Why would you comment on the kids picture? That's weird.*\n\nYeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. But like I said I am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. This happened when I was still pretty new to the job and I had never worked in retail before so I wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. After this happened I learned my lesson and I have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. \n\n*Why do you work in customer service? You clearly don't belong in that department.*\n\nLike I said this happened a few years ago when I was still pretty new and I have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. I now train people for the job and I am also a assistant supervisor of the department. I usually tell newbies this story when I am training them so they don't make the same mistake as I did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). Also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. \n \n*Did you ever apologize to the guy?*\n\nNo, and that's the one thing I regret most of all. I've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. I truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my post guys. While I'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!\n\nTL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.",

            "Not as bad, but I know how this feels. I was working as a cashier at a grocery store, I was in my early 20's, and had been working there for a few years. I tended to bond with customers that were around my age, and often made small talk, and talked about little life updates. Saw a woman come through the line, and something in my head went \\**ding*\\* with recognition. I thought to myself, \"*Oh hey, it's that chick you were talking with a few weeks ago, and told you that she was pregnant.\"*\n\nWith over familiarity, I exclaimed \"You never did get around to telling me, so when is the due date?\"\n\nThe woman shot me a confused look and went pale. \"I'm not pregnant.\"\n\nMy eyebrows furrowed, and I went down the mental checklist of what the pregnant chick looked like, compared to the lady in front of me. Realized I made a mistake. There were very slight differences, and this lady here was a bit older.\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry, you just look a lot like another customer! I wasn't insinuating you looked pregnant or anything of that sort, you just look like someone else who happens to be pregnant. Please don't take any offense. I'm really really terribly sorry.\"\n\nShe stared at me so intensely, I thought she was going to shoot lasers out of her eyes. She then says \"This other customer, is her name Sarah?\"\n\nThat \\**DING DING*\\* went off in my head again. \"Why yes, I believe it is! Do you know her?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I think I do. I guess my daughter is pregnant.\"\n\nIt took me awhile for it all to click, I spent a good minute or so just ringing up her groceries in silence before it finally all clicked. That pregnant customer, (also known as Sarah)... This was her **MOTHER** in front of me.\n\nI finished ringing her up, took payment, and handed her the receipt. I felt like I had to say something... \"Welp, congrats! Sounds like you're going to be a grandmother!\"\n\nShe snatched her receipt angrily from my hand, shook her head and said \"Nope, don't. Just don't.\" I could hear her mumbling as she pushed her cart out of my lane and out to the parking lot. I never saw either of them in the store again after that. I often wonder what happened, and how much I affected that situation. I hope everything turned out ok.\n\nAs for me, I stopped getting so personal with customers. Learned my lesson.",

It was my first time meeting with this particular dentist so we went through the common break-the-ice topics as best we could with a bunch of pointy things in my mouth. Eventually, we start talking about person life events and she tells me that she had a miscarriage about 4 months ago. Once I heard that I internally started freaking out about how to respond and my dumbass says, \"It be like that sometimes.\" I was in complete shock over having accidentally memed. I could tell she was taken aback, too, because she leaned back for a second and said, \"Uhh yeah... uhh i guess it does...\"\nNeedless to say the rest of the cleaning I was very tense even though she took it well.",

            "Oh geez, this reminds me of a call I had to make once! \n\nI worked the front desk at an eye doctor's office in some janky-ass small town in rural Texas. I was tasked with calling people who were due for their annual eye exam. Called this lady's number, dude answered, asked for the lady I was trying to reach.\n\nMan: \"She died in a car accident last week.\"\n\nMe: \"Oh no I am SO SORRY.\"\n\nMan: \"...yeah...\"\n\nMe: \"Uhh.........okaybye.\"\n\nThat last 'uhhh' seemed to stretch on for an eternity. The peaked-in-high-school crowd who also worked the front desk laughed at me. It was horrible and I was mortified.\n\nLook, don't listen to any of those haters who say 'you shouldn't be in customer service because you had a single awkward interaction.' Those people are closed-minded and think that customer service is something you're born good or bad at, which is patently false - people skills are just like any other skill, you learn them over time with study and practice. But the thing about practice is that you fuck up sometimes. That's how you learn and get better, which it sounds like you did. Guess what, I did too! That was one of my first jobs in what has now been twelve years of customer-facing work, and now I also train people on how to deliver excellent customer service.\n\nSee, nobody wants to learn how to interact with customers from the smug jackass who's just naturally charismatic and has never had a problem with it - they want to learn from the person who also had to learn, so that they know what to take away from their mistakes and how to get past those crazy awkward or negative moments.\n\nYou keep on keeping on, good Redditor. That's a hell of an awkward interaction, but it does sound like it was a great learning moment for you, and now you're using it as a great teaching moment for your trainees!

            "I learned real fast (thanks to my coworker who was an idiot and a great example of what not to do) that there is a fine line between connecting with the customer to sell shit and getting too personal.  Old people were super easy.  You make fun of younger generations and talk about how kids don't realize how good they have it.\n\nI worked at a Harley dealership years ago.  It wasn't uncommon for people to come in on crutches from a motorcycle accident.  Usually, to connect with them, I'd just say, \"motorcycle accident?\" and they'd either say yes or no.  If it was \"yes\" I'd follow up with, \"It's happened to the best of us.  Hope you heal fast and get back on two wheels.\"  One thing I didn't do is comment when people had a cane.  Crutches = temporary.  Cane = permanent.\n\nA lady walks in with a cane.  She's maybe 40 years old.  Looks painful to walk.\n\nIdiot coworker:  Oh no!  What happened to you?!\n\nI immediately turn around, see the cane, and prepare myself for an awkward shit show.\n\nLady:  (looking miserable) I have MS.\n\nIdiot coworker:  YOU POOR BABY!!  I hope you get better soon.\n\nAfterward, I took my coworker aside and let her know that MS is permanent, extremely painful, and she'll probably die way earlier than she'd like.  And that a lot of adults don't like it when you call them a baby.  This corworker was 30 years old.  You'd think she would know better.",
            "Okay, maybe not the smoothest conversation, and of course you'd do it differently if you had the chance, but\n\n>that sure is a daughter to be proud of!\n\nTrue. This is just a true statement. She is and was a daughter to be proud of.\n\n>It's too bad she died!\n\nAlso true.\n\nYou spoke two truths, it's just that they probably came out in such a casual and cheery way that it struck him and he was surprised. Had you said the same things in a serious, sad, somber tone it wouldn't even be that unusual.\n\nBut maybe it's not that bad to incorporate lost ones in a casual manner. I think some people get upset that no one even wants to talk about their lost ones, because talking about them helps keep them alive.\n\nMaybe the man was just due for a really good cry about his daughter, and no matter what you said or how you said it it was going to happen. Maybe he needed a catharsis cry because it had been awhile. It sucks for you that you had to be the impetus for it, but try to imagine that on another day maybe he would have been feeling stronger, not due for a cry, and the conversation might have even gone another way... like maybe he would have started chatting about her, or said \"Yeah, I *am* really proud of her.\"\n\nEdit: Also OP, you simply didn't know, and you had only started the conversation to be friendly and kind about the girl whose picture he was carrying around.",
            "> OP: Oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! It's too bad she died! \n\nI absolutely find this hilarious especially if you said it with a shit eating grin.",
            "Bruh. That is rough. I\u2019ve worked in retail - I know getting friendly can backfire.\n\nThe worst instance of this I witnessed actually involved staff instead of customers. We had a new manager who had come from another branch of our retail chain and one of the part timers recognised her from the last store she worked at. They got talking and the part timer remembered the manager had been pregnant and said something to the effect of \u2018when did you have the baby?\u2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s how we all learnt she\u2019d had a late term miscarriage. Baby was basically born but too weak to live and passed away soon after.\n\nThe worst part (where I fucked up) was that I had been out back in the warehouse and had seen none of this go down, so when I walked out onto the shop floor to DEATHLY silence I laughed and said, \u201cJeez, who died?\u201d",

            "One thing many parents of children who passed away miss is people commenting on them and saying things like \"you must be proud of them.\" The man was probably crying because it was both painful and a relief that someone acknowledged his daughter as a real person instead of changing the subject",
            "That man, he loves his daughter. So much. And he is sad that she is no longer in this world. That is understandable. He did not get to cry enough when she died. Given the harsh regime of male conditioning, this is also understandable.  \n\nThen you, a chirpy bright young woman, demonstrated genuine friendship and interest in his life. It showed. He noticed. It reminded him of the hopes and dreams he had for his beautiful daughter. And it showed him that sometime cared.\n\nThis is the perfect storm.  He got to have those feelings, those feelings that were buried deep inside, too painful to look at. It reminded him of the pain he felt when she died, and gave him a chance to heal, a bit more.\n\nThe thing is, you did not cause the hurt. The hurt happened long ago. You inadvertantly gave him room, made it safe enough for him to heal, just a little bit. You brought her to life for just a second, and took him a little way farther down the path of acceptance. \n\nWe all play our part, in healing the people around us. It is unusual that it happens in retail though!\n\nThis is not a fu.

For a few solid months he was my favorite musician, so you can imagine how excited I was when a friend and I were just walking around one summer evening in our small suburban town, only to dimly hear one of my favorite Cat Stevens songs playing in the distance, with the telltale differences that accompany a live performance. \n\nI didn't think it was Cat Stevens himself, mind you, I knew he was Yusuf at that point and kinda past the scene, but there really wasn't any live music venues in my town, so I was still excited to see where this was coming from. \n\nWe tracked it down to a small dentist's office, the front vestibule door wide open, office lights off and a stairwell down brightly lit with the music swelling out as raucous as sweet 60s folk/pop can be.\n\nWe went downstairs and found a small group of greyhaired hippies jamming out, four or five crammed into a small office space playing dated instruments, all smiling brightly as we crouched in, but they kept playing. They finished the song they were on and greeted us, and we talked for a minute about Cat Stevens and that flavor of 60s pop. They seemed cool, and I buckled in for some Grateful Dead or Donovan or something of the ilk, but I didn't recognize the song they started playing. The music got less playful, more somber, and the singer started singing about Jesus. And then kept singing about Jesus. And then more Jesus. \n\nThis was my first and only time robotripping, and as a mildly hallucinating, very recently lapsed Catholic, I didn't take the scene change very well.

        "selftext": "\nThis happened just a few hours ago. Using my actual account because my husband will know it\u2019s me and there\u2019s no way around this embarrassment. Hi sweetie. \n\nOn with the fuck up. It\u2019s my first time voting and I\u2019m dropping off my ballot. I\u2019m thinking about how nice it is that I did my part as a citizen, and oooohhh stickers! I took more than one and I noticed the large circle was about the same size as my areolas. The wheels in my head start to turn. I get home and strip all my clothes off. I\u2019m feeling quite patriotic as I censor my teets with these sticky knockoff nipple covers. \n\nWhile my husband is on the phone, I lift up my bra to show off my work. He makes a face. I know this face. I\u2019m reeling him in. I push a little further. I squeeze them together, wiggle them a little, and do whatever necessary to get the D. He hangs up the phone and gives in to my tempting ways. I start to go down on him for a while. Then I move to give him a taste of what\u2019s underneath the sticker. I start to peel it off. FUUUUCK. \n\nThat shit is STUCK on there. Trying to keep a brave face, I lift it again, but the sticker has latched on to my nipples like a baby. Should I rip it off like a bandaid? Sweet lady liberty NO! Ladies, do not rip anything off your nipples. Actually, take my advice and don\u2019t be stupid enough to put stickers on your nips in the first place. I end up hopping in a hot shower praying they come off. One of them rips in the middle down my nipple. When I pull on both, my nipple is stretch sideways almost bringing me to tears. After taking the time to slowly lift it, it finally comes off. I will now treat them extra special and put oil on them or something. Never again. Not even to get dicked down. \n\nThe foredaddies of this country, would be ashamed.\n\nTLDR; I put I Voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband\u2019s pants. It was painful to remove. Don\u2019t do this no matter how sexy. I regret all of my decisions from the past 2 hours.\n\nEdit: My top post is a fuck up about my boobs lmao! Thank you for my first awards internet friends \ud83d\udc9b\nI would like to address some things. \n1) I\u2019m married, so no I will not send pics of my breasts. I ask kindly that stop messaging me about it. \n2) Believe this story is real or don\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t care less. I know it happened and I don\u2019t need anonymous people on the internet trying to discredit my story. I\u2019m sure lots of you have more important things to do than cry to the mods over this.  \n3) Sorry if my 5 erotic sentences awakened something in you or offended you. I would suggest putting away your torches and pitchforks and moving on. \n4) If people are so adamant on trying this out, fine. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. I used those big red circular stickers in Utah. The O in voted has an image of the state of Utah around it and a checkmark in a box on the bottom. I kept it on for like 20 minutes total and put them on when they were soft and unaroused. I\u2019m not sure how true this is, but i\u2019m pretty sure women have more sensitive, pliable nipples than men. At least that\u2019s the case for my husband and I. Maybe I just have very sensitive nipples. I don\u2019t know. So I don\u2019t think this would work for everyone. Anyways, enjoy. You\u2019ve learned nothing.",

I was up really late because I fucked up and didn\u2019t do this assignment that was due in the morning. \n\nI was starting to get really tired so I decided to get a little hit of caffeine. I went down to the garage because we have an extra fridge there and I grabbed a soda. I walked back to the door to go inside but the door wouldn\u2019t budge. \n\nThis is when I realized I fucked up, because not only did I just lock myself out of the house with no shirt, no keys and no phone. I also failed to remember that my home security system was armed. \n\nRight as I finished that thought: \n\n\u201cWooooOOOOOooo WooooOOOOOooo!\u201d \n\nMy surprisingly loud security system went off (there\u2019s a 30 second delay to allow someone to punch in the security code before it goes off).  I start panicking and trying to force the door open so I can shut the alarm off. I realized that wasn\u2019t gonna work and just started pacing and freaking the fuck out. It took longer than I\u2019m proud of realize that I\u2019m in a garage and I can just open the garage door. \n\nAfter I raised the garage I ran to the front door and... locked. Of course. Fortunately for me though there\u2019s 3 other doors on the side and back of the house that I could get into the house from, unfortunately for me those too were locked. I defaulted back to stress pacing until I decided fuck it, the cops will be here soon and maybe they can help me. Well, I was half right. \n\nI open the side gate and walk back to the front of the house when all the sudden someone screams at me \u201cSTOP! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!\u201d I freeze up in fear because I\u2019m realizing that two cops who are responding to a home invasion are now pointing a gun at me, the weird shirtless guy coming from the backyard. \n\nI complied with their orders and explained that I live here, I just set off the alarm and locked myself out. They looked up the homeowner, my dad, and gave him a call. Needless to say, my dad wasn\u2019t too happy to be receiving a call from the police at 2am asking if the dumbass who locked himself out of his own house was his son. \n\nOnce they were satisfied that I lived there, one officer brought out this device that just sort of popped the door open for me. I thanked them, shut the alarm off, and used the adrenaline coursing through my veins to bust out the remainder of my homework. \n\nTL;DR: I was home alone late at night and got a drink from the garage, not realizing that I locked myself out and that I just set off the alarm. While I was trying to find a way into my house the police showed up and pointed a gun at me, thinking I was trying to break in.",

My wife and I have a built in china cabinet in our home. The kind that's common in 100 year old houses. That's when ours was built. On top of the built in we have 60-70 framed pics of our families and her kids. There is exactly one picture of her and I up there in the mix. One night she was at work and I was home and set the alarm for away on accident. I also stupidly forgot I had set it at all. I was in our bedroom and our dog wanted out. I walked into the dining room to head to the kitchen and tripped a motion sensor. I was pretty quick to shut the alarm off, but missed the call from the alarm company. I was getting ready for bed and turn my ringer off while sleeping. While standing in the backyard the police showed up. Two out front and two out back and all had guns drawn. My dog ran towards them. With my hands up I begged them not to shoot her. She's a big dumb goofy ass loving dog who thought they were there to play with her. I spoke just in time apparently because the cop said he almost shot her. They handcuffed me and brought me through my house to the front porch. I tried explaining to them what had happened and they weren't trying to hear any of it. We had been in the house about 6 months at that point and had previously lived 3 blocks over. When they asked for my ID they again thought I was lying because it still had my old address on it. So I told them to go look at the pictures on the built in and they'd see my wife and I in one of the pictures. One of the officers went in and grabbed the picture bringing it out to the front porch. He asked if it was the picture I was \"claiming\" to be in. Since it was a picture of me and I was super annoyed with the whole situation I made some snide remark. In all fairness I had no beard and shorter hair in the picture but I did tell him exactly where to find the picture. This questions continue for about 10 minutes and they're telling me they're taking me to jail. I was still in handcuffs and I was angry as hell and my attitude probably wasn't helping. The whole time they just kept insisting I was burglarizing the house. Finally I told them to call my wife and she could verify I was in fact allowed to be in my own home. They asked her to come home to see if she could identify me. She's freaking out thinking something's happened to me and flies home. She gets there and they don't ask for her ID or anything. She explained it was obviously all mistake. They uncuff me and tell me next time to be more careful. No apology. No nothing. Spent an hour dealing with them in cuffs and it cost my wife her job. She told her immediate supervisor she was leaving but not her actual boss. Her supervisor gave her permission and vouched for her but it didn't matter because of the zero tolerance policy. She'd never been late or written up. Shitty night for both of us over a serious misunderstanding.",

A bit awkward at first but she's good company and passed the awkward stage within two days.\n\nYah so I woke up this morning and my fianc\u00e9e wasn't in bed but I could hear the shower in our bathroom. Feeling a bit frisky, I decided to join her and maybe play around a bit. Got fully naked and ready to go. I opened the door and the speakers in the bathroom were playing music and then it hit me. Maybe I should tiptoe in and seductively start kissing from behind like in the movies. It looks hot there so maybe it'll be the same in real life right? So I stealthily made it into the shower and wrapped my arms around 'my fianc\u00e9e'. When she screamed I just started laughing (second wrong move) and said in a deep voice, \"it's just me baby\" and tried again. It was only when she shouted my name and told me to get the fuck out I realized that it was actually her mother. Since I'm a slow idiot, I just stood there for about 5 seconds just staring at her as she covered herself before apologizing and running out.\n\nI'm sitting in my car in the garage right now typing this and I still don't know where my fianc\u00e9e is or why the fuck her mother was showering in our private bathroom instead of the house bathroom. So that's my life right now and I don't know how I'll live through this.\n\nTl;dr I woke up and thought I should join my fianc\u00e9e in the shower but it turned out to be her mother. My life is over.\n\nEDIT: I didn't realize it wasn't my fianc\u00e9e sooner because the both of them literally look like sisters. Her mother doesn't age at all and they share the same hair color and body type(for lack of a better word).\n\nUPDATE: After spending the past hours across the street with my friend building up confidence, I finally went back home and found both of them sitting on the couch. I first went up to kiss my fiance and greet her but she sort of turned her cheek as I came (I was bloody sweating bricks at this point) and said something around the lines of \"So my mother says you two had quite the morning\". *Holy shit*, I can't even explain how scared I was since they both looked serious so I just started explaining my side of the story. When all was said, they both kind of looked at each other then broke into laughter. Apparently her en suite's shower had terrible pressure this morning so my fiance said she could try ours.\n\nSo basically we're back in the awkward phase and her mother can barely look me in the eye and though my fiance says she's fine with it and understands, I can tell she's a bit angry/disturbed by the fact her mother and we saw each other naked and also that I didn't realize it wasn't her soon. Needless to say I'll never surprise my fiance in the shower ever again.",

We live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. \n\nWhen they\u2019re young we tell them Santa brings every boy and girl a present on Halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he\u2019d leave in exchange. \n\nWhen the kids get old enough to realize Santa is a hoax, that\u2019s when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. \n\nDid this with our oldest two and it worked great. They\u2019d give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. \n\nOur third child is 8 this year so called us out on the Santa thing. We explained the new deal. \n\nHe said \u201cSo then it\u2019s my money and I can buy *whatever* I want with it? A new skateboard even? *Anything*?\u201d \u201cYou bet.\u201d \u201cSwear?\u201d \u201cYep.\u201d \n\nHe goes and brings us **all** his candy. Even every Kit Kat, his favorite. I was shocked, but he\u2019d been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must\u2019ve decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. \n\nGetting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 I\u2019d spent all week. \n\nNext day I brought the candy to work. Then we went to Walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. We met at the check out. \n\nThere\u2019s my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred Kit Kats for $10.00. \n\nI started to tell him to put it back, but he said \u201cWhat? You said I could buy *whatever* I wanted! You swore! I want my candy back then.\u201d \n\nHis candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. And I did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. \n\nSo... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. \n\nI don\u2019t know who\u2019s more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. \n\n*tl;dr I bought my son\u2019s Halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. He spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for all these awards!",

        "selftext": "A few days ago I (28m) got an email from my ex gf (25) with the subject line: \"I did it thanks to you!\". The email had an attachment. The attachment was a manuscript. The manuscript was an autobiography written by my ex gf. The title of the autobiography instantly took me back to the time when my ex gf and I were still dating. \n\nI was sexually inexperienced back in those days whereas my ex gf had more than enough sexual experience. We enjoyed talking about past relationships and what the sex was like. It was never \"a thing\" in our relationship. Just casual conversation. My ex gf had more stories to tell and all of them were entertaining. I remember joking about how she should someday write a book. We laughed, made love, and a few months later, our relationship came to an end. It was sad, but alas, life continued. \n\nWe're now back in the present. I finished reading the manuscript an hour ago. There were 72 chapters. Each chapter was about an individual person my ex gf had known sexually. No real names were mentioned. Only character labels. Like The Surfer, The Biker, The Jock, The Older Man, etc. Some of the stories and \"characters\" I actually remembered based on the details my ex gf shared with me during our relationship. Others were totally new. But new or not, it was fun to read. Until I made it to Chapter 39. My chapter. \"The Turtle\". \n\nKeep in mind, all the sexual partners my ex gf mentioned in her manuscript had something specific about them that made the sex memorable for her. For example, The Surfer always smelled like the ocean, which never failed to turn her on. The Biker had gang tattoos from the neck down, but the one tattoo that always made her rip his clothes off was his pet hamster tattoo. Then there was me. A guy who couldn't swim, let alone surf, no tattoos, and with practically zero sexual experience at the time. What was so memorable about me? \n\nWell, according to my chapter, the answer was my \"adorably small penis\". My ex gf described how she had almost forgotten what it felt like NOT to choke during oral, before she met me. She compared my penis to the head of a baby turtle, thus my chapter and character name. Based on what I was reading, not only did I have the smallest penis compared to all the other people she's dated, but I also had the only penis that somehow managed to look \"too innocent\" for sex. \n\nIt didn't come across as if my ex gf was purposefully trying to insult me, but come on, I think most people can understand what a sensitive topic penis size can be to any guy who's not hung like a horse. I still need to contact my ex gf and provide my feedback, but I'm gonna need some time to process what I read. It's not every day someone writes a book about your small dick. Welcome back, insecurities I didn't think I would have at this age. \n\nTL:DR Jokingly encouraged my ex gf to write a book about her adventurous sex life when we were still together. She wrote a manuscript years later and recently sent it to me. To my surprise (and horror), I was in said manuscript, and so was my \"adorably small penis\".",

        "selftext": "Standard not today, but 4 yrs ago.\n\nSo when my wife and i first started dating (7yrs now) she was fairly naive to the world. She grew up in a strict southern Baptist environment and was never allowed to date, watch certain things, etc. etc.\n\nShe moved out of her parent's house in 2013 at 21yrs old. I met her 7 yrs ago on oct. 28th. We started talking and messaging each other things fairly quickly and getting frisky. \n\nNow I've never done this with anyone else, but because she was very innocent to various pop culture references i decided to give it a try. During one of our early make out sessions... without knowing a lick of french aside from Dexter's Labratory (yes my dear reader we are going there.) I proceded to whisper the phrase \"omelette du fromage\" into her ear... this turned her on immensely.\n\nSo for 3 solid years this went on until I F'd Up and told her what the phrase meant... ever since then i've regretted telling her (and she never thought to look it up) because i always got a kick out of it.\n\nomelette du fromage = cheese omelette \n\nMarried for 6 years this past June so i did something right!\n\nTL:DR - For 3 solid years my girlfriend and then wife got weak in the knees to me whispering cheese omelette into her ear because she had no clue what \"omelette du fromage\" actually meant.\n\n---------------------------------edit-line----------------------------------------\n\nEdit: forgot to add that she in fact HATES cheese.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for all the laughs and first awards lol. My wife and i are both laughing because we've held off on posting this, but it's a hilarious story.\n\nEdit3: I've only seen a few (2-3) nay sayers. I can fully assure you that this is infact true. It's still hilarious to this day that i managed to go for so long and give her the feels by using a cheesy line ;)... did i mention we have 2 kids? So dad joke included at no extra charge.\n\nEdit4: I am aware it's not actually omelette du fromage. However it's parodied from Dexter's Laboratory as i have stated above. I implore you to google or youtube omelette du fromage, and you will be enlightened.\n\nEdit5: elvisharchercrafts is indeed my wife. Prior to today she has never been on reddit. \n\n* she did not create her profile to drum up business, we are both horrible at naming so she just used her business page.\n* I do own a business myself, but i believe it would go against TOS to go into detail on that despite the fact that I'd love to drum up business.\n* If it is against tos I'll delete because ive had a couple people ask. --- I do credit card processing and 100% elimnate fees for the merchant privately owned and large to keep them afloat, especially these days.\n\nElvisharcher and myself did not anticipate the huge interest of this story. It's been fun! Sadly i don't think i have many other funny stories that come to mind. I'm glad it brought a smile to quite a few of y'all!",

I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in \"bad dad\" mode when she sees me this weekend.

If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.\n\nCut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: \n\n*\"You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?\"* \n\n*\"Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... \"* \n\nMy old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last.

He has lost about a hundred pounds so I thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  I said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  He responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  We aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which I was completely expecting as I awkwardly stood in the hallway.  \n\nWhen I got back into my office I brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  My office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  \n\nTL;DR I enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer.",

I already was thin my whole life and weigh around 100 pounds. I lost nearly 20 from the B symptoms. I tried to hide it but I took my baggy sweatshirt off one day. \n\nThe rumor mill started that I had an eating disorder. That made me mad. Finally a supervisor leaked I was sick with cancer and then everyone knew my secret. Nothing was ever said about my weight again. \n\nI wasn't mad at them because of the cancer being the reason, just the petty office gossip about me having an eating disorder. When strangers talk about my weight I tell them it is because of lymohoma and they shut up so fast and you can see them mentally looking for a black hole to hide in. I always tell them it's fine and they didn't know, but perhaps telling people you don't know to eat a cheeseburger to gain weight isn't wise because you never know why someone is so thin.",

I had a bit of a stomach 'thing' going on. But I didn't want to call off so early in my employment.... so I took a big slurp of Pepto Bismol and went in.\n\nThe first half of the shift went fine. And, though I was a still queasy, I was alright. I was learning how to help the residents with meals, recreation, and all their daily functions.\n\nMy manager told me it was time to learn how to help them with bathroom functions. And that one of the residents, a 92 year old woman named \"Georgia\" needed to be changed. I gulped, but was ready. The residents needed help with this, and I'd provide the help.\n\nMy manager brought me into Georgia's room. She was lying on her bed, awake and smiling. My manager said: \"Georgia, we're here to change you. \"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said: \"That's nice.\"\n\nManager said: \"I know you've not been feeling well, Georgia. is today any better?\"\n\nGeorgia smiled and said \"That's nice.\" My manager told me this is the only thing Georgia EVER said.\n\nMy boss lead me through the process of getting Georgia's pants off. The smell intensified. My stomach burbled. We opened Georgia's disposable adult undergarment.\n\nYeah. Georgia WAS NOT feeling well. Georgia had horible, volcanic diareahha. Georgia had messed herself. And the mess had creeped around to AND INTO her front.\n\nMy boss began the cleaning. Showing me how to gently clean the resident. She had me put my gloves on and told me I was to finish cleaning Georgia. At this point, my stomach was NOT doing well. But I was determined. The residents needed me.\n\nGloves on, wet wipes in hand. Cleaning Georgia's outsides was managable. I was queasy, but it was managable. Then my boss pointed out I was not done. That, some of the diareahha had gone into Georgia's vagina. And I would have to clean that out.\n\nI should mention at this point that I am a gay man. And that this was my very first experience with a vagina. And, while I'm totally vagina-positive... and not adversant.... I was not prepared to deal with a brown liquid filled vagina. Not when I was dealing with nausea.\n\nI vomited. I know I should have felt it coming and turned away. But I didn't. The vomit happened suddenly and withouyt warning. And it went onto and into her vagina.\n\nGeorgia just smiled and said:  \"That's nice.\"\n\nMy boss then said something for which I will always be grateful. Even though her lips were pursed and I could tell she was disgusted and upset, she only said: \"If you're vomiting, you need to go home. Now. I'll take care of this.\"\n\nI took off my gloves. I went home. I went back the next day and gifted my boss with a bunch of candy bars.\n\nEpilogue: I'm still working there. I've not vomited into any more vaginas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr:  If you're sick, stay home.",

Stewardess was Laotian and she and started flirting so we went back in to the rear cabin and slipped in to the bathroom. Mile high club, you know? Well, I was performing oral on her while she was on the sink spread eagle and I noticed that the last person didn't flush the toilet. I just puked right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\".\n\nAnother time I was in rural Alabama. I had recently purchased a pick up truck in Florida for about 1000 dollars and was driving westward. Out of a prank, my friends painted \"Man Love Rules\" in pink on the side of my truck. We stopped to get gas and while I was giving my friend a jump in his caddy this big fat woman came rambling out of the station asking if we are gay and want to get beaten up. Well, that did it. My friend held her down in the back of the pick up and I started to pleasure her orally. Then, in the bright sun, clear sky, I vomited right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\". \n\nBack when I was heavily in to using meth, I was walking to my car in an alley way and a heroin addict woman jumped out of the trash can. She said something to the effect \"I'm really sick, I'll suck your dick for dollars, I need a fix\". So I figured why not get serious? I told her I'd pay her five dollars to get but naked and sit on the dumpster. I got close to the garbage and that nasty beaver and you know what? I vomited right in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\". \n\nOne time I was buying lottery tickets, those scratch of kinds you know? Wow, I won $1 million. I'm already a millionaire so I figured I could give this to some loser. So what better place than Walmart? I go into Walmart and I see this fat loser with his family and I walk up to him and said \"would you like this million dollar lottery ticket\". Dude starts all crying and thanking me but ten I tear up the lottery ticket in front of him. He starts cussing at me and threatening to fight. Well, that did it. I turned away walked several steps. He took a swing at me so I round house kicked him to the chest. His fat wife was coming at me so I took out my knife and said \"Watch out for falling prices\" and threw the knife at a sign above her head and it crashed in to her skull. He moo moo was hiked up so you know what? I vomited in her vagina and she said \"that's nice\".",

        "selftext": "I (38M) am in the process of a high- conflict divorce. 5 years in the making after 8 years married. \n5 months ago I met a wonderful woman, she has been very understanding with the situation with my soon to be ex and kids. We\u2019ve put off sleeping over since I was still living with my wife in our house. A couple of weeks ago, the court ordered my wife to move out and we now exchange the kids every week. This was her week with the kids and my girlfriend and I decided to finally have a sleepover.\n\nThroughout the whole divorce process I have been having trouble sleeping, and have been taking sleeping pills on and off for the past 6 months. This week was particularly hard with the kids out of the house and by Thursday I had had a total 10 hours of sleep. So I go to the pharmacy to get sleeping pills. My girlfriend has already warned me she is a light sleeper and has a strict schedule of going to sleep at 10pm. So I want our first night to go well with no disturbance from me. Secondly, my experience has taught me that I need at least 3 sleeping pills to feel the effects and even then they take a few hours to kick in. Granted, I\u2019ve never used this particular brand but I trust my experience, given that I\u2019m 115kg and 2,01m and don\u2019t drink or take drugs, it might be that I\u2019m just not that responsive to sleeping agents.\n\nSo I get to her house after a tough day in the office where I had to let go of staff. I\u2019m sleep deprived and emotionally exhausted.\nWe order pizza and salad and when it arrives we sit down to eat. It\u2019s around 7pm, so I decide to take the pills then so they would have time to do their thing. We get through the salad, and by the time we get to the pizza I\u2019m starting to feel woozy. By the end of the meal, I can\u2019t see straight, its difficult to form sentences and I\u2019m experiencing very strong hiccups. \n\nMy girlfriend sits me on the couch and rubs my back to help with the hiccups, and within 20 minutes they\u2019re gone. She helps me brush my teeth and helps me into bed. It\u2019a just after 8pm and she jumps in the bed with me and rubs my back and arms until I\u2019m asleep.\n\nNext thing I know, I feel a fart coming on and just let it rip. As you can guess, it was a trick my sphincter was playing on my sleeping-pill-soaked brain and I go on to make a deposit of loose change in my underpants. I jump out of the bed and run to the bathroom. I try to quietly clean up and long story short, I go through a roll of toilet paper and ruin two hand towels and the little carpet by the toilet in the process. I get out of the bathroom and run into my very worried girlfriend pacing the hallway. I tell her what happened and she bursts out laughing, tells me not to worry and after assuring me I didn\u2019t shit the bed as well, puts me back to sleep. \n\nI woke up this morning to a clean bathroom, laundered towels and underwear AND a fresh cup of coffee. She\u2019s a keeper :)\n\nLesson: not all sleeping pills are equal, some  come with added sharts. \n\nTLDR- underestimated strength and side effects of sleeping pills and shat myself on first sleepover with new girlfriend",

I'm sure  they will. I know it's none of my business and I'm not saying to do anything straight away, but start thinking of an exit plan for the pills.

            "Keep her. My husband was divorced with 3 kids, 30 years old, and trying to get sober after getting out of jail after his ex pressed charges against him for writing a check on their joint account. He was a mess. Now, we're celebrating 14 years married this year, have 4 kids of our own, he's 11 years sober, and I still couldn't imagine myself with anyone else. He definitely wasn't what I thought I'd find, but he was it. I had no choice in the matter \ud83d\ude0a .. I hope you get some sleep soon. Insomnia is a bitch I know all too well myself. Good luck to you!\n\nEdit i mean 3 kids. We have 3 kids of our own lol.",
            "I have a similar story.  I (36M) was married for 8 years and have now been divorced for 4.  I finally started dating a couple of years ago and met this beautiful girl on Bumble.  Everything is going great!  Similar interests, great chemistry, yada yada yada.   Everything was awesome.  So awesome, I was eventually invited to sleep over at her place.  \n\nSo a little backstory.  I have suffered from nose bleeds my entire life.  They can just randomly pop up out of the blue so I have to always be ready for one.  Kleenex in my pockets at all times.  It\u2019s a pain in the butt, but I\u2019ve gotten used to it over the years.  \n\nYou see where this is going...\n\nWe inevitably end up in her bedroom, sans clothing, and things began getting a little frisky.  At one point, I was, uhh...on top.  I\u2019m looking into her eyes thinking \u201cWhy does this beautiful woman even like me?\u201d when it happened.   And not just a little drop either.   All over her face.  A little on the eye.  Some in her hair.  A lot on her freshly washed sheets.  Good times. \n\nWell, it was fun while it lasted.  I run to the bathroom, apologizing along the way as blood is dripping down my face.  I clean myself off and after what seemed like an eternity, nervously walk back into the room.  She had apparently cleaned herself up in the downstairs bathroom, and was in the process of removing her blood stained sheets.  When she saw me, she smiled and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do a whole lot worse than that to get rid of me!\u201d  Somehow, she was not turned off after getting a shower of schnozzle ichor! We even finished the deed!  \n\nWe got engaged last year and are still going strong.   \n\nDon\u2019t let yours get away!",

My son was with grandma and I finally cut loose. \n\nThe first morning we woke up in the resort, I ran to the bathroom and had the most violently upsetting diarrhea of my life. There was no muffling the sounds. I emerged and found him gone. I felt so embarrassed, and also queasy. He returned five minutes later with two ginger ales and pepto from the resort shop. He then ran into the bathroom to be sick as well. \n\nAfter four years and many poops later, we\u2019re still together.",

            "She is truly a keeper!\n\nHowever, I would highly recommend you to be careful with the sleeping pills or any other medicine you take in a new environment that is not your usual one. Your body builds up resistance to drugs and medicines, but these are depended on the CONTEXT you take them AKA the room, the time, the temperature, etc. When your body is in the familiar environment, it will adequate its internal chemistry to match the expected dosis. However, when an unfamiliar environment, you are in high alert mode, which means that the internal chemistry and response is different, so if you take the same dosis, your body will react completely different.  There has been studies that have found out that a huge amount of overdose cases (from various substances) did not ingest a higher dose necessarily, but received the dose in an unfamiliar place, so their body was not prepared to deal with it like it normally did. This is why we hear of a lot of overdoses in hotels, from people who took their usual meds plus sleeping pills because they knew they did not sleep well away from home.\n\nHope this tip helps people!! Stay safe people!",

You have a monster of a pre-loaded flatulence, prepared for launch... Your bare buttocks against this chair will add, the finest resonance to your flatulence......\" So, I took a deep breath, flexed my abs, gripped the seat beneath me to affix my bum firmly to the wood...... And pushed.... \n\nInstantly I realized \"TIFU\" as the gaseous exchange quickly felt more like a liquid one..... I squeezed cheek and penguin waddled my way to the bathroom, as quick as waddling allows.  As I sat on my porcelain throne, my love could not contain the laughter, while I explained my dilemma. I inquired as to whether or not I had left any of the exchange behind in my mad dash to the potty, and was reassured that my clenching had been sufficient... I got lucky\n\nFor another 10 minutes I attempted to expell the remainder of my treacherous BM. But alas it was just coming out in spurts.

If you are able to go without them and don\u2019t have some untreatable disease that prevents you from sleeping it\u2019s not worth the troubles. Funny enough I had a very similar story of pissing all over myself at my gfs house on sleeping pills which I believe were either Valium or zolpidem or something. I\u2019d gotten the pills from her because she got prescribed for insomnia. She never did drugs or drank alcohol but ended up getting addicted to them and could only function on them, not only taking them for sleep but also just to go about her day. She became violent and suicidal for a week when she ran out after taking more than her dose and not being able to pick up the next prescription early. Come to find out most \u201csleeping pills\u201d that actually make you feel sleepy and whatnot are 100% narcotic drugs and are sold on the streets with high value and are in the same class of drugs as xanax. Anyway these drugs do work for some conditions but are often prescribed for people who are able to treat and suppress their symptoms without the need of drugs.",

I'm about your size, and not a doctor, but have GI issues and sometimes need to sleep through pain and anxiety.  Risk factor for shart-fest is minimal with Ambien/Zolpidem and/or \\*moderate\\* use of benzos in my professionally-supervised experience.

Normally, during a cover lesson im a lot more relaxed since the work is usually simple and the kids know it's just trying to fill the hour. I got chatting with a couple of students about reddit and talked about a post I'd made which i thought was fairly ambiguous and buried, and totally SFW anyway. The students i was talking to were two lads, both around 14 or 15 and both pretty nice kids, who i have a good relationship with. Little did i know, one of them would go all super sleuth and track down the post. It must've taken him ages, since the post was at least 4 months old at this point, and my username contained nothing related to anything i could be identified by. A couple of days later, i see one of the lads on the corridor, and he says \"what would you if you were a girl for a day, sir?\". At first,i have no idea what he's talking about, but then his smirk helps the horror melt into my brain. A day or two previous i had rather immaturely answered that question on askreddit with \"fingerblast myself into oblivion\". After a mad dash across the school to the staffroom, which is the only place in the school that i get signal, my reddit account was no more.\n\nTL;DR - I idiotically gave a student an in to finding my reddit, which he found, then cleverly teased me with a pretty immature and vulgar post I'd made a couple days previous, resulting in the end of my reddit account with all my sweet sweet internet points.\n\nEdit: thanks for the awards and reimbursing my lost sweet sweet internet points.

He unfortunately didn\u2019t let us use the name.\n\nOther names that myself and my friends thought up during the year include: \u201cSeamen in the Middle Passage\u201d, \u201cRougher Riders of Teddy\u2019s Stick\u201d, and \u201cCarter\u2019s Nuts\u201d. IIRC only the first and last ones did he actually let teams use.\n\nIf anyone is wondering, \u201cSlick Willy\u201d was one of Bill Clinton\u2019s nicknames and the bastard republicans made Jimmy Carter divest from his peanut farm when he became president (how times have changed).",

        "selftext": "So this is an old story, from when I was about 11, so somewhere in the early 2000's. I was working on my homework in my room, when suddenly an unrelated question came to mind. Considering my dad is pretty knowledgeable I decide to ask him for the answer. I walk into the living room where my parents are watching television. Since this is before you could simply pause your show, or at least before that technology was common, I decide to ask my dad if its okay to interrupt his show, thinking he would tell me to wait till a commercial or something.\nMe: \"Dad, is it okay if I ask you a question?\"\nMy dad stiffens and slowly turns his head to look at me. He looks a bit pale and stricken, \"W-what?\"\nMe: \"I was wondering, if you aren't busy, if I can ask you a question?\"\nDad: \"Uh, yeah... just... go wait in my room.\"\nI happily go to my parents bedroom, the only other room with a TV, and turn it on as I wait.\n\nThis next part is my mom's perspective, which she shared with me years later. She was still focused on the show, unaware of my dad and I's conversation, when the TV suddenly turns off. She looks at my dad in confusion and asks whats going on. Without looking at her, he says in a shaky breath, \"Our son has... questions.\" She eventually figures that my dad believes I want to ask him about sex, and that he has to give me the 'sex talk'. They spend a few minutes discussing what to talk to me about, and preparing for whatever questions I might have. She bolsters his confidence and sends him off to talk to me.\n\nI'm watching TV in my parent's room, completely unaware of what's about to happen. My dad enters, turns off the TV, and rigidly sits on the bed next to me. He clears his throat, \"Well, son, what questions do you have for me?\"\nMe: \"Okay, well, are there #1 pencils? They always say 'use a #2 pencil' at school, but I've never heard of any other number. Do they exist, and how are they different?\" \nMy dad slumps over onto his knees. He stares at the floor for a solid 30 seconds of silence. Finally, he takes in a deep breath and sits back up and answers my question. (For those who are curious it has to do with the quality/softness of the graphite in the pencil.)\nMe: \"Okay, cool, thanks dad.\" I stand up to leave, but he puts a hand on my shoulder to sit back down. \"Wait a minute, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about.\"\nHe proceeds to give me the 'sex talk'. It wasn't anything overtly graphic, focusing mostly on puberty and biological changes I can expect. But it comes so out of left-field for me that I am completely bowled over. He finishes talking and asks me, \"So, do you have anymore questions for me?\". I reply \"No, no more questions\" as i shuffle back to my room. I sit down at my desk and stare at the pencil that started this, while I can hear my mom's cackling laughter in the living room as my dad tells her what happened.\n\nTLDR: Asked my dad a question about pencils, got the sex talk as a bonus.",

They\u2019re in an after school program in elementary school and 2 years ago they started asking me questions about things they\u2019d heard from 5th graders at the time. So.... unlike my parents, I decided to give my boys an unsolicited lesson on everything related to sex. This is your penis.... when you become aroused you get an erection. Females have vaginas and fallopian tubes with eggs that can be fertilized by semen from your testicles If you stick your penis in their vaginas. I used their artsy eazel from ikea to illustrate it all.... They were grossed out at the time but now they know and they refer to their reproductive organs as penises and know girls have vaginas. Not that difficult a discussion when they\u2019re young. Don\u2019t put it off. Be a parent and tell them all about it yourself or risk having them learn about it from some random kid.",

            "Funny story. Wholesome.\n\nSpeaking as a parent, they really should have had that talk with you before 11 years old. It's also not really one talk, but a series of talks as kids grow and ask questions.\n\nI mean, you were 11 before they explained puberty? I was shaving at that age. My folks explained things to me at probably 5 or 6, but not in graphic detail. It was in response to my questions.\n\nNot sure exactly how old you are now, but I'm assuming 25-30? If so, and you're preparing to have kids, please remember that they can find all sorts of information, honest or not, online or at school. You do them no favors by withholding any information.\n\nMy wife and I have had multiple conversations with our daughter, who is only seven. It's come in stages. At four she kinda put two and two together and asked my wife to confirm if babies exited their mother through the vagina.\n\nThen at five or six she asked me to explain how \"the seed\" gets from the man to the woman. I told her that I had to go to work and she had school, but that I would sit down with her and her mom afterwards and we would explain it to her. She decided that she didn't want to hear it. After two more times of this she explained that for whatever reason, she didn't want her mom around for this talk, but wanted me and me alone to explain it all.\n\nSo we did. She asked straight up \"Is it private parts?\" I told her that it was. She asked \"Do you rub them together?\" Yup. And that's all she wanted to know. I made sure to tell her that if she had any more questions to come to us and not to seek it out from anyone else. Also repeated to her what she'd been told before, about privacy and safety.\n\nThe point of this is that while it's funny to think about how nervous parents can get about this, we have to remember that its the health and safety of our kids at stake. Natural, normal curiosity and questions that we can choose to answer ourselves or let kids come across who knows what on their own.",

About 10 minutes later I'm playing Starcraft or whatever and my dad uncharacteristically knocks softly on my door and comes in and asks to sit on the bed next to him. I oblige and he's like \"Son... What you saw me and your mother doing... That's called sex.\" I'm trying not to facepalm and saying \"dad, I know\" but he won't take the hint or back down. \"You don't know everything-\" and proceeds to very academically explain the ins-and-outs of the 'ins-and-outs' in painstaking detail.\n\nSo in the end it's a \"good talk son\" and me sitting there wondering in what world my dad grew up thinking this whole time that I didn't have the slightest idea how the human reproductive process worked at sixteen. I have a feeling he walked out of that room and breathed a relaxed sigh of relief with the knowledge that he had done a good dad job.

        "selftext": "My wife has extremely sensitive skin and she has always\u00a0struggled\u00a0with it. I've never cared about her having acne despite her being really\u00a0insecure\u00a0about it. She has seen\u00a0countless\u00a0dermatologists and other\u00a0professionals\u00a0trying to get rid of it to no avail.\n\nWe have a small drying rack thing for our cleaning sponge in our bathroom.\u00a0It's where\u00a0a\u00a0square\u00a0cleaning sponge is kept and it's used to\u00a0quickly\u00a0clean the counters and mirrors if needed. Pretty\u00a0handy\u00a0right? My wife got it for us, she is so awesome coming up with these things.\u00a0\n\nWell I was in the bathroom today and saw that my wife had bought a new cleaning sponge. But it was a super weird egg shaped sponge. I found this\u00a0eggsponge\u00a0hilarious and asked my wife why she would get such a weird shaped sponge and not just a normal square one. She told me it would be easier to use than the old one to put makeup on.\n\nWhat. My wife uses our cleaning sponge for makeup. I don't understand. She saw the confusion on my face and asked me what's wrong. I asked her why she would use our cleaning sponge for her face.\n\nI don't know anything about makeup. Did you know that people who wear makeup use a sponge to spread the makeup on their face? Well I didn't. But now I do, my wife made sure to explain that to me very carefully.\n\nI\u00a0had used\u00a0my wifes makeup sponge for cleaning. She used that same sponge on her face and we believe that\u00a0that's\u00a0the reason for her\u00a0reacuring\u00a0acne. The wife is not happy and I feel horrible.\u00a0\nI asked her why was it on a drying rack and not in her makeup bag. To let it dry out after use obviously. She\u00a0didn't\u00a0want any bacteria growing on the moist sponge which could happen if she left it in her bag. Great thinking! If only I didn't make it a nest for bacteria by cleaning with it.\n\nI went out and bought her a bunch of new sponges all different shapes and sizes, but not the square ones. I hope she can forgive my dumbass soon.\u00a0\n\nTldr; My wife has acne she can't get rid of. I had accidentally used her makeup sponge to clean the bathroom for years. She has used that same sponge on her face and we believe that has caused her acne. I am an idiot\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the\u00a0skin care\u00a0advice and kind words. I'll be sure to tell my wife about it all. I'm\u00a0definitely\u00a0going to have to buy more than just sponges for her so thanks for all the suggestions too. To answer a few\u00a0questions\u00a0that keep getting asked: My wife likes her privacy while using the bathroom when she gets\u00a0ready\u00a0in the morning. She doesn't use make up that\u00a0often\u00a0because apparently\u00a0that's\u00a0bad for her face. So I've never really seen her using her makeup sponge or then I've been too\u00a0absent-minded\u00a0to notice. I guess I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. The makeup sponge I had mistaken as a cleaning sponge was a square one. They come in sheets and you just take one square piece out of it, honestly just like you would take out a cleaning sponge.\u00a0Thats\u00a0the best explanation I have for them I hope that makes it more clear.",

My mind is reeling at this.",
            "This reminds me of a roommate situation I had. Shared house with one female and one male. We shared a bathroom and generally left our shower stuff in the shower. I bought this handmade charcoal soap for acne which was left on a rack at the side of the shower, now we never had an issue with someone using our stuff if they run out but soap is generally a no go. Anyway the male roommate got his first tattoo and I was showing him how I always cleaned mine. I always used a gentle soap to lightly clean the area before moisturising and when I showed him it he said \"ew why would you use ball soap,\" (considering he was the only one with balls I don't know how he decided that this was it's function). We discovered that the soap I was using to clean my face, he was using to clean his balls. Soap never lived in the shower again in that house.",
            "I'm not really that well versed in makeup products, but if a tiny weird looking sponge mysteriously appears in our bathroom I'm gonna ask my wife about it first before using it to clean the sink. If I didn't buy a thing and my wife doesn't tell me about the thing, I'm not touching it. Just like food in the fridge. If I didn't put it there and my wife doesn't say I can eat it, I'm not gonna eat it.",
            "I gasp so loud reading this, my husband asked what was up. After reading it to him, he gasped. (he's bought me my far share of beauty blenders) the one silver lining in all of this is, honestly good on you for keeping the bathroom tidy. I know it doesn't seem much considering, but it all came from a good place. Maybe just make sure you both agree to keep bathroom cleaning supplies in a little carry all tucked away in a spot in the bathroom from here on out.

Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don\u2019t feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. \n\nSo I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in \u2018women\u2019 and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot. I\u2019m not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn\u2019t figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think \u201cwow short hair must be the new thing\u201d or \u201cso many bisexuals on here\u201d but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...\u201dhow long ago did you transition?\u201d I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That\u2019s when it all came together and I realized I\u2019ve been swiping on lesbians the entire time.\n\nTldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole.\n\nEDIT: I AM NOT 13 YEARS OLD, THAT\u2019S WHEN I MADE A FACEBOOK.

But if y\u2019all do, then you\u2019re smart. \n\nThis has only happened once to me but after this happened... I\u2019ll just say, I learned my motherfucking lesson and it ain\u2019t happening again. Those titles can be a bit UN-DESCRIPTIVE as HELL apparently and I\u2019m about to tell y\u2019all why I now have god damn trust issues. \n\nI was at home relaxing and missing my man because he was at work and I was horny. So I did what anyone would do in that situation and pulled out the old iPad/vibrator combo and started scanning for hot videos. I watched a good bit of videos. Some good, some boring. But all were fine, ya know? until this one video... this one video. I won\u2019t go into full detail on what all was in it but all you need to know for now is there was anal in it. I clicked this video bc it had a very generic title like \u201chardcore anal session with petite blonde Susie floozy\u201d (not the exact name but u get the point) and a generic thumbnail. \n\nSo, ya know, I was expecting a generic video. Either way I\u2019m already close at this point and need to let it rip. \n\nIt was normal, at first. and I was getting into it. I was ready to GO. You know when you\u2019re in that perfect spot like a few moments from when you\u2019re about to cum? Where nothing matters to you at all except what you are doing right the fuck now? The house could catch on fire and your ass ain\u2019t moving till you finish? You aren\u2019t mad at anything in the world. Perfect bliss and desperation. Yea, that\u2019s where I was at.\n\nUntil it happened... that fateful moment when my orgasm became Game Of Thrones. It started out amazing and then it was taken away and quickly ruined for good. \n\nAs this pornstar is getting piled-drived into oblivion over the couch....... \n\nshe. starts. shitting herself. \n\nA lot. Everywhere. And a lot. And did I mention it was EVERYWHERE?? OR that she was shitting herself?? I froze dead in my tracks in shock and then I became even more shocked when the guy KEPT GOING... He liked it...... He started saying shit like \u201cMm oh damn baby you couldn\u2019t hold it in could you?\u201d \n\n...\n\nI closed my iPad fast as hell and just sat there, cold, and dead inside. Winter had come, but not me. There was no chance it was coming back either, not after that. \n\nSo Pornhub- There is no need to trick a bitch. When the kink is that extreme, put it in the title ffs. \n\nAnd lastly, my fellow Redditors- check the god damn tags/description on a porn next time you\u2019re watching it. Also make sure to exit that shit out before your boyfriend gets home so he doesn\u2019t use your iPad and then be scared to touch you for a week bc he thinks you wanna shit on his dick. \n\n(TIFU update: first off, I don\u2019t have a link guys, I\u2019m sorry :( \nsecondly, I\u2019m sorry I said \u201callot\u201d lol, I\u2019m illiterate and had no idea that was improper until I saw the comments so thank you to those of you who brought it to my attention. \nAnd finally, how tf did this blow up like it did?? I honestly expected this to be taken down when I posted it, I sure as hell didn\u2019t expect 38k upvotes. You guys rock, thank you for the upvotes!)\n\nTLDR: I tried to relax and watch porn, but didn\u2019t properly check the tags and ended up pranking myself with shit porn, killing an orgasm and then making my boyfriend think I wanted to shit on him.",

Yeah I get it I was a dumb kid, you don\u2019t need to remind me.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a very curious person and have procured information that I often will never need. One of the best ways to gain knowledge is to ask questions, so I do, A lot. Sometimes it\u2019s for the better, often it\u2019s for the worse.\n\nlets cut to the chase.\n\nin third grade, there were 4 classes, one of these had two teachers, one for the morning, and one for the afternoon. The one we will be speaking about today is my afternoon teacher. her name was Mrs. \u201cVirgin\u201d\n\nat The time, I thought a \u201cVirgin\u201d was someone originally from the Virgin Island, if you are from America, You\u2019re American. If you\u2019re from Canada you are Canadian. Britian? British. Makes sense right? So when I thought about her name, curiosity got the best of me. So I waddled up to my teacher blissfully unaware and stated the dire inquiry\n\nMe: Mrs. Virgin, I have a question.\n\nMrs Virgin: Go ahead sweetie\n\nAnd then, I ask it.\n\n\u201dAre you a virgin\u201d\n\nShe gasps, Stares at me for a moment, Regains her composure, grabs my shoulder and says \u201cNot an appropriate question.\u201d\n\nI, still unaware of what I had just asked simply said \u201dokay\u201d and waddled off to the bus\n\nAs I rode home I had wondered what I had said wrong. It was in the back of my mind so I eventually forgot about it, until a couple years ago, when I remembered the story and realized what I had asked. I swore to myself I would never tell a soul, but here I am, bored and typing a story to 16.5 million people. Hope you enjoyed my suffering.\n\nTL;DR dumb kid asks if teacher is a virgin\n\nEdit: wupti-doo Looks like I got feature on R/slash, what a treat. Thanks everyone!",

            "Most children are just innocent and I think the teacher could have handled the situation better. Ask what the child means with the question and all of the awkwardness fades away as the child explains it.\n\nI had 2 situations in my childhood that remind me of yours quite heavily. In one of them I was in elementary school in a room where we could play some early PC learning games. One of the games was \u201ePushy\u201c and you needed to push the correct things into the fitting goal. Back then, progress was not saved and after some time I wanted to look on the internet at home if I could get the game on my own. So I tried to remember what the game was called and me, being a german not knowing what Pushy meant or how it was written, started typing some addresses into the browser. You can guess what site I\u2018ve also visited, fully on accident. Of course, 100% embarrassed, I instantly closed the browser and never tried to look for it again. A few days later my mom yells at me because she found it in the browser history and ask what I did on the site. I tried to explain myself and I think she got it, but I was never so embarrassed in my life before...\n\nBut as I said, I think most children are just innocent and probably don\u2018t know what they are doing.",

My mom bought me a book about babies, which had a chapter on how they are made in it*.

            "This made me recall a similar cringe moment I endured as a kid...\n\n I was in Sunday school near Christmas time and hadn't figured out why we qualify \"Mary\", the mother of Jesus himself, with \"virgin\". Like OP, I assumed a more innocent meaning of virgin than 'never had sexual intercourse before' which considering now is totally reasonable for a term used in Sunday school where any talk of sex is about as acceptable as praising Lucifer himself or considering the merits of abortion.\n\nAnyway, somehow I contextually gave away to my wiser Sunday school peers that I likely didn't know what it meant. One kid, who wasn't even very cool, seized the opportunity to be cool. In front of the class he asked innocent me, \" are you a virgin?\"\n\nI knew I was cornered and the only way out was to correctly guess whether or not I was a virgin. The class and Sunday school teacher sat on edge waiting my response. I squirmed on the inside, but knew to save face I must appear calm and cool and nail my yes/no guess. \n\nMy mind was spinning through possible definitions of virgin to inform my critical response. My only clue was that Mary was indeed a virgin. Did Mary live in the Virgo region? Was Mary's professional occupation a Virginista? The connotation seemed negative...

            "When I was in primary school I got the words feminist and prostitute mixed up - can\u2019t remember exactly  how that happened but probably down to my three older brothers. One day my primary school teacher is explaining why she used the term Ms instead of Mrs and she asked the class if anyone knew what a feminist is.

I was 13 he was 18. He gave me a lot of good weight lifting, dieting, advice and we ended up becoming gamer buddies.\n\nNow we drifted apart for a few years and then rekindled our friendship years down the road. Going forward we will call my friend John.\n\nWhen I was in mid 20s I ended up moving nearby John. I lived in a smaller town about 2 hours from him. And John and I knowing each for over a decade by this point decided to meet up\n\n* First time I went to go see him, he showed me around his favorite spots, we ended up watching some sports at a sports bar, drinking having a good time etc.\n* Second time John came down to visit me and I borrowed my dads motorcycle and John rode my bike. We smoked together, he went home\n* Third time John said he was going deep sea fishing and a cousin dropped out and if I wanted to come along I could so I did\n\nWell then a high school friend of mine who is this beautiful Asian/American woman (we shall name her Ana) got a job in Johns city. Like this woman was gorgeous. I also knew her type, she liked really musclar guys, guys who loved sports, etc.\n\nWell Ana and I are talking on Facebook and she mentions she's single and I tell her about John, how he's a fire fighter, likes sports, is really in shape, loves to cook, etc. Ana is super excited about John and I think \"Why don't I try and hook those two up?\"\n\nSo I ask her if she'd be interested in meeting John and seeing where things go, she goes YES!\n\nSo I message John and I ask one question, \"Are you single?\" He said \"yea\" and I leave it at that. So a few weeks later I have some free time coming up and I ask Ana if she'd be up for meeting John, she says absolutely. So I message John and tell him I'm thinking of coming up to his city to meet a high school friend of mine and if he wants to join us. He says yea. So we agree to meet up at a restaurant I know John likes.\n\nAna and I get there first, and a few minutes later John comes in. Ana whispers to me that I was right on the money and I'm thinking score, John is single, Ana is hot and succesful John going fall for head over heels. We order some drinks, and our dinner, conversation stays pretty light. We decide to go to a bar.\n\nWe get to the bar, Ana get somes drinks in her and starts getting hitting on John, she wants him. It takes John a moment and John pulls me aside and asks me \"Did you invite me to met your friend cause you wanted us to hook up?\" and I go \"Yea I did\"\n\nJohn hangs his head low, shakes his head looks back up at me and goes \"Dude i'm gay\" and I go \"What? Your gay?\" he goes \"Yea I'm gay\" and I ask \"Why have you never told me?\" and he goes \"Well...you never asked\" and I go \"Why haven't you mentioned any of your boyfriends?\" and he tells me that most of his boyfriends have been in the closet and they wanted to keep the relationship off social media.\n\nAt this point Ana comes over, she's fairly drunk she rubs up on John arm and goes \"I really just want you to know your super hot, and I'd love it if you took me to your bed tonight\"\n\nJohn looks at her and goes \"Your really pretty, but your not my type\" and Ana goes \"O you don't like Asians?\" he goes \"No, I'm gay\" Ana is standing there for a moment, processing this information looks at me and goes \"You tried to hook me up with a gay guy?\" and I respond \"I didn't know he was gay\"...Ana looks at me and goes \"You've known him for like 15 years and you didn't know he was gay?\" and I go \"Yea...\" she goes \"O...wow\" she thought for a moment and said \"Well...I thought I was going hook up with you, so I need a moment I'm going go step outside\"\n\nJohn and I went to our table and had a good talk, he had only come out of the closet shortly after I moved nearby, and knew I was straight and liked being friends with me and didn't want to ruin our friendship over him being gay and I never asked so he never felt the need to tell me he was gay. And to be fair, I didn't care he was gay he is still a cool guy.\n\nAna comes back after a few minutes, and sits down and goes \"Ok, I'm new here...your gay...so we aren't going be hooking up...but like do you where the best place to shop here is?\" John laughs and goes \"Yea I can show you\"\n\nThe rest of the night was good, Ana and John are still good friends. Since that night John actually met the man of his dreams, I was supposed to attend his wedding but...COVID19 makes international travel difficult.\n\nAnd that folks is the story of how I tried to hook up my hot female friend with my hot male friend...and I found out he was gay.\n\nTL:DR Tried to play match maker, found out my friend is gay.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n* John and I age gap?\n* At first John and I didn't even know how old each of us were, and he never made any \"moves\" on me or attempted to \"Groom me\" also we were not even remotely close to each other in terms of distance. Also Johns new Husband is actually older then him. I also never met John in person until I was in my 20s. Not cause of any sense of concern or anything but that's just how things worke dout\n\n* Why I didn't hook up with Ana? Or at least try?\n* Several reasons, first being I met Ana when she started dating my best friend in high school, that's how we became friends. I don't date my friends ex girlfriends. Secondly Ana is both a perfectionist and a clean freak both of things would drive me up the wall. Thirdly I'm not her type, I'm not some big in shape guy.\n\n* Is Ana seeing anyone?\n* I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she is I don't know who. And the creepy PMs of guys trying to get me to hook them up ain't going anywhere guys...I'm not going message my friend and be like \"O some dude who I don't know messaged me on the internet and said he wants me to help him get in your pants you cool with that?\"",

We have both been exploring kink with each other in ways we never have in past relationships, and it\u2019s been a really great way for us to connect and explore our sexuality. Overall a very positive experience.\n\nAbout a month ago, I brought up that it might be fun for me to give him keys to my apartment and have him \u201cbreak in\u201d at random to have sex with me. I heard some kinky friends discussing it, and it sounded so spontaneous and sexy. He agreed, and said he would come to my place at random one night. After that, I pretty much forgot about it.\n\nLast night, he was driving home from an evening with friends and gave me a call to chat. We talked for a bit, and I heard him start getting out of his car, assuming he\u2019d arrived home. He told me to hold on a minute, so I did. Then I heard someone fucking with my apartment lock. The door started opening, and having totally forgotten about our \u201cplan,\u201d I started screaming bloody murder. \u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d I yelled. \u201cGet out of my apartment!\u201d I was sure someone was breaking in and honestly thinking I might die. My heart was just about pounding out of my chest.\n\nHe shows himself. \u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d he said, rushing to help me. I burst into tears, and he spent the rest of the night comforting me. Needless to say, we did not end up doing the deed. So much for hot, spontaneous sex.\n\nTl;dr: gave SO keys to my apartment so he could \u201cbreak in\u201d and have kinky sex with me, forgot about it entirely, he did it, I thought he was a burglar and pretty much lost it.\n\nEdit: Thank you so very much for all the trinkets!",

Ie decided on a code word for x kinky activities that is up for trial, when in the mood send that word or just say hey do it some time within this time frame, 10,12 hours whatever. Less spontaneous, but safer for your mental health. It prioritizes proper consent. Always get consent from both parties even if playing a no consent game/kink.\n\n\nEditing to add: don't forget the safe word! A word that won't naturally come up in sex/kink play but means stop.

I thought If it had been him, this would be an obvious time to reveal the surprise. His reaction makes me think I should be concerned. I start to look for a weapon and hide and I\u2019m freaking out. Ultimately it was revealed that it was \u201cjust him\u201d. Then he couldn\u2019t understand why I was upset that he had come over to spend the night with me. He said I\u2019ll just go home.

I want everyone to have fun.\n\nBut. If anyone here is going to do a break-in fantasy, please practice your safe words with one another until they are second nature and discuss the scenario over a course of time so that it\u2019s burned into your head. Then have a code word or phrase the week and day of. That way. You know it\u2019s coming. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything sex related. It can just be an uncommonly used or bizarre vanilla word or phrase that won\u2019t get mixed up with your normal conversation so, you can kind of know what\u2019s coming. Maybe have him act a bit weird and creepy for a week or so around you to set the mood. Men are good at being creeps (sorry). Then have a weird confirmation phrase or word that you reply. So that the \u201cattacker\u201dknows that you are game. \n\nThen create a secret sequence of knocks or claps or something. So you will know who is at the door or is in your home. If you know you will reflexively freak out, you and the other person(s) need to make sure that there is nothing near you you could use to harm them. And they need to make sure that they will be able to overpower you, even in your adrenaline filled state. \n\nThese sorts of scenes are rarely spontaneous. They take planning and work.  Trust me, even if you know it\u2019s him, If he toys around with you for a bit as though he is a predator playing with his prey. You will get really anxious and excited not knowing when he will pounce. \n\n*change pronouns to suit your situation*",

People were ALWAYS over so the thought would turn me on from time to time.\n\nSo, like usual, I'd crank one out and then fall asleep.\n\nWell, one of my friends thought it'd be awesome to \"get me laid\" by doing exactly that. He sent this drunk girl into my room (at this time I didn't lock it as people generally left me alone, and I never wanted to be stuck trying to unlock the door if I needed to get out with my cats quickly).\n\nThis random chick who lived across the street and I had never even talked to, ended up opening my door: Waking me up and crawling in bed with me, startling the shit out of me. I had maybe been asleep for an hour at this point and I was just amazed that someone would have the balls to crawl in bed with some guy they had never spoken to. Talk about a great way to catch a disease.\n\nI uncomfortably told her to get the hell out of my bed and asked what she was thinking.\n\nSure enough, the thought of that scenario was no longer 'sexy' at all afterwards.",

            "Pro tip: if you want to engage in some surprise sex, get a hotel room. You go there first and go to sleep, he comes later. If you really don't want to know when he's going to come, get the room for a few days, so you don't know what night he will come. Discuss a safe word beforehand, and maybe a code word so that you know it's him.\n\nI did this once with a random hookup. I was going interstate, and was in an adult chat room talking about it, and bluntly asked if anyone wanted to fuck while I was there. A woman sent me a dm telling me that she would be good for it, but she had a fantasy. Because I was getting in very late, the motel I was staying at arranged to leave the key to the room in a designated spot, so I told her where the key would be, and to be asleep in bed when I got there. The first she knew of my presence was my dick being driven into her. In hindsight, it would have been hotter if I had tied her up with a blindfold and gag, and then had my way with her.",

The system was updating in the middle of my shift so I had to pick something really quickly.  I chose something off the top of my head that I knew I would never forget. It was the password that my boyfriend and I had always used for things that didn\u2019t really matter to us such as temporary Xbox accounts and throwaway emails we shared. \n\n\nThat password was : #YOLO69\n\n\nSo me half asleep is totally incapable of thinking up a way to get myself out of this. I honestly don\u2019t even remember how I told her. I assume I mumbled it somehow I got the letters out and hung up and fell back asleep. \n\n\nShe never really found a replacement for my boss so I had to step up and take on the role for a while making the district manager my boss for the next year or so.

I was holding out a handful of change to a stranger I just touched.

(He is much taller than I am and she had the same hair.)  She turns around and he realizes he's just kissed one of the prospective grad students and is SOOOOO horrified.  He just gibbers an apology!  She turned out to be really cool and we all had a good laugh about it.  Although, I no longer get kissed on the head when we are out in public.",

She was there to purchase something (perfume/socks?) for a friend at Christmas, and then saw something like sweatpants she wanted to try on. I went to a back wall and stared at my phone so I wouldn\u2019t look like a creepy guy, and then a few minutes later I hear \u201chey how does this look\u201d in a voice similar to my wife\u2019s. I look up and discover that not only was I standing right in sight-line with the dressing room entrance, but I was also staring at a lady in a revealing outfit who wanted her friend to provide feedback on how it looked. Eye contact was made, and I slithered my way back out the store to a bench in the mall. I think I was a bright shade of red. Wife came out and wondered why I left. I felt really awkward.

            "A lady at Disney world did something similar last month.  She was super close to my side, so I would move.  She would slide with me, then I would move.  Then she was talking to me and backed into me from the side, almost to lean on me, but then realist I was taller than she was expected.  She turned around to say something, right into my chest, then looked up. She was shocked.  In Disney, with people from all over the world, personal space norms can vary, so I was just trying to roll with it.  LOL  She was mortified.",
            "One time I was walking out of the dining commons and I think I see my girlfriend sitting on a bench facing away from me.

            "I can't say that women are not harassed overall, but there's more innocent mistakes than you'd think.\n\nI had just traded my old jeep in for a Mazda 3. Turning radius was much improved, as you'd expect. I was in Boston (unfortunately) and needed to bang a uey. Fortunately the intersection I was at allowed me to go from the left lane, around the median where people would wait to cross, and back onto storrow Dr. Had my windows down, etc etc.\n\nI get the light change, go left, u turn, whatever. Legal, safe, etc. I watched cars, people, the whole bit. Surprised by how easily the car maneuvered (first time in Boston with the thing), I exclaimed \"wow, tight like donkey!\" (I was alone, whatever, don't judge). And as I'm driving away I see a girl flip me off. Like what the fuck, I didn't do anything unsafe or illegal, I was watching pedestrians and traffic the whole time....\n\nThen I realized. She was out for a run. In spandex. She thought I was talking about her.\n\nSorry donkey girl. Was talking about my car. Not about you.\n\nBut makes me wonder how many times it's an innocent mistake and not even intended toward the person, let alone harassment towards the person.",

I was waiting for my wife by the dressing rooms and kinda staring into space while waiting on her. \n\nAll the sudden I snap out of it and there are two girls looking at me like I\u2019m a pervert while they were looking through one of those huge bins full of panties. \n\nI just stared at the ground and waiting for my wife so we could leave.

A couple guards came up to me and said some woman complained that I was following her around and taking photos of her.\n\nI showed them every single photo I had taken and they said the this woman was not in a single one of them, lol. Some people are just so full of themselves. Especially because I would even wait for the majority of people to get out of the way before I took my photos (I want to photograph the building, not the people). \n\nWe just laughed it off and the guards apologised and offered to take a couple photos of me next to some of the statues and whatnot.",

A couple minutes later my dad sees her, comes up behind her, and grabs her ass. Needless to say the random woman he grabbed wasn\u2019t thrilled. Neither was the security guard she yelled for.

For reference I\u2019d been divorced like 10 yrs and had only two teenage boys, she was divorced with two young daughters, one a teen and one a pre-teen.  \n\nWhen we were first dating \u2014 like date #3 \u2014 we had dinner plans.  We got there a tad early and she asked if she could quickly shop at the department store next door for something for her daughter.  I give the man sigh and say ok.  Her 12-year old daughter is tiny, even for her age. I\u2019m coming from work , so I\u2019ve got my long wool jacket on, for all intents and purposes a trench coat. So  I go into the store with her and unknowingly she  drags me to the underwear section .  I get texted and look down to respond and loook up and suddenly realize she\u2019s nowhere to be found. So there I am, standing there all alone in a trench coat in the pre-teen pantie section and look up and to one side there\u2019s an older lady just glaring at me, and from the other side a very flamboyant man rushes up with his hands on hips saying, \u201cSIR, can I help you?\u201d\n\nBy some act of God we got through this and got married in July. .............................. \n\n\n\n..............................the mom, not the 12-yer old daughter.",

It was his dad's drinking buddy who had similar hair, and my boyfriend was in the kitchen the whole time. FML. To make it worse, his dad was off to the side of the porch and saw the whole thing.

I\u2019m have the same underwear!\u201d\n\nExcept, it wasn\u2019t my sister anymore. It was definitely some random older woman. She gave me a look of shock, then a quick polite smile but probably thought I was off my rocker. I gave her a horrified look and mumbled an apology before bailing from the rack I was near.

So one of my co-workers was this fairly attractive guy in his early 20's, we got along pretty good. Long story short, he bailed on me on a Saturday night (which is always a busy night) and apparently had ended up quitting. Few weeks later, in the local Tim Hortons (insert Canadian jokes here eh!?) and I see him at the counter. Ran up behind him and LITERALLY gave him a good kick in the ass. Dude turns around and it's him, but not him...turns out he has a twin brother. Had no idea. I was so fucking mortified, lol. He was pretty cool about it.

I don't have a car, so I usually rely on a friend to drive me home and this time one of them, let's call him Ben, volunteered to do it. I was looking up some stuff about the movie on my phone while following the gang through the car park, when I \"noticed\" Ben getting in what seemed to be his car. It was weird that he didn't say anything to the others, so I got in the car, front seat next to the driver, a bit annoyed that we were in a hurry and not saying bye to anyone, still not looking away from my phone, about to put my seatbelt, when I say \"Ben, did you forget how to say bye?\". A second passes by in silence, so I look at Ben. That was not Ben. No idea who that was, but poor guy seemed terrified, his hands clenched on the steering wheel and eyes wide open. Says something like \"I think you got in the wrong car\". I start laughing and say \"Sorry, wrong car, I must've confused you with one of my friends\" and quickly got out of there. The look of confusion on my friends' faces when they saw me getting out of a stranger's car was priceless. We all laugh hysterically while I try to explain and we hear a honk from a car passing by. It was the driver who's car I got into, waving at us and clearly laughing. It seems the guy had just been walking close to my friends and his car was the same color as Ben's, gray. We still laugh about it."

That being said, I may have done something pervy and I now hate myself. This fuck up is innocent enough, I think, but the implications are terrible. I\u2019ll let you be the judge. \n\nSo yesterday my lovely, beautiful, 35 year old wife went to her grandmothers house to help clean out her old room. She lived with her in her high school years because her mother moved away and she didn\u2019t want to change schools, so she stayed. Her room at grandmas has gone pretty much untouched since she moved in with me, 16 years ago. Anyways, she got home late last night and was very excited to show me some of her treasures for decades past that she recovered from her childhood bedroom.  Unfortunately her show-and-tell session coincided with a playoff game so she did not have my undivided attention (even though the Titans clearly had it in the bag, you have to watch until the end just in case). She showed me her sketch book, (very nice dear, you could have been an artist) an article she wrote that was published in a local newspaper (wow babe, you coulda been a journalist... FUMBLE!) and some other stuff. Then she breaks out a dusty photo album from the good old days of disposable cameras. I got detailed history of every picture of her, her friends, her siblings, people she doesn\u2019t even remember, places that no longer exist... I was not paying attention. I\u2019ll admit that. She flipped through page after page as she sat beside me on the couch and I glanced at the pictures, and gave my obligatory \u201cthat\u2019s nice\u201d or \u201cwow, look at that\u201d response. \n\nEverything was going peachy. Until she flipped the page, and said \u201cthis is a picture of me at the beach\u201d and I glanced. And it was her in a bikini. Her, my wife, in a bikini. I said \u201cdaaaaaamn\u201d. And looked back at the TV. Silence from her. I feel something is wrong. I can feel her eyes on the side my face. I said the wrong thing. What did I do? I risk a peek at her face; she is shocked. I have obviously grown a grotesque second head on my shoulder, because the look on her face could not be the result of anything less. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask stupidly. \n\nWhat the FUCK does that mean? I show you a picture of me when I was 15 FUCKING YEARS OLD and you say \u201cdaaaaaamn?\u201d You find that fucking attractive?! You are disgusting! I have no answer, I just kinda look at her wishing she\u2019d start laughing at let me know she\u2019s fucking with me. But no, the same expression of rage and disappointment. I don\u2019t know what to do. I kinda stuttered out \u201cbut... but it\u2019s you! You know... younger I guess but you\u2019re hot. I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve always been hot. What the fuck am I supposed to say? She tells me that the little girl in the picture no longer exists, that\u2019s it\u2019s not her but a memory and that I am a weirdo. I have nothing to say, I just want this conversation to be over. There are 4 minutes left in the fourth quarter. I get the brilliant idea to say \u201clook, I wasn\u2019t paying attention let me see the picture again I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t hot\u201d. Smoooooth. \n\nI won\u2019t go in to too much detail about the rest of the conversation but suffice it to say that I am sleeping on the couch and should apparently be on a list of folks to keep an eye on. All I wanted to do was watch football. \n\nTL;DR I saw a picture of my wife taken when she was 15 and suggested she was hot.\n\nEdit: I should add her Grandmother is being moved to Hospice care. She does not normally react this way but I think she is under a lot of stress. Also I have read your comments and agree that this has more to do with me ignoring her than me thinking she was a hottie at 15. She needs me to be there to listen to her and I blew it. Thanks for your feedback though it\u2019s a lot to think about.\n\nEdit 2: hooray I made the front page. I wanted to update the folks who seem genuinely interested. My wife and I talked about it, we are doing just fine now. She is not crazy, not a bitch, and we\u2019re not getting a divorce. Some of you also suggested her reaction may have been the result of a past trauma. She assured me this is not the case, she\u2019s just stressed and was angry with me.\nLastly, fellas... please stop suggesting that I did nothing wrong because you think it\u2019s perfectly natural and ok to be attracted to teenage girls. It is not. I don\u2019t care how \u201cdeveloped\u201d they are. Stop it. \n\nFinal edit: sorry if I ghosted you guys. I took (some of) your advice and have been giving my wife my undivided attention. I am not used to this amount of attention or scrutiny, and honestly it\u2019s been a mixed bag. It\u2019s Reddit. I asked for it. But now that I\u2019ve got it... I feel kinda like a young actress who wanted a private meeting with Harvey Weinstein. So I\u2019ll try to read your 4K comments and reply to anyone who I feel might me waiting for one, but not now. Thanks for your support and advice. Thank you for mocking, trolling, and ridiculing me as well, it\u2019s all in good fun. I hope.",

            "So here's the thing. My boyfriend and I got together when I was 15 and he was 17. We're in our early 20s now and when we talk about our sexual relationship in the past he will comment that he liked my boobs or something to that effect. That doesnt mean at the age he is now he would be sexually attracted to 15 year old me. I dont think you did anything wrong. When it's your spouse I think the rules are a *little* different. \n\nMaybe I can see it if you guys didnt know each other when that picture was taken...but just slightly. \n\nAlso, sometimes it's hard to differentiate between adolescents and young adults. Some people just look older and that picture was taken when she was already close to adulthood anyway. How were you automatically supposed to know she was underage in it?",
            "Sounds like your wife is having a very tough time, you should try your best to support people especially in times of grief.",

            "I don't think you did anything wrong, I cant believe that ended up with you on the couch... \n\nWord of advice though, turn off the football game when your wife is sharing her life with you. If you did anything idiotic, it's that.",
            "I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, I think it was her bad for freaking out over a little misunderstanding/ honestly I feel like that\u2019s a compliment. You weren\u2019t saying she was hot because she was 15 or that all 15 year olds are attractive to you, you just saw a photo of her from when she was younger that you thought she looked good in. \n\nNot your FU imo",
            "Your wife just put one of the most important people in her life into hospice care. As she's reminiscing about her life during the time she lived with her grandmother you ignore her to watch a football game. Grief makes a person act out in different ways. I don't think your wife should have to ask you to support her while her grandma is in hospice or while she's packing up her childhood home. The fact that you described the incident initially without describing the context is alarming to me. Significant others shouldn't have to beg for support while their loved ones are dying. And their overreactions to awkward situations shouldn't be described on Reddit with zero context. At least you added that edit. Just be there for her and be patient through her grieving. You'll have more chances to watch football and this is your chance to support her through this difficult time.",

            "cha cha real smooth, OP",
            "I agree that reaction was NOT warranted. But respectfully, I found your description of your wife to be really condescending. She was clearly excited and if it's anything like you described, you may have come off really disinterested/dismissive. Maybe that's why she freaked out? To get you to admit you haven't actually looked or absorbed anything she was showing you for the last hour? Not saying it's a proportionate response at ALL but if your wife isn't typically a lunatic, maybe start there.\n\nIt's a communication fuck up for you both. She could have articulated it better, sure, but you also could have told her you wanted to finish the game and would love to look after",
            "Honestly I can see how that comment can ick me out. Especially if she's going through some stuff with her grandmother she may have looked back at her time in the photo with nostalgia, and maybe innocence. Girls and young women in bikinis are instantly sexualise, even if she was just existing and having a good time at the beach.\n\nPersonally if I was in her position, his reaction would remind me of being at that age (or younger) and trying to do fun things only to be constantly reminded that a lot men wanted to fuck me. Normally it wouldn't bother me (jaded) but if I was going through a tough time it might.\n\nHow she responded could have been better definitely, but unless this was a normal occurrence I wouldnt call her a psycho.",
            "Sounds to me like she was more pissed off that you weren't paying attention to all this cool, interesting stuff (from her perspective) about her childhood and the comment that 15 year old her was hot just pushed her over the edge.    \n\n\nSHe is probably angry and upset bc she feels old and ugly.  She thinks she doesn't look that good anymore and you don't say \"Daaaaaaamn\" when you see her dressed up at age 35.    \n\n\nAnyway it is horrible of her to treat you like a perv for finding a pic of her at 15 being attractive.   \n\n\nPS - Everyone knows that 15 will get you 20 but that doesn't mean they aren't hot.",
            "The worst part is that you were ignoring and patronizing your wife.",
            "I think her mental health may be compromised at the moment considering her grandmother being moved to hospice, o do think that she overreacted, but I also think it's because she realized you were half - ass listening to her when she needed you to, however, you probably didn't know she needed that attention from you right then, so don't beat yourself up over it. \n\nI've had several moments where I lashed out over things that really have little significance now, but the stress I was under at the time produced a reaction that could have been labeled as extreme anger and super unhealthy. \n\nI've had to put my mother in hospice care and almost had to make the decision to put her in a nursing home which was a very trying and difficult time for me, and I was quite unpleasant to be around.\n\nI would highly recommend a therapist or counselor, it's so incredibly helpful to have someone on standby for anything that may arise in the future. \n\nIn closing, I believe she did overreact.\nBut if you know she's going through something and wants to talk to you turn the TV off and listen. I fucking hate being ignored over a TV or phone.",
            "This is upsetting to me because you obviously had no interest in something that meant a lot to her in the first place that she really wanted to share with you. \n\nIf you were dead set on watching a game in that moment you might have made it known and asked her to wait until it was over so you could give her all of your attention or have been polite and stepped away. It\u2019s not like they don\u2019t announce that shit and replay things for the next hour afterwards. \n\nI think that is what bothers me the most.  I went to high school with my husband so I take comments like that as a compliment.  I felt like I was an attractive youth. I tell him he looks hot in his teen photos too because he was and still is to me.  I was actively pursuing him even though he was three years my senior.",
            "You sound mean for pretending to pay attention when she was trying to show you something important from her past.      \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if she only got so mad because that was the first opportunity where there was an actual, tangible reason to speak out, when in reality she felt ignored or unimportant to you the whole time when you were... literally ignoring her because the game.      \n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

            "Your fuckup was choosing a sport over your fucking wife dumbass. This was important to her and you can't be bothered to even try to listen, but the first thing you decide to pay attention to is underage her in a bikini. I don't blame her for getting angry at all, you're a fucking idiot by the sounds of it",
            "Your wife sounds like she overreacted. However, she probably was bothered by the fact that you neglected to really give your attention to cherished stuff she still had. The only thing you payed attention to was her physical appearance from when she was young. The age thing was just a catalyst. Your behavior was shallow, and she probably felt objectified. Give her a couple of days, and think about why you aren\u2019t paying attention anymore.",
            "You didn't do anything wrong. Your wife's reply is bordering on toxic.",
            "Yeah. You\u2019re right, the part you screwed up on is ignoring a once in a lifetime bonding experience with your wife for a game that could have been watched later ( either by taping it yourself or by looking for it on the internet. ). Even if you couldn\u2019t have gotten to see the game later, it\u2019s a game. Compared to your wife sharing her younger self with you the game has no real value at all. \n\nI remember when one of my exGFs was showing me old pics of her. I was, of course, paying attention. She was a beautiful Filipino woman and, even in her late thirties was hotter than a jalape\u00f1o pepper. She showed me a pic of her around 15, too. I also told her she was super hot at her age; adding that I wish I\u2019d known her then. But, I didn\u2019t just look, say daaammn, and go back to not paying any attention to her. Even your attempt to correct it showed you only wanted to get it over with and get back to your game. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t find your SO as important at that game because you not only lost a great bonding opportunity but, you\u2019ve probably turned her a bit away from sharing stuff like that with you again. Why would she want to open up and share? You don\u2019t care.",
            "Wow, I can't believe so many people are saying you you did nothing wrong.\n\nYou did. \n\nYou basically brag about not listening to your wife and giving her the most cursory attention when you say in an edit, that she's going through probably a difficult time regarding her grandmother. I get it, I'm a football fan too, but you could have just told your wife that the game had your attention right now but you'd love to hear about her day after.\n\nAnd guess what, you wouldn't have made such a boneheaded comment if you'd actually been paying any attention whatsoever.\n\nI don't agree with a spouse punishing another spouse with banishment to the couch, but I absolutely sympathize with your wife in this situation.",
            "It's not like you go around ogling 15 year old girls in bikinis. You looked at the picture and saw your wife, the woman you love. You weren't thinking, \"This is a child.\"\n\nYou also used to be a 15 year old boy. Maybe saying something like, \"I know what I looked like at 15, and you would definitely have been out of my league.\" will help?\n\nIdk, man. If your wife can't listen to your explanation of being distracted by the game and it not registering that the bikini pic was not just her, but her as a minor, then I'm not sure what recourse you have.",
            "this is hilarious, i could imagine a stand up comedian saying this on stage\n\nmy gut feeling is telling me nobodys the good guy and nobodys the bad guy, just a huge misunderstanding",
            "I'm on the edge for this one, but i am going with YTA. You knew how the game was turning out and your wife is under a lot of stress and was trying to show you memories from her past, but you still remained watching football instead of paying attention to her",
            "She seems fun",
            "You weren't paying attention, and you said something dumb because of it. It's not the end of the world, but yeah you fucked up. IMO go apologize, explain you weren't fully listening or thinking about it, and that you didn't mean anything perverted.\n\nLearn from it, listen to her more when she's talking about things that matter to her. I'm sure you either wouldn't have made that comment had you been listening more, or you would've handled it better after saying it.\n\nI might be going against the Reddit hive mind here, but indeed it's your fault here, from my point of view.",
            "Maybe you could have paused the game or turned it off and paid attention to your wife. She was sharing things from her past and was obviously excited to show you these parts of her life. Her grandma is dying, and this gave her a pleasant distraction and you ruined it. Screw the playoffs, you should have paid attention to get and been there for her. The fuck up here isn't complimenting a pic of teenage her in a bikini. The fuck up is that you talk about only giving your wife little bits of your attention while watching a football game. That's rude, inconsiderate, and selfish.",

            "She gets back from a trip and you aren't listening to what she wants to share. That's the fuck-up right there. \n\nWhat you're focusing on is merely an effect of that dynamic - she has to feed off the crumbs of your attention. Your comment represents not just a *small faux pas* but something that hits home: maybe you don't pay attention to her because you prefer younger women? Maybe she finally realized just how little you paid attention to her? \n\nUltimately the responsibility to communicate well enough for you and she to negotiate a good time where you'll listen rests with both of you. Record the game. Find time to listen. Talk it out.",
            "Ooh I think she's going to be pissed if she finds this post because it makes her sound dramatic and immature...I don't think she is, I saw how she was helping her grandma and I'm sure she wasn't really mad at what she was saying she was mad at, but this story makes her sound bad. \nThe first thought I had was that she shouldn't have interrupted the game you were watching because duh, of course your attention is going to be divided. But then I saw the stuff about her grandma and I think she probably needed you to help her feel better but she didn't know how to ask. Then she was hurt that you didn't really pick up on it so she punished you. It was a bad coincidence. Neither of you did what you were \"supposed\" to do. Just help her feel better about her grandma now. I think it will be OK.",
            "I believe she overreacted to that, but what bothers me is you paying more attention to a game than your SO sharing significant memories with you. That's just sad...",
            "Sounds like your wife has some issues if that was the reaction, under age girls can still be hot because many people would have physically developed by that point, but they're not mentally developed and are venerable to exploitation and that's why we have laws in place to protect them.\n\nNothing wrong with thinking someone is hot, but there is with acting upon that.",
            "I am thinking that with her grandma going in to hospice she is overloaded emotionally, when add to that the fact that you were basically ignoring her for a football game of course she is going to lash out at you. Going through her old room brought home the fact that her grandma is dying and in trying to deal with that, she brought stuff home and was excited to share some of those memories with you but to you the football game was more important. Could you not have paused it for a few minutes, or maybe have said \"I really want to hear all of your stories, but with the game on I can't give you my undivided attention. If you give me (however many) minutes, we can look at all of it when it's over\"? She definitely overreacted, but I can see her frustration. Her grandma is dying and she is having a hard time dealing with that but to you the football game was more important than comforting her after she had a difficult day. Maybe sit her down and ask if you can go over everything she brought home again. Just remember she is having a hard time right now and needs a little bit of understanding.",
            "Dude you fucked up way more by not paying attention. \n\nIt honestly sounds like your wife is grieving.  Turn the damn game off and pay attention. \n\nHer grandma is dying.

            "Aww it kinda makes me sad you weren\u2019t really paying attention when she was excited to show you things that were about her. I catch my husband doing this sometimes and I just slowly stop talking and he doesn\u2019t even realize I\u2019m not talking to him anymore.

        "selftext": "So I've spent the last 20 minutes hypervnetlating with laughter and I promised my wife I wouldn't tell anyone we know because she's a bit humiliated... so this is my way of getting it off my chest.\n\nSince lockdown, my wife and I have found a new appreciation of the garden. It isn't big it, isnt pretty... but it's a way to get outside and, given the cabin fever we've experienced, this is a nice form of escapism. We've always had a bird feeder that we topped up periodically... but with us both working from home, we've enjoyed watching the birds come and go. We got bladk birds, starlings, magpies and more pigeons than you could count. After a while we fed them by hand and now we can even get a few of them to sit on our hand and eat. Its therapeutic in a  weird way and naturally we've named some of them and so on. I really recommend it ( #berbs )\n\nAnyway, the wife asks a week ago if she can buy some more bird seed  - I said sure, sounds good. I should add my wife isn't from a country that uses the metric system and she's still getting used to it over here. I was in the room whilst she put the order in and - well - maybe when she said \"ooo is it ok if I get a fair bit, its cheaper that way?\" and \"ooo a selection for wild birds, shall I get some of that too?\" I didn't do my due diligence. I thought \"what the hell, its not like it goes off. We can stick it in the garage\". When she told me how much it was, I was shocked but I assumed she got a few bits with the order (again, she is still adjusting to the price of things over here and everything is super expensive to her)\n\nSo  you can probably see where this is going... this morning a delivery arrived. My first clue should have been the size of the van that pulled up outside my house, ready to deliver 4 sacks of 12.5kg of birdseed. The delivery driver, from his safe social distance, lost his shit with laughter as my mind melted as he pulled sack after sack off his van. My wife was in a zoom meeting and when I finally got her attention revealed there's still more to come that's in transit and will arrive tomorrow. Turns out, for some reason, she thought it was 2.5kg to the lb.\n\nI don't know if you can picture the amount of birdseed we have, but I'd say -- if we take into account how much is due to arrive tomorrow-  I'll expect we have about the size of a small sofa. We have enough birdseed to last our entire lives, we can give it as inheritance after we die... from drowning in birdseed.\n\nWe've both spent a good part of the last hour crying with laughter amid our sacks. Every time I go into the hallway, I lose my shit a bit. After 6 weeks in lockdown I really think I might be losing my mind.\n\nThe best bit, we threw some into the garden and the birds don't want to know. Little bastards.  \n\n\n  \nTL;DR My wife bought bird seed. She didn't appreciate the nuances of the metric system and bought Pablo Escobar quanitites. The birds don't like it. My house is full of it. I can't.\n\n\n\nUPDATE- golly, this is what it feels like when Reddit goes bananas? My phone has been going crazy... Anyway, lots of people asked for photos - regrettably, I had already started breaking the sacks down so I cant do all of it.. but here is ONE of the FOUR sacks (12.5kg) we received... cant wait for more tomorrow! \n Annoyingly its also the most compact of the sacks we got due to smaller seeds. The one with the peanuts was immense!\n\nOh and for 100% honesty I'm squeezing it a bit (Because it isn't a solid mass to hold)... but believe me when I say I am satisfied I got the full amount we paid for, its a solid mass to carry. Also, hello lockdown hair!\n\n https://imgur.com/gallery/PdjInrR",

It's 2.2lbs to 1kg, but in situations where you don't think accuracy is that important, it's often easier to round that 2.2 up or down. But if you round it up, then switch your lbs and your kgs by mistake, you end up with a fuckton of birdseed.",

When the box showed up, my husband called me at work and was like \"OMG WHY DID YOU ORDER SO MUCH HAY???\". I was like \"what are you talking about, I only ordered 10 lbs of hay\".

No sympathy, nothing you do will ever make her feel right again, no matter how many houses, cars, flowers you buy, no matter how many apologies you give her. Best bet now is to hope to god she is kind enough to keep this private, because if this gets out, good luck bro.\n\nEdit: Also don\u2019t beg for forgiveness.

I don't want an actual answer, I just want you to think about it, why didn't you get rid of them in the first place? And then to actively seek them out from a place of selfishness, that's kinda fucked up. It'd be different if you were single, but that's beyond disrespectful to your current girlfriend. Don't be in an exclusive relationship if you don't have the maturity or are not ready to let go of your ex. My thoughts go out to the poor girl, I can only imagine how hurt she feels.",

Things escalate and we eventually start having sex. We were super quiet about it so that nobody would know. \n\nThis is where things get ~hilariously terrifying~.\n\nSo, I\u2019m BALLS DEEP in my gf as she\u2019s riding me, and my dad just casually walks into my room and essentially gets a full ass view of my gfs fuckin butthole and my willy half-way up main street. He\u2019s so startled he makes one of this \u201cDOH!\u201d sounds like Homer Simpson y\u2019know??? He quickly turns away pretending like he hadn\u2019t seen anything. This all happened in less than 2 seconds. \n\nI can hear my mom downstairs say \u201cHoney? What was that?!\u201d\n\nMy dad, god bless his soul, replies \u201cI... uhhh... stubbed my toe...\u201d in the most defeated way possible.\n\nMy gf couldn\u2019t look at my dad the same way again.\n\nI haven\u2019t talked about it with my dad ever.\n\nedit: I still laugh my ass off telling this story to people.\n\ntldr: tifu by having sex w/ my gf while my parents were home and my dad walked in on us.

To be fair, enough time has passed for me to stop referring to him as the new guy, but he's not my dad and I guess that will always make him feel like the new guy. According to movie logic, I'm supposed to hate him for trying to replace my father or whatever, but the truth is, I like him. I like him so much that I've been learning how to use sign language to improve our communication because new guy happens to be Deaf. \n\nHe can read lips, which is how I've been communicating with him. My mom didn't waste any time learning sign language at the beginning of their romance and she's at the point now where she can have full conversations without using her voice. I was really proud of her and so was new guy. I'm not on their level yet, but I've had enough practice to follow a conversation that's not too complicated. My plan was to surprise new guy on his birthday, which is 2 months from now, and wish him a happy birthday as well as officially welcoming him to the family in sign language. \n\nHowever, I never factored in the amount of dirty talk my mom and new guy were having in sign language. Not knowing that I can understand them, my mom and new guy have gotten disturbingly comfortable exposing their sex life in my company. It didn't matter if we were at the dinner table or watching tv, I would constantly catch so many dirty descriptions being communicated between the two of them. They are worse than horny teenagers, and I should know, I am one. No 17 year old son should ever witness his mother use her fingers to demonstrate how wet her vagina is. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I'm no longer willing to wait until new guy's birthday to make it known that I can understand sign language because HOLY FUCK I need my eyes to not see this shit anymore. \n\nThis is an ongoing fuck up.\n\n**Tl:dr The guy my mom's dating is Deaf.

Today was an especially nice day so there were a lot of people out jogging and walking as well. As I was jogging up to an intersection a really attractive woman with a very fit butt happened to turn the corner and start walking the way I'd come. She was out walking a dog and ended up going the same direction as me. This coincidentally ended up being about the time I'd exhausted myself with jogging and started talking to catch my breath. I, being a guy, couldn't help but take notice of her very nice rear end. I wasn't trying to be a perv about it, nor did I plan on saying anything rude, I was just admiring. Well for whatever reason I happened to look over at the large dog she was walking with and was confronted with the large pair of dog danglers I've ever seen. \n\nThe abrupt change from admiring a woman who takes amazing care of her body to these two huge furry tennis balls swaying back and forth apparently broke my mind for a short period of time. I'm guessing the woman had seen me jogging a ways behind her as she turned the corner because she moved off into the grass and looked behind her. I imagine to let me pass assuming I was still jogging and not realizing was now walking at the same pace as her. She saw me looking down and I could see her scowl a bit, thinking I was staring at her butt. (which in all fairness I had been moments before.)   \n\n\nHowever, at that moment what she caught me staring at was her dogs obscenely large balls with what was probably a mixture of shock and awe. Her scowl immediately faded and she started laughing so hard she had to stop walking because she almost walked into a street sign. Was at a complete loss of how to respond and was tempted to say I was looking at her butt as if that would somehow help me salvage my dignity. She eventually regained her composure, I blurted out some sort of apology and used the newfound adrenaline to jog most of the way home. But that's not all! Later in the day I ran into her again...as she was entering her apartment....in the same complex as me...  As it turns out she's one of my new neighbors. FML. \n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr I was going for a jog/walk and ended up behind a beautiful woman who caught me staring at her dog's huge balls.",

He kept a fairly high pace as he was in a hurry to get back home before the game started but he noticed that as he came closer to the lady, she actually sped up and started looking behind her nervously, so he slowed down and she slowed down as well when he was at an \"ok\" distance again. He kept an eye on his watch and realized he was about to be late so he sped up again, only for her to speed up as well, so he slowed down... Then sped up again to make it home, started to jog and she started running, he ran faster than her and while passing her he screamed \"I'M NOT GOING TO RAPE YOU, THERE'S FOOTBALL ON THE TV!\" and kept running past her.",

In the past, I have laughed off weird situations like this--it is an attempt to deescalate a situation that (to me) could be threatening, and other women can tell you they've laughed something off or played nice to deescalate as well.\n\nYou mentioned in another comment that she points you out, said, \"That's him,\" and everyone laughed? I mean, it could be amicable--but personally, if I'm loudly pointing out a guy to my friends, even if I'm making it look light-hearted, it's so everyone now knows that's the guy that made me feel uncomfortable earlier, and now he has been identified to other people.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to admire a body type you find desirable. But you phrased it here like you were behind her, looking, for some time. Enough for her to realize and be uncomfortable. That's not okay. If you decide to leave her a cute housewarming gift or whatever else has been suggested--I hope it goes over okay. Personally, I'd be both uncomfortable and unflattered. You live around her, though, so maybe you'll get more cues as to whether or not it's okay.",

At this point, I'll be surprised if you're not married by now, but at the wedding, be sure to write your vows and make them all about the dog's balls. In fact, make the dog's balls your best man. Tie two rings to them and retrieve them during the ceremony. \n\n8.)

Eventually the dog will die. Do NOT resist the urge to ask the vet to put the balls in lucite - in fact, the vet will probably ask you if this is what you'll want. In your saddest, but most appreciative tone, be sure to respond \"Your dog's balls.\"\n\n10.) With the lucite balls on the mantle of the fireplace that's in your house, be sure to have you, your wife, and the 10 children the two of you created, along with all of the male progeny of the dog with the balls spend two hours daily praying to the balls. \n\nI know you were already thinking all of this, so there was no need to type it out, but I figured I'd spell it out in case someone else needed some similar guidance.",

To show a bit of gratitude, I wanted to cook for her so I decided to go for something simple like a Chicken katsu.\n\nI've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. This is the moment I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs so I have to go to the convenience store to get some. I am somewhat decent in Japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? No.\n\nAs I walked in the store, I couldn't find the breadcrumbs I was looking for so I decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:\n\nMe: \"Sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?\" which literally translates to \"excuse me, where is da pussy?\"\n\nAt this point I didn't realize that I mixed \"manko(pussy)\" and \"panko(breadcrumbs)\". The staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking I was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. I repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. After the change of the staff's expression, I realized that I fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. I then explained that I mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.\n\nTL;DR I mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy",

My mom and dad asked the hotel concierge where we could get it done, they recommended a place, and off we went.\n\nAs soon as we walked in the door, we realized it was a sex shop. We were surrounded by hardcore fetish gear, toys, and porno dvds. But a worker greeted us brightly and confirmed that they indeed did piercings in the back. \n\nMy parents were permissive and liberal when I was a kid, so they just kind of shrugged, giggled with me, and let the guy lead us through to the back. A heavily tattooed, outrageously attractive woman pierced my nose, and although I did not yet know I was a lesbian, I was certainly *interested* in the way she apologized for the pain by saying, \u201cSorry sugar!\u201d in her lovely Irish accent. \n\nPiercing complete and a bit woozy, I walked back into the sex shop to find my parents, and spotted my dad standing in front of a wall of dildos.  \n\n\u201cChecking out the dildos?\u201d I joked, but to my dismay the man who turned to face me was not, in fact, my father. \n\nThis poor random Irish guy took a look at me and said uncomfortably, \u201cI\u2019m just looking around.\u201d Keep in mind that although I was 17, I am 4\u2019 11\u201d and looked about 12, so from this man\u2019s perspective an actual child had just interrupted his sex toy browsing to question him about his behavior. \n\nMortified, I threw up my hands and said what came to mind first, the most situationally absurd sentence of my life, \u201cOh my god, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014I thought you were my father!\u201d\n\nAs the man\u2019s face contorted in horror, the implication of what I had just said hit me, and I fled. I found my parents and shooed them out of the store. I told them what had just happened and they laughed all the way back to the hotel. \n\nTl;dr My parents accidentally took me to a sex shop to get my nose pierced, I jokingly asked a man I thought was my father about browsing dildos, the man was not my father and I apologized by implying that my father and I were shopping for sex toys together.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!

After about 15 minutes of his brooding shittiness and bad driving, I lean forward and ask \"What's the matter xxxx, hasn't your mum ever taken you to a sex shop?\" \n\nI could just about feel the rage coming off him like a furnace.\n\nDaughter's in the front seat snorting, tears running down her face trying not to laugh, hubby's got his hands over his mouth and is struggling to keep it together. \n\nNot another word was said. \n\nBoyfriend had no sense of humour and was a stuck up little prig. While we really didn't expect him to try anything on, we did expect at least a chuckle. Nope, he just showed us who is really was. A mirthless, bad tempered, pain in the arse.",

        "selftext": "This happened in high school at a summer band camp. I did not know anyone at this camp and I flew in from out of state. \n\nWhen I left the airport my best friend called me and we were talking. I had an inside joke with my best friend where we would just talk to each other in random accents for no reason. This time I was talking to her in a British accent. Little did I know that a group of people from my summer camp were standing right next to me waiting for the camp\u2019s bus to pick us up. \n\nI get off the phone and one of them asks if I\u2019m here for the camp too and I say yes. He then asks me where I\u2019m from and tells me that my accent is so \u201ccute\u201d. I had really bad social anxiety in high school and in my anxiety mind I thought this dude would think I\u2019m weird for faking an accent. He was also cute which made me more nervous. \n\nI totally panicked and just said, \u201cEngland\u201d. Then he asked me what part and I said, \u201cLondon\u201d. Then, thinking he\u2019d ask if I flew in from abroad, I said I was raised in London and then moved to the US. That was where the lies started but not where they ended.\n\nThe entire bus ride to the camp this guy was talking to me about british TV shows like Doctor Who and I keep faking the accent. So we get to the camp and by now I\u2019m thinking I HAVE to come clean and say it was just a bad joke, but for some reason my anxiety is going NO DONT DO THAT ITS TOO LATE YOU ARE BRITISH NOW. \n\nEveryone in the bus had heard my accent and me talking about how much I love Doctor Who and the London theater (never been). So for the entire TWO MONTHS of this camp I pretended to be British. I even watched YouTube videos on how to fake a better accent and words to say to sound more British. \n\nThat guy and I become friends and we kept in touch. I never came clean. It\u2019s been TWELVE YEARS. For a while we kept in touch a lot and would FaceTime and I\u2019d fake the accent. We aren\u2019t as close anymore but we still talk over Snapchat sometimes and whenever I send him a Snapchat when I\u2019m talking I have to fake the accent. At this point I think I\u2019m stuck being British forever to him. He can never meet my other friends or family. He lives in a different state but if he ever visits where I live I guess I\u2019m faking the accent. I wish I had never faked the accent.\n\nTLDR; Panicked and ended up faking a British accent at a summer camp in high school where I made a friend who I kept in touch with. It\u2019s been 12 years and he still thinks I\u2019m British.\n\nUPDATE\u2014 Wow I did not expect this to blow up and I\u2019ll try to respond to more comments after work. I answered the dialect question in the comments but it\u2019s buried and people keep asking so: \n\nI didn\u2019t pick a dialect but I did have the brilliant idea to say my dad was French Canadian and we spent a few summers in Canada when I was growing up. I thought this would explain it if my accent sounded off to anyone because I would\u2019ve grown up hearing his accent too and taken on some of it. Obviously looking back on it now that wasn\u2019t as clever as I thought at the time lol\n\nUPDATE #2 - I did it. I sent him this post and told him. Turns out he sorta figured it out years ago because he saw my dad post something on my Facebook page that made him suspicious, he did some googling and quickly figured out my dad had always worked in the US. My dad is a university professor so his cv/work history is easy to find online. There are even videos of my dad talking at conferences, clearly with an American accent. \n\nAnyway my friend said he suspected for years and just didn\u2019t want to embarrass me and thought it wasn\u2019t worth bringing up because we weren\u2019t super close anymore when he figured it out (Nothing romantic ever happened between us btw, I just had a slight crush on him that summer. We\u2019re both actually married now). \n\nI apologized for lying to him and he said it\u2019s fine but he\u2019s never letting me forget this and I have to do the accent if we see each other in person again lol. I\u2019m glad I came clean but I still feel really bad and embarrassed about the whole thing. Honestly I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be cringing to myself about this for the rest of my life lol",

I have GAD and basically just extreme anxiety in general so I had my whole monologue memorized by the time it was my turn: My name is Hobbitracer, I have one beautiful boy, I work at BLANK and I\u2019m taking this class because I\u2019m studying English. \nIt came my turn and I stood up, unable to feel my limbs and mind a buzz of dizzy fear. \u201cMy name is Hobbitracer, I have THREE CHILDREN and work at PLACE IVE NEVER EVEN BEEN and I\u2019m here because I\u2019m STUDYING PSYCHOLOGY...\u201d\ud83d\ude36\u201d \nApparently, I had subconsciously absorbed the information that the previous girl had given and combined it with my own for no particular reason. Everyone thought it was such an amazing coincidence that we both had 3 kids, worked at the same place and was studying for the same degree. \n\nObviously I had to stick to it, I\u2019d just said it in front of everyone. Over the next few months, I \u201ctransitioned\u201d out of that place I apparently worked and switched my major so I was back on track. \n\nBut there was no getting away from having said I had 3 kids (when in fact I only had the one). I had to make up names, ages, birthdays, and excuse their absences whenever I met someone from class on the street or in a shopping center. I refused to add anyone on Facebook or other social media because they would wonder why only one kid was pictured. I purposefully didn\u2019t get close to anyone in that class and was constantly paranoid that I\u2019d be found out.",

When he moved out of WV people looked at him like he was an alien so he was too embarrassed as a kid and would hide it.

        "selftext": "To make a simple story simple, i was laid off due to Covid killing the industry I worked in. In the past month or so Ive hit a bit of a slump emotionally. \n\nI havent reslly done much lately but binge Read Dead Online trying to gring my level up. I dont have social media other than Reddit. And I honestly cant recall seeing any articles about any hurricane. I also dont have cable, just paid services like amazon prime and netflix.\n\nFinally, a few hours ago I ran across an article about a hurricane headed for Louisiana. I looked it up on Weather. Com and it now appears I am in the unsurvivable zone of a storm surge. \n\nSo not sure what to do at this point.\n\nTL:DR- Isolation due to Covid, depression, and video games made me oblivious to the fact that a hurricane was headed directly for me. Now its too late to leave\n\nUPDATE: \n\n- A friendly redditor dm\u2019d me the location of a gas station that still had gas. This allowed me to gas up while the eye was over Lake Charles and the storm wasnt so bad.\n\n- Ive made it 3/4 of my way to Shreveport where I will be staying, out of harms way. The storm is bad but im ahead of it now\n\nFrequently asked questions:\n\n- My phone battery. I honeslty wasnt without power that long before I left, and I have this cylinder shaped thing that you plug into the wall and charge and then its like a portable charger and you just plug your phone into it, and its like a whole new charge.\n\n- Did I really play RDR2 that much? Unfortunately yes. I got lost in finding collectibles and leveled up to 70 in a few days\n\n- Was there no emergency text sent out to my\nIphone? You know I started thinking about this after someone mentioned it, and it seems like my phone did go off at like 11:30pm last night or the night before, but i didnt read it because I thought it was an Amber alert and I was asleep.\n\n- Did I get drunk on American Honey? No, i took like one slug off of it before communicating with the gas guy and then I knew i would be leaving soon.\n\n- Why did I go back home? After finding no gas, i was too afraid of getting stranded in an unfamiliar place in a storm. I thought mt chances would be better in a place I knew and where I had my things at my disposal.\n\nThank you all for the concern, advice, and words of encouragement. Rest and know that I am safe and will be more aware of current events in the future.",

I live in the south, people talk *all damned day* about hurricanes. There was a fucking state of emergency declared man, they basically went doorknockin.\n\nTake this as a sign from G-d. Unplug your shit, start reading *some* news (even if it's just local daily shit, it doesn't have to be that political garbage), clean your place thoroughly when you get back, and make some friends (No excuses with this COVID shit, get a penpal, hell, you can have my number). \n\nYou got a second lease on life here, don't squander it mashing buttons.\n\nI'm not being hateful, but if one of my buddys did something this life threateningly dumb, we'd be having the same talk, because I care about them.

            "Not as bad as OP, but I've been there. I had one particular weekend that I disconnected entirely from the world and played solo games on my PC while holed up in my bedroom. Ordered delivery food or cooked what I had so didn't go out. Didn't even see my roommate for 3 days. \n\nSunday evening I realized I hadn't done my weekly shopping trip and was running low on groceries to get through the week so I went to the local store for some stuff. I noticed it was kind of busy in the store for a Sunday evening just before close, but didn't really think much of it. When I got home I fixed a sandwich or something and finished an episode of whatever show I was binging, then crawled in bed. \n\nAbout a half hour later I get awoken by a phone call from my roommates brother to let me know roommate is stuck on the nearest highway exit... what? I don't understand. Stuck how? Do I need to go get him? Frustrated noise and phone cuts off... wtf is going on?\n\nSo I drag my ass back out of bed, get dressed, and leave to go check on my buddy. Fuck. There's 4 inches of snow and ice on the ground. Where the fuck did all this come from? I was just at the store an hour ago!\n\nYeah, apparently just after I left work Friday night the weather forecast for \"possible flurries\" in the North GA mountains had changed dramatically and I hadn't a clue. ATL was entirely shut down for 2 days and didn't really get back to full business for 4. That snow and ice literally dumped out on us in less than a half hour and I had no clue it was coming since I'd spent my entire weekend with my head in the sand.

The duties are simple for reserving tables, write down the name, number of adults and children, and the estimated wait time. We get about two hours into my shift, and we're rapidly growing our list. I'm doing my usual, making small talk, big smiles, 'how's your day, jeez look at that weather, we'll be ready for you in ten minutes' yadda yadda. Then this humble looking father strolls on up, he's polite, and asks for a table for two. I jot down his name with a smile and reply with the sentence that will stay with me until the last molecule of my maggot-ridden corpse finally rots away: 'And one kids menu, yeah?'\n\nSuddenly his brow furrows, and he looks like he's ready to tear me apart. Now I'm 6'2 190lbs, never feel threatened by anyone, but the look on this previously soft humble man's face put the fear of god into me. As I stood there confused, contemplating what I was rapidly assuming could be my last moments on Earth, he leans in close and utters a simple sovereign: **'No.'**\n\nAs my brain rattles around in my skull trying to piece together what he is aggressively objecting to, my peripherals finally decide to do their job and draw my brain's attention to his child.\n\nShe's not a child at all, she's his wife, and *she's a dwarf.*\n\nShe's refusing to even make eye contact with me, she's just fighting back tears and looking sheepishly away.\n\nI can't even.. I'm literally just frozen. It's like my entire body was trapped in a factory reset for what seemed like ten solid seconds.\n\nOnce I realize how long I've just been staring at them like a frog, I manage to regain control of my body, and open my mouth to try and formulate some sort of panicked spastic defense, but the pair swiftly turn away and disappear into the crowd like Hannibal Lector at the end of Silence of The Lambs. I'm just standing there staring at the spot they once were, suddenly finding the air horrifically thin, as I wait for my eyebrows to return from the back of my head.\n\nSo yeah, I definitely ruined this poor woman's night, if not her week, I have no way to rectify my actions, and I am at an utter loss for words.\n\ntl;dr- I mistook a dwarf for a child and offered her a kids menu.",

As in, maybe you get to see one or two in your lifetime. \nThe kit became sort of a joke as a useless purchase that will never be used. \n\nBut then like three years after our inauguration. We have our first little person guest. And we're all like \"holy shit, we can use the kit we have in storage\"\nSo after he's checked in, the bellboys took the kit up to his room. \nWithout exaggerating, we probably made that man's week.

Her husband suddenly speaks up from beyond my shoulder and says, \u201cI\u2019m Leslie.\u201d  It had never occurred to me to consider that he was the patient and not her.

I don't understand why so many people have no empathy, but I'm glad you do and know this was a FU OP.

            "This lovely time, a few years ago, I worked as the hostess at my families little pizza parlor. I basically worked the register, took orders, made salads, brought out orders, cleaned the dining room, yadayada..This particular day will  forever haunt me. An older couple came in, they were locked in arms, and the man had dark sunglasses on. \n\nI welcomed them with my usual choice at of phrases, pointed to our menu behind me, and waited for them to make a decision. The man asked me what they had for pizzas by the slice (we were well known to be one of the only pizza parlors that served pies by the slice in our area) I once again pointed to the menu behind me, but more directed at the pizza by the slice area of the menu. \n\nMy now ex mother in law tapped my arm, quite ferociously I might add, and tried to point down at what the man had in his hand. I didn't understand what she was trying to get at, so I proceeded to point out at what was written on the board, suggesting that what was WRITTEN on the board was among some of our most popular pies by the slice. \n\nThe wife looked at me in sort of a, I can't believe you way, grabbed a to go menu and proceeded to walk her husband over to a table so she could read the menu out to him. My ex m.i.l. and my ex brother in law took me back into the kitchen and told me that that man was blind! I now noticed that what he had in his hand had been his feeling cane. \n\nI felt like such an idiot, and I definitely gave my ex m.i.l. second hand, embarrassment. Not even, it was definitely first hand embarrassment. My ex b.i.l. proceeded to laugh his ass off at me. I was trying to get him to read the damn menu by his grown self, not knowing that he wasn't able to see it. I'll forever cringe at the thought of this story. My ex m.i.l. proceeded to finish taking their order, as I was too caught up in embarrassment.",

When I was like 18-20ish (I don\u2019t remember when exactly)I was going to the movies with my mom. The guy at the ticket office asked if we wanted one adult ticket and one child ticket. The worst part was that I had actually gone to high school with the guy, he just didn\u2019t recognize me.\n\nAnywho, we laughed it off after getting over our surprise, and I asked if I could still get the child\u2019s ticket\u2014it\u2019s like $4 cheaper c\u2019mon! But he said no. \n\nSo, I think the person would have to have been used to something like that happening or at least not entirely surprised. Based on what you say your reaction was, I don\u2019t think they thought you did it maliciously, it was just a mistake as you didn\u2019t actually look at her.",

I wanted to homer blend into the bushes. It seemed like forever I just stood there like... do I apologize about his hand? Do we acknowledge that I just offered him a hand and he doesn\u2019t have one? Fuck it\u2019s such a stupid expression. Why did I say that?! Gah, my silence is making this even more awkward. \n\nHe laughed and said it\u2019s okay and then with his one hand reached out for the rags I was holding.

The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.\n\nWhen you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.\n\nTL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule.

They are generally always on a throwaway account with no prior post history, they sometimes but rarely respond to being called out, they never provide proof, and then the stories just.... don't quite make sense. They do if you don't think about it, and most people tend to prefer feelings over thoughts so the posts do well for that reason. \n\nThey are usually very fluent in English but their word choices give me a vibe that its not their native language. Extremely subtle hints.\n\nAs I said, this is just recently only. Not sure if anyone else has been noticing. Reddit is super gullible though so I'm afraid what level it could escalate to.",

There's plenty of subs for creative writing where you can spin your tale to everyone's delight, but you can't farm karma or fulfill your role play fantasies with the same exposure you can here I suppose.",

Frustrated, I shot back with \"How about I pay you $445 to suck my dick and we'll call it even?\". Satisfied I hung up and went back to work. About half an hour later I get a call from my mom, I am fresh out of college so she still manages my home owners insurance, asking why I just offered the State Farm agent money to suck my dick. Turns out that wasn't a scammer and instead was a legitimate agent trying to tell me my policy was about to be cancelled because I forgot to pay my bill.

But my kid had just moved out so I apparently overestimated how much to buy so it didn't all fit in the linen cupboard. My darling spouse started storing the extra in the garage. But I didn't know this as I never go in there.\n\nSo I kept looking in the linen cupboard and seeing we only had a few rolls. And then increasing the subscription. And even buying extra packs one-off because I thought we were out. And spouse kept stashing it all in the garage without me knowing. After almost 2 years of this, he finally begged me to stop buying TP because we were running out of room to store it! So for the past year and a half I have not bought TP at all. As all the coronavirus panic was building I thought, \"well at least my earlier stupidity means we don't have to fight crowds for TP, as I am sure we have enough. We will NEVER run out! We can share with all our friends and neighbors!\"\n\nWell, turns out we actually had FINALLY gotten through the huge backlog of TP. And as luck would have it, the first time I genuinely need to buy TP in well over a YEAR, it's this week. FML.\n\nI suppose the bright side is I was equally stupid about subscriptions for wipes and paper towels, so I have been able to give those away to needy neighbors.  They all think I am brilliant and prepared. They have no idea it's just because I am dumb.\n\nEDIT: to the 60+ people that mentioned I should get a bidet, yes, I agree. Except I do live in a severe drought area. Also, the garage is detached from the house and not where the car goes, and is used for storage only. None of my stuff is in there. Mostly camping stuff and my kid's stuff they didn't take to school. And even if I did go in there, the TP was out of line of sight. So no, I really didn't see the stack for years.  Spouse and I talk plenty, but just not about TP!  ;-) He trusts me to buy stuff and I trust him to put it away when it arrives. We just got too good at our jobs! Plus he's a little bit of a prepper so he didn't think to ask me to stop until we had a LOT, lol!  And for the weirdos who need to know: about 2 rolls per week. Yeah, that's a lot, but there are medical reasons. And lastly, I am amazed how many other people on here have had the exact same type of accidental hoarding experience. And how many ran out at equally inopportune times. I feel better knowing I am not alone. \n\nTL;DR: After three years of accidentally having a surplus of TP, I happened to run out entirely THIS week and can't find more to buy.",

        "selftext": "\n\n\nA few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.\n\nI suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.\n\nI was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.\n\nI saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.\n\nIt was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.\n\n*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*\n\nThe bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.\n\n*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.\n\nNope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.\n\n\"Hey man are you alr-\"\n\n*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*\n\nTo his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.\n\nSo, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*\n\n**Fuck.**\n\n**Me.**\n\nThe door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.\n\nI can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp.\u00a0I just wanted to look like a normal human being.\n\nTL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will.",

You did all that, and in a brilliant way.\n\nAs a regular gym rat, I\u2019d like to share my perspective with you.  Anytime I see someone new in the gym, I secretly cheer for you.  I see someone trying to make a change for the better in their life, stepping out of their comfort zone, and trying something new and scary.  I remember my first time in the gym.  I felt lost, intimidated, and worried I\u2019d be doing something stupid.  So now I look for opportunities to help new people in the hopes of getting them through the awkward phase so they can continue on their journey of self improvement.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for all gym rats, but at least the people I work out with all feel similarly.

I've been rescued by the safety bar for squats and bench-presses.  \n\nFailure is part of the game!  \n\nYour next step is to head over to /r/fitness and poke around.  Get a weightlifting program like Stronglifts 5x5 and build momentum.  Build a habit.  Keep going to the gym.

You tried to get out alone, and imo, that is your only mess up.\n\nThere are other people there. Weight lifter courtesy is helping people out. You can always call out for help. There is *no* shame in asking for a spot, or calling for help when trapped. The only people who will hold that against you are the gym Dicks\u2122. And those guys violate every bit of gym etiquette they can, on purpose.\n\nOf course everyone laughed. It's a fart. Farts are funny, especially to people who lift the kinds of weights that make you vomit or crap yourself. This happens *a lot.* I've thrown up three times from heavy weights. I always managed to get to the trash can or bathroom, but it's happened. I've watched a guy PR on his deadlifts. He farted on the brace. I laughed. He laughed. He got his PR anyways.\n\nEvery single person waited until you were out of the building to laugh. You owned what happened. I guarantee that most of the people there that witnessed it actually kinda respect that. They weren't laughing at you, they were laughing at the farts. \n\nGo back to the gym, but do it sober. Ask the guy that helped you out for a spot. Build those gym relationships on the foundation of those farts. It's OK to be embarrassed by that. You've already owned it, keep doing so. ",

            "This writing is spectacular. I was laughing obviously loud in the middle of a volleyball tournament. Well done ",
            "Okay this is right up there with my favourite stories of all time. \n\nFirst of all, mad props to the people in your gym for keeping a poker face while all this was happening. You hear so many horrible things about people in gyms being Grade A Cunts to other people - like that bitch snapping photos of a lady in the shower, or a group laughing at a fat person on the treadmill, whatever - but my experience has always been closer to this. People are just doing their own thing, having their own challenges, trying to get through their workout, and not there to act like middle schoolers. But damn... the clap *ALRIGHT* has to be what pushed them over the edge. I'm imagining that as you left, one person inadvertently made eye contact with another and just LOST it, which set off a chain reaction. Can you imagine the tension levels in that room as everyone tried not to look at each other or you while you deflated like a whoopie cushion? Bless their hearts for trying.\n\nSecond, you are all of us. This is a nightmare everyone's had in one way or the other - it's the \"naked at work\" dream or the \"why am I on a toilet in the middle of a room full of people\" dream or the \"I just tripped and fell, spilling every marble in the world\" dream. Only you were there for the best of reasons and earnest as can be... If I'd been there I would totally have wanted to go over and be like \"Dude, are you okay? That was hilarious, so please don't feel bad. I once fell off a stairmaster. Want to come do some cardio with me?\" \n\nI remember the first time I got back in a pool after many years of putting on weight, and not swimming for exercise (I'd been in the water, but recreationally). When I was younger, I swam athletically and was extremely fast and in exceedingly good shape. Now, however, I was more whale than dolphin... but nobody told my brain that. I was expecting to be able to do something I'd always been a natural at. Get in the pool, do laps, glide through the water, technique perfect. Front crawl, here I come. What happened instead was I did one lap, flapping around like a drowning pelican because I couldn't breathe because I was so out of shape, and indeed my body was in an entirely new shape that didn't do what I told it to do. I got to the other end where there were many, many people nearby and was breathing so hard they were staring at me. So I had to pretend not to be out of breath, of course, like any vain person. I headed back for a second lap which nearly killed me, and then I got out of the pool and walked back to the locker room having done a grand total of two laps, trying not to open-mouth pant and instead breathing through my nose so people wouldn't know how hard I was breathing... Which of course made me breathe like a raging bull. \n\nVanity thy name is /u/goodhumansbad. \n\nI also once fell down a flight of stairs at a museum fundraiser (imagine one of those grand, sweeping staircases with a red carpet in the centre of a mezzanine, so EVERYONE SAW IT). It was attended by the city's most glittering beautiful people, who were all in masks as the Cirque du Soleil performed in-crowd. Because I was wearing 4\" heels and the stairs were carpeted, and there were footmen lining each side where the handrail was so I had to walk without holding onto anything, aaaaaaaaaaand the carpet was slick, all of a sudden WHOOOOOP feet went out from under me, smash onto my ass, slide down about 8 stairs, came to a rest. Two of the footmen (it was a themed masquerade) came running over, and mumbled the usual \"Are you alright???\" while helping me up. I graciously smiled at them as though I had dropped my purse and they'd picked it up for me, rather than dropping my own ass like a drunken aunt at a wedding, and said \"Oh, thank you so much.\" and as though nothing had happened, continued walking down the stairs to the lobby. I literally wanted to die - when people talk about wishing the ground would open up and swallow you... Yeah. That.\n\nBut I can now tell the story and laugh, a mere 10-15 years later. Point is, your clap *ALRIGHT* probably has been told to more people than you can imagine as the funniest goddamn story that witness has in their arsenal, just like me going ass over teakettle down the stairs has... and we should be happy we continue to make so many people sound funny at parties!\n\nEdited for typos",

We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her \"carnal sins\". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. \n\nSo thanks to that confession, that's how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the Deacon's daughter. \n\n*Edit: Thank you for the Silver & Gold!* \n\n*Edit: Okay, gawd damn. Some of you are sick of all the sex posts. Noted.* \n\n*Edit: A few of you are asking how my old man reacted. Every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of God. Being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. I was forced to listen to \"rehabilitated\" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the Bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in Christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time.

I was actually going to her church at the time because I knew this day would come and I couldn't let her confess without me or else the story would be twisted.\n\nWell, the bishop made her confess anyways then called me into his office.

Mom and dad standing around her, the lead pastor close by.  It was designed to show how accepting and loving the church was in spite of whatever sin you got wrapped up in but boy it sure was an awkward introduction to that particular church.

He broke up with me right after and I was confused and sad and talked to my friend about it because I needed support. She talked to her mom who was close to my boyfriend's parents. Her parents then blackmail me by saying if we didn't tell his parents, she was going to tell them herself (Note - I was 19 and he was 21). I also had to tell my parents before they found out from a 3rd party. So this is how we (as consenting adults) had to actually tell our parents what happened.

Then when I realized she was nuts, I got out of that relationship and a few months later started dating someone new. Time goes by and new girl and I are engaged.  One day I get called into my bishops office to discuss a serious matter. Turns out Ex-girlfriend has gone to her bishop (separate congregation) and told him all the dirty details of our sexcapades. He then phoned up my bishop to let him know of my evil deeds. Fun fact, when my bishop tells me the name of her bishop that called him to report me, he\u2019s got the same last name as my fianc\u00e9. I connect the dots that it\u2019s my fiance\u2019s uncle and pray to the good Lord to take me now.  \n\nAnyway, I won the bishop roulette and got off with a slap on the wrist, but I\u2019m certain that what happened is ex-girlfriend pulled that stunt after significant time had passed as an attempt to sabotage my degree, my engagement, and my reputation with my in-laws as a proper Mormon boy. Family gatherings were pretty awkward for a while whenever I ran into that uncle.\n\nFor context, pre-marital sex at BYU can easily mean expulsion, kicked out of your housing, and temple wedding is off the table unless you go through a lengthy \u201crepentance process.\u201d Or you can be lucky like me and have a chill bishop who isn\u2019t a narc.",

Suddenly my dad bursts in the door and tells me he has to show me something.\n\nI\u2019m like \u201cwhat\u201d and he tells me I have to come look at the TV. There\u2019s a lot of crazy news on these days, so I\u2019m like \u201cwhat\u2019s up.\u201d He tells me that CNN is doing a report on the stock market and it\u2019s hard to explain, but he wants me to come take a look at it. Right now. He emphasizes that I have to come quickly. \n\nNormally, I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see, but I figured maybe something interesting has happened, like happened to GameStop earlier this year. Plus, it couldn\u2019t really hurt, and I wasn\u2019t doing anything anyways. So I decide to humor him, get up, and follow him to the living room. \n\nI am immediately greeted by 4 realizations:\n\n1. The TV is on, but it\u2019s not playing CNN\n\n2. It is in fact MTV doing a throwback night. They\u2019re playing 80\u2019s music. \n\n3. The Never Gonna Give It Up music video is been playing.\n\n4. I have been rickrolled by my father. \n\nFuck.\n\nTurns out my brother had told him about the meme, and I was the unfortunate victim of his first attempt. The most old fashioned rickroll I\u2019ve ever seen, and I have to give him credit for it. \n\nTL;DR: Dad told me I had to come look at a stock report CNN was playing. Turns out it\u2019s MTV and he rickrolled me.",

It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.\n\nIt was our first Valentine's Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.\n\nI decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. \n\nI needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...\n\nThis is when things begin to go wrong.\n\nAll of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)\n\n\nSure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.\n\nWe're both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. \n\nFight or flight kicks in and I know I must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. I'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. So when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, I go balls to the walls.\n\nI grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting\n\n*CLACK*\n\n\nOnce he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. I drive him to the hospital\nAnd sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded\n\n\"Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.\"\nSo not only, on our FIRST Valentine's Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder. \n\nTLDR: Had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",

There was no one else in the public area so I took off my top - he was so worried someone would see me so he gave me the shirt off his back (literally) and was walking me back when\u2026 we ran into a few of his upperclassmen friends. \n\nYou can imagine their faces.

        "selftext": "This happened yesterday in the UK while we are going through the hottest heatwave on record. It's 4PM and I'm minding my own business in my back garden tidying my shed when i hear somebody trying to get into my back gate. I peek through the gap to see an elderly woman looking very hot and distressed, she notices me and starts shouting please help me, please help me. I can't open the gate, so I tell her to go to the front door. I ran through the house and told her to come in and take a seat while I get her a glass of water.  She's mumbling gibberish and rocking back and forth. Tells me she is lost. I suspected she had heat stroke and was suffering from delirium and exhaustion. Poor woman, thank god I saved her.\n\nI pop upstairs to get a damp towel and the fan. When I return I find the woman sitting on my sofa, smoking a cigarette, masturbating. Great.\n\n\"You can't do that\" I yell in bemusement but she carries on, telling me how nice it feels. \"Can you lick my clitoris?\" she asks, to which I said no way and she needs to leave. \"Do you have a dog?\" I see my chance to get her out of the house. \"Yes I have a dog, come with me\" and I managed to get her up and out into the garden.\n\nShe collapses onto the floor. Making gagging noises, telling me she's going to die, still with her hand between her legs. It is 40 degrees and I myself am struggling to be fair, so I know she will be in trouble if I don't get her out of the heat. \n\nI call 999, they take 5 minutes to answer, and eventually they tell me there are no ambulances. \"Is she breathing... is she conscious... OK then, if she passes out, put her in the discovery position and fan her, then call us back and we will try to hurry up.\"\n\nShe keeps asking for the dog and that she wants us both to make love to her. When I try to move her into the house she keeps grabbing me and trying to kiss me. What the hell am I going to do?  \nThe hospital is a 5 minute walk, so I make the decision to get her there by carrying her or she is going to die from heat stroke. So I tell her I know a really nice dog across the road and I'm going to take her to it. Her eyes light up and she heads with me out of the garden. \n\nI get her to put her leggings on and begin to walk to the hospital while being sexually assaulted the whole way. 999 rings me back and I tell them the plan. The closest door is the ear and throat department or something like that, so I carry her in there where there is air conditioning and sit her down. I shout for help and a nurse appears, she fetches some water and I leave her in their capable hands. They all seemed to know who she was and apparently she had been on the mental ward. As I walk out she yells \"Where is this dog to lick my clitoris??\"  The nurses look puzzled, I shrug my shoulders and walk out. \n\nI return home, lock all the doors and gates, and have a shower to wash the woman's sweat and fanny juice off me. I've not seen her today, hope she is feeling better.\n\nIf the mods so wish I can verify the story with video evidence as my house has Nest cameras, but I won't post these publicly for obvious reasons. \n\nTLDR: I let a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She turned out to be a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to masturbate on my sofa and sexually assault me\n\nEdit 1: Gonna leave in the typo of recovery/discovery, I believe they call that a Freudian slip\n\nEdit 2: Getting lots of requests, so here is a photo from my back garden cctv: [https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q](https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q) The inside video with sound is much better but will remain unshared, sorry.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all the awards. I won TIFU of the month! I\u2019ve not seen the women again, and my friend who works in A&E has never seen her either. I hope she is OK. \n\nFor the dozens of you asking about my garden, I did most of the work myself!

Old lady in slippers sort of collapsed against the doorway and asks to come in and sit down. I let her in, sit her down and she tells me she has asthma. I also have asthma if I get a cold or infection, and fetched my inhaler and asked if it was the same as hers. She replies that no, it isn't but a shot of brandy usually makes her right.  \n\n\nI am dubious about this but go and get her a shot of brandy and bring it to her. And another. By this time my then husband comes down and asks what's going on and I explain. He asks her where she lives, but she's determined to get more brandy. He says she can't have any brandy can we phone someone for her? She says no, she's very comfortable here. We explain that we're going to work and so she needs to leave.... She refuses.  \n\n\nJohn helps her up but then she grabs the side of the sofa saying \"Ma name's Bernadette BUT I'm NOT LIKE THE SAINT!\" No shit Sherlock.\n\nJohn had to manhandle her out of the door with her grasping the side of the door, the stair bannister, the edge of the porch etc. She seemed pretty feisty with two large brandies inside her and not at all in need of help.

The next door neighbors had a girl who was a year or two younger than us who had come over to party a couple times. One time, she shows up and is clearly on something. She sat on the couch, put her hands down her pants and started playing with herself. Then she started trying to kiss the guy on the couch with her. He was defending himself for a bit, until her hand came out of her pants and she reached for his face, at which point he jumped up and got away. Idk of that was when she started getting upset or not, but at some point she did start getting frustrated with us telling her that she needed to leave. She also went to the kitchen, grabbed a jar of pickles out of the fridge and started eating them by hand (yeah, that hand), out of the jar. \n\nEventually she was forcefully told she had to leave and suddenly she couldn\u2019t walk. A couple guys walked her home and most of us walked with them. Apparently the mom thought she had been drugged by us and was throwing out rape accusations. Luckily, some of the people there were women and talked to the mom about what happened and she later apologized. Pretty scary shit. Also pretty eye opening for what could have happened if there wouldn\u2019t have been any girls with us.",

You're a better person than me. \n\nA few years ago, a man began aggressively banging on my front door asking/demanding to be let inside because he was cold (it was below freezing outside) but there was no way I was gonna let that guy inside. Instead, I called the police. I informed him of this and he walked away. The police came and searched the area but didn't find him.

On the other hand, based on his aggressive tone and demeanor, I feel justified in not wanting to let him in my house, especially since my mom lived with me. \n\nIf it happened again, I think I still wouldn't let him in, but I would put some blankets, hand warmers, and warm food outside for him (after asking him to back away).",

        "selftext": "Still processing this one since it took place about five hours ago. Me (45M) and my wife (47F) have been married for about 5 years and have a combined family. Most of our kids are half time with us and half time with their other parents. Anyway, my 20yo step-daughter's room is just down the hall from the Master Bedroom. About 6 weeks ago, she started sleep walking and wakes standing in random places, she even woke up in the kennel with our dog once (yes I know it's super strange).\n\nBecause my wife and I are trying not to scar the kids, we wait until they are all asleep before we have sexy times. Many times this means we go to sleep and then wake each other up in the middle of the night for sexy time. Last night was one of those nights. When we went to bed (between 8 and 9 because we get up at 4am to workout) kids were still up and milling around, so we figured we'd wait until the middle of the night or have a quicky before we went to the gym.\n\nA few hours later I wake to a stiffy pressed up against my wife's backside and decide it's game time. Within a couple of minutes we are deeply into it and a few minutes later we know it's about time for the grand finale. My wife breathlessly tells me the words that every man around the planet loves to hear \"I want to finish you with my mouth\". I practically jumped off the bed and stand there as my wife gets on her knees to give me a toe curling BJ.\n\nI am going to interrupt this story for a moment to give another little factoid. My wife was a single mom to four girls for many years prior to meeting and then marrying me. Her and her daughters are pretty immodest around the house. I'm constantly asking them to put shorts or sweats on.\n\nAnyway, there I am standing naked beside my bed. My wife is on her knees sucking my soul out through my dick. My eyes are closed my head is back and I'm just about to release when I get that weird feeling that I'm being watched. I open my eyes and see my 20yo step daughter standing three feet behind her mom in a tank top and panties. I reflexively pulled back from my wife's mouth which caused her to grab extra hard the next thing I know I'm spraying my load all over her face while I'm looking directly into my step-daughter's eyes. My wife is trying to be playful and thinks I'm just feeling kinky and I was just trying to cover myself. My step-daughter just stands there for what seemed like an eternity before saying \"holy shit\" over and over and walking out of our room and back to hers. Of course as soon as my wife heard her daughter's voice she became much less playful and everything got deadly serious.\n\nSo now I've gone to the gym, am sitting at my desk working and my wife has been in talking with her daughter for the past couple of hours. Honestly my only fuckup was the timing. But it did happen today, so there is that.\n\nTL;DR My wife and I had middle of the night sexy time, sleep walking step-daughter walked into the room and watched me frost my wife like a cake.\n\nFollow Up: They are done talking came out of the room laughing and stuff so I guess no harm no foul. My wife said the three of us should sit down later and talk about the what happened and that her daughter has some questions.\n\nEdit: To all those wondering why I added the part about how my step-daughters dress. At the time I was worried that my wife was going to be thinking I was a freak for nutting as soon as I saw her daughter in her panties. That didn't happen at all, when I mentioned it to my wife she waved it off. If I were to write this post now I would leave it out, but it was important to my mindset at the time.\n\nEdit: People are claiming that it's been deleted, but I still see it and haven't tried to delete it. Any how, I just tagged it as NSFW (something I should have done in the beginning, but I didn't know) maybe that fixes things. I'm enjoying some of you funny sick people.\n\nEdit: Well we just had an hour plus conversation. My step-daughter was just wanting to clear the air (she was a lot more mature about it than I thought she would be). She asked a couple of questions about how often is normal and stuff like that. I don't want to get too specific, but all of her questions centered around how far my wife and I pushed each other's boundaries sexually. We were open and honest with her about it. Turns out she is not a virgin (I am actually surprised) and the first guy she was with was very pushy. The guy she's with now is very laid back, but maybe too laid back. We told her to be vocal with him about what she wants. I think she understands, but my wife is going to follow up on the conversation later.\n\nBTW, she did not even realize what was going on at first. All she saw was that I was standing there naked. It was when I saw her and started to freak out that she understood what was going on.. My wife and I have already stripped the bed and are washing the sheets and comforter. I am shampooing the carpet this afternoon and there are spots on the wall that need to be washed. My wife found some of my material in her hair... at work she sent me [this pic](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xLxBjV-kW_8/UI2KgL4_O_I/AAAAAAAAG8U/yMWE-6BXi8I/s1600/Cameron-Diaz-There's-Something-About-Mary-Ejaculate-Hair-Gel.jpeg).\n\nI got back on here and this post is at almost 10k and my inbox is screaming for mercy. I'll try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\nOK, I'm disabling inbox replies. I can't believe that my (by far) most upvoted post is about my wife and I nearly emotionally scaring my step-daughter. Be well everybody.",

I know it\u2019s overpriced coffee and a poor financial move, but I felt like treating myself today. \n\nSo I\u2019m walking into work, an iced coffee in each hand, and a coworker greets me. He notices the two coffees and says \u201cdouble fisting coffees today, eh? Man you love that place.\u201d For some reason I was immediately embarrassed by the fact that I had bought two large iced coffees for myself. So, I lied about it and said \u201cactually they accidentally made me 2 and gave me the second for free, so I guess it\u2019s two coffees for me today.\u201d\n\nI thought that would be the end of it, but then he, thinking I had a happenstance second cup of coffee that I didn\u2019t need, asked if he could have it. Being the nice guy that I am, and not wanting to be caught in a lie, I gave it to him, pretending like I probably wasn\u2019t going to drink it anyway. \n\nSo I essentially bought my coworker a large iced coffee today. There was absolutely no reason to be embarrassed or lie about this lol. Why am I like this??\n\nTLDR: I bought two iced coffees for myself, was embarrassed about it so I told a coworker that one was a free one made by accident. He then asked for it, and I gave it to him because I didn\u2019t wanna get caught in a lie.",

The only person I feel\u00a0comfortable\u00a0goofing around with is my boyfriend.\n\nWe were having a perfectly nice summer day today. We went on a walk, did some necessary grocery shopping and started leaving home. Before going I needed to use the\u00a0bathroom, no big deal. My boyfriend will just wait for me outside.\n\nMy boyfriend told me he'd wait for me by the car. I leave the store the sun in shining and I\u00a0don't\u00a0have my sunglasses but I can see him standing close to our car with his back facing me. I decide to surprise him with a really firm grab on the ass, making sure he could feel my enthusiasm through the grope while\u00a0seductively\u00a0whispering \"nice ass\"\u00a0finished\u00a0by a dumb overexaggerate\u00a0moan. Fucking hilarious, great move on my part.\u00a0\n\nThen I hear a loud \"What the fuck\" in an unfamiliar voice and my boyfriend turns\u00a0around\u00a0and well.. it isn't him. It's a much older man wearing all black like my boyfriend. That wiped away the stupid grin on my face real fast. I'm completely speechless. I don't know what to say. I just stare at this poor man\u00a0whose\u00a0ass I violated.\u00a0\n\nI could feel my face turning red and I start apologizing\u00a0profusely\u00a0while trying to explain the situation in a panic. A little further away by our car I can see my boyfriend walking towards me almost tripping for laughing so much. After what felt like forever the man also bursts out\u00a0laughing\u00a0saying it's fine that I'm glad I liked his ass.\u00a0\n\nI couldn't laugh even if I wanted to. I\u00a0was horrified. I still am. My boyfriend thinks this is all too funny not to share but I'm going to stay\u00a0anonymous\u00a0doing so.\n\nIf the man\u00a0whose ass\u00a0I grabbed happens to see this I am so sorry. Just know that a part of me died today and this gave me another reason to never leave my house again. Social distansing no longer feels difficult in any way.\n\nTLDR: \u00a0I went to surprise who I thought was my\u00a0boyfriend\u00a0with a firm ass grabbing followed by a moan only to find out he wasn't my boyfriend. I'm now dying from\u00a0embarrassment\n\nEdit: Wow thank you everyone for sharing your funny stories keep them coming, me and my boyfriend are having a blast reading all of them! I'm glad that I'm not the only ass grabber around It's really helping me with the embarrassment.\n\nEdit: wow this blew up thank you for all the nice comments and the awards. I'm able to laugh at it now thanks to all of your stories so thank you. I truly felt horrible and\u00a0embarrassed\u00a0for what happened and yes the situation could have been worse if the genders\u00a0were reversed\u00a0or if the\u00a0recipient\u00a0of this mistake didn't take it so lightly. Thank you for everyone who can see when people make an\u00a0actual\u00a0mistake and can distinguish that from an actually vile act. I shared this because the man didn't take it seriously and laughed with my boyfriend about the accident and no harm\u00a0was done\u00a0apart from the shame I felt. And yes rBangerz YT you can use this story for your video, thanks for asking me beforehand I appreciate that.",

I see one of my coworkers that I have a good connection with (construction job) so I decide to slap his ass and walk off.

My wife slept in the hospital bed, I spent on the couch/bed/thing, and out son was in a medical bassinet between us. Night 3 my wife gets out of bed to take care of crying baby I didn't wake up for. I grab her butt gently and tell her I love her. It's not my wife but it's the nurse that just woke up the baby for meds. I'm in complete shock and horror and I fell back asleep before I finished the word \"sorry\". I found the nurse the following morning, apologized, and gave her a big bag of crispy Eminems.

            "LMAO, that username checks out. You dirty dirty ass groper. Unfortunately I can top that.\n\nHad a drunk woman try to put her finger in my butt while I was taking a piss at a local lake. My gf and I had the day off work and decided to go swimming. There weren't many people there and I guess I resembled him enough for her to make the mistake. But I was taking a piss in one of the stalls with no door and I had just pulled off my wet swim trunks. So here I stand minding my own business and this chick sneaks up on me, throws one arm around my waist and pushes herself against me which my first thought was my gf trying to be funny but she whispers \"Wanna have a little fun\". Instantly I knew it wasn't her and thought \"WTF\" but before I could react she pulled me in hard, grabbed my ass, and tried to shove her finger in my chocolate starfish. It puckered hard enough to make me stop pissing and I went vertical then screamed \"WTF lady\". She instantly realized her mistake and her face just glazed over like she was having war flashbacks and she started crying and apologizing incoherently. My gf thought it was hilarious and for years would sneak up behind me and do it. I figured eventually she would make the same mistake then Id get the last laugh.",
            "We were at Disneyland in Paris 20 or so years back. I was a kid, the type that doesn't like being told where to go, and even less a fan of holding hands with parents in the amusement parks. I don't remember all the details but I was probably being a pesky little shit as my dad was already annoyed and out of patience  before I had to go to the bathroom. And a decided to take my sweet time. \n\nI get out, look around for my parents as I hear this kid scream, a kid that kinda looked like me. Same color jackerlt and jeans, same age, more or less same height. The kid was being pulled along by.. my dad. I went to my dad's free arm, pulled his jacket and asked who that boy was.\n\nHe looked over, angry turned to confused for a brief moment. Then to horror as it sank in that he was dragging someone else's kid through the park. \n\nAt that moment some concerned parents came running over and as soon as my dad let go the kid bolted to them. My dad had some explaining to do. Luckily the father understood the situation and had a laugh, the mom tried to comfort the kid which kept hiding behind his dad as mine tried to apologize.\n\nFun memory for me, not so much for the other kid and my dad.",
            "Oh I\u2019ve been where you\u2019re at. I tend to do spontaneous ass-grabs to my spouse. We were at a convenience store picking up snacks, and out of my peripheral, I saw him bend over to look at things on a lower shelf. So I absentmindedly reaches over and palmed a cheek. \n\nMy spouse then walks up to me and asked \u201cWhatcha doing!\u201d with a grin on his face. I look over to where my hand is, and a dude with a rather bemused look on his face was standing where I thought my spouse was. \n\nI was mortified, to say the least. I mean, I\u2019ll happily grab a nice ass of random strangers, but I always ask consent first. He told me I made his day, at least.",
            "When I was much younger my dad took me to an arcade. He liked playing pinball and I would play whatever a 10-11 year old would be playing. So anyway, I just used my last quarter and needed more so I looked over and saw my dad playing pinball with his back to me. Looking back, it would be weird to put your hand into your dad\u2019s front pocket and grab but I think it was probably worse that it was a stranger. They did not seem to appreciate it, from my recollection.",
            "One of my friends and I look pretty similar and there was a time we dressed with the same style. Once we ran into each other at the store and he was with his girlfriend (I\u2019m sure you all know where this is going). After we said bye I was looking at something in a random isle when I feel someone grab my hand and arm and say something like \u201coh I found you.\u201d I look down and it\u2019s my friends girlfriend. She instantly goes \u201coh my gosh I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d and just bolts. She was a super shy introverted person as well and I could tell she felt super embarrassed. Ran into my friend again in the store and me and him were busting up laughing while this poor girl was not too amused. I told her it was fine and don\u2019t worry about it. \n\nNo joke 1-2 weeks later it happened again but at some random social gathering. Come to find out she has bad eyesight and was getting glasses soon.",

We were in a dim underground viewing area and i'd wandered off looking at the whales.\nAs I came around full circle I grabbed my wife's ass and said \"Hey mother want another\" in my best 70s TV cringe voice. \nYou obviously know where this is going.\nThe woman turned around looked up and me and said, no thanks, I've already got a son your age. \nI'm white... so white I'm sure I lit up that room, if that didn't my dinner plate eye's sure did.\nThen she reached up and patted my cheek, \"you are cute tho\".\nAll the blood that had drained from my face rushed back with extra. I scanned the room found my real wife, noted for the first time that the stroller she had (grandson I found out later) wasn't even the same colour as ours and beelined it for her side before I got arrested.\nCue \"What was that all about? Why are you so red? Etc.\nAt lunch the nice lady ends up a table away and the two women start chatting up a storm.\nI went to go find the monkeys. \n\nIt's been 30 years and I still cringe.",
            "When everyone started slowly re-entering society from quarantine to go for walks and bike rides, my son and I decided to go for a small car ride. We were by my brother and sisters-in-laws house which had a bike path nearby. He\u2019s blonde with tattoos and she\u2019s a petite tanned girl with dark hair, and rides a red bike. We see them riding their bikes down the path parallel to the road. I roll down the window, and big sister style start yelling out, \u201cboo, you suck!\u201d  We often joke like this. My son starts yelling some insults as well. The couple stops their bikes and looks at us confused. That\u2019s when I realized that although this couple very much looked like my family members, they were in fact not them. I yelled out sorry, not sure if they heard me and drove away. \n\nTo the innocent couple out trying to enjoy some leisure exercise after being being couped up for months of quarantine; I am so sorry.  We are nice people, really!",

            "Many years ago, back when my wife and I first started dating, we were in high school. I saw her walk by, but she didn\u2019t notice me. I decided to sneak up behind her and give a big hug. I approached as she turned a corner, and as I saw her profile, I realized it wasn\u2019t her.\n\nSo there I am, standing with my arms outstretched in the middle of the high school hallway, completely frozen in shock as people walk by looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. Which, if I\u2019m being brutally honest, isn\u2019t entirely incorrect.\n\nI told my wife and she thought it was great.\n\nA few years later my wife was in college. She walked into the library and reached behind her to close the door. She feels something strange; like rough fabric. She feels around, but the doorknob isn\u2019t anywhere to be found.\n\nShe turns around and there\u2019s a very confused looking young man, and her hand is on his groin. He looks down at her hand, then looks up at her wordlessly. He looks down at her hand again.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d she says. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s... okay,\u201d he says as he walks away.\n\ntl;dr: My wife and I keep trying to start an open relationship by accident.",

            "That reminds of the reverse of that. While at Wal-Mart when my wife and I were still dating, we decided to get some alcohol. It was after midnight, so the store was pretty dead. I walked over to the next aisle to get something frozen to eat when I heard her scream and saw an old dude limp  away super fast.\n\nApparently, he came up behind her and grinded himself against her backside, something I had done before. She smiled and grinded back and reached around and felt a hand that wasn't mine. That was 15 years ago, and she still doesn't want to go shopping without me.",

So when my sister in law was in town visiting she was standing in our kitchen when I came home from work. I walked up behind her and gave her a big hug from behind and started to kiss her neck when it hit me \u201cfuck!\u201d. Really embarrassing but her and my wife have a good sense of humor. I\u2019m just thankful I didn\u2019t do anything worse.",

We live on an island in the sun and are both mechanics and so we both walk around barefoot and generally dirty. I walked up behind him, grabbed his arse (with added middle finger to butthole for effect) and whispered seductively in his ear \"hello Daisy\", my nickname for him. As the name Daisy was leaving my lips my brain registered his neat new docksider shoes, socks, clean shorts and pressed polo shirt. I absolutely terrified that poor vacationer.",
            "I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a TIFU situation.\n\nI was in a large mall about twenty years ago, just browsing windows and stopped at a jewelers\u2019 window to look at watches. I had noticed there was a couple at the same window, but didn\u2019t pay much heed until five seconds later when she put her hand in my coat pocket and slipped her fingers between mine. I turned my head and was about to say something when the guy behind me, my height and dressed almost identically put a finger to his lips with a smile.\n\nAnd then she started to walk away with me in tow and her partner right behind me, answering her questions while we were walking. I don\u2019t know for how long it took, but to me it felt like an hour (in reality it was probably more like a minute), before her partner moved to her left side and asked her where they should eat.\n\nShe answered, probably grabbed his hand and then after a second or two tensed up and yanked her hand out of my pocket with suck force I thought she would rip the stitching.\n\nMuch laughter ensued, mostly from her partner, along with many many apologies from her to me and him to her for letting her do that for so long.",

His mother comes over laughing and apologizing, all while trying to explain that I look like her husband. \n\nMoments later, the husband comes down the aisle wearing glasses, a dark green t-shirt, black sweatpants, and white runners. We are twinsies. He smirks as he walks past and says \"I like your style\". \n\nA couple of minutes later, I was grabbing a jug of milk and I hear him approaching me and laughing hysterically. He managed to get an apology out through the tears, sweat, and wheezy laughing.",

            "I got one: I used to work in a small grocery store restocking when the store was closed. I was in my mid twenties, and a single, straight dude working with a bunch of other single straight dudes. We all partied together after work and were all pretty good friends. So I was walking around on a ten minute break when everyone else was working and I walk up behind my buddy and start sensually massaging his shoulders then whisper, \u201cyou wanna get a drink tonight, big boy,\u201d breathily very close to his ear. He turns around and it\u2019s the new hire who started earlier that day. I don\u2019t get embarrassed easily so I didn\u2019t really care, I just thought it was kinda hilarious. The new hire was a tad bit traumatized I think, but he did end up coming out for a drink with all of us when the shift was over and joined the weird dudes at work crew.",

Im a 22F and a coworker of mine is a very skinny 24 y/o gay man and we regularly play a game of drive-by poking each others butthole area unexpectedly. So I walk into the alley and he\u2019s bent over looking for a soup plate so I wind up and put my fingers so deep into his ass crack and thrust my hips into him. Then I hear him talking behind me. I turn around confused and he sees where my fingers are placed in a different coworkers ass crack who for some reason has the same body structure bent over. Everything was in slow motion at this point so when I turn around the coworker bent over stood up with his ass clenched hard enough that I barely snatched my fingers back in time. He owed me money for taking a shift and he was so embarrassed all he said was \u201cGeez, Ill get you your money\u201d and pulled $30 from his wallet. \ud83d\ude2d",

A few minutes after she left I thought that seemed like a good idea so I went to the store, too. Spotting her in the produce section I snuck up behind her and gave her a good hard squeeze. She very calmly turn around and says \u201coh, hi.\u201d She had no idea it was me, she just didn\u2019t have a strong reaction at all to bringing groped in public. We had a good laugh about that.",

            "Actually, I have a similar story. I saw a close friend of mine at her locker and went to surprise her with a hug. It turns out it wasn\u2019t her, but her sister. She\u2019s triplet, and two of them are identical. It was also a Wednesday, so they were both in the JROTC uniforms with their hair in a bun. She did understand she they were so similar (though their friends, including me, could tell them apart from the front), and though it was funny. I was so embarrassed, though.",

It was the end of the day, everyone was leaving school and I thought I saw one of my friends that has pink dyed hair. Seeing the back of her head, my mind went \u201ctarget confirmed\u201d, so I sprinted up and prepared to do a sick slide and greet her with \u201cwassup bitch\u201d. As I slid beside her, I saw her face and quickly realized that it was indeed not my friend, but some other girl who had pink dyed hair. She laughed it off, but I was super embarrassed and I still think about it to this day.",

            "I was dating a girl in college, and I was over at her place a lot. One evening I walked into the kitchen and saw her doing dishes with just the light over the sink on. I decided to go up and grab her tenderly by the shoulders and give her a kiss on the neck except... it was actually her roommate who's of more or less the exact same height and build.\n\nSimilar ending, she turned around and said \"What the hell??\" and upon seeing the look of horror on my face burst out laughing. She pretty much instantly knew exactly what happened (did this happen a lot I wonder?). I never lived that down for as long as they were living there together.",

He gets to the bottom of the hill and bends over to undo his bindings. I can up from behind and wound up for a good strong ass smack. \nSame thing: it was an older man who looks nothing like my bf, only wearing similar colours, and was quite shocked.

            "A girl I know grabbed my then husband's ass at a BBQ thinking it was her husband. She apologized a million times and I laughed and told her it was ok. She was related through marriage to my cousin's husband so I saw her a few times a year at gatherings they had and it always seemed she avoided me. A couple of years later I mentioned to my cousin that I didn't think she liked me very much and my cousin told me she thought I wanted to beat her ass. I'd completely forgotten about the ass grabbing thing and couldn't imagine why she thought so because I'd always been friendly to her. It took a few years before she was comfortable with me, even though I'd gotten a divorce by then.",

We both have the same hair color, and from behind and in the usual safety gear we looked close enough for him to try this while I was drinking from the water fountain on my break.\n\nWhen I yelped and spun around, he went white as a sheet.  He was stammering and just as freaked out as I was until his wife came around the corner. Until she showed up I really didn't believe him and was just trying to get away to anywhere with other people.\n\nAfter that, I could kind of laugh it off.  It definitely freaked me out, but it wasn't HR worthy.",

I forget how but I got split from her for a minute.\nNo big deal, we are out and walking up the hill to the party. There's my wife chatting with a friend, so I decide to full on sprint up this hill and smack her ass hard. Not hard painful, but hard like full on thick contact.\nShe jumps two feet in the air, (and I'm sure u guessed) turns around. I hear cackling behind me and just blut 'your not Beth'.\n\nMy wife is standing there losing it after wondering why I sprinted up the hill right pass her. Thankfully, like I said it was an interesting bunch. So she laughed it off as well.\n\nAnd that is why I rarely slap her ass these days (outside the bedroom \ud83d\ude09)",

Her excuse was she was putting some sweets in my back pocket. I go red and than her. I was a single guy at the the time, and an IT techy (however not my first rodeo).\n\nAnyway a bit later, due to it being a school for special kids, they hosted a Christmas assembly and had Santa asking the kids what they wanted whilst sat on the knee.  A group of teachers tell me to go and do the same (so keeping in the spirit of the day I duly obliged).\n\nIt turns out to the woman who grabbed my ass earlier.  Now she was older than me and was hot. One eye a different colour than the other, which I found out whilst sat on her knee.  She asked me what I wanted for Christmas, so I whispered in here ear, \u2018I want you\u2019, she giggled and I got off..\n\nA few nights later and it was that staff night out Christmas party.  A few drinks were consumed and I had fun of tasting the female colleagues lipglosses. Turns out she was there and was wearing the best flavour.\n\n\nWe been together since for 10 years.

She didn\u2019t tell her boyfriend (who was coming back from the men\u2019s room) so when he walked up to where they were and hugs my mom from behind and essentially grabs her boobs. My mom screams and they both pull away horrified and my auntie is just laughing her ass off as she saw everything while walking back from the bathroom. To this day my auntie brings it up and laughs about it. My mom was around 15 and my auntie and uncle were about 17 at the time. They are in their late 40s and still find it funny."
