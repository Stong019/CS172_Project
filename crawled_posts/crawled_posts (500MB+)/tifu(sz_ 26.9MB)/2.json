        "selftext": "I'm a professional housecleaner in a large city. My first house today was beautiful and pretty big (4,000+ sq ft.) I had never cleaned this house before today. \n\nIt's kind of interesting to clean the home of people you have never actually met while they are not home. I never snoop but I do learn about people just by the state of their house or whatever is out. These people seemed like they really needed us. I would guess they are busy and don't have much time for cleaning and organizing (but definitely have an active sex life judging by the master bedroom).\n\nI love cleaning dirty houses and was like amping myself up doing a mini Rocky training montage warmup and finding the perfect music to work to (Pantera). I was sweating like 4 hours in but I was getting this house spar\ud83d\udc4fka\ud83d\udc4fling! All I had left to clean were the floors when a man walked in. \n\nI welcomed him home and let him know I just needed to clean the floors and would be finished soon. He looked super confused and then kind of grinned and asked if I was his birthday gift.  I didn't really know what he meant. Maybe his wife scheduled the service on his birthday? I just answered with, \"maybe? Happy birthday, Mr. Henricks!\" To which he looked even more confused and told me his name was not Henricks. \n\nWell. That's because his next door neighbor, my actual client, is Mr. Henricks. I walked my happy ass into the wrong fucking house and cleaned the hell out of it. And then the guy who lived there came home and thought I was a sex worker role playing as a housecleaner hired by his wife as a birthday present. \n\nI was so totally embarrassed explaining myself to this guy and my boss.  (The entry instructions in the app said the client wouldn't be home but that there was a key under the mat. There was no key under the mat but the front door was unlocked \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). This is not even the first time in my life that I have let myself into the wrong house, although the first time was not a work thing.\n\nOn the plus side, dude was so happy with how clean his house was that I finished the floors and he paid me what my company would have charged him plus a tip!\n\nTL;DR; I disappointed a man who wanted to get laid by a maid.",

I was looking around the house deciding our strategy. Dude comes in freaking tf out, screaming at us even after we explained 5009 times we were at the wrong address. He sent my entire team outside, wouldn\u2019t let them back in to help me carry equipment, and then kept screaming at me to \u201cget the fuck out\u201d even though I had to carry everything myself (several buckets of cleaning supplies plus a vacuum, mop, and broom, and also my supervisor binder) wouldn\u2019t even let me make a second trip. Fucking psycho freak. \n\nKept demanding to know what we were \u201creally doing there\u201d. The company name was literally The Maids. We were driving a company car that was bright fuckin yellow with the name emblazoned all across it, and all wearing uniforms that matched the car. Please use a brain cell dude. I even showed him on my GPS how I typed in the address I was given and how it brought us to where we were. Once outside we were packing up the car to try to get tf out of there and he tried to demand all our IDs and said he was \u201cdetaining\u201d us til the cops got there lmfao. Nah. Bye pal.\n\nThe weirdest part about it was when I was exploring the house (trying to locate all the bathrooms, my sheet said 2.5 bathrooms and we could only find 2) I went down to the basement thinking there was a half bath down there and I came across a room with nothing but a bare mattress on the floor in the corner and a lamp. Nothing else. To this day I wonder if there was a more sinister reason he didn\u2019t want us in the house. \n\nThen we got to the house we were supposed to be at right down the road, and a few minutes later the cops showed up. Rural sheriff gets out and immediately starts swinging his dick around, acting like we\u2019re complete idiots even tho I explained the GPS thing, and acted like I was completely ridiculous when I told him it was standard procedure for us to just walk into a client\u2019s house. Lots of people would leave doors unlocked for us and have us lock up when we left, or they\u2019d leave us a key. Almost all our customers, actually. He wouldn\u2019t believe me until he\u2019d spoken to my manager. Fucking ridiculous. Even the owner of the house we were supposed to be at told him that GPS gets their address wrong all the time, and that several visitors had ended up at the same wrong address. So people had gone there by mistake before more than once and the dude had still refused to believe any of it. Fucking assholes both him and the cop.",

        "selftext": "So do you guys know those waterslides that you stand in, and then they suddenly drop you straight down onto the water slide? If not, look them up on YouTube, there's nothing like them.\n\nAh yes, the sweet memories of my first time on one of these. I feel that my mental/emotional scars have healed enough to tell this gem.\n\nAt the time my girlfriend, now Fianc\u00e9e, worked as a photographer for one of those resorts with the indoor and outdoor water parks. One of her perks was that her and a family member/friend could get into the waterpark for free, so one hot summer day she had off and we both decided it'd be fun to go there and cool down for the day.\n\nWhile we were there, I discovered one of there most \"Thrilling\" looking waterslides. Basically you stand in this tube, and then the slide operator presses a button and this slide drops you straight down a good **90 FEET**, before you actually start going down the water slide. Me, being a thrill seeker, of course had to try it. So I made the great climb up to the top of the slide, stood in line, and finally it was my turn. Once I got in the tube, the operator told me to keep my legs crossed. Now I'm a pretty big heavy guy, so I was like \"That's uncomfortable as fuck, I'm not doing that\". So there I was standing in the tube, having a panic attack from anticipation, with my legs not crossed. The operator finally presses the button, the bottom opens and I fall straight down the water slide. Very quickly I realized why they have you cross your legs. Water shot so far up my ass, so fast, I swear I tasted it in my mouth. My body raced down that slide, as I questioned every life choice that I have ever made.\n\nOnce I made it to the bottom, I sat there for a moment, absolutely violated. I felt like someone in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. I built up the courage to finally stand up, and all I could feel was the nice warm stream of water mixed with shit, and maybe a little bit of blood shoot out of my ass faster than the Steamboat Geyser at Yellowstone National Park. I quickly got off the slide and ran to the bathroom, with a trail of shitty water tailing me as the slide operator stared in awe. They had to shut down the slide for the rest of the day :'), but man was my asshole clean after that!\n\nMoral of the story: Keep your damn legs crossed on waterslides.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Went on a waterslide that drops you straight down 90 feet. My ass was violated by the force of the water. As I got off the slide water, shit, and blood proceeded to shoot out of my ass and they had to shut it down for the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for blowing up my post, like I blew up the water slide guys :)\n\nEdit 2: For those of you who are wondering, this occurred at Camelback Resorts on Paradise Plunge (Such an ironic name....) which can be found [here.](https://www.camelbackresort.com/waterparks/poconos-pa-indoor-water-park/slides/) It is in fact a 60 foot drop, but my ass says 90.\n\nFinally: Yes I saw the other waterslide post and the comments on a different sub reddit. That post is what inspired me to share my own experience here which is actually quite a common one.",

I think it was Bobsled themed, but I am not sure what it was called. \n\nI am certain I was the biggest guy to go down at the time. I climbed onto the giant tube/raft/bobsled thing and took off down the slide. I was MOVING when I hit the first banked corner, I went so high up the bank I swore that I was going to fly right over, plunging to my death. But instead I did some kinda wild X-Games flip, landed with my back against the slide, and the tube on top of me. I am sure it looked totally kick-ass to anyone watching.\n\nI proceeded to go down the entire rest of the slide faceup and backwards, fighting to get the giant rubber tube out of my face.\n\nWhen finally hit the pool at the bottom the lifeguard fished me out, and said something like \"duuude are you okay?

Dude is acting up and the second before I pull the lever he takes of his shorts to go bare bottom.\n\nFriction and some sand on the tube make sliding naked trough the tube feel like you are going trough sandpaper. Midway trough all you can hear is pain screams. When he finally finishes the fall his ass is covered in bruises and small cuts.\n\nHis shorts were still hanging on the top of the tube ... dude had to be rushed to the infirmary bare bottom with his ass red as a watermelon.",

            "A few years ago I had a nasty flu. I woke up and felt terrible. I went pee while having a discussion with my wife, washed my hands, and started to walk out of the bathroom.\n\nAs I got to the bathroom doorway, I started to feel lightheaded. My wife approached to see what was wrong (I had abruptly stopped talking) and saw me leaning against the door frame.\n\nThe world began to fade and I felt my balance slipping away. I have low blood pressure, so sometimes I get a little lightheaded. I figured it would pass. But things just kept getting darker until I couldn\u2019t see anything.\n\nMy wife tried to hold me, but I went completely limp and I was too heavy. The last thing I remember was the feeling you get in your stomach when your car goes a little airborne over a hill, followed by a dull thud and the sound of teeth clacking together as a jaw snapped shut. The last thought I had was, \u201cBoy, that probably hurt a lot. I hope that guy didn\u2019t get hurt.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was nothing for a minute or two. It wasn\u2019t warm or cold. It wasn\u2019t even dark. There was just nothing.\n\nThen I heard my wife\u2019s panicked voice, screaming, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me!\u201d\n\nI tried to tell her to calm down and that I was fine, but distressingly, I couldn\u2019t talk. I didn\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t, but sound just wasn\u2019t coming out. I tried to open my eyes, but I couldn\u2019t.\n\nMy wife left the room and I heard her talking on the phone. It sounded like 911.\n\nI tried to tell her I didn\u2019t need an ambulance, but once again, I couldn\u2019t move at all. I went through every set of muscles I could think of. I couldn\u2019t move my hands or feet, nor my arms or legs.\n\nI tried coughing, and it worked. I let out a small cough. My wife rushed back to my side. \u201cHe\u2019s breathing again!\u201d she told the operator.\n\nI tried talking, but I still couldn\u2019t. I coughed a few more times to let her know I was still there. After a few minutes I was able to roll myself over, and gradually the room came back into view.\n\nI was taken to the hospital and they ran a battery of tests. They weren\u2019t able to find anything wrong. Their assumption was dehydration.\n\nI told my wife about what the experience felt like. I told her about how I couldn\u2019t move or talk. I told her that I tried to open my eyes, but they wouldn\u2019t open. My wife said, \u201cHoney, your eyes were open the whole time.\u201d\n\nTo this day, the terror in my wife\u2019s voice still haunts me. I cannot bear to do that to her again.",

        "selftext": "My top dresser drawer is a catch all for uncategorized miscellany that I\u2019ve accumulated over the years. It\u2019s filled with the kinds of random things that seem like a good idea to keep but have no use whatsoever in my day-to-day life\u2026 Like that track medal I won in high school, or a guitar string replacement tool, or that \u201cnaughty coupon booklet\u201d my wife bought me when we were still dating. You know, stuff like that. \n\nI was looking for something in there the other day and I came across the booklet. It was untouched, all coupons in tact. When she gave it to me, I thought it was a cute gesture but we were already doing all those things anyway so I tucked it away and forgot about it. Fast forward 15 years (many of those married with children) the novelty that was lost on me in the past suddenly came into sharp focus. Mental bookmark: This can come in handy, especially these days when \u201cthe spice\u201d needs all the help it can get. \n\nOne day she comes home from work. I was upstairs and I could just feel the negative energy rush into our house. The sound of her bad day could be heard in her footsteps. Her heels were aggressively clacking against the floor. I could tell from the combo sigh-growl coming from downstairs that I was about to get the business for something I didn\u2019t even know I did. \n\nI head downstairs and we say hi and ask about each other\u2019s day. Her\u2019s sucked, mine was great which automatically made things worse. As predicted, she starts to unload big time. It\u2019s brutal and I\u2019m just listening quietly, certain there\u2019s nothing I can say or do to make it better. She notices I\u2019m not engaging and asks what my deal is. I pull out the coupon booklet that I had slipped into my pocket during a hasty moment of questionable \u201cquick thinking\u201d and flip it to the blowjob coupon. I ceremoniously fold it along the perforations and tear it out, handing it to her purposefully. \n\nHer, confused and caught a little off guard: \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\nMe, pointing to the coupon: \u201cSee, \u2018Good for one blowjob any time.\u2019\u201d\n\nHer, livid: \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d\n\nMe, still purposeful: \u201cNo, it says \u2018any time.\u2019\u201d \n\nHer, shocked, face turning crimson: \u201c\u2026\u201d\n\nMe, doubling down and drawing her attention to the fine print which says: \u201cDrop your pants, I\u2019ll get on my knees and suck your dick with a lick and a squeeze.\u201d\n\nShe goes nuclear. NU-CLEEEEE-ERR. She snatches the booklet and tears it into smithereens. I\u2019ve never seen her so mad in my life. Achievement unlocked. \n\nThere is a 100% chance this MAY or MAY NOT end in divorce.\n\nTldr: Basically the title.\n\n\nEdit: Today I finally learned what RIP inbox means. I am sincerely grateful for all of the awards!\n\nA few things: This really happened. I absolutely positively knew there was no way in hell I was getting a BJ. My attempt at levity backfired, hence the TIFU. \n\nUpdate: Wife and I are back in the positive. Our relationship is far from perfect but we love each other. Our situation gets less Hindenburg-y as the years go on, but we\u2019re in it for the long haul. \n\nI tried to make it through most of the comments but holy cow there\u2019s a lot to unpack here. There are some pretty big conclusions coming from such a small post. For those of you who would find humor with your SO in this same situation, hang on to them.",

Definitely didn\u2019t look suspicious. When I was in the middle of an argument with an adult, this kid says \u201cyou sound so gay right now defending those abominations\u201d. \n\nI snapped and said \u201c I\u2019m bisexual you ignorant idiot\u201d.\n\nBest way to come out.\n\nAnyway, the realization didn\u2019t hit me until five seconds after. Currently I\u2019m in a bathroom typing this.\n\nTL;DR I went to church, defended LGBTQ people and came out of the closet in the worst way possible.\n\nEdit: First of all, thank you guys for the support. As for the people at church, we had a little talk. They said that this news are not very pleasant in the slightest, but I convinced them to think about giving LGBTQ people a chance. Some apologized to me, but others looked at me differently. My mother said she actually supports me :D! Again, thank you guys for the support, but I think I have to take a break from everything.\n\nThanks,\n\nA bisexual mess.\n\nEdit 2: After some thinking, I came to the conclusion that I have to say that you guys are awesome too. Some of you guys are probably going through some tough times too, and I just wanted to say that many people will support you no matter what. It also astonished me that you guys came over and supported a stranger that you will probably never meet and for that, you guys are strong and brave. Thank you.",

I saw the order for a fellow named Tom...funny thing the second half of the order is EXACTLY TO THE TEE what my gf ALWAYS gets. Two dragon rolls extra Siracha on the side and a large Ice Tee. She is very particular! She also has a co-worker named Tom she has mentioned AND she said she spent the night up in Denver with her sister last night for a girls night. Hmmmmmm....Picked up the order and was on my way. Pulled up to a waaaaaay nice apartments knocked on the door and a very handsome fellow named Tom answered. Handed him the food and heard a familiar voice say \u201cMake sure there\u2019s  Siracha!\u201d It was my now ex gf in a T-Shirt and panties. I said nothing she said nothing... door closed and well now I\u2019m single! And onto me next Dash better make that money if I\u2019m going to be back on Tinder.

        "selftext": "So this happened a couple of days ago..\n\nHad a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. After changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, I went to visit a dermatologist. Anyways, turns out I have a skin condition called Pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. So she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. Anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. After showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and I sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. I noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( Rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back REAALLLYYY good. So naturally I took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. Naturaly I decided to take it to the next logical level: Flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (Yes I know this sounds mildy retarded). What ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. I busted a nut so hard I started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and I fucking fainted. My parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a REAAAL worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. So yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. FML\n\nTL;DR: Found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided I wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. Came so hard I went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.\n\nI'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol\n\nEDIT: WOW I had no Idea this would blow up like this! Thanks for the golds, silvers and platinum kind strangers!\n\nPs: Am looking into becoming hair dryer sales guy now",

I do read every message and I most certainly care if you're going through something similar. I still get like, a lot of messages. I don't respond to messages though asking for medical advice for your cats. I love your cat too much for that. I certainly don't respond to messages if you also think you have tapeworms. I care too much about you for that. Pleaaaseee consult a medical professional and take your cat to a vet if you suspect something is wrong. With love, tapeworm girl.\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g3hmo4/tifu_wormageddon_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\nThis fuck up has been set up perfectly for disaster over the past few months and is continuing to destroy my life. This is a long one, but every detail counts in portraying one of the worst weeks of my life. \n\nLet me preface this by saying I love my cat more than anything, and while he is currently not sleeping anywhere near me, he's still getting a lot of cautious love. I can't imagine being self-isolated alone without him right now. Truly, I love him too much - too much love got us here today.\n\nIn January, I adopted an 11 yo, 19 lbs chonker. I fell in love instantly. His last family returned him after 6 months with a bad case of fleas. He had been defleaed but came home with a slew of other health issues. By end of January after a lot of vet visits, he seemed to be on the mend. I knew what I was signing up for when I adopted a senior cat, but just didn't realize the endless possibilities. Truly, I tell him every night before bed he's my ride or die, and that's about to be tested with this saga of the greatest love story ever told.\n\nEarly February, he starts coughing and stops pooping in his litterbox, despite me cleaning it daily. He's still peeing in there, but seems cautious and runs out immediately. Even when he started pooping on the floor (thank God for wood floors), he'd run under my bed from it. That was the only time he'd go under my bed, otherwise he was cuddled up on or next to me. His medical chart from when I adopted him said he had issues with litterbox pooping- they suspected he was afraid of his last family's other cat and it was behavioral, but something didn't add up. He was fine with pooping in the litterbox for the first month after his kitty enema. I cleaned up his poop every other day and saw nothing out of the ordinary. He was starting to lose weight, which was good because as cute of a chonker as he is, it's NOT healthy, folks. I stopped free feeding him, started feeding him scheduled wet food meals, and we had daily playtime to get him to a healthy weight.\n\nI bring him into the vet in February for the 6th time in a month and a half. He had half of his teeth removed before I adopted him. This resulted in an incision infection and an enema due to opiod constipation. This visit was for his cough. I even ask if he could have worms. The vet tells me, \"I know you're trying to be a good pet owner, but he likely has allergies and it's a behavioral issue. This might be something he has to live with. Come see me if his mucus turns brown\". I had been right about every single Dr. Google diagnosis up until this point, but whatever. I buy an air purifier, vacuum and clean regularly, change the bedding weekly- I already have an obsessive cleaning schedule, and COVID/quarantine has only allowed that the time to thrive. Ask any of my previous roommates and I am the cleanest person you'll ever live with. Despite the cleaning, some coughing days were better than others.\n\nAll of a sudden end of last week, he starts coughing a lot less, and I start feeling like absolute shit. My best friend even makes a joke that I caught whatever my cat had. Sick, sick foreshadowing. \n\nWhen I read the article about the tiger in the Bronx catching COVID19, I was convinced we both had it. My chest was tight, frequent bathroom runs, just pure exhaustion, losing weight rapidly despite being quarantined for a month in a tiny studio- malnourished to the point my hair is falling out. I'm a mess. I guess it's a good thing I got laid off 2 weeks ago, because the bathroom and I are very close friends these days. \n\nI wake up Monday morning to the pungent smell of my cat's usual poop surprise on the wood floor. He's such a kind cat to poop where it's easy cleanup. That's when I see them - worms crawling around EVERYWHERE. I'm gagging, take a little sample for the vet, and flush the rest. I Dr. Google the shit out of it and it is for SURE tapeworms. Then I read about the eggs. Let me remind you I change my sheets and wash my duvet cover weekly. I make my bed the second I get out of it and even vacuume my duvet cover. I RUN to inspect my bed- there are eggs EVERYWHERE. Little rice demons of hell that have been dropping from my poor cat's bum for 3 months. I'm dry heaving at this point. I live in an old studio apartment and my bed is against a brick wall, so I get little grout crumble patches that I have to vacuume up pretty regularly. I remember feeling little patches of what I assumed one night was grout in my sheets, but fell asleep wine drunk and ignored it. When I tell you they were everywhere, I mean they were everywhere. My pillow, under my pillow- my cat and I fall asleep cuddling every night. Again, I love this cat too damn much.\n\nI call the vet and it is undoubtedly tapeworm. We suspect he's had it since I adopted him. His prescription gets to me within a few hours. I also get flea medication and spray. I check him for flea dirt regularly and hadn't seen anything, but better to be cautious. I bag all of my bedding, throw out half of what I own, vacuum every inch of this place for an hour, I'm on the fucking floor with my flashlight and  find a dead tapeworm under my couch, Swiffer, disinfect my couch, flip my mattress- like total mental breakdown. I give him his medication and his cough stops instantly. He hasn't coughed once since Monday.\n\nThis has been one of my childhood phobias since I read that urban legend about the guy who starved himself then put a burger patty on his tongue and lured the tapeworm out until he could grab it from his mouth. I'm thinking about this story after giving my cat his meds when holy moly diarrhea. I look in the toilet bowl to 3 long strings floating on the sides that normally I would have flushed to sewage heaven without second thought, but they are undoubtedly tapeworms. My grown ass calls my mom and sobs while still sitting on the toilet in all of my wormy glory. I call and embarrassingly show the doctor, doctor undoubtedly tells me I too have tapeworm and writes me a prescription. He asks me if I want just tapeworm or a full deworming? I'm like wtf does that mean? He's like, \"You'd be surprised how many parasites are living in you regularly. Just wait and see what you're about to poop out\". I honestly just want to die at this point. \n\nMy cat and I are prescribed the same medication, obviously just different doses and different pricetags. His was $13 for two doses. Mine? $130 for one dose, 2 pills. That's WITH my last month of insurance from my previous employer. I immediately receive a text that my prescription is on back order because of COVID. I'm trying to fall asleep that night on my couch without any blankets, when would you fucking guess it- my heat stops working. So now I'm just shivering on a small ass couch knowing there's worms crawling around inside of me and eggs everywhere. I don't sleep. \n\nI call the pharmacy when they open in tears asking when my meds are going to get there. Lucky me, they had just arrived. He asks me, \"Did you know your prescription is $130?\" I'm like, \"Uh no I've never had tapeworm, but I guess the price is irrelevant\". We both nervously laugh. I also haven't had an in-person human interaction in a month because I've been self isolating alone and laid off due to COVID, so this is trying on soooo many levels.\n\nI order delivery for a big ass meal from my favorite restaurant because 1. I have no appetite because the thought of feeding the worms makes me want to die and I was hoping ordering from my favorite restaurant would entice me to eat. 2. Medication has to be taken with food. 3. I realize this is the last day  the calories don't matter. Might as well enjoy it. \n\nI pick up my prescription, light a candle, call my best friend, we have a little virtual funeral for my worms and try to make light of the situation. I play the song I want played at my funeral (Hamburg Song by Keane, it's beautiful). But it just keeps getting worse, y'all. My best friend hesitantly tells me he was telling his physical therapist about my worm saga. She recommended buying clove oil and rubbing it on my pink starfish. I'm like why? Apparently worms like to bite your butt on the way out, and clove oil prevents that. I hate everything at this moment. It's like the different levels of hell. \n\nI take the pills and am reading the prescription pamphlet. It notes that you'll experience random aches and pains while the worms are dying. Let me tell you- I felt every fucking worm dying as I lay blanketless on my couch in the fetal position. All of a sudden, I'm thinking about the worms and I can't breathe. My throat is kind of itchy, and I'm thinking there are worms dying in my tonsils at this point or I got COVID at the pharmacy. I'm laying there in the fetal position, telling myself it's just a panic attack. My cat decides to go pee at 2am, jumps out startled trailing pee all over the apartment. I know the medication says limit your alcoholic beverages, but I say fuck it and make a drink. I clean the pee and finally fall asleep for about 3 hours.\n\nI wake up bright and early to the smell of cat poop. Still half asleep, I searched his normal spots and couldn't find any poops. He left it in the tub for me- a new spot- thanks, cat. Easy cleanup and no worms- I take it as a win. I flush it down the toilet, bleach the tub, and obsessively wash my hands. \n\nLet me tell you- my hands are bleeding from the amount of times I wash them between COVID and wormageddon. I look at myself in the mirror while scrubbing my raw hands and holy shit. My face is is swollen to the point I'm still surprised I can see out of my eyes. My tongue is flopping all over the place. I am having a severe allergic reaction to the tapeworm medication. That panic attack while falling asleep was actually an allergic reaction. \n\nI immediately video chat my doctor, he tells me to go get Benadryl immediately and writes me a steroid prescription. I get a call from their finance department on the brief walk to the pharmacy: $140 for that 5 minute virtual visit. I try to dispute the charge- she can't do anything. I just flat out ask her: \"Can I just tell you about my shitty life then for $140?\". We talk for 5 minutes about how much my life sucks and she agrees. She was very nice about it, but still $140. She basically tells me that if I had waited a month to get tapeworm and almost die from the medication, the virtual visit would have been cheaper without insurance. Fucking love it and American healthcare. \n\nI cut my losses go back to the same pharmacy from the day before and they ask me what's wrong. I lift up my glasses and they were like \"Ooooof- did you know you were allergic to this medication?\". At this point, I'm like \"WHY DO ANY OF YOU THINK I'VE HAD TAPEWORMS BEFORE?\" Truly, complete mental breakdown. I buy my medication, a box of wine, and $20 worth of candy to ease the pain.\n\nSo folks, here I am. Unemployed and alone during a pandemic, clenching my butt like never before, still haven't pooped because I'm terrified of worm kisses on the way out, face still swollen shut, but I'm breathing fine. My cat is a new cat, so for that? I am grateful. I am 100% sure I will have PTSD from this experience. It is going to be a long, long, time before my cat and I snuggle regularly again, but I know we'll get there and I still love him. Adopt senior pets regardless of this story, because 10/10- would still get worms again for him.\n\nWormageddon 2020 will not soon be forgotten. \n\nTL;DR My recently adopted cat gave us both tapeworm, I almost died from the meds, and this is my hell.\n\nEdit: I'll come back and give more meaningful update, but I'm reading all of these comments over the phone, basking in the worst kind of Reddit fame with my best friend, and his smart ass says, \"Your tapeworm is going to come out of your butt and ask DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?\" \n\nBut really, y'all are too kind.",

            "Your vet really let you down. So badly. \n\nPeriodic deworming of all companion pets is recommended by everyone from the American Animal Hospital Association to the CDC. The periodicity differs due to geography and climate, but not the need to address the issue. \n\nYou were right to ask, and your vet gave you the most wrong answer possible. \n\nDeworming is *always* recommend when an animal has had fleas, been in a shelter or cattery, or is moving from one home to another. \n\nRoundworms and pork tapeworms are spread by oral ingestion of eggs. \n\nThe tapeworms that usually infest cats require an intermediate host. Transmission of these worms occurs when a mammal ingests an infected flea. \n\nHumans more commonly are infected with pork tapeworms from eating undercooked pork. \n\nAnti-helminthic drugs remove the parasites\u2019 protective coating, allowing them to be digested by the host. While you may pass some that are still in one piece, they are not going to \u201cbite\u201d on the way out. \n\nNow for the bad news. Adult tapeworms stay in the digestive tract, and are efficiently cleared by the medication. Their larva may move out of the digestive tract, where they may form cysts in the liver, lungs, eyes, or less commonly, in the brain. \n\nWatch your stool for the next several months for any signs of reinfection. Take any pain or illness seriously, and make sure to tell your doctor about having had a tapeworm infection. \n\nIn all honesty, while I understand that it\u2019s cost prohibitive, a sample should have been taken and the parasite identified. Cats and dogs are usually infested by *Dipylidium caninum*. Infection of humans is rare, but it\u2019s also easy to treat when it happens. Here\u2019s info from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/dipylidium/faqs.html#spread) about these parasites. \n\nInfection with pork tapeworm, *Taenia solium*, is more common in humans, and also more serious. Taeniads are more likely to migrate in their larval form and cause cysts. Here\u2019s information from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/taeniasis/index.html) about taeniasis. \n\nI am so terribly sorry you\u2019ve gone through all of this. It sounds truly horrifying. I would have been weeping too at that point. \n\nI used to be a vet tech, and part of my job was educating pet owners about parasites, and preventative treatments. If I can help answer any questions or help you find information resources, please ask. I\u2019m happy to help. \n\nI\u2019d also recommend that you find a new vet, who follows current guidelines on parasite control. And always cook your pork well.",

            "When I read this title , I freaked out because I JUST WENT THROUGH THIS.\n\nI adopted a 4 month old kitten, the shelter never told us she had worms. One morning I woke up to her PUKING worms on my bed, couch, kitchen counters, etc.. This was multiple times and her vomit was red tinged for some occasions. Those nasty bitches were tangled in balls and MOVING.\n\nI also panicked because I'm an insane clean freak and disinfect my apartment on the regular. One day at work I'm pooping and I find worms in my poop. I went to the urgent clinic and they literally think I'm fucking bat shit crazy. Also the meds were so expensive, like hundreds. And my vet was shocked I got them, and suspected it was from my bedding. I threw out everything in my apartment that would house eggs to those little hoezzz.\n\nAnyways, I'm apparently worm free and my cat has done about 6 months of worm treatments and we are still giving her medications, those fuckers won't die. She is still having pooping accidents and her anal glands were swollen, it's a journey :(\n\nUgh, I feel you, I'm sorry - feel better <3",

Terrible gases, diarrhea. Fatigue. Felt so sleepy all the time. I was afraid it could be the corona, but my boyfriend is fine and I wasn't showing any respiratory symtom. Besides, I live in a small town in Brasil, and we only have one confirmed case. \n\nThen, I thought I was pregnant. That's when I started to pray for it to be the corona virus. Finally, I was watching tv, and suddenly, my cat crossed the room dragging his butt along the ground. Like it was just another thursday morning. That's when I realized that he's been leaving poop pieces on the floor for the past week, and always scratching (he's an old cat. I thought it was an old cat's thing. Don't judge me). \n\nAnyway, found the eggs in his butt. Bought medicines for him and for me. The shocking part is that my medicine costed 6,70 reais. Which, in dollars would be something like $1,2.",

            "How did your vet not know your cat had tapeworms? Years ago when I adopted my cat, I took her to the vet for her first routine checkup and they asked, \"does she go outdoors or do you have a rodent problem? Because she has tapeworms\". They usually get them from eating snails outside or mice. I was living in an old house in an old city known to have mice. But the vet could clearly see the egg casings around her butthole, a telltale sign. She acted completely fine despite having worms. My cat is black, though, so maybe the white cases were particularly easy to spot. The vet gave her a pill and she was worm free. She didn't advise me on getting tapeworms myself, however! Makes me worry a little. My cat has never slept in my bed, though.",

Cats (and apparently humans) are infected with Diplidium species tapeworms by ingesting infected fleas. The other species is Taenia which cats get from hunting wildlife... people can get it from undercooked meat but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a concern in commercial meat. There also a nasty type called Echinococcus but cats don\u2019t get that.",

It seemed odd but I was relieved I didn\u2019t have to pay for a vet visit I couldn\u2019t afford. \n\nSo I went to the pharmacy and kindly asked for some deworming medication. I was mildly taken aback when the pharmacist asked, \u201cFor dogs, cats, or humans?\u201d thinking how could humans in France be getting worms so much the meds are OTC? But now I know.

After several incidents, she had meds on hand and would de-worm me and go about her day.\n\nShe tried figuring it out, had the dogs confined to one space, washing everything (I think I am solely responsible for her strict cleaning obsession now.) She caught me eating dog food and thought that was it.\n\nUntil she REALLY watched me playing outside. (I had a pen/cage because I was the epitome of naughty). Usually my grandmother babysat me, but as long as I wasn't screaming and crying I guess they figured I was good.\n\nI was eating grass. Like a cow. Grass that was most likely pooped on by birds, cats, dogs, etc.\n\nThat's been 30+ years ago, so it'll get better-from one worm survivor to another!",

It's even more relevant if your cat had issues with being scared of the litterbox bcs of the kitten in his previous family.\n\nMy go to to clean is to first burry it under sodium bicarbonate if it's wet (I usually have to deal with puke) and then sweep that out and sanitise with some more bicarbonate and white vinegar. You can pre-mix the two in a spray bottle with some water and add something that smells nice (orange or lemons rinds or a few drops of essential oils or whatever) to always have it ready to go. \n\nGood luck with your kitty !",

            "OP if you chose the tapeworm specific medication (Praziquantel aka Biltricide) you wouldn't have to worry about the upcoming bowel movement. That one works by essentially dissolving the tapeworm(s) inside you and it's over and done fairly quickly. \n\nThey might have prescribed you albendazole or mebendazole which are broad-spectrum anti-helminth meds. Those are the ones that take longer to work (up to three weeks for tapeworms if I recall) and you could potentially see bodies in your bowel movements. \n\nIn my experience there are no worm kisses on the way out. I've had some less than usual experiences myself.",
            "I\u2019m going to give you some advice, as a fellow tapeworm survivor...\n\nThe medication I got was a giant one-time pill called Biltricide. This thing is a nuke. Your body and specifically your stomach and intestines are lined with tons of different bacteria, both good and bad, called your gut microbiome. This is a microbiome you begin to develop in the womb from your mother. When you take the Biltricide, it does exactly what it sounds like, it will kill all the bacteria and parasites including the good ones (notice the -cide in Biltri-cide is like suicide). It will definitely take care of the tapeworm but now you will have a new problem, your gut microbiome will go out of balance. This can lead to (and did for me) stomach pain, cramps, indigestion and worst of all for me, ACNE. \n\nSo the point here is that you now need to focus on replenishing you gut microbiome. Eating foods rich in probiotics like yogurt or most fermented foods should help with indigestion but they\u2019re not complex enough to make up for what you\u2019re about to lose. I recommend a daily probiotic pill (look for billions of different strains on the labels on amazon or your local pharmacy). It\u2019ll cost like 20-30 a month but will really help with rebalancing your gut. Still won\u2019t be enough tho so do some research. \n\nFinal point. I consider myself a tapeworm enthusiast at this point due to all the research I\u2019ve done after being traumatized. In 3rd world countries where tapeworms are common (think Vietnam, India, etc) and medicine isn\u2019t as readily available, the common village solution is to eat raw cloves of garlic whole. The garlic clove (and this is why your friend mentioned it) is that it will paralyze the parasite within your body. In 3rd world countries this will get is out. I\u2019ll skip the details. But as you now know, tapeworms can be ASYMPTOMATIC... so to this day I casually eat a raw garlic clove once in a while to deal with the anxiety of maybe having another tapeworm in me. \n\nI\u2019ll save my own tapeworm story for another time. I hope the best for you and your cat and a speedy recovery! Good luck!",
            "That means that you somehow ingested the intermediate host. You both ate a flea infected with the parasite if you got it.",
            "You're a wonderful person for adopting that old cat, taking such good care of him, buying the air purifier for his cough, all the vet visits, all the cleaning up after him, still cuddling him and keeping your sense of humor though all of this. You deserve something really nice to happen to you. I hope the worms pass easily, and you and your senior furry friend have many happy years together.",
            "I don't get how the eggs were all over your sheets and pillows, but you never noticed? Also how did you get the tapeworms yourself? Maybe from the eggs getting into your food somehow?",
            "First off, this was a great read. Sorry it was at your expense.\n\nHey though- I\u2019ve worked in animal care, and tapeworms can be diagnosed by a pet owner. A vet should not take offense to that and should have taken you seriously. It\u2019s very easy to test for, and cats gets worms easily and often because they\u2019re constantly licking themselves and ingesting fleas. Please, get a new vet. It also doesn\u2019t hurt to over-the-counter deworm your car every three months.",
            "> Did you know your prescription is $130?\n\nThis is **obscene.** It costs **50\u00a2** to make a dose of albendazole.\n\nEdit: And it has fewer side effects and interactions than fuckin' *aspirin.*",
            "Just so everybody knows it is very rare for humans to contract tape worms from cats. It is only in small areas of the world and if you live in a developed country than you aren't in one. I have had a few cats that have had them and as gross as it is, don't worry just stay sanitary and get them dewormer. Now tape worms from eating raw fish or uncooked pork is a whole other story.",
            "I find it interesting people in developed countries are terrified of tape worms. Sure, they're disgusting and all but in a lot of third world countries they're merely considered a nuisance.  I think the issue is medical staff have never seen parasites on patients and have a hard time identifying them but if you know what's up (if you can identify the symptom) a couple of days on albendazole takes care of it. I'd rather get a tapeworm than the flu to be honest",
            "Hi OP,\n\nThis was truly one of the most disturbing things I have ever read but I am very much moved to your dedication to your cat. If you need help I would be more than willing to help pay for some of your medicine, doctor visits, vet etc or just pay for a 6 pack of your choice. I thought I was having a rough time but your story put me in my place real quick. \n\nGood luck to you and your kitty!",
            "Umm... tapeworms aren\u2019t zoonotic. Your cat got them from eating fleas anywhere from 2 weeks to a few months before you adopted him. You got them from eating something undercooked/contaminated/improperly handled (usually a pork product) that had a Cestoda cyst present. Cats and humans don\u2019t/can\u2019t host the same species of tapeworm. This is an (excellently written) bizarre coincidence. \n\nTapeworms in cats are very common. You can\u2019t prevent them with deworming, you can only treat them when they appear. \n\n(Credentials: 12 years in veterinary medicine.)",
            "My only question is *how the fuck did you get it too* \n\nLike you would\u2019ve needed to have eaten something with the egg on it??",
            "Search for a different vet. Standard course is to give every pet a worm treatment course every 12 months, or in even shorter intervals if they are going outside, and of course always after adopting one. As you learned, it's not like it's that expensive for pets, and they tolerate the course very well.\n\nWhen we got our two cats adopted, they brought fleas with them, and that was also kind of not so nice, and took a while to catch and erradicate. The woman who nursed them before we got them was completely unaware, and should actually have known that cats on a farm have fleas and worms regularly."

        "selftext": "Last summer. We're on a road trip from New Mexico to Mexico. We have a Honda Element converted for living in, so I crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. He stops at a gas station in the desert of Arizona and while he's pumping, I get out to use the bathroom. Come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. I jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. I sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. I reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.\n\nI go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. Obviously they do, but whatever. So I start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think I'll steal it I guess. I go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. I realize I don't know my boyfriends number by heart so I just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. He doesn't. I use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when I call.\n\nI resort to explaining to everyone whose phone I ask to use my situation. Some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and I was just being modest. It's been about 2 hours now. The store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, I'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.\n\nA cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. I explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. She tells me I can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. I ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. We're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. I just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. And there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. \n\nHe said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized I wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. And that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. He thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. \n\nEDIT: I understand IFU by not relaying my need to pee.\nAlso that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. Also have never heard of this Last Man on Earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. I have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened IRL.\n\nNot so great Element/Trip pics: http://imgur.com/gallery/SVBZIwp\n\n\nTLDR: went to use the bathroom while my boyfriend was pumping gas, he didn't know, drove off, and I was stranded, asking people to use their phones for hours until police were called to come get me.",

With how much smartphones cost these days (1k and up sometimes) and how much personal info is on them (social media, credit cards, contacts, etc) once you unlock your phone and hand it over to someone to use you may be fucked even though their story may sound genuine. I've had people that approached me with a \"story\" (credible or not) ask me to use my phone. My solution is to tell them, \"no problem, tell me what number you're calling and who it is  and I'll dial it for you\" . People who were looking to steal the phone would falter. Those that tell me exactly who they are calling, why and the number without any hesitation, I'd dial the number and ask if the person knows them before handing them over the phone. Yeh, I'm no asshole to leave someone stranded who's in a tough situation, but I'm also no asshole who'll hand over my whole life in digital format and have you run away with it.",

'For the next several hours, while the sun is gone, I'm going to become unconscious, temporarily losing command over everything I know and understand. When the sun returns, I will resume my life.'\n\nIf you didn't know what sleep was, and you had only seen it in a science fiction movie, you would think it was weird and tell all your friends about the movie you'd seen.\n\nThey had these people, you know? And they would walk around all day and be OK? And then, once a day, usually after dark, they would lie down on these special platforms and become unconscious. They would stop functioning almost completely, except deep in their minds they would have adventures and experiences that were completely impossible in real life. As they lay there, completely vulnerable to their enemies, their only movements were to occasionally shift from one position to another; or, if one of the 'mind adventures' got too real, they would sit up and scream and be glad they weren't unconscious anymore. Then they would drink a lot of coffee.'\n\nSo, next time you see someone sleeping, make believe you're in a science fiction movie. And whisper, 'The creature is regenerating itself.

        "selftext": "This is long so TLDR at the bottom.\n\nThis happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that\u2019s where the pee came out.\n\nSo one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that\u2019s certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!\n\nSo armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom\u2019s bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.\n\nAfter about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. \n\nI cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.\n\nSo this was about 10 days into my stretching and I\u2019d gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I\u2019d try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn\u2019t bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn\u2019t care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn\u2019t budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That\u2019s how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.\n\nWhen I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I\u2019d check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I\u2019m a black guy.\n\nI realized that if I didn\u2019t find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. \n\nI checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!\n\nAlso please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren\u2019t as stupid as I was don\u2019t take that risk lol\n\nTL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn\u2019t get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. \n\nEDIT: So I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! \n\nSo while I\u2019m happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I\u2019d like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I\u2019d like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. \n\nFor those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don\u2019t be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren\u2019t old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it\u2019s not as awkward that you think. Don\u2019t risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like. ",

Know this: I am NOT a penis expert, as I do not have one! Also, after researching a little this morning, phimosis is way more common than I thought, and the need for surgical intervention is low. Important details: don't expect to be able to fully retract a baby's foreskin, and full reaction isn't really expected until adulthood, and that with GENTLE stretching it can improve. And never ever EVER leave a foreskin pulled back like op did. He's lucky he didn't lose more than just a little sensation.\n\nAlso, do not use advice from strangers in the internet as end all truth.

            "Oh boy.  I get to retell my story about not pulling back my foreskin for 17 years!\n\nYou are lucky. At your age my dick exploded due to this. I had been washing my penis since I was a child but my foreskin was too tight to pull all the way back past the end of the head so I assumed that is where you were supposed to stop unless you wanted to damage something. When I am 17 my dick swells up on one side for no reason. Gets bigger and bigger. I go to the doctor and she says it is probably trauma due to me first noticing the pain while working out. She says the swelling will go down. A week goes by and it keeps getting bigger and bigger. Hurts like a motherfucker. I just lay in bed and cry about my rock hard swollen penis that pulsated in pain. I was pretty sure I was going to lose my dick at 17, right when I was starting to get to use it for things other than myself.\n\nFinally, my dad makes an appointment with a urologist for me instead of my primary care doctor. On my way to the urologist, my dick exploded. Now you may be wondering how one's dick explodes. Well, the inner side of my foreskin tore from the pressure and the pressure of all of the built up swelling was actually pus that shot out like a damn super-soaker. Turns out it was an infection. So, the thing is now leaking shit tons of pus and blood. I go to the restroom in the clinic waiting room and whip it out and start working my finger from the top of the shaft down to the head and am just pushing out pus through the rip in my foreskin. I begin to hyperventilate, now sure I am going to lose my dick to gangrene or something, but at least the pain has gone down.\n\nI see the doctor with my bloody, pus-covered knob and he says, \"Oh you had Blanitis. Take some meds and wash your penis a lot for the next few days and you should be fine.\" I get home and can barely work my foreskin back since it is still swollen. I use a toothbrush to scrub the accumulated muck off of my dick while sitting in the tub and a week later I am totally fine. In fact, I am better than fine. The expansion from the Blanitis had stretched out my foreskin so I could now pull it all the way back for the first time in my life.\n\nI now keep an exceptionally clean penis. So, kids, wash your dick well, or it will explode.",

        "selftext": "I thought it would be funny to put a Bluetooth speaker in the ceiling and play sounds of cats over it.  I found an eight hour video of cats meowing on YouTube that was perfect.\n\nI paired an old phone to the speaker, tossed the phone in a drawer of an empty desk, and tucked the speaker under a ceiling tile.  It was perfect.  You could only hear the cats if you listened real close.  It sounded like there was a cat in the ceiling, but you really couldn't tell exactly where it was coming from.\n\nI went to my office, got busy with work, and forgot about it until I went to break.  I walked into the break room and several people were talking about the cat that must be in the ventilation system.  I chuckled to myself while I grabbed my coffee and made a loop through accounting department to see if there were any more people talking about the cats in the ceiling.  \n\nTo my horror, half the ceiling tiles were removed and there were two maintenance men on ladders looking for the cat.  They were real close to the speaker but hadn't found it quite yet.  \n\nI just reversed out of there and went back to work.  They eventually found the speaker, and shortly after everyone got an email from the big boss reprimanding the guilty party and asking for any information on the culprit.  \n\nTLDR - I caused the entire accounting department to be shut down for 3 hours this morning by making them think there was a cat stuck in the ceiling.  \nMy bad.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nA conspiracy theory emerged by the end of the day. \n\nSeveral of them don't believe that it was a prank at all.  They think the maintenance people lied about it being a prank.  That management made it up to get people back to work, and that maintenance  is planning to set out traps and poison to kill it.  One person claimed they absolutely heard the cat yesterday, and I shit you not, a couple of them claim they still hear it.",

            "A sound guy did this to a production manager at the theater I used to work at. The manager hated the music man with a passion, so sound guy rigged up a speaker in the ceiling above his office that played \"76 Trombones\" every day at the same time. It started off almost inaudibly and got louder every day. Production manager was humming that song daily and couldn't get it out of his head. Took him two weeks to figure out what was going on.",

            "I did something very similar. Our building has an intercom system throughout it. I connected a CD player to it. I made a cd that had about 60 minutes of silence, then one faint meow, and put it on repeat.  It was driving everyone crazy, because nobody could tell which direction the meow was coming from. It sounded different all around the building depending on where you were in relationship to the closest speaker. Also the upstairs people didn't realize that the downstairs people were hearing it, and vice versa. It was the talk of the office for a while, until I finally ended it and told some people the truth. Good times.",

I left it on my worktable while I went to get something on the other side of the warehouse.  I came back to all the surrounding processors gathered around my table looking worried and I was like, 'oh hey, guys, what's going on?'

            "At a company I started out with had a group of jokers - always innocent jokes but some were the long game.  One of their things was to take the guts out of a battery smoke detector and put in a nearly dead 9V battery and then hide in somewhere in your van.  For a few weeks you\u2019d search for the source of the intermittent beep until you found it or the battery eventually died. \n\nI was telling a buddy of mine about this and he asked if I wanted to \u2018win\u2019 this game - of course my answer was YES!  Using spare parts he cannibalized from scrap at his work and spending about $30 for random parts from Radio Shack he made 8 devices with a piezo alarm and a timer set for different intervals.   I put some new 9V batteries in them and hid 2 or 3 of them in each work van of the other jokers.  Above the headliner, in the dash, under the cover of the passenger seat, buried under a tool shelf, etc...  \n\nAfter a couple of days I heard them talking about it and blaming each other when I started laughing and taking credit for it.  After 2 months only 3 of the 8 were found and they couldn\u2019t figure out why they were lasting so long.  I filled them in on why but never told them how many there were in total - the multiple locations and random timers made it harder to determine where it was coming from. \n\nBEST $30 EVER SPENT!\n\n\nThey also liked to hide smelly foods (cheese, milk cartons, fish...) in a van until it happened to me and I realized that they still didn\u2019t learn their lesson to lock their vans whenever we were all at the shop.",

            "The tech support for my previous job had a guy who loved to troll his colleagues. \n\nThey told me about that one time he left his office locked, playing Levan Polkka on repeat. They eventually got hold of a key to his office, and tried to turn of what ever played the sound, realised the song came from within a computer case that was padlocked. They tried to navigate his computer, found several browser windows playing the song. They closed all of them and the song kept playing. They found Winamp and stopped that (had a Playlist filled with thousands of songs, all Levan Polkka). They gave up, and just shut down the machine (which they didn't really want to do in case he had something unsaved going on). The song still kept playing. They then realized he had hooked up a different computer to the screen than the one under his desk playing the damn song. So they unplugged the computer playing the song. And the machine still played the damn song. He had put a speaker and a UPS inside the case. They hooked a screen, a mouse and a keyboard up to the computer only to be greeted by a password prompt. They tried several passwords and nothing worked. They finally gave up and just had to endure the song until he returned. \n\nWhen he finally returned to the office they all yelled at him and asked him what the password was. He laughed and said, you still don't know? It's been right there in front of you all this time, it's Ievan polkka of course. He was kind of legendary for trolling his coworkers, never the same way and always when they least expected it.",

We changed the last name to be a pun of a cat because it was so close. I even went so far as to add a second user to my credit card under that name so that there was no way my name was on anything coming to him. The first month, of course everyone heard he had gotten a copy within 20 minutes, and everyone thought it was a funny joke. The second month, everyone realized it was a subscription. Soon, centerfold cats started being hung around the office. He began getting bulk mail about products for his non-existent cats. People would even occasionally buy little cat trinkets for his office.\n\nThe happiest day of the mail-guy\u2019s month was the day he got to deliver that next issue of Cat Fancy.

Been a while since we've gotten tangled up in the sheets, so we decided to give it a go.

We shrug it off, lay back in bed, and then it happens again. We think to ourselves \"oh shit, this may be real\". Then she starts getting a contraction, not one she normally gets, no, this one is stronger and lasts a lot longer than usual.\n\n4 hours later I sit here in the hospital next to her bed, she's 8 cm dilated, epidural given, and now we're waiting for our 1st child to arrive!\n\nTL;DR fucked my wife into labor 3 weeks early\n\nEdit: here we go, 10 cm, nurse said they're rounding up the troops and will begin pushing soon\n\nEdit 2: Jason is a 6lb, 2oz beautiful baby boy, welcomed to us at 3am!

        "selftext": "This happened about 30 years ago when I was doing my PhD in tissue biology.\n\nA little background, in the lab we use something called [microtome blades](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Zl4AAOSwWr5ZxTKP/s-l1600.jpg). For those that don't know, it's a blade that is so sharp it's used to create 1 micron thin [slices](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mousumi-Gupta-2/publication/288835345/figure/fig1/AS:313022531817474@1451641795449/Tissue-block-is-sectioned-with-microtome-fitted-with-a-sharp-knife-The-tissue-is-moved.png) of tissues that are literally less than 1 cell layer thick to be studied under a microscope. So yeah pretty sharp. They weigh a little more than a small kitchen knife, taper out toward the non-cutting end so they can be sharpened for many years. I was taking it back to the lab after it was just sharpened and usually we carry it in a special container, partly for safety, but also if it get's dropped the vibrations will create microscopic bends/fractures in the blade that cause it to cut unevenly and the blade is essentially ruined. As fate would have it, I forgot to bring the case and was too lazy to go back across campus to get one, so I just carried the blade by hand.\n\nAnother detail is that since day one of working with these blades, it is indoctrinated in us that we are to never drop them, because they are very expensive to replace. Now-a-days they are cheaper to manufacture and even come as disposables, but back in 1980's money it was several hundred bucks and it would delay your research by several weeks while a new one was shipped.\n\nWith that in mind, as I entered the main hallway of the biology department, the blade slipped out of my hand and, in a split second, I subconsciously I reached down to catch it (maybe after it fell about 1 foot). Unfortunately I caught the blade sharp-side-down and it instantly severed three tendons in the palm of my hand. I immediately noticed I couldn't close my index finger, middle finger, and ring finger. It was very strange, because there was very little blood at first, but after 5 seconds bright red blood started pouring down my hand. Before I knew it, the white tile floor of the hallway I was standing on, had a rapidly spreading pool of blood. I all happened so fast I hadn't fully comprehended what I was experiencing. Another fortuitous part of this story is that one of the anatomy professors saw all this happen and immediately rushed over to hold pressure on my radial and ulnar arteries to control the bleeding.\n\nI ended up having surgery to reattach the arteries and the tendons.\n\nAfter waking up after surgery I was relieved, but noticed they had a blood bag connected to my IV. The nurse said I lost quite a bit of blood and had to be transfused during the surgery. I wish this was the part of the story where I tell you that I had an uneventful recovery. However, after the surgery I started having severe fevers and chills, terrible back pain, my urine was a muddy dark brown color, and I could barely catch my breath. Turns out the lab person who drew my blood mislabeled the tubes and I was transfused with the wrong blood type. I ended up staying in the ICU for a week, almost had complete kidney failure and had severe pulmonary edema. I vividly remember the doctor saying that my kidneys were most likely in complete failure and I would have to have life-long dialysis or a transplant. Fortunately they caught the transfusion reaction before most of the blood was infused and I never had to start dialysis.\n\nTL;DR - Dropped one of the sharpest blades in existence, caught it before it hit the ground, it severed most of the tendons and arteries in my hand. In the hospital I was given the wrong blood type, survived severe pulmonary edema, and almost lost both of my kidneys in the process.",

And then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet I saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) C) I knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies\n\nJust wanted to respond to popular questions.\n\nEdit 3: Hope you saw the screen shot, you know who you guys are. :-)",

        "selftext": "My wife posted earlier today on LA about this. Not using my main because my FIL knows it and I'm not quite ready to tell him about this.\n\nI went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. I had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when I turned it on. Most of them were asking how I could do this. I had no clue what she was talking about. She didn't answer any of my calls back.\n\nI got home and she was packing up to leave. I'll admit it, I cried. A lot. Had no clue what was happening or what I did. Finally, it comes out that I texted her that I wanted a divorce. She showed me the text and I immediately realize what happened.\n\nThis morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. I texted her \"the new mirror came in! I'm going to try to put it together but I may need your help later\". I had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. I texted her, \"this isn't working, and at this point I think I need to just give up\". Apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. So my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while I was off thinking everything was great. She even called a divorce lawyer.\n\nThings are fine now but she's still crying off and on. She told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR Accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.\n\nEdit: Wow, this blew up. To address a few things that came up in the comments:\n\n\\-I usually work from home unless I need to meet with clients. I don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. That's why she didn't know I was at work yesterday. I'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. If my phone goes off, I could lose my job, and our health insurance.\n\n\\-My wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. That's why she had the reaction she did.\n\n\\-My comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. Neither of us is mad at the other. This was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. We're fine. I posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. No need to psychoanalyze my wife or PM me about divorce. We are fine.\n\n\\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. We weren't really in a \"home improvement\" mood last night.",

We have been dating for 3 years at that point and living together for at least 2, so it wouldn't have been the \"we need a break\" chat, she is just bad at text messages.

            "A few years ago at the launch of TF2 I joined a casual group of players and one of them asked for my cell phone number for texts regarding matches and whatnot. I added them to my contacts and at the time I was putting in complete information fields so there were no shorthand nicknames or anything. A short time later my cell phone fell out of my pocket at my parents place and I didn't notice and walked our dog back home. This was the era of small flip phones.\n\nWhile I walked home, (roughly 15-20 minutes) my friend had texted and when he got no response started calling. My sister picked up my phone and saw the caller ID and refused to answer the call, the screen simply showed: Sugar. My sister immediately ran to my mom to rat me out apparently who then called my wife so that when I opened the front door there was my lovely wife holding a cup of iced tea for me. As I sipped she looked me in the eye and simply asked \"So who's Sugar?\" My mind a blank, I didn't know who Sugar was so I said as much. \n\nYou can imagine how pleasant the much faster drive with my wife back to my parents place to pick up my phone was. I took my phone, my sisters absolutely disappointed, my mom ready to murder me on the lawn. I opened the phone and saw a few missed texts, a call, and a voice mail. I laughed as soon as I read the texts about TF2, then confidently dialed my voicemail on speakerphone so everyone could hear it without checking it first. All they heard were the dulcet tones of a man calling me inappropriate names and asking why I wasn't joining up for a TF2 match. That was the last time my family worried about me cheating on my spouse, my wife was so relieved that my own family would turn on me in a heartbeat if I were cheating she rarely worries about me sneaking around as the punishment from her would never match what my mom would do.",

            "About 2 years into dating, she went through a phase of asking a lot of weird questions. I enjoyed it as it was fun to talk about dicks and balls and the joys of living with them day to day. She asked if it was ever \u201cin the way\u201d or \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely! All the time! For instance if you sit in the mall and watch people walk around the mall on a warm day, watch for guys to take one awkward long step. That means there nuts are sticking to their leg and that long step peels them off in a similar fashion and sound as pulling open Velcro.\u201d \n\nThat was almost 8 years ago. Yesterday we were at the mall and she gets absurdly excited every time she sees it, enough to make them notice a couple times and smile and wave like she thinks their famous. And for that, I\u2019m sorry guys. It\u2019s a hilariously awkward thing for her to be excited about, but that\u2019s why I married her. \n\nTL:DR Broke guy code by spilling the secret about sticking ballsacks to your leg and taking the long step to de-Velcro your sweaty scrotum from your leg, now she\u2019s called it out every time she sees it for the last 8 years.\n\nP.s sorry op, but people needs to see.",

        "selftext": "This weekend, I was in one of my best friend\u2019s weddings. The bride, my friend, is diabetic and forgot her insulin when we went to the church, so technically, diabetes is the villain of this story.\n\nNo problem. I volunteered to go back to her house to pick it up. I like a mission. Me against diabetes. After a morning of bridal stuff, my adrenal glands were more than happy to kick some dust off.\n\nThe bride says the back door is unlocked, so I dash to her house, drifting the corners (in my mind), finding the apex in the road. The back door is not unlocked. No doors are opened, but I am NOT taking the L on this.\n\nAll of us bridesmaids had gotten ready at her house earlier, and one of the other bridesmaids was leaning out her window on the 2nd floor smoking. I gaze up at her window, praying that it\u2019s still unlocked. I know this house. I went to high school with the bride, snuck out of that window onto the roof, and clambered down the tree beside the house many times.\n\nOnly this time, I am in a strapless, tight, mermaid style dress. Driving a stick in this constricting skirt was challenge enough. There is no way on God\u2019s green earth that I can climb a tree.\n\nIts barely above freezing, but this is a DefCon 2 situation.\n\nI\u2019m in the back yard, and there is only one house that can see me. I accept the crazy-low odds that the grandparents that live next door will notice me. Decidedly incorrect assumption because apparently, Gramps has assigned himself the position of overwatch.\n\nI kick off my heels, sling off my jacket (it\u2019s barely above freezing), and toss the Morticia Addams-style bridesmaid dress over the fence. I pat my old friend, the tree, and begin to climb. I\u2019m sure I sloth-climbed it, but the adrenaline pulsing through my veins has me convinced that I ninja warriored that shit.\n\nThe window is unlocked\\*\\*. Oorah\\*\\*!\n\nOnce I open it, I ungracefully fall into the room from the roof.  I don\u2019t care because the distinctly male movie announcer voice in my head is sexily broadcasting the trailer for the movie I\u2019m acting out. The crowd cheers when my icicle toes hit the hardwood floors. *I\u2019m killing it*.\n\nThe room looks like a girl bomb exploded. Curlers, hairdryers, make-up bags, and clothes cover every square inch of the carpet. I super kung fu hop over the piles to the dresser where she said her insulin bag would be. It\u2019s not there.\n\nI rifle through the piles, shaking like a scared dog from the cold. Nope. To the bathroom. Nope. A massive rock drops into my stomach when I can\u2019t find her insulin. The clock is ticking. I launch down the stairs, two at a time and run through the house as my eyes scan every surface.\n\nI find it on the kitchen counter, a full floor away from where she thought she left it.\n\nBooyow! I\u2019m back in the game. I shotgun pump my arm and grab the bag.\n\nI make sure I can lock the kitchen door from the inside. I mentally check-yep, I left all of my stuff outside.\n\nI step into the garage, shutting the door behind me. As I\u2019m jiggling the locked doorknob, I hear the *Woop Woop* of a police car.\n\nI slowly turn and do some weird half raise of my hands. There are two\u2026TWO cops in the driveway. All official and stern-looking. In a split second, I flash on images. I\u2019m in the back of the police car, handcuffed, search warrants are getting issued. I see the courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury.  In a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, I swear I heard my brain misfire.\n\nThe only thing that zaps me back to reality is that I kid you not- my boobs are two frozen ice-cones. I\u2019m going to have the pleasure of explaining this shit-show to the officers while wearing nothing but my fancy thong and lacy, strapless bra because genius me didn\u2019t want panty lines\u2026 and my hot-ass guy will be wearing a tux to the wedding. Nuff said.\n\nI could have vaporized on the spot from the humiliation as the officers approach me.\n\nI don\u2019t even know what I said. I virtually shoved the bag of insulin at the older cop and vomited out the preposterous details of this Texas-sized oof that landed me in my skivvies, coming out of a house that I technically broke into.\n\nThey try to keep a straight face, but then I start to laugh. It begins as a small embarrassed chuckle, but then it takes on a life of its own, commandeering all of my self-control and flinging it into the icy wind with the ashes of my dignity. I howl. Tears run down my face and I shoot strangled, inhuman sounds at them. I can make no sound other than drawn-out vowels. God, it\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nThe cops are trying to ask me questions, and instead, they get Mutley the dog. All I can do is wheeze, or tear and shake from the cold.  Finally, I beg them to let me put my clothes on.\n\nOne gallantly swings his arm to tell me to proceed to the back yard to recover my assortment of clothing cringingly clinging to the fence. They are gentlemen about it as I jump and shimmy into this hell-contraption of a bridesmaid\u2019s dress.\n\nThey ask me if there is anyone that I can call from the family to confirm the story.\n\nI call the bride. She doesn\u2019t pick up.\n\nI call the bride\u2019s mom. She doesn\u2019t pick up.\n\nI call the love of my life. He picks up on the first ring. God, I love that man. He doesn\u2019t know why I left the church but immediately goes into solve-this-shit-fast mode. He gets the Bride\u2019s dad. It gets sorted.\n\nMy guy is waiting in the parking lot when I pull up. Panic rolls across his face when he sees me, thinking I have been crying. I laugh the rest of my make-up off with him when I tell him the story. We\u2019re getting married soon, and I think the bride should have to perform a commensurate task to climbing a tree in freezing weather in her underwear. I\u2019m definitely taking suggestions.\n\nThis all happened in a decently small town. This story has ripped through the gossip mill like Taco Bell through the colon. My oldest brother is apparently friends with the \u201cyoung\u201d cop that I could never make myself look in the eye. Yep- never living this down, and I\u2019m never more grateful to have moved away.\n\nAlso, LPT- I\u2019m an idiot, so maybe you all know this, but don\u2019t hand your phone to the police. Put the call on speaker or show the text from your hand. Do not physically place your property in the care of the police. Advice from a law student who was more than happy to lecture me for 20 minutes at the reception.\n\nTLDR; Title says it all. Insulin is a life-saving drug, and at least for one day, I kicked diabetes ass. You gotta do what you gotta do, even if it means being a streaking, Tarzan cat-burglar.\n\nEDIT: Thanks, everyone. It's been a fantastic ride.

So we had this talk and I\u2019ve always found it imperative to teach them proper terminology for their own genitals as I\u2019ve read repeatedly that this makes a huge difference in preventing abuse...not that I put my kids in any risky situations that I\u2019m aware of but always seems to happen it\u2019s a situation we never view as risky, right. So we have this entire conversation. A few days later we\u2019re in the pasta aisle at Walmart when my kid yells out \u201cMommy that man looks like a creepy guy that would try to touch my vagina\u201d and \u201cthat man\u201d was like elbow to elbow with me trying to innocently pick out his pasta. \n\nI have never hauled it out of Walmart so fast in my entire life. Left the pasta behind and everything. \ud83e\udd23",
            "When we moved from the UK to Canada, my kid (3 years old then) noticed that the walk signs were different \u2013 they're green in the UK and white silhouettes in Canada. Well, the light changed and he started yelling at my Indian mom \"The white man said you have to walk!!!\"",
            "I grew up in an area where there were MAYBE 10 black kids in my whole high school. When I was really little I don't think I ever met a black person in person until my grandparents took me to a restaurant one day.\n\nAs we were leaving there was a black couple and a kid my age sitting down and I screamed \"Look! A basketball baby!\"\n\nI guess I had only ever seen black people on TV playing basketball... My grandparents were obviously mortified but the couple apparently went into hysterical laughter.",
            "This totally reminds me of when I was 6, and I had just moved to Latin America and was just learning Spanish. I tried to tell my maid she looked embarrassed, but I said \"embarazada\" which means pregnant. Oops. Funniest thing ever was that it turned out that she WAS pregnant and couldn't believe I'd figured it out.",
            "When my step son was 6 or 7 he used to make up random nicknames for me (nickelodeon, Nicky) but in general he called me Nick-Nack. We were in Austin one time at Hamilton pool, which is like a little piece of a river sectioned off like a natural swimming pool. Maybe someone else can explain that better but it's not really important. What IS important is there were a lot of black people there.\n\nMy son gets out of the water like 30' from me and decided to try out new nickname... he yells \"NICKER!\".\n\nThe people around us got pretty quite for a few seconds and his friends that we were staying with told him what it sounded like. He ran over on the verge of tears making sure we knew that's not what he said. After a long few seconds everything returned to normal. He stuck to Nick-Nack after that.",

            "When my eldest was just turned three, she saw her babysitter\u2019s son get a diaper change and asked me why his vagina looked weird. I explained the difference and told her it was called a penis. She went down the line of every male we knew (including our cats) and asking if they too had penises. A week later, on military payday, we were in the check out line at the commissary (on-base grocery store) and a retiree smiled at her and said hello. She looked him straight in the face and said, \u201c You know what? You have a penis!\u201d really loudly. I was mortified and so was he.",

            "I was at the mall with my friend and her daughter, who was about 4 years old at the time. We were pushing her in the cart and she started to fuss and squiggle around. We stopped to see what was going on and were facing her and asking her if she was alright. Out of no where the daughter screams at the top of her lungs: \"DON'T HIT ME MOMMY!\" I swear everyone in the mall stopped in their tracks, the music stopped, and everyone was staring at us. My poor friend starts to cry because as up to that point she had never physically disciplined her daughter that way and she was incredibly embarassed.",

My cousins high school was playing a baseball game against my (old) high school, so I headed on down to see the game. As I was standing in line at the concession stand I saw a few of my students and one of them was walking towards me with his dad...\n\nMe: hey there Jimmy, hows it going bud?\n\nKid: (looooong pause, then excitable yelling) Ooooh! His Miss Nobes, I didn't recognize you with your clothes on!!! \n\nAll heads turn to me, I turn red, the dad laughs - all he'd ever seen me in was a bathingsuit so it made sense after the initial shock haha\n\nBut those parental looks are killer.",

MIKEY SAID THE N WORD!!!\" To which every adult at the table immediately begins berating Mikey. Poor kid looks so confused, and he is even younger than my nephew, I can't fathom how he would know the \"N word\"\n\nI calm everyone down and very quietly ask my Nephew \"Stan, what is the N word\" and as children will do, he leans forward conspiratorially and whispers (which here actually means states quite loudly) \"NAKED\"\n\nThe whole table erupts in the laughter and the little shit even gets some chuckles from surrounding tables.\n\nTL,DR: Naked is now the N word",

My son when he was younger used to call excavators, \"diggers.\" I'm sure you can imagine where this is going...\n\nWe are leaving a restaurant and in the lot next to the parking lot are two excavators with two young black gentlemen walking towards us. My son yells and points in the direction of the excavators and these men \"look Daddy, diggers!!!\" At that point, I'm nearly yelling \"yes buddy two excavators\" to try to diffuse any potential situation.

            "I wasn't present for this, but apparently when my nephew was young he noticed an older woman in the grocery store wearing one of those Life Alert necklaces like you see on late night TV infomercials. He saw this, the gears in his small head began to turn, and what emerged was a pointed finger and a screeching announcement of \"LOOK MOMMY, SHE'S ON LIFE SUPPORT!\"\n\nI am told that the woman in question was neither pleased nor amused by this.",

The robot was of course programed to say obedient things to anyone in the family. So, my son and I are in Walmart one day and as we get ready to go through the register line I tell him he cannot have any candy and to not ask or make a big show to which he looks at me, and in a mechanical, robotic type voice says \"Yes master\". Now the rest of the story is this, my son is also adopted and black......I am white. Every person in line within 3 registers turned and stared at me.....some even scared me a bit with their looks.

Well along with the classics like weed, coke, and black tar heroine, our school taught us that alcohol and cigarettes were also drugs. They did not, however, make any distinction between legal and illegal drugs because their goal wasn't really education, it was only to convince us to avoid all of those things completely.\n\nA couple of days later my dad took me shopping with him after school. Being a chain smoker he asked for a carton of cigarettes at the register at checkout. My aspergers 6 year old brain that had just recently been indoctrinated freaked out. All that was going through my panicked mind was cigarettes=drugs. Drugs=prison. Cigarettes=prison. So I had a meltdown! I started screaming \"NO DADDY! DON'T BUY DRUGS!!!! I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO TO PRISON! PLEASE NO!!!\"\n\nThe cashier started laughing and basically everyone else in the checkout area turned to look at us because a kid was screaming about drugs and prison.

One year, when my daughter was quite young, I was with her in Target getting toiletries and stuff to take with us. We are walking around and talking about the trip when she yells \"I hate Japan.\" in the middle of a crowded section. Everyone looks at us. I'm freaking out, so I immediately kneel down and ask her in a loud annunciated voice \"why don't you want to go see your grandparents?\" Then in a mix of Japanese and (mainly) English she starts complaining about the flight.

We got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. We're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. I started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so I figured on going to completion. Unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.\n\nSo there I am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. His mom comes in! I freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. Meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. Eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. \n\nAnyways, it's 5:40am, I've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.\n\nTL;DR: Bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.\n\nUpdate @7:31am - Thanks for all the reassuring comments. My bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. Anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. More to come.\n\nUpdate @8:38am - Of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... Anyways thanks! So breakfast started off totally fine. I mean, yeah I was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. That is, until I excused myself to go shower. She stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. But then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being \"safe\". It was sweet and cringy all at once. I guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) \n\nAnyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!\n\nUpdate: A lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. Actually I assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); I didn't actually see her do it. I asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while I was...ehm...cleaning.",

So anyway, it is summer and we rented out one room on the top floor of a small cottage near seaside. There was no fan or AC in it, but otherwise it was properly furnished and even had a fridge which we extensively used. There were two small windows, but only one could be opened. Anyway, I noticed over time that room was insanely hot. I attributed it to effect from sun heating the roof of the building as sunny days finally began. We tried to spend as much time outdoors as possible - it was vacation anyway, but it was horrible at night. So one night our toddler managed to switch the fridge off and noone noticed it. \n\nIn the morning I noticed that the room was much cooler and the fridge was off and leaked water.\n\nThat is when I remembered principle on which fridges work :\\\\",

            "a ceiling fan won't have a 10 degree impact on temperature.\n\nif you blow the air up, it's supposed to push the colder air from the bottom of the room to the top. if you blow downwards, it pushes the warm air from the top of the room to the bottom. Both will do the same thing - circulate air to more evenly distribute the temperature throughout the room. the main difference is that blowing down also causes a \"wind chill\" effect if it's blowing directly on you. Which can cool you off more. So basically, in the winter you probably want to blow the air up, so you aren't causing yourself to feel wind chill when you're trying to be warm. In the summer, blow the air at you and you cool off.",
            "uh... the idea behind the switch isn't that it is a heater.  changing the direction of the fan won't change the temperature in the room. \n\nAir blowing down on a person will cool the person because you now have air flow over your natural coolant system (sweat on your skin) due to evaporation.\n\nAir blowing up distributes the hot air on the ceiling around the room for more efficient distribution of the hot air. \n\nBlowing the hot air DOWN on you still distributes the hot air from the ceiling down on you in the same way it down when blowing up.",
            "Like what every one has said, which is that the fan doesn't actually make your room cooler. In fact, in a controlled environment the fan's motor will slightly increase the temperature in the room. What the fan will do is make you feel colder. This can be referred to as comfort, which depends on the person. You will feel cooler because of latent heat transfer. Latent heat is the energy needed to move matter from one state to another. It is not the energy required to get it to that point. Because there is moisture on the body, having the fan blow against your skin will help the moisture evaporate. It takes the energy/heat from your body to do so, which is how the fan make your feel cooler. It takes a lot of energy to have matter like water to change from a liquid to a gas.",

            "Oh my fucking gosh. You just changed my life. 5 years in a hot-ass Brooklyn half bedroom. Thank you SO MUCH.",
            "A fan only circulates air. If the fan is in the centre of the room it would either draw air up and then push it to the outer walls or it would draw air from the outer walls and push it down the centre of the room. Either way, wouldn\u2019t make 10 degrees difference but likely that is an exaggeration. If your room really is that drastically different from the rest of the house, it is either the cause of poor ventilation, or poor insulation in your room.",
            "I made up my own mnemonic to remember how to set the fan. \n\nBasically, you want Winter to be over as soon as possible so you want the fan to move clockwise, to keep things moving along. Summer you want to last as long as possible, so you want the fan to move counterclockwise, to keep summer from passing too quickly.",
            "I did this once and all the polar ice caps came back.",
            "No one is explaining this right, the temperature of the air in the bottom of the room and the top isn't the same. In winter mode, since the fan pushes air upwards it brings all the warmer air up in the ceiling down, so the room actually feels warmer and you WILL feel a temperature change. In the \"normal mode\" the fan just pushes air downwards to you and makes it feel cooler.\n\nIf you ever wondered why feeling air from a fan makes you feel cooler its because wind accelerates the evaporation of moisture in your skin. Evaporation has a cooling effect. That's why the human body sweats when its hot so that the sweat evaporates to cool you off. And that's also why wind feels so cold if you are wet.",

            "This is nonsense, the fan moves air. It does not make the room hotter or colder. The lack of common science sense in this is staggering. One way the fan moves air down more efficiently the other way it draws air from below and moves it up. TLDR the OP learned nothing.",

            "Man I know your pain. I used to have this surge protector monitor stand when I was a teenager that would have a high pitched low voltage alarm. It would only come on if the window unit air conditioner was running. In the summer I had to make a choice between being cooled and having to listen to this maddening alarm while trying to play on my pc or gaming in peace but slowly dying of a heat stroke. Every summer it was the same sacrifice. When I moved I took it with me and the curse continued, for over a decade I had been putting up with this thing until I finally bought a new version of the stand. After I had switched everything to the new one I finally looked closely at the old stand and saw a little black switch that disabled the alarm. I almost lost my mind, I probably suffered a mild stroke. I suffered needlessly for years. I smashed the thing and when I turned on the new stand the alarm went off.  At least I knew there was a button back there now.",

            "The perceived cooling effect of a fan is due to the movement of the air blowing away the heat radiated from your body. This does not mean that the air is cooler and it definately doesn't change the temperature of the room. \n\nWeather Apps sometimes show you the measured temperature as well as the perceived one which accounts for wind speed.\n\nThis observation correlates well to other phenomenon, like an increased risk of sunburn on windy (but sunny) days because the sun doesn't *feel* hot or the ability of a very thin but wind-proof jacket to keep you warm on a windy day.",

            "I owned a house in Miami,  years ago. The house had a solar water heater which was really awesome until a hurricane destroyed the solar heating box. It was around 2006 or so,  I could look it up but it was the year we got hit by 5 or 6 hurricanes. I'd start to repair the heating box and we'd get hit again. After that happened a couple times,  I resigned myself to cold showers until we were clear of hurricane season. So it was cold showers for a couple months.  Once I started the repair,  I realised one of the copper pipes going through the roof had been bent and needed to be replaced. There wasn't a traditional attic, but there was a tight crawlspace that only opened up near the chimney, so it was a military crawl for about 20 feet before I could get to a place I could stand up. Once I had gotten to the chimney I saw a water heater. (I still,  too this day,  have no idea how they got a water heater up there. The only possible way was when the roof was off) There was a power AWG cable running to it but it wasn't powered. I followed the cable and realised it went forb into the kitchen. When I bought the house,  there was a switch above the stove that didn't seem to control anything. I just kept the switch off, because I imagined a loose,  live wire that was only powered when the switch was on.  Turns out, the switch turned on the water heater and I didn't have to take months of cold showers.",

I brought up the fact that I thought the blades were rotating the wrong way. He disagreed with me saying he knew and they were going the right way. \n\nWe sat in silence for a minute, the fan not helping cool us down. Without saying anything, he gets up, switches the way the fan was rotating and laid back down. A couple minutes later and the room started to feel cooler. Luckily the dark hid my smirk \ud83d\ude02",

            "am I the only one who suspects weve been lied too about by this 'reverse' switch?  It dosnt matter the direction, if the fan is on it mixes the higher hot air with the lower cool air, regardless of direction. In the winter this is great, you can feel the increase in warmth, in the summer... depends. The evaporative cooling effect fights the warming effect of the fan.  It dosnt seem to matter the direction of the breeze. I suppose in the summer a direct fan 'feels' cooler?  Otherwise, my temp will go up (large room) when the fan goes on regardless of direction.",

There was none around my brothers room. My parents felt so guilty about not listening to my brothers complaints. \n\nWe hired some guys to insert insulation in my brothers room and now it gets super cold even in the summer. My parents haven't told him we fixed the room out of guilt.",
            "It's ok, my dad thought I was absolutely crazy and kept telling me I had no idea what I was talking about when I told him that there was a switch to make it spin opposite directions based on the season and whether you wanted it cold or hot. Argued with me there was no such thing and I had no idea what I was talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUntil they were discussing it on the news, and as they're discussing it I just turned and stared at him the entire time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, he believes it, but only after the news covered it.",

            "I hate ceiling fans. Besides they are ugly as hell. My son was visiting tall and 275 lbs. Came home drunk from high school reunion . Ran into the fan. That is how I got rid of it.",
            "Direction of fan spin causes air to be directed either upward or downward.\n\nWhen fan is off hot air rises so air temp in room is hottest near ceiling, coolest near floor.\n\nMost rooms are fairly small.  If you direct air downward you will move hot air down.  If you direct air upward you will move the cool air torward the ceiling.\n\nObviously if you move air either upward or downward the air at ceiling and floor will simply exchange places.  Within a few minutes or so all the air in the room will mix together and become essentially the same temperature.\n\nFans don't cool.  Evaporation cools.  Sweat on your skin evaporates as moving air passes over it, and as the sweat evaporates into the air it takes the heat in the sweat along with the sweat itself away from your body making you feel cooler.\n\nIf you are not in the room, a running fan cools nothing. Your sweaty li'l body needs to be there to feel anything.\n\nOne last note.  Since it's the evaporation doing the cooling you can \"double your pleasure, double your fun\" by wearing a damp T-shirt.\n\nThat's my story and I'm strick'n to it.\n\nS",
            "Fans don't heat the room if they are going the wrong way. They just do not supply airflow in the expected direction that provides an evaporative effect.",

I've had a similar issue where I've lived in my house for close to 10 years and my ceiling fan has done nothing...... after reading this I just looked a bit closer, and sure enough theres a switch on the side.....\n\nNeedless to say thank you OP for saving me from my sauna as well.",

            "This makes no fucking sense.  A fan\u2019s direction cannot change the temperature of a room by 10\u00b0.",

We have been waiting for our debit cards for 2 weeks. We started a new bank account and had all of our money go into it besides a little bit we get put on a pre pay card. Turns out this online bank does not send out your debit card until you make a deposit (hit a week ago). I am sure it said that somewhere so that is on us. \n\nAnyway we have been spreading the money we had super thin, and we finally reached a point the we are going to try to Venmo or Paypal again. We tried them early in the week and it would not connect to the other card for some reason. \n\nMy wife get everything set up while I am playing PS4, hits transfer and sends a test 50 bucks, it worked! So this is were I come in, I said you should have sent more. So I take the phone from her and Send $225 on Venmo and jokingly write  \"Sex?\" in the message. Error can not process this transaction, next I get a email saying my account has violated terms of service and it is frozen.\n\nTLDR: We finally found a way to transfer money while we were waiting on our debit cards, I fucked it up by writing \"sex?\" in the message to my wife. Now my account is frozen and we are back to not having our money.\n\nEdit: It was a brand new account, I have never had to use Venmo before. So had I been verified, it probably would not have been an issue.\n\nUpdate: Kind of anti climatic but debit cards came in today so we are saved. Still have not heard from venmo, so Kanye shrug.

        "selftext": "(Names changed for the sake of the post) So this took place maybe half an hour ago, and to be honest there's still a chance there will be some kickback for this today. I (25M) work in a call centre, and am doing so for the duration of this pandemic while I wait to find out whats happening about going back to university, its no career but its a pretty nice job with some decent people and its easy, all we do really is facilitate switches for people looking for better deals on household stuff, usually their internet provider or supplier of gas/electricity etc. We have agents in the field who make sales, then call us for verification with the customer, simple right?\n\nNot today. See, usually its company policy not to do call-backs, nobody wants annoying call-centre calls right? So unless the customer specifically requests a scheduled call-back, we just don't do them. I had a customer 2 days ago looking for a pretty pricey internet switch, going from some basic setup to a full TV/Phone/Internet package, the works, all the channels, anytime calls to numbers including international, 500+ mbps wifi, and it came to over \u00a3100 a month. I inform the customer, who's an impatient sounding guy, that because of the price increase he'll need to have a quick credit check run on him and it'll mean the call takes a little longer. The guy gets all pissed about being busy and saying he \"can't waste all afternoon on the phone to some call-centre\" so would it be alright if I called him after the weekend to go through it then. Seemed straightforward enough...\n\nThis is pretty common, people are always up for the sale until they realise they'll need to spend more than 1 whole minute on the phone, but I scheduled the call anyway and asked if there was a specific time he wanted me to call, he says any time is fine and follows with \"If Emily answers, just ask her for me, she'll make sure I get the phone\" and gave me a home-phone number. Fast forward to today, and I make a grave error.\n\nSee, the application I had from the customer had his home phone number already filled in, which it turns out was NOT the same number he'd given me for today's call back. I called the number I thought was correct, and a woman answers. I say without thinking; \"Oh hi, I'm calling for Steve to confirm his broadband switch, we spoke the other day? You must be Emily!\" .....cue uncomfortable pause. She says  \"This is Steve's wife, Amanda. What do you mean I \"must\" be Emily?\"\n\nI apologised, and said \"I'm so sorry, when I spoke to him the other day he said if an Emily answered to just ask for Steve?\" And she just goes \"I fucking knew it, I fucking KNEW IT.\" and slammed the phone down. After checking the application against the post-it note i'd jotted some info down on the other day, I realised Steve must have given me the number for where he was going to be today, and i'd instead called his unsuspecting wife at home. Nobody's called in to my workplace yet, but if they do I don't think they'll be happy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Customer gave me a different number to his own for a call-back, and I accidentally called his wife and revealed his infidelity\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE! Well fUCK, angry Steve just called my workplace, and has achieved nothing but making himself look like an ever bigger fucking dipshit than he already has, also for the record, Steve was always a dick who can die in a hole, and deserves all he gets, the reason for the TIFU was because I was worried about my job)  So I haven't worked here very long, and am still learning things about company policy, and it turns out that when an application is put through by an agent, it MUST be the applicants own details, according to what they provide the agent. So I was only technically allowed to call the wife anyway, not Emily's home number as he gave me. If he'd wanted the call to a different number, he would have had to have a new application submitted with revised details, it wasn't enough to just give me a different number over the phone, so my job is safe (phew) however my manager isn't happy and i'm getting a write-up, but I can live with that, they don't mean much and i've never had one til now, always on time and have taken overtime voluntarily etc. ANYWAY, this guy phones up and before saying anything else, leads the call with one of my colleagues, who by the way, is a teenage girl in what I think is her first job, and he says \"Put me on with the little f\\*cking c\\*nt who thought it would be funny to call my wife earlier after I EXPLICITLY told him not too\"\n\nObviously the poor girl was confused, and looked about to ask the room for a manager asap, I immediately piped up and said \"Is it Mr X from \\*insert location\\*??\" and she confirmed, so I got her to transfer the call to my desk ASAP, Steve comes on the line and goes \"I bet you think you're well f\\*cking funny you little pr\\*ck, put your manager on the phone and see if you're so smart when you lose your job\"  So in my most sarcastic, overcompensating cutesy phone voice ever, I just say \"Of course sir, let me just transfer you to someone who can help\" then put him on hold for 20 minutes hoping it would wind him up even more while I found my manager and told him about the whole situation, he explained what i'd said above that I wasn't technically in the wrong from a legal standpoint, and then my poor team leader had to quickly explain to Steve that he didn't have a legal claim but that we're sorry for the distress caused (sucky I know, but its a business after all) and now hopefully Steve's evening culminates in his entire life being ruined. I got a disciplinary write-up for it but its over now, sorry for the wall of text but thanks for the awards!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE 2: For those wondering about the disciplinary, it was a formality and was the lowest possible level write-up my company can give, it was given as a formality because of disruption to the office (the girl Steve called was upset and it became a whole thing) He argued that I still made a mistake but that ultimately I am in no trouble over it, he also cited on the write up that leaving him on hold for so long just to wind him up was spiteful and petty, which, yeah, but Steve deserved it so it be like that\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 3: Not a continuation of the story, but thanks so much for the /insane/ amount of awards, (I didn't even know an argentinium award was a thing) I'm glad this story has given you guys as much joy and faith in karma as it has my colleagues and I today, it's spiralled to become the talking point of the whole office today and has been a bit of a scandal! Your support over my write-up is touching, but I won't challenge it, hopefully before long i'll be on to better things and this will just be a funny memory! This has even somehow birthed its own subreddit?? To the creator of r/TodaySteveFuckedUp, a special thanks \ud83d\ude06Thanks again for so much love, you Reddit bunch are the best x",

Turns out, he was having it made for his mistress and when his wife heard the message on the home machine she got so excited she came in and picked up her new surprise gift! He ended up dropping another $10,000 on an identical bracelet for his mistress, who had originally known he was buying it for her. He couldn\u2019t fault us and never said a word, but I\u2019ve never seen someone deflate quite as quickly and completely as he did when he came in to pay for the second bracelet.",

            "You're just doing your job, fuck him.  I used to work at a large grocery chain. I was a shift supervisor. This chain does the free turkey at Thanksgiving program where you spend $300 between 1st week of October and day before Thanksgiving, you get a free turkey. Pretty standard, lots of chains do it. Oftentimes people would think they were entitled to a turkey and when they went to go redeem, it didn't work. I would have to then go to the cashier, get the customer's frequent shopper card (FSC), and see what the problem was. Usually they just hadn't spent as much as they thought and that was that because they had plenty of time to shop more. Sometimes, it was because they already redeemed their turkey. This is where my story comes in. With their FSC, I can go to my computer, see how many points they had towards the turkey, I could see where they shopped for the last 10 years,  see how much they spent, see where they redeemed their turkey, etc. More than once (I worked there for a very long time), when people would insist that they didn't redeem their turkey, I would go to my computer with their FSC, look it up,  and see it was redeemed at a store on the other side of the state, revealing that the shopper's husband was redeeming it at their girlfriend's place and using the family FSC. I felt awful but there was no way for me to know that. Same for you. Not your fault he's a cheating piece of shit.",

            "Dude i worked 10 months in a call center. For background, im a HS dropout who went into a very niche manufacturing industry and did well, but then lost employment following the US recession. Im a hard ass worker. But that call center sucked so bad - my last 3-4 months i was basically absent, and ridiculous policies let me go that long before termination. Basically, any \u201cwrite up\u201d would roll any same offense actions together from the date of the offense to the date of the sit down with management which made it official. This meant you could literally run away when you saw the managers come out if their office and look over at you. Anyway, fuck that job, fuck the absolute nuclear dill holes who treat employees like dogshit, and fuck the politics that make some of the worst human beings upper management and the most competent employees remain lower level. Ive had people tell me how worthless i am because they were doctors/lawyers/rich, and so many people would call purely to kill time talking to us like shit for basically no discernible reasons (in bound only)",

Unfortunately due to the nature of my work we have to move soon and having a real wedding before then during covid would be impossible. I got off work early today and after getting home my fianc\u00e9e asked if we could go get some paperwork notarized for our courthouse wedding we planned to have in a month or two. We hopped in the car with a form we printed off the county website and drove to the closest UPS, the notary checked our IDs and had us sign and then she signed, notarized the form, and said congratulations. Cool, now all we have to do is go to the courthouse on a day of our choosing to be wed. My fianc\u00e9e called the courthouse afterwards double checking to see if we needed to bring anything else and after calling me her boyfriend the lady on the phone corrected her by saying \u201chusband.\u201d She then told my fianc\u00e9e our state no longer requires a ceremony with the judge at the courthouse. That form is literally the marriage certificate and she is now married. Whoops!

The typical sample is taken by using a cotton swab to grab some cheek cells, oral bacteria, etc by scraping the inside of your cheek. He had a microscope with a camera attached for the demonstration, so he asked for a sample from the student closest to him. They swabbed their check, then he fixed the sample onto a slide and put it under the microscope. Once he got to the 40x objective (lens) it was pretty obvious: the student had a good amount of sperm in her sample, and it was projected in front of the whole class!

        "selftext": "Throwaway for reasons.\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSo this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.\n\nAbout 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I\u2019d finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I\u2019d brought some with me that I\u2019d recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.\n\nThings were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn\u2019t helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. \n\nSo I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It\u2019s a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door\u2019s door is about one meter away from mine. I\u2019d not met anybody on my street yet and didn\u2019t realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of \u201chello nice to meet you, my name\u2019s (her name), are you new to the area?\u201d\n\nSo basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can\u2019t speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were \u201cje voudrais une boulangerie\u201d (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn\u2019t handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said \u201cbonjour\u201d, so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I\u2019d just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can\u2019t speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. \n\nFast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I\u2019m in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I\u2019ve perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.\nI\u2019d gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn\u2019t let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn\u2019t French. If I had friends come over (I don\u2019t have many so it wasn\u2019t too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. \n\nThings were going okay and I wasn\u2019t too worried about being exposed anymore because I\u2019d gotten so used to it. I\u2019m not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.\n\nBut then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn\u2019t recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend \u201cthis is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about\u201d. You might be able to see where this is going. \n\nHer friend hits me with a question in French that I didn\u2019t understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn\u2019t know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn\u2019t actually French and couldn\u2019t speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I\u2019d been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I\u2019d  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.\n\nTL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.\n\nEDIT: I didn\u2019t think this post was going to catch much attention, and I\u2019m praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I\u2019d like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",

I realized halfway through our conversation he was calling me \"Brad\". Wtf that's not my name? Oh shit, my middle name that I have never once used is Bradley... He must have been trying to remember my name, looked at the registration paperwork on my table and read the middle name as my first name.

Only after my posts hit 3 million views, did they suddenly try to call me and they offered me my $5 refund.\n\nBut get this. Suddenly I'm getting tagged and I discover that their official account has posted for the first time in ages.... and DOXXED me in the thread.

Instead, the comment is removed by the moderators from the thread, but it has not been removed from their profile nor has their profile been banned as a normal user would be. It's still up!\n\nNot sure what to do to get it removed. Any media I can contact to put pressure on Lyft??\n\nTL;DR: Got myself DOXXED by the official Lyft account, which reddit apparently does not want to ban or even remove the comment.\n\nEdit: After 5 hours, they removed my name. One of their execs just emailed me to inform me that they removed it, and suggested I could delete my Lyft account. I suggested they clean up their PR and CS teams because they're not doing so well today.\n\nFor your amusement: she is one of the top execs and she is located in the central time zone, so she was doing this at 11:00 p.m. \ud83d\ude02 Sounds like they are finally awake and paying attention. \ud83d\udc4b\n\nUpdate Tuesday morning: the customer service rep (same one who doxed me) who insisted he wanted to speak to me on the phone did not in fact call me at the appointed time.

So I pulled up his account history and there was literally pages upon pages of online purchases. The gag? Every single one of the purchases was OnlyFans. I guess that he subscribed to many many pages......and the craziest part was that they were over the last few days directly after he got paid so he got a bunch of money then blew it all on OnlyFans subscriptions!\n\nWhen I saw the account history I pretended to cough because I had the biggest urge to laugh but I managed to hold it in. I asked him if he had online banking or if he\u2019d managed to look at his account history recently & he said no. I offered to print it out for him and he said yes please. When I handed the printouts to him, he just said ahhhh. And I came so close to laughing again but I managed to hold it in and be professional. Then I asked if he made those purchases and he just dejectedly said yes. And. I. Giggled. I couldn\u2019t help it. He gave me this weird look & left. Afterwards I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and laughed it all out of my system.\n\nI guess he called in to complain because after I came from my lunch break my manager called me into his office and now we\u2019ve scheduled a call for HR tomorrow.

I just got done meeting with HR and I did exactly what you guys said, I took full responsibility for what happened. My manager asked why it was funny and I explained what OnlyFans is and the HR lady burst into laughter. They just let me off with a verbal warning and they said they appreciate the fact that I took responsibility but that I should try better controll my laughter next time, which is definitely fair enough.

If this is the first time you\u2019ve done anything, they may just want to hear you acknowledge that wasn\u2019t appropriate. Now I was a teller for a couple years when I got started, and depending on the rapport I built with customers, I\u2019d have varying communication styles. Just learn to read people better, and make sure to treat their purchases and financial records like the important data they are. You wouldn\u2019t want someone reading off your medical history in public would you? Same premise. \n\nNow, understand that yes, putting anyone on blast for their purchases is inappropriate. If you go into the conversation remorseful and understanding of the problem (which sounds like you intrinsically have) then you\u2019ll probably leave with a warning. That\u2019s fine. All the serious warnings I ever got were as a teller. You learn and move on. \n\nAll this is under the presumption that you don\u2019t have previous warnings or HR issues.

            "Best thing to do is own up to it, don't make excuses, acknowledge the overall problem and your personal error, and make your bosses feel comfortable that you realize how serious this is, that it's not just about you but also about how it reflects on and affects the bank, and that you won't make the same mistake twice.  Having access to people's personal financial information is a heavy topic and this man probably feels violated by your reaction to his private info (innocent as your reaction was, this is an unfortunate crossroads of personal financial information held by a regulated bank and a personally embarrassing set of purchases).  Dodging or deflecting will not save your job and will reflect poorly on you.  You said this is a big bank - it will have well established procedures for this, and understand that the HR and management people that you interact with at the meeting are just doing their jobs too and may be bound to take certain actions by company policy.  I'm cautiously optimistic that you weren't fired on the spot and have a chance to meet with people.  Ultimately, if it doesn't work out and you're fired, comporting yourself maturely in this will get you a softer landing (you're young, these people are human, a letter of recommendation from sympathetic people who are forced to fire you due to policy will go a long way even outside of the financial sector).",

For me personally demands don\u2019t go far, treat me like a human with a modicum of respect and ask nicely and I will happily help. This gentlemen wanted to just try to be a bully like many customers think is appropriate, it is not. As the Branch Manager I took him to the side of our teller line to look at what had happened. I pulled up his profile the account was indeed overdrawn, and not by the $50 he knew about, but rather about $140 in the negative. He got even angrier, I offered to print off his transactions so he could review everything, and I would be happy to help with any fraudulent charges. He stated \u201cNO, just fuckin read them to me.\u201d I obliged, opened the account and started reading the charges out loud. Naturally our lobby was small and the other 5 customers could easily hear me read titles that all included words like \u201csexy\u201d \u201cbabes\u201d \u201cxxx\u201d all porn websites he had blown his paycheck on, needless to say all the charges were legitimate.

I looked over and realized it was, in fact, not my mother at which point my dad turned the car off and told the lady she got in the wrong car. Watching her walk to her car, she got into a similarly colored Yukon where there was a male wearing a cap similar to my dad's and he had a similar body shape with similar complexion.

A cop is telling us we can press charges, but this guy is actually just fucking wasted and thought he was at his own place a few blocks away.\n\nWell shit. No, we won't press charges. \n\nSo they take the dude home and that's that. Luckily they're chill college cops.\n\nThe world is a scary place, but not always.",

Each year in school my crush for her grew.  After I graduated I was not used to not  seeing her and talking to her and got a little depressed.  So then I ended writing a letter to her confessing my love for her. (I feel like a huge idiot now. And I wish I had never done it). And to no surprise she didn\u2019t feel the same way and figured she didn\u2019t. I would tell people about how I was in \u201clove\u201d with a girl but never told them who it was or how I knew her. So people would encourage me to tell my crush how I felt about her. Stupid me went through with it. Looking back I wish I hadn\u2019t done it.  One of her sons was the same age as me and I feel so awkward and stupid whenever I seen him out in public.  I don\u2019t think she told him because if she had I think I would\u2019ve got my jaw broken (rightfully merited now that I think about it). I wish I never did what I did.",

I blurted out \"Nigeria!\" since naturally I knew all the university's he had listed as having worked at. He looked at me and was like huh...  Good guess.",

She gives me her number one Sunday and tells me what time of day is good to call her. This was the exact time in my life at which I became self-aware enough to know the panic of calling your crush for the first time. \n\nCue the montage of me sitting by the phone trying to muster up enough courage to dial the number. \n\nCue the repeated I-dialed-and-just-heard-the-first-ring-but-I-don't-know-what-to-say, hang-up-quick-before-someone-answers routine. \n\nThis happened several times throughout the course of the week as I waited for my courage to stay put long enough for me to let someone answer. \n\nIt never did. \n\nBeing born in the late eighties, I saw the advent of several little technologies that are now completely common, particularly regarding telephony. One of those little advances was the incredibly useful thing known as \"Caller Identification.\" It wasn't totally widespread at that point and we didn't have it in our house yet, but guess who did. \n\nThe following Sunday when I saw her, I felt I was ready to have a go at actually talking to her, having found a much calmer outlook learned from my week of childish cowardice. So I approached her.\n\n\"You've been calling...often.\"\n\nCue the pitying look from her mom (who knew my mom on good terms and I'm sure recognized the name) that seemed to say, \"You poor thing, bless your heart...\"\n\nCue the last time I tried talking to her and the subsequent few years of  awkward eye contact and silence and me inwardly dying a little each time I saw her until I eventually stopped going there.\n\nThat was at least two-thirds of my life ago and I can laugh about it at this point, but I still get a little cringe when it comes to mind. Yikes."

Basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. \n\nObviously I think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though I've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. So, for some stupid reason, I decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. I set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. \n\nAfter a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after I showed this to him, I saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. \n\nQueue my surprise when a couple of days later I check the tinder account I had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and I could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. \n\nI confronted him and he denied it but I mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. Obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity I checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. So now the tinder I made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool\n\nTL;DR: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with\n\nEdit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up!

And nowadays i also realized she didn't quite loved me that much at that point - maybe it died along the time (i believe to be my case), or maybe I was the better/only option to begin with, but thinking about it does nothing but hurt me, so i tend not to think about it too much. \n\nThe point is - She being with me at that point was not healthy either for her or for me. When someone is not that into you anymore, they often get aggressive, blackmail you, put you down, etc etc, and you literally don't realize is until it's a year afterwards and you notice the relationship was toxic.\n\nIF indeed he left you and betrayed in a single fucking day or week, just for that small hint of interest from others, that was not quite a Fuck Up.\n\nThat was a hell of a bullet dodged.\n\nI mean, you should only *date* someone who actually and deeply love or care for you. If he did not, he was a tremendously bad bf for you. (Maybe not for all time, as you definitely share a caring history, but, at least right now)\n\nLet him go.

        "selftext": "It\u2019s still in my post history because I am permanently keeping it as a reminder that I\u2019m a fucking idiot whenever my ego gets out of check. \n\nOkay so this morning I posted on Reddit a conversation me and my friends had in which we all unanimously agreed that drinking a gallon of milk in under an hour is 100% possible and is an incredibly easy challenge. My reasoning was that an entire hour is a lot of time, and that if you just slowly and steadily drink the milk while portioning yourself there\u2019s no reason why anybody can\u2019t do it. One of the lesser challenges was doing a half gallon in an hour and I can say from a certain experience with hot sauce a while ago that I was 100% capable of achieving that so I was absolutely confident I could do two.\n\nI posted it to Reddit, feeling pretty high and mighty of myself on the \u201cunpopular opinions\u201d board and was immediately provided with multiple comments informing me that I was an idiot and had no idea what I was talking about. These comments from inferior humans asked me to record my endeavors and I was without a doubt ready and willing to prove them wrong. So I went to my local 7/11, bought a gallon of 2% and got back to my dorm. \n\nI will give myself credit through my naive ego, I did prepare for the worst a little bit, I sat with a towel bib in case of dribblage and pre-opened one of the shower stalls because the toilets would not account the possible gallons worth milk that could occur from the bovi-licious odyssey I was about to traverse upon. So I turned on my video camera and filled up 5 approximately 25 ounces cups of milk. \n\nLooking at these completely full cups infront of me, the milk carton definitely tricks you with its sheer volume and I was realizing the challenge ahead of me, but mama didn\u2019t raise no bitch so I went in.\n\nFirst cup: Totally easy, I love milk, my father, brother and I will go through a gallon within 2-3 days tops, and all I have to do is do this every 12 minutes and I\u2019m home free and all those losers on Reddit will know how cool I am.\n\nSecond cup: I down this one too, easy peasy, though the first signal to my brain that I was very much so satiated with my daily value of calcium was already upon us. Though this was a challenge even the greatest often failed at, I wasn\u2019t going to underestimate this challenge, but rather like a matador I will corral this bull with steadiness and finesse.\n\nThird cup: this one I was able to not consistently down, I got about half way through and I had to breathe for a second. But I have a 12 minute window to down this so I don\u2019t have to rush it. The camera is still recording, I wonder if I have to post this full hour of footage to prove it or if I can just skip to each time I drink. Ha. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see I can drink an entire gallon. How much time till my next cup? IVE GOT 30 SECONDS?! \n\nFourth cup: OKAY! I FINISHED THE THIRD CUP IN THE TIME WINDOW! The 12 minute mark hit and I didn\u2019t immediately drink it, I picked it up, inspected it\u2019s beautiful color and temperature, and immediately had to put it back down because a certain noise just befell my ears... did my stomach just... hiccup? Me and humbleness have a very long distance relationship, and as the crazy zodiac girl in my nursing classes has informed me, \u201cyou totally DO give off Leo energy\u201d. And while my understanding of stars is lacking I think that translates to at this very moment, I definitely have gotten myself into a bad scenario thanks to my ego\u201d. I begin to drink the fourth cup and my stomach is really starting to slosh around, it\u2019s just stagnant and sitting in there and I can feel it truly filling up. SOMEHOW, BY SHEER MIRACLE OR LUCK, I get cup 4 down within the time window with a few minutes to spare. \n\nFifth cup: ALL. I. DID. WAS. BURP. A very small burp, but up with it came a mouth full of milk. I realized my fate was sealed. As I swallowed it back down I knew that the second part of the challenge was actually sitting there and not puking as the body begins to naturally break down the lactose and shit in the milk. I haven\u2019t even touched the fifth cup yet, just decided to bring my knees up to my chest to help with the completely full stomach... then, I, very graciously I should add, sprinted like a mad man to the open shower, kneeled on that gross ass floor and prepared for the inevitable. 10 seconds.. 15... nothing was happening... so I slowly got up and went to head back to my room to hopefully finish the challenge, and THEN I BUMPED THE STALL DOOR RIGHT INTO MY GUT. \n\nIn that moment I saw two things, the white of the milk projectile ejecting from my mouth into the shower floor from my rapidly turning head as to not destroy everything. And the vision of God punishing me for the next probably 40 years because I attempted to achieve the ways of the golden calf. \n\nIt is now 5 hours later, and Reddit has won this time with their stupid facts and basic science that I chose to ignore. I am still making frequent trips to the bathroom with generous supplies of dairy for the toilet from both ends. If you need me I will be listening to \u201cI told you so\u2019s\u201d from the toilet. \n\nTl;dr: I try to best Reddit by drinking a whole gallon of milk and now my stomach is churning to the point that I may shit butter\n\nEdit: It has been only two hours and so far I have seen many people read this story, understand my overconfidence within it, and then comment that they bet they could personally do the challenge themselves and will be trying soon, which makes me feel better knowing that I am not ill for this world. Thanks guys!\n\nEdit 2: FAQ on my [Main Page](https://www.reddit.com/user/leprecaun8/comments/n1bzfh/quick_little_faq_so_that_i_dont_have_to_check_250/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)",

        "selftext": "So I have an uncle (we will call him J) who has always been VERY vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.\n\nWell this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that's how I roll. A lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so I don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.\n\nSo I'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn't letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I've been talking to and I told him I don't judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years \n\nHe kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.\n\nAlways get a face pic, people.\n\nTL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic\n\nEdit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but I'll answer some pressing questions . I did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who I was . It is pretty disturbing to say the least. As far as blackmail goes I have everything saved but I don't plan on doing anything with it as I think that could actually put me in danger . This man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.\n\nEdit 2: this was fake . Reddit is gullible and I fucking hate TIFU . It's all fake stories just like twoxchromosomes .

            "As someone who was out at a youngish age, (14/15) I've been surprised quite a few times after matching with dudes on Tinder who were (somewhat) homophobic in High School. Not bullies by any means but you could tell they were clearly uncomfortable with someone being out in public. At first I thought it was absolutely hilarious until I met one of the guys a few years later at a bar. He came up to me (mostly sober haha) and gave me the most heartfelt speech about how he wished he could've shown his true self to the world, how much time he wasted trying to craft an image that didn't exist, ect. It was extremely sweet and we talked about how being 'cool' in high school was essentially being broadly accepted by most people, and agreed that having people love you for who you are is the coolest thing you can do. We still talk once in a while and sometimes ask each other for advice :)",

So was mine because I don\u2019t want people to know how slutty I am, lol. \n\nWe talked for about 5 minutes. (Thank god it was never sexy talk, just funny banter) \n\nThen he sends me his picture. \n\nI\u2019m dying. It was my nephew. That\u2019s when I learned he was in the closet. \n\nHis profile advertised he, \u201clikes to have sex with no condom, and likes \u2018car play\u2019\u201d\n\nI immediately went into panic mode. Now I had to hide he was gay from my entire homophobic family AND talk to him about safe sex. \n\nIt was the worst, but I had to swallow my pride. I met up with him, told him it was me, and had to tell him his secret is safe with me, and that we needed to have a safe-sex talk. \n\nHe was dying of embarrassment. (So was I) but I *had* to do it. I don\u2019t want to get a call from my nephew 5 years from now that he has an incurable disease. \n\nDefinitely the worst thing I\u2019ve had to go through with him.

Figured I'd tell this story though so here it goes:\n\nI used to date this girl and early on in our relationship we were all about the \"going out to bars\" phase and hanging out every chance we could. Well it was a Friday night and my brother was playing guitar at a bar so I thought it'd be fun to join my parents and my sister and drink and listen to him play. My parents arrived at the bar first, and then my girlfriend and I arrived in my car. We parked a couple cars down from my dads car. There were a ton of cars so we found a spot and nestled right in. \n\nCut to an hour in: We're having a grand old time, drinkin and yuckin' it up with my family. Well I look at my girlfriend and she flashes me the, \"sexy eyes\" and of course me being a drunk and horny 23 year old decides to flash em back. So i pretend I'm going outside with her to have a smoke and we go to my car and it's pretty dark out. Noone is around. I triple check to look for people and then when I assume its safe i pull out my log and she starts giving me the ol blowie. \n\nNow I'm in the car for a good 15 minutes with her and we were both drunk, but not completely useless...but we both must of lost track of time because we were so in the moment that we didn't realize the \"gig\" my brother was playing let out....\n\nI hear the knock on the window first and we both jump about 2 feet in the air in our seats. I look up. My sister starts walking away shaking her head. I see my mom with the most horrified look on her face. My brother is loading up my dads car with his music equipment. My dad just turned and tried to hurry my mom back to their car. Meanwhile my girlfriend pretends to be looking for a contact while I'm struggling to zip up my jeans. \n\nThe next day my girlfriend and I had plans for dinner with my parents. I wanted to get ahead of the situation to gauge my dad's reaction and to hopefully find out what exactly they saw. So I begin to open my mouth when he cuts me off and says \"so we're having chicken for dinner tonight\". \"Cool dad, but <insert gfs name here> is a vegetarian\". And without missing a beat my dad says: \"not from what we saw last night....unless you have a broccoli dick.\" Ladies and gentlemen, my father.\n\nTl:dr - my entire family caught me getting a blowjob from my girlfriend at the time.",

        "selftext": "This TIFU actually happened yesterday (throwaway account)\n\nIt was a sunny day in an otherwise crappy Scandinavian summer. So me and my 5yo son went out to play at one of the city playgrounds. This particular playground has a really cool artificial river for kids to play in. Needless to say, the place was packed. Since my boy was having such a good time playing with his friends, now was a good moment to make my weekly FaceTime-call with my mom.\n\nHence my error....\n\nFast forward 5 minutes.... I am still having a nice chat, laying down with the sun in my face. Life is good. When suddenly the sun literally got blocked by four or five moms and dads gathering around me, looking absolutely PISSED. One of the dads says: \"we called the police\". I had no clue what they were talking about. Let alone that they meant that they called the police on *me*. I naively asked \"oh, what happened?\". Replied by \"You are filming our kids without our permission.\".... eh, wait, what??\n\nWhile still on FaceTime with my mom I look over my phone to see what I am actually pointing my camera towards. I see a bunch of butt-naked kids running around, while my own kid wandered off to some other part of the playground. I desperately tried to explain what is going on, and that I wasn't just filming random kids. But I was so stressed that I couldn't find the words (I am living in this country as a foreigner, and don't fully master the language yet). Honestly, if I were these guys I would be darn sceptical of the situation myself.\n\nBy now the crowd grew to a mob of 15 people or so. I got up to get my kid, when one of the dads says that I cannot leave without leaving my phone. \"Hell no\", I said. That sobered me up quite fast and I explained in clearer words what is going on. The situation cooled down and most parents walked away. But there were two couples that would have none of it, and demanded me to stay until the police arrived.\n\nEventually the police showed up and fortunately they were really chill about it - almost laughing when I explained what was going on. They asked me to show my camera-roll which of course showed nothing improper. Also I showed my call history, which indicated that indeed I had quite a long phone call with my mom on FaceTime.\n\nThe angry couples apologised, which I appreciated. Me and my son gathered our stuff and immediately went home. On the way home my son asked why everyone wanted to see my pictures..... Oh boy, I can't wait for him to be old enough for me to tell him this story.\n\nTL;DR : Went to the water-playground with my kid, called my mom on FaceTime, and was mistaken by  parents for voyeur-filming their naked kids.\n\nEDIT 1: Whow this exploded! Interesting to see the different perspectives. I guess there are some cultural differences between the nations - which is fine. I don't judge culture.\n\nEDIT 2: Regarding social distancing; Scandinavia is not in lock-down, and (practically) never has been. We have a relatively obedient population where we follow government recommendations without too much questioning. So far we were spared the catastrophe, meaning that our kids can still play in the park. But who knows that the future holds in store... Stay safe everyone!",

            "When my nephew was 6, he really wanted to walk to the bus stop and wait for the bus \u201clike a big kid.\u201d They live at the end of a cul-de-sac and the bus stop is at the beginning of the street, at the corner of the main road, about a 5-min wall. The main road is a busy road, especially in the morning.\n\nThis was a big deal to my nephew because all the other kids were a little older so he was the only one with a parent there.\n\nSo my brother-in-law would secretly follow him and stay out of sight behind fences/trees until my nephew got on the bus. Then my brother-in-law (who is a construction worker) would immediately go to work.\n\nIn retrospect, I\u2019m more surprised that it took almost 2 weeks before someone called the cops about the creepy guy in dirty clothes spying on children at the bus stop .",
            "I'm a single dad and this one woman called the cops when my little girl was playing on the bars at a park... ironically I think out of displaced shame. She had to run to the bathroom and her kid fell off the jungle gym; I looked over to see if he was ok. Didn't touch him, just checked. It was enough for a full on harangue... and the cops getting called... I ended up leaving with my daughter as there weren't any other witnesses. Anyway it was one of our local  parks and she used to stare at me all the time and watch me. Cops kept getting called. We moved to a different park to avoid the harassment.",
            "This reminds me of something my dad did once.\n\nMy wife and I had recently moved into our first apartment together, but there a bunch of kids on the estate who weren\u2019t particularly well-trained. These kids decided to throw shit in our house; stones, rubbish, balls, you name it, through the open door, the letterbox, etc. This was stressing my wife out so I called my dad to see what he suggested. Of course we should confront their parents, right? But we had no idea who these kids belonged to, let alone which doors to knock on. So my dad, the super clever bastard he is decides to sit in the doorway with his camera phone out. I told him I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea, but he persisted. His logic was sound; pretend to use the phone as security footage in order to deter the kids from trying anything. Unfortunately those little shits ran back to their parents saying some old guy was outside taking videos of them. He got in deep shit with the entire neighbourhood, but at least we now knew who was responsible for the little shits.\n\nWe moved out less than a year later.\n\nEDIT: Because a few people have been commenting about evidence - there wasn\u2019t any. My dad wasn\u2019t actually filming the kids. He was just pretending to do so as a deterrent. Even if he had filmed, it would\u2019ve just been video evidence of kids hanging around in the street giving him stink-eye because he was an old man filming kids. There was no evidence of any foul play to confront the kids parents with, or to take to the police.",
            "Man that must've been surreal. I am so glad the police were reasonable and didn't jump to conclusions.\nI have a three year old and he is like a cat in that he is always hugging your legs. This is something he does with all of us at home. My wife makes jokes about it all the time, all he needs is to purr and we can buy him Whiskas. I was playing with him outside one day, and he comes and hugs my leg, of course his head is in my crotch area, but I never thought about it, my little boy is hugging me it's the sweetest thing ever. Here comes this asshole, and says \"you're enjoying that a little bit too much aren't you? \" Of course I'm enjoying it, I looked at him and answered \"absolutely, they grow so quick and once they grow they know it all and don't like to shower\" I responded jokingly. He started walking towards me, he looked mad something triggered an alarm in my head and I moved my son behind me. He started calling me a pervert. He invaded my personal space and I pushed him back, when I finally understood what he was implying I became enraged and nauseated. Someone called the police, when they arrived I was questioned, they were reasonable.\nIt turns out the guy is an ultra conservative Christian. He was telling the police that I was rubbing my son against my crotch. As he is saying this my son does it again and hugs my leg, and the guy goes \"look he is doing it again!\" The officer looks at my son, looks at me, he goes \"ok enough, you have some serious issues man, what you see and what we all see are two different things\". At this point he starts talking about his faith, what the Bible says on temptation etc etc. The police leave, a few months later I find out the guy is a registered sexual offender, turned to religion and was again arrested when he attempted to molest children at the congregation he attended.",
            "one time at the park with my 4 girls (2-9) a little boy  got stuck on part of the structure and asked me for help (he was gonna face plant) so of course my parent instinct came in and i grabbed under his armpits and set him down on the ground...2 seconds later this very crusty mom storms towards us and pulls him away\n.death glaring...as my youngest is tryna grab my leg...i just pointed at her and was like \"i got kids..im not.... nvm\". \n\nwas kinda amusing but also really sad that actual pervs ruined harmless \"adult genuinely helping a kid\" stuff.",

She loved to pull on my hair, my beard, my glasses, and I was one of maybe three people who could get her to take naps. And boy this little one would pass out hard. Her mom always got a kick out of it. I even got hired to babysit for them outside of regular work, took care of the snot, saliva, and even changed a diaper with no prior experience in doing so. For some context, my gag reflex is really sensitive and those kinds of things set it off way too easily, but I didn't let them bother me. \n\nThat wasn't the only baby that ended up liking me either. I had another regular who was super sweet and loved it when I wore a specific sweater, she would nap much better for some reason. Even some of the older kids wound up liking me.

They put me in the car, and took her back in the restaurant. Then the questions... \n\n\"What's your relationship to the child you were buying dinner?\" \n\nShe's my daughter.\n\n\"Is she going to say that?\"\n\nYes. \n\n\"Is that what you told her to say?\"\n\nNo.\n\n\"Someone in the restaurant saw you fondling her.\"\n\nI did not.\n\n\"Why would they lie?\"\n\nI don't know.\n\nAfter about an hour, they let me out of the car and brought my daughter out of the restaurant.

She kept constantly moving to one side of the road than back across to the other side for some reason.\n\n She did this for about 1 or 2 minutes and I felt totally uncomfortable just slowly following her, but I obviously couldn't just drive past her and risk running into her bike. When she finally moved and parked on the side of the road, I was able to drive past her.

I even asked him to walk beside me but he declined and stayed back.\n\nAs I got closer to school, I came across a friend also walking and whispered to me \"Do you know there's a man following you??\", I had to explain that it was my dad keeping on eye on me because of aforementioned sketchy people.\n\nWe made it all the way to the school gate, with more students on the path and my dad still following. It wasn't till I was past the gates and yelled out \"Bye Dad!\" that he decided it was a good point to turn around. Really, calling out to him was my way of making sure people knew he wasn't one of the sketchy guys in the news!\n\nIt was a little embarrassing but also amusing. I love my dad for trying his best.",

He always stopped for me, but it did make him uncomfortable, because while I was oblivious, he could see all the mean looks pointed in his direction.   \n\n\nEventually he explained that, because of the differences in our ages and races, everybody at the plaza probably thought he was picking up a prostitute.

Make them stand out and be something that wouldn't be easily copied by chance.\n\nIf someone sees that you and your child are wearing the exact same colors and style, they will connect a lot easier who you are and who is your kid. \n\nThis also makes finding your kids easier because you can just point out your outfit and say \"they are wearing this,\" if you lose sight of them.\n\nIf you have a few different sets it's also something that you can have as memories. \n\nExamples: [One](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1751/5137/products/Parent-child-Father-Daughter-Matching-Clothes-Gift-Girl-Dresses-and-Mens-Top-Shirt-Pant-Set-African_530x.jpg?v=1578627983), [Two](https://img.xshoppy.shop/uploader/d961a3493f737f3fecc9a2d4dc61d0caf0c37e2b.jpg), [Three](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/1c/9e/5c1c9e468f205e8e375a34490a950681.png)\n\nGood luck."

Friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. Etc etc. all I can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. But I can never say anything about it being an accident. So like now I\u2019m being adopted and changing my name. \n\nTl/dr sent a fathers day commercial to my stepdad who is adopting me now. I\u2019m 31!",

            "Off-topic, but this reminds me of something that happened when I was a kid. So I'm in church with my grandparents, about 10 years old, not paying attention as usual. I decide I want to go to the lake after church so I ask my grandpa if \"he'll go with me\", not mentioning what I meant. \n\nYeah, turns out that was the exact part where the preacher was asking if anyone wants to come up to agree to be baptized. Next thing I know, I'm walking down to the front with my grandpa. He looked so proud of me, I couldn't back out then. \n\nSo that's how I got accidentally baptized.",

He is very happy about it. I'm stoked and can't wait for it to be finalized but it has been a hassle and it's not been cheap. Be realistic about the time, effort and cost involved and if that is too much tell him sooner rather than later. I originally assumed this was a bigger deal to me than to my dad but I was incorrect. I'm very glad I was 100% on this decision prior to letting him know because he asks for updates every time I see/talk to him and he wants to throw a party to celebrate when I officially become his son.

Initially the plan was to pop the question over dinner last night, but alas, the build up towards the big moment got the better of me. However, today I woke up determined to do what needed to be done. \n\nSo, there I was, on one knee next to my girlfriend's side of the bed, waiting for her to open her eyes and see me holding the ring. The moment I attempted to wake her up she groaned and rolled over, leaving me with nothing to look at but the back of her head. My heart was beating hard enough to hear. I leaned over my girlfriend and gently tapped her on the shoulder. Instead of waking up like a normal person, she *hissed* in her sleep like a fucking vampire before elbowing me in the face. I stumbled back and dropped the damn ring.\n\nMy girlfriend woke up during the commotion and the first thing she saw was me bleeding from my nose. Not gonna lie, when she rushed over to comfort me I flinched. The hissing thing she did scared the shit out of me. After all the drama died down, I managed to recover the ring without her noticing. Speaking of recover, my nose still hurts. \n\nTonight I'll try again. This time I'll make sure to propose while my girlfriend is wide awake and still human.\n\n\n**TL:DR Attempted to surprise my girlfriend with a proposal in bed, but little did I know getting her to wake up required blood.**\n\n*Edit: I'm just gonna leave an update here for all the comments requesting an update. She said yes! My girlfriend is now officially my fiance\u00e9. Not that anyone really cares about this part, but my nose also stopped hurting.*",

            "My husband wins at proposals I think. He always knew I wanted a spectacle of sorts, something big for the engagement. The weeks leading up, I had a sneaking suspicion he was going to pop the question at a show we were going to right after his 30th birthday. Boy, was I wrong. Rewind a couple months to April and his mom asking if I would help throw a surprise 30th for my husband. His birthday is in July so I wasn't totally prepared for what she was planning 3 months out but of course I said yes. Many weeks of coming up with excuses why I'm late from work or mysterious packages showing up that he couldn't look in, me actually succeeding at not spilling the beans on the surprise and finally, the day had come! I was already super excited because I had given him a PS4 and some games as a gift and we were headed to his parents for the surprise party. All of our closest friends and family were in attendance and I just couldn't wait to see his face, knowing I'd pulled off this awesome surprise! As we rounded the corner to the courtyard and everyone is shouting surprise, he turns to me and drops to one knee and bam! Hit me with the ring and the proposal. No one at the party knew what was happening and it was a spectacular moment. Turns out, way back before my MIL ever asked me to throw a surprise party, my husband walked the garden with her, GoT style, and planned this elaborate ruse! I unknowingly planned and threw my own engagement party and he didn't have to do a thing!",

            " I had my wife\u2019s engagement ring for a couple days, arguing with my self about timing, being romantic, etc. Plans and ideas formed and discarded in an almost continuous loop as I tried to figure out a way to make this proposal special, romantic and memorable. I was trying my damndest to keep my wife (gf at the time) from discovering said ring, so I stashed it in a rarely used table at the back door. One day she decides to clean the house while I\u2019m outside sawing firewood, comes outside and I see her shaking out the rugs from the back door.\n  Fucking PANIC. Tell her I have to grab my chain file, snag the ring whilst rummaging, shove it in my pants pocket and make my escape undetected. \nFast forward a couple hours. I have been sawing firewood for the better part of the afternoon at this point, I\u2019m covered in sawdust and sweat. Decide to call it a day and head back to the house. Get in the front door and realize that the whole house is clean, while I look and smell like beaver shit liberally fumigated with 2 stroke mixed gas. I decide to strip at the front door so as not to spread the shavings all over the newly cleaned house. My wife is casually chatting to me from the kitchen (direct view to the front door) as I manfully strip buck naked and proceed to throw my clothes onto the floor. Just as the clothes leave my hand I see the lump in my pocket.\nFucking THUD. my wife looks down at my pants on the floor. \n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\nExcuses fly through my mind, the chain file? A rock? What will she believe? My panic and fear must have been clear on my face because she is suddenly concerned! She reaches for my clothes and I, still mumbling half formed excuses, swat her hand away and grab the clothes. \nBrilliant move, smooth as sandpaper taco ol boy. Now she\u2019s on the verge of tears, taken completely by surprise at my odd possessiveness over a bunch of dirty clothes.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in there Taco? Are you smoking again? Honey I won\u2019t be mad you can tell me..\u201d at this point she is quite upset and little tears are in the corners of her eyes and she just looks so worried, she\u2019s almost crying and I... I dig the ring out of my pocket, get down on one knee and hold the now opened ring box towards her wordlessly. So that\u2019s how I proposed, naked, dirty, with my balls hanging out in the stiff breeze.",

She says yes and I realized I can use this!  I'll be bringing her something so I can instead give her the penny.  But then I thought better of it and decided I should really bring her the cookie too, why take a chance.\n\nSo I come upstairs and on bended knee and hold the cookie and penny out to her.  She grabs the penny, doesn't even look at it and sets it on the shelf and starts eating the cookie.  I'm kneeling there in shock and tell her maybe she should look at the penny more.  She thought I had just found a squished penny she'd left downstairs.",

            "I proposed a year ago today. We drove up to Baltimore and got a room at the Kimpton Monaco, then went to catch Hamilton. After that, we got dressed up and went to The Rusty Scupper (super nice seafood place) and got fantastic food and a bottle of nice wine. Then we walked the inner harbor back, but stopped to take in the sights. The ring was in my pocket. A random guy walked up and offered to recite street poetry to us. Couldn't understand half of what he said, and then it was apparent that my gf was drunk and had sore feet. I got cold feet and we turned in.\n\nThe next day, we have some time before we need to get the car out of the garage, so we try to grab brunch from some big brunch spot just northeast of the harbor (can't remember the name). The place was PACKED. We moved on to another spot nearby, but it was $40 per person. She was getting hangry, so we settled on IHOP. There was a 20ish minute wait, so not terrible. I got a burger and she got pancakes. My burger was delicious until I bit into one of those bread tag things that was in my burger. I immediately lost my appetite, got the bill comped, and got outta there. We walked the harbor again, while she finished her pancakes by hand. Then I made sure she rinsed her hands off in a water fountain. We walked to a beautiful spot just a few feet from the water, and I got down on one knee in my khaki shorts and my Superman t-shirt. She burst into the happiest tears you can imagine and said yes about a hundred times.\n\nI missed my perfect moment, but made an unexpected moment just as perfect. You've got this.",

Immediately prior I'd been reading him an excerpt from a bio of Queen Elizabeth I about how she didn't want to marry and get roped into foreign wars.  When I saw him get down on one knee I kept asking if he was sick and trying to help him stand. After things clicked and I said yes, well, it was a regular Tuesday night and I had dinner dishes to do.  He popped in \"Platoon\" for us to watch when those were done. This was so \"us\" that even though the engagement never became a marriage, I still look at it as the best proposal he could have made for me.

Bent down on one knee and waited for her to turn around - she was in her underwear and I popped the question... felt like forever - we'd moved an entire house worth of stuff that day and we were exhausted, so time kind of went weird, but she swears it was an instant 'yes'...  \nBeen together 17 years, 15 years married now. She likes to tell people that she couldn't escape being almost naked so she said yes, and I like to joke it took her hours to answer.",

            "I proposed during one of my hobbies.  I have a Side by Side (polaris RZR) and I go off roading.  Last march I was going on a trip for a day to a place with some awesome views and my girlfriend wanted to tag along.  So I grabbed the ring and hid it and we went.\n\nWe were riding with friends for most the day, then we eventually split up because my girlfriend was cold and wanted to go warm up in the truck.\n\nWe were up on this mountain passing a look out with a great view, and I said I had to pee, and she's like, yeah me too.  So we got out.  We relieved ourselves etc.\n\nThen we were appreciating the view.\n\nSo I proposed after that.  I didn't get on one knee or anything either.  I was just holding her, we were looking out at the view, and I just casually pulled it out of my pocket and was like \"hey, what do you say we get married?\" and she started dancing around like a little school kid on a snow day.\n\nWhew had a three hour trip home in the truck and she was calling her dad, mom, family, etc like \"Omg, I'm engaged\".  I had just talked to her dad the day before to ask him lol.\n\nI knew where we were going was beautiful, and I wanted to propose doing something I love, sharing my hobby with her, because that's how I am.  I'm all about sharing my life with her, I wanted her to experience that, and I couldn't think of a better place to propose.\n\nShe's not the type that likes lots of attention, she didn't want anyone to see me propose.  She was fine with me not getting on one knee either.  I'm not a very traditional guy, I don't like tradition for the sake of tradition, and I didn't like the expectation of getting on one knee to propose, so I did it my way.  Even her engagement ring was uncommon.  It's a 1.5 Karat Moissanite, and she LOVES it.  It's really shiny, and beautiful, and was a fraction the cost of a diamond the same size.",

            "Now in all fairness I have previous experience with bad proposals.  One of which involved blood, injury or him being one one knee. \n\n\nSat side by side & was told he'd asked my dad the night before, as I pointed out my mum was acting weird, wanted to know if I had any news....Tells me of asking my dad & then suggested we tell my mum the good news...He skipped asking me....that's bad.\n\nNext different boyfriend,  been together over 4 years, so literally all our family was asking & way too many of our friends. So I said we needed to discuss what to tell them, because conflicting answers was making it worse. He thought that meant ring shopping & that he didn't have to ask me or my dad...  cause asking my dad was the problem? No, no idea.\n\nMy husband, we discussed it, I knew my dad said \"it's up to Kitty\" we even discussed venues & dates. I knew he ordered the ring, I even knew the location of the ring box. He planned & saved for a romantic meal on my birthday. His mother didn't approve & told him how upset she'd be as although it was planned for months I was 3 weeks pregnant...early tests are a thing. So it was delayed a few weeks & involved the word \"Catch!\" Yep he three the ring box across the room at me. Not the best,  women ask about how he proposed, surprisingly a lot of men too. While not romantic,  people will & in fact are enjoying the pre-proposal proposal with a vampire twist. \n\nAnyway I shared this as the how doesn't matter, not really, I mean I'm still gonna tease hubby his & joke that my super power prevents men getting down on one knee.. I mean seriously! 3 of them!! But my moment I knew, our moment we knew was a lot sooner than the actual ring making it official. \n\nSo as you are struggling with words, & getting on one knee may currently make you nervous. Write the words on a slip of paper, then place it in the ring box, with the ring & give her the box.  Trust me it works better than the movie proposals do, seriously.\n\nGood luck & congratulations...now go propose, then update us...",

We got into a fight on the 4th of july over him being a pansy and not wanting to sit on the grass.... Seriously a stupid ass fight, which led me to yell at him to \"man up\" and propose. He walked to his car and pulled the ring from his trunk and proposed to me, I of course was so freaking happy and now engaged. By the time our fight and engagement happened it was now the 5th of July and I ran inside waking up all my family. That was in 2007, we are still very happily together and married and have our second kid coming in the next few weeks.

(Yes there's a big age difference and no it doesn't bother us.) Not that you have to be young to enjoy a big elaborate proposal. I guess what I meant was, we were both experienced with relationships so instead of him surprising me, we just started talking about where we wanted our relationship to go and we both agreed we wanted to be married. \n\nActually no, we didn't agree at first. He fell in love with me before I became romantically interested in him. I just wanted to be friends and we hung out a lot, so one day in the car he looked at me and said, \"I'm gonna marry you one day.\" I just laughed, but inside I felt bad for him because even though he was a really great guy, I just wasn't into him. Well he must have known something that I didn't LOL because here we are, married for 8 years."

This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It's been bothering me enough that I've been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They're harmless, and most of the time I don't even notice, BUT every once in a while...I'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It's not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I wasn't asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted \"HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!\"  She didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting \"Jesus Christ!\".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took me a long time to calm her down, and I don't think that's something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "I feel for you.  When my wife and I were dating I told her over the phone I was going to lay down one evening because I had a horrible headache.  I didn't think I was tired but apparently I went into the deepest sleep I had ever been in my entire life.  Fast forward a few hours, she's trying to call me, I'm not answering the phone, and she starts to worry.  She lived with her sister and BIL at the time.  BIL starts telling her that this is how his mom died.  Took a nap and never woke up (some undiagnosed heart problem).  They both come over to check on me but I don't hear them banging on the door.  She has a key but I dead bolted the door and there was no key for that.  They get the landlord involved but she doesn't have a key, either.  BIL starts to talk about how he bets I'm cheating and too afraid to answer the door.  They are even banging on the wall in the vacant apartment that shares a wall with my bedroom, right behind my bed.  Eventually I wake up, open the front door.  Everyone is standing there.  Future wife is crying.  She's so pissed at me for not answering and I have no idea what is going on.  She was pretty certain I was dead.  I think she overreacted.  FWIW, falling into a deep sleep like that is not me at all.",
            "I hate to tell you, but it will be a long time before she\u2019s over this. I woke up one night to a loud crash in the bathroom, ran in to find my SO sprawled on the floor limp with her eyes open and lifeless. I also yelled and threw myself to the ground to grab her. Luckily she had only fainted and came to a few seconds later, but there was a few seconds I thought I was holding my dead SO in my arms. That image was burned into my mind for over a year before we finally moved out of that apartment. I couldn\u2019t walk into that bathroom without seeing her lifeless body every time. Haunted me. ",

            "A few years ago, my wife had surgery on a couple nerves in her leg. Obviously, slicing up nerves is a painful procedure, so she stayed pretty medicated for the two days or so she was in the hospital and was still well doped up when we got home. We got back from the hospital, got her situated in her favorite recliner, then I went out to fill her prescriptions.\n\nWhen I got home, I walk in the door, into the room, and see her in the recliner, eyes closed, head lolled to the side, blood running out of her mouth and down her chin and neck. Even in the second and a half it took to rush over to the chair, I'm thinking she must've bit her tongue and choked on the blood and passed out and oh god, it's been 10 years since I was certified in CPR am I going to remember?!?!\n\nI get to her, reach out and she immediately, but groggily starts moving. I start asking what happened, is she OK? She says she's fine, just dozed off, has no idea what I'm going on about. I tell her she's bleeding, there is blood running out of her mouth.\n\nShe says \"no I'm not\" and reaches up to her mouth to check - with the bag of Very Cherry Jelly Bellies she had been munching on still in her hand. She hadn't been bleeding, just drooling red-stained saliva. Ten years later and she still thinks it's the funniest damn thing that's ever happened (once I got over the shock, I couldn't help but agree).",

The poor girl thought i was right behind her in bed so she shot up like she took 220v and let out the most blood curdling scream I'd ever heard. Took a minute to calm her and myself down, and we talked about how that was the 'realest' fear she'd ever felt. ",

            "I kinda had a similar experience. Very early on in the relationship, my LDR boyfriend and I decided to take a bath together. Nothing sexual, we'd been dating for a few weeks and hadn't even popped the L word. We just wanted to take a bath together while on the phone, no FaceTime, just comfy romantic time. \n\nWell, my phone was almost dead so it was charging while it rested on the bath rim. He knew this of course and when I accidentally dropped it into the bathtub he was mortified. The way he described it was that there was an awful loud static noise right after he heard me say \"SHIT\" and a crash. He immediately thought the worst and ended his bath early when the call dropped.\n\nI on the other hand rushed out of the tub to shove my phone in some rice. I went to empty the water and clean up before I went onto my computer and rejoined the call (discord). I had a shit ton of messages and apparently he sent me a shit ton of texts too. He was googling whether or not a plugged in phone could kill you and was hesitating to message my friends and family to check on me. My boyfriend said he'd been pacing around in his towel wondering what to do.\n\nI just laughed and apologized while he sat there relieved and annoyed. He makes jokes now about finally scoring a girlfriend only for me to die awfully somehow. That memory in combination with me being an absolute klutz doesn't help his nerves at all when I'm flying or doing anything by myself tbh. Haha.",

We all liked to have a few beers at night, who doesn't, right? Well, one of the guys I worked with tended to drink too much. So my friend and I are sitting outside of the employee dorms on some rock slab steps chatting at like 1 AM. Drunk guy comes out of dorm and decides he can slide down the railing. He's so drunk he doesn't realize that isn't possible due to a huge post at the bottom of the rail. So he slides down the railing, hits the post going pretty fast, flies over the post and practically lands on top of the girl I was talking to... and I literally watched his head bounce, not joking, actually bounce off the step beside her. After we collected ourselves in a second or two, I look over at the guy and he is out cold. I was a lifeguard back in the day, a manager at the hotel, and knew basic first aid. I lifted his head up to try and wake him up and there was a pool of blood under his head. I honest to god thought I was holding a dead man in my arms. His eyes were rolled back in his head and he was just completely limp. I grab a t-shirt and stuff it on the back of his head applying pressure and yelled at someone to go call the park rangers. The guy comes to thankfully. He tries to tell me he's fine and it's not a big deal. He is shitfaced. Everyone hears him talking and tries to convince me he's fine. It's a fucking head wound and there's a puddle of his blood right there on the steps people. Security shows up and takes over. I warn them that with a head wound they shouldn't take the bandage/pressure off the wound until a trained paramedic/ranger shows up. I pass off holding the bandage on drunk idiot's head to security. After a minute they think he's fine too. I literally just walked away at that point. Turns out the asshole was completely fine, but I literally thought for what seems like an eternity that he was dead. In reality it was probably only 10-15 seconds, I honestly don't know. But it shook me up hard.\n\nThe real kicker of the story? The dude didn't remember any of it the next day. He was wearing a stocking hat and I walked up to him and asked how his head was doing. He told me it was fine and that someone had freaked out last night and called the rangers about a little scratch. Fuck that dude.\n\nThinking someone's dead or died near you is serious mental shit. I can't imagine if it had actually been someone I truly loved and cared about. I honestly hope your wife is ok and wish you guys all the best. That sucks.",

        "selftext": "\nSo quite recently I\u2019ve been listening to the song \u201cScatman\u201d, which for the uninitiated is a dope song of a dude scatting which kinda goes like \u201cscatdobiddlybiddlygiddlydiddlybiddlydiddly...\u201d  and then he says \u201cI\u2019m the Scatman!\u201d.\n\nSo I couldn\u2019t get this song out of my head for the past couple days and I was always queuing it up on Spotify. \n\nLong story short a girl I\u2019ve been dating came over last night and my brain didn\u2019t override my stupidity when I decided to add Scatman to my sexytime playlist. \n\nWhen she came over it was pretty much \u2018prepare for battlestations\u2019 from the first minute, so I put the sexytime playlist on shuffle. It started off well with some song from the Mezzanine album, and then one I can\u2019t remember and then a jazzy one. By this point I was just beginning to go down on her. \n\nThis is where I fucked up. The Scatman song came up next after the relaxing jazz and it was so fucking jarring. \n\nI guess a normal person would\u2019ve stopped and skipped the song. I really regret not doing that now. \n\nInstead of that, without skipping a fucking beat, I started to use my tongue and went down on her at the same exact pace as the dude in the song was scatting. It was so fast that I had to concentrate hard to get the timing right. I know it probably was bad technique, but I started and I had to commit.  \nIt was probably 9 seconds of doing that before I stopped and came up. I looked into her eyes and perfectly in time with the song I said \u201cI\u2019m the Scatman\u201d.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what expression I expected to see on her, my brain clearly short circuited for me to do that in the first place. What I didn\u2019t expect was the look of pure disgust.  \n\nThat moment went in pure slow motion for me. My brain pretty much exploded and was like \u201cah fuck I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve done this\u201d \n\nI saw no means of recovery so I got up and paused the song. And she said \u201ccan we just hang for a bit instead\u201d  and I agreed. We ended up watching an episode of Friends, both of us refusing to acknowledge what just happened. Then she said she had to go back to her place.\n\nWe\u2019ve only been dating for 3 weeks and I\u2019m pretty sure I might\u2019ve totally fucked this up. At least I have a funny story out of it, though I\u2019d much prefer having a girlfriend.\n\nTldr: Went down on a girl to the Scatman song and now she might turn into a ghost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Since people have been asking. Nothings really has happened after I texted her \u201chow\u2019s it goin\u201d the next day. Sorry to not have a juicy follow up story. Hopefully we don\u2019t get into the same classes next semester at uni.\n\nIf we somehow get back together, I\u2019ll make sure not to remove Scatman from my playlist.\n\nI\u2019m somewhat disturbed by the comments that theorised that she thought I was sexually attracted to fecal matter. I\u2019ll try not to believe it, but looking back on her reaction it does make a lot of sense.",

We decided to meet for a date on Friday. I have IBS and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. I was also very tired.\n\nThe FU: So I'm at this guy's house and I've made us a very nice Mac n Cheese. There was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. We're then snuggling on the sofa and I feel a big fart brewing. I'm hoping I can just absorb it back in to my body if I hold on to it long enough. \n\nWe start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. I choose a 'relaxing' oil. I'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. He starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. I'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.\n\nI then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart I have ever expelled. The fart I was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. It was hella loud and it was hella long. And it was right on his balls. It was so forceful, they vibrated.\n\nHis response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'At least you didn't shit yourself'.\n\nTLDR: Farted on a first date's balls.\n\nEdit: For anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. You can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!",

After we finished, I started getting undressed to shower. For some reason, I completely forgot she was in my room and so when I felt a fart brewing, I kicked my leg up to the ceiling and just ripped one straight from my bear ass. It was about a 5 second squeal of a trumpet and finished like a tuba, and it stunk too which didn\u2019t help. I had looked up afterwards to see her widened eyes staring into mine and we both just lost it laughing. I told her I was holding it in while we were having sex and I just had to let it out. \n\nNow I\u2019ve always been a gassy kid ever since I can remember. Chronic flatulence is a real thing people.

Here are some key things that have helped me.\n\n- Tuzen probiotic, lots of vitamin D. There's quite a few other vitamins that can help but those 2 I've found most beneficial\n\n- Cannabis can stop an attack right away. Try and get mostly cbd since thc can create anxiety which can be bad for IBS. Right now I'm using a 10% thc / 10% cbd strain called CBD blue dream which works great. A high CBD strain will work better though imo. Try and get oil since itll help more medicinally and cure the gut if you're able to get unlimited amounts, like growing your own.\n\n- Sourdough bread is amazing and yes, you can have gluten. The problem isnt necessarily gluten, it's the way bread is processed and needs time to ferment. I eat sourdough bread and sourdough bagels everyday with little to no issues.\n\n- Exercise and sleep are both really important. Get that blood pumping in the gut and also avoid cellphones or video games before bed to not over stimulate so you can rest and sleep better through the night.\n\n- Fodmaps seem to work sometimes but dont follow it \"religiously\" since everyone's gut reacts differently. Keeping a food journal can help!\n\nHopefully this info helps you or others in need. The gut and mind are connected so if your gut is shit it will test your sanity on a daily.

        "selftext": "I admit I posted a version of this on the relationship subreddit the other day, but they closed it with no explanation, I assume because they just decided it was fake. I can see how they might think that, but this is a true thing that happened and is happening, and now there is more to it because I actually got broken up with over it. \n\nWith all that is going on, we had stocked up on supplies, including some canned goods. I ordered a few weeks ago 30 cans of beans. 10 are black beans, 10 are kidney beans, and 10 are pink beans. Also, I ordered 15 cans of chickpeas. I thought this is a reasonable amount of beans and chickpeas to have every now and then and would last for quite some time. \n\nHowever earlier this week I opened the cabinet because I wanted to make a vegetarian chili using two cans of beans, but all of the beans were gone. What the hell? \n\nI asked my girlfriend and she told me she buried all of the beans in the woods. \n\nAt first I thought she was joking, but she explained, no, she had buried the beans in the woods. WTF? \n\nI asked her to explain and she told me she was afraid that \"if things get bad\" we might have to worry about \"looters or whatever\" and that the beans would be in danger of being stolen. I said I thought this was completely ridiculous and unlikely. She became angry at me and said she \"is protecting our beans.\" \n\nAccording to her logic, the beans are safely buried in the woods behind our apartment complex, and if we ever need some beans she will go to the \"stash\" and dig up a can or two, but would prefer if we save them all for \"if things get worse\". \n\nI said why only bury the beans, why not bury our more valuable items? She said the canned food was most valuable for long-term means, and that since we get fresh food in our online grocery deliveries, it would make sense to continue to stockpile beans. She intends to go bury more beans in the woods every week. \n\nThis was too insane for me and I got very upset. I demanded to know where the beans were buried, and she refused to tell me. She said if I knew she was afraid I'd dig them up, I said damn right I would. She said \"I will never jeopardize the beans.\" \n\nThe following day I tried to put my foot down, and I'm not usually a foot downer but there are rare issues where compromise is out of the question, and I foolishly decided this was one of those issues. I demanded to know where the beans were buried and I told her if she was going to bury beans I paid for in the woods that I would move out. We fought about it and I kept insisting. \n\nIn hindsight I should have just let it go and created my own hidden stash of beans in the apartment, and given her time to maybe cool down about this bean burying scenario, but I blew it all out of proportion. Yeah it's weird to bury beans in the woods but why did I have to press it? What's the harm at the end of the day? In the grand scheme of things? But I kept demanding her to take me to the beans, or at least draw a map or something, and finally she BROKE UP WITH ME. Over the beans. I have lost the love of my life because I couldn't let the damn beans go. I am in disbelief. She moved out. Not only am I heartbroken but I am now paying full rent instead of 50% which is a huge financial issue for me. \n\nTL;DR - I kept demanding that my girlfriend show me where she buried the beans in the woods and she got so angry at me that she ended our relationship and moved out. My heart is shattered and my finances are jeopardized because of a bean hoard.",

A considers X to be communal property even though A bought them.  \n\nB decided to hide X.  \n\nA asks to know the location of X. \n\nB refuses.  \n\nA repeats his query and makes it known it is important to him. \n\nB refuses. \n\nHere my biggest red flag is that B should have at least revealed to A the location.  By refusing, B declares A has NO right whatsoever to the beans. \n\nNow substitute beans with children.  I\u2019m not saying kill and bury the children. I\u2019m talking about one parent deciding that the other parent should not have any custodial rights.  That\u2019s devastating. Yet it happens.

She stole them to give to a friend/family\n2. She got embarrassed about this 'hoarding' (seriously, 30 cans is overkill unless you're a family of 5+) and gave them away to a foodbank or friends and family.\n\nThus she couldn't bring the cans back or show them to you. Not loving you, and not trusting you, she doubled down and refused to tell you, because she didn't want to admit what she actually did.\n\n\nThat, or she actually did, which nevertheless comes back to - she doesn't love you, she doesn't trust you. I know you're hurt and blame yourself for 'not letting it go' and you're likely phrasing things here more gently than you actually behaved. However, stealing and hiding a bunch of food and saying that only they can be trusted with it is insane behavior and unacceptable from a partner/spouse.

        "selftext": "A few years ago my wife and I bought a house with a hot tub. We enjoyed it but after a while it developed significant issues and we found it hard to justify the expense of repairing it... we opted just to shut it down for a while. \n\nWell, COVID hit, and I figured that being in isolation with nothing much else to do is the best time to own a working hot tub. I tried to do the repair work myself, which took a lot of time and stress, and in the end I had to have a professional do it anyways. The process ended up costing almost $2000. But, with no vacations to budget for, we figured it was a good use of our money. \n\nAnd it was! We've been loving using the hot tub this winter. We regularly go out there for family time with our kids, who love being able to swim around a bit, and I regularly go out by myself at night to unwind. We have a beautiful park behind our yard that makes it an amazing spot to relax. Because of COVID I've been having long zoom calls with groups of friends, and realized I could do that from the comfort of my hot tub, which just amped up the enjoyment of both activities.\n\nConcurrent to all of this though, my wife and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have another baby. The giant FU is that we didn't think, at any point, of the fact that hot tubs kill sperm. Last night as we were discussing our failures in the bedroom, it finally occurred to us that the hot tub might be a problem. I was disappointed, thinking \u201cshoot I guess there will be a few days every month when I can't use it.\u201d\n\nNope. We looked it up and found out that after being boiled, it takes sperm three months to \"respawn\" or whatever they have to do. \n\nSo until I produce a winner, I am no longer allowed in my own hot tub that I slaved (and splurged) so much to repair. It took us two years to get pregnant with our previous child. Hopefully this one comes sooner.\n\nTL;DR fixed my hot tub, boiled my future children\n\nEdit: lots of doubts about my semen facts... this is the source we\u2019re using: https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/health/facts-and-myths-male-fertility-tight-underwear-hot-tubs-marijuana-and-more\n\n2nd edit (I can see why people do these): we have been to fertility specialists, thank you.\n\nAlso, it looks like the hot tub factor is about a 50% impact on fertility rates, meaning **no this isn\u2019t reliable birth control!**",

        "selftext": "Edit: I am blown away by all the awards, and moreso by all the kind words and compliments about my writing. You guys have motivated me to start writing more. Thank you!\n\nDidn't happen today, but still a bizarre and embarrassing memory that sometimes wakes me up at night.\n\nImportant preface: I am \"drive the 1998 honda civic from the trailer park to Walmart to buy a $5 wolf t-shirt\" poor. \n\nA few years ago, I worked about 25 hours a week humping the grill at McDonald's in a frighteningly small town. When I wasn't on the clock, I was free to drink and mingle with the bottom of the social ladder of rural America. They were actually some of the nicest people I've ever met.\n\nThis was a self destructive period in my life. For entertainment, I'd pass the day drinking and crawling through Facebook for entertainment/drama. There isn't much more to do when you live in the trailer park in the middle of a cornfield in the Midwest. Especially when your weed guy is out of town.\n\nI ended up friend requesting a somewhat older girl who was, well, \"trashy hot.\" Like a trailer park Emma Watson with stress lines on her face. She seemed... open.\n\nWe exchanged pleasantries, which rapidly escalated to us flirting because we were both horny. We flirted for about 2 hours, which escalated to sexting. Through the haze of alcohol and horniness, I was certain that this was the most beautiful woman this side of the trailer park and I had scored big. We scrambled to make a time to meet up and \"chill.\" Trailer Emma says \"I'm ready for you now \ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\". Now THAT got my warrior to stand at attention.\n\nThere was one problem though: she lived 40 miles away, across the county line, and snow was in the forecast. My poor little beater car did not handle snow well. But my dick had been crying out for this woman for hours now. \n\nSo I said fuck it. Took a minute to freshen up in my dirty little bathroom and hopped in the car. Quarter of a tank. That should be enough.\n\nWhat followed was a long, windy drive through the dark, on ugly back roads. My dick ached from being hard for so long. Visions of passionately porking this woman flashed through my mind.\n\nIt took a while to find her house-- er, trailer. It was in a small trailer park basically in the middle of nowhere, way in the back. I had to crawl through the rows of dirty single wides, headlights on high, feeling intrusive and out of place. It seemed that the farther I creeped, the more run down the trailers became. By the time I got to the back, I was passing piles of siding and glass.\n\nI finally get to her trailer. It's... Not great. But my dickbrain is fixated on the night of passion that surely lays before me.\n\nTrailer Emma answers the door. She... Used a much nicer picture on Facebook. Even enrapt in a state of almost spiritual horniness, I could tell she had, well, aged. When she smiled, I noticed several of her teeth were black. My stomach clenched a little. I do NOT do well with bad teeth. \n\nBut the show must go on.\n\nShe took me in and briefly pointed out her kids. There were three small, dirty looking children huddled around an old TV. I remember her mentioning being a mom, but 3 kids was a little much... Plus they didn't look cared for. Uh oh.\n\nBy this point, a small part of me had already decided that an entire night of love making was off the menu, that I would bail when the fireworks were over. But not before some action. I still thought this girl was hot as long as she kept her mouth closed.\n\nShe pulled me into her bedroom-- which had an entire litter of kittens staring at me in the corner-- and started making out with me. Her kisses were way too sloppy and wet. This whole experience was going downhill pretty fast.\n\nMy spirit was torn in two-- part of me wanted to bail. The dirtiness, her physical appearance, the creepy trailerpark, the goddamn kittens watching me-- but the other part of me wanted to rip this woman's clothes off and fuck her till her pussy retired and moved to an assisted living facility.\n\nMy little head won.\n\nI pushed her against the wall and started kissing her neck. I did my best to avoid her nasty mouth, though she kept trying to push it into my face. Within moments she was naked on the bed, legs spread, waiting for my stiff magic wand. This is what I had wanted, what I had been waiting for, a night of passionate love making with a questionable but moderately attractive Facebook mom, so I thrust my loins forth... and came immediately with a shudder and a groan.\n\n\"You came *now?* Trailer Emma said in a disappointed voice that still haunts my dreams. I guess being aroused for four hours can often result in sperm school being let out early.\n\nNow, I'm just a man. This has happened before. Normally I'd take a few minutes to recharge my batteries and get back to work.\n\nWhich is what I would have done... Had I not been experiencing the singularly WORST episode of post nut clarity/regret that I ever had in my entire life. Everything hit me at once. Being far from home, at night, in a strange trailerpark. Her dirty, sad looking kids in the other room.  Her meth mouth. Her emaciated frame clinging to a pair of obviously fake boobs. \n\nIt was like the existential dread/paranoia from weed, except it came out of my dick.\n\nThen, I noticed the window. Remember how I said snow was in the forecast? Well, there it was! Fluttering past the outside light like a ghostly interpretive dance of \"your ass ain't going home.\"\n\nI immediately hopped up and tried to emit some kind of plausible excuse for leaving. I don't even remember what I said. I do remember her sitting on the bed and giving me a blank stare as I fumbled over words. I felt like the dumbest man in the world. I just wanted to disappear.\n\nI quickly threw my clothes on and stumbled out the door without a good-bye. I start my beater car and try to reverse. But I don't move. My bald tires spin in the mix of slush and mud. I start to panic. I gently depress the accelerator as visions of spending the night with this weird lady and her kids dance in my head. By a miracle of God, the car lurches backwards. I laugh hysterically with relief.\n\nThe drive home was long, slow, and dangerous. The snow hurtled past my windshield in silence, my chest heavy with embarrassment and regret. What in the blue fuck was I thinking?? Driving 40 miles in the snow to fuck a stranger in a strange place?? I couldn't wait to get home and forget these awful memories in a haze of pot and PBR.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got home was log into Facebook to block my lover. Thankfully, she already had. Then I went to my room and got so, so drunk.\n\nEverything was better till I woke with a fever... Because I had chlamydia... Because I went in on a strange woman bareback. I had to call my gram to pick me up in her nicer vehicle and take me to the clinic an hour away. She grilled me the whole time about why I was going and I had to lie and say I had a sore throat.\n\nThe antibiotics they gave me ended up making me incredibly sick so I had to go to the clinic a few days later for a big shot. I missed four days of work and almost didn't make rent.\n\nSo, I traded about three seconds of sexual enjoyment for an infected dick, a tiny paycheck, a pissed off gram, and a lifetime of embarrassing memories.\n\nI *did* talk to a social worker at the clinic about Trailer Emma and my concerns about her kids. Not sure what happened after that, but she said she'd look into it...\n\nMy life is a little less self destructive these days. I moved to a better town, got a better job, and settled down with a girl. But I will never forget my misadventure with that woman. The memory of revving the engine and not moving is particularly haunting. I may have actually been traumatized a little...\n\nTLDR Drove 40 miles on shitty roads to bang a strange woman, got bad lost but regret and almost got stuck in the driveway, caught an STD and had to miss a lot of work, then I almost missed rent.\n\nAll because I couldn't just rub one out.\n\nEdit 2: important clarifications-- yes, not using a condom was incredibly dumb, both for me and for my partner. No, she did not get pregnant with my child. It's pretty easy to check up on people in low population areas. Trailer Emma is fine.",

One night we were all at the library doing an assignment and he sat down next to me on the steps outside afterward.  He started telling me about his life, but I figured he was probably winding up to ask me out.  He explained he'd gone into the military before college and was stationed in southeast Asia.  Said when you're stationed there they issue the guys huge boxes of condoms as part of their provisions, because the guys get so much play, and the area has a reputation.  At that point my brain just said, \"oh hell no\".  Don't think I even heard the rest of the conversation.  He couldn't have made me less interested in him if he'd lit himself on fire right there.  His face looked confused when I abruptly stood up and said \"Better head back to the dorm\" right in the middle of some story he was telling me.\n\nLater when he was dating my friend and would show up on our floor on Saturday night, all the girls would be walking around in towels trying to get ready to go out.  He started stammering awkwardly when he saw me in a towel once and and his girlfriend said to me in a laughing voice, \"thanks for rejecting him, now I got him\".  He was red as a beet, lol.\n\nPunchline was: he married my friend.",

I got there and her soon-to-be ex-husband's best friend was there and cock blocked me. I had to ride back home the same way , an utter failure.\n\nI was at a bar one night and some girl grabbed my cock at the pool table behind her boyfriend's back. She said let's get out of here. We snuck out the back way when he wasn't looking, ran down the railroad tracks behind the bar, I called the cab and got to my house. before we even got out of the cab, she was crying about how she couldn't do this to her boyfriend.

Finally, when the paramedics were about to grab me, knowing a I couldn't afford the monetary devastation of an ER visit, I sat up and yelled, \"IT WAS AN ORGASM I'M FINE.\"\n\nI'm never going to that gym again.\n\nBut I am gonna see where these Kegels take me.\n\nTL;DR - Did too many Kegels, had a mega-orgasm at the gym, concerned people thought I was dying.\n\n**Edit:** Holy hot hell.

We set a reminder. \u201cDavid it\u2019s time to bonk Fiona\u201d. It seemed bonk didn\u2019t trigger Alexa\u2019s censorship. \n\nSo fast forward ten days.  We had totally forgot this and last night in the middle of a dinner party with several friends we get the reminder. \u201cDavid reminder. It\u2019s time to bonk Fiona\u201d as you can imagine confusion reined and after a pause in the dinner party conversation questions were asked and our friends joined in on the good humour as we are all similar ages. Pro tip. Everyone gets old, things dint work as well as they once did, but please try and keep your sense of humour.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks everyone some of these comments are hilarious. I played Scotty doesn\u2019t know to Fiona (which I had never heard before) and it\u2019s now her favourite song.

During a dinner party Alexa announced \u201cDavid remember to bonk Fiona\u201d We had forgotten that we set up a reminder 10 days earlier (while drinking a few wines) to remind us that enough time had passed since my wife started her new treatment to sort her soreness during intercourse.

            "I have a similar one. When I first got an Alexa I  made a bunch of dumbass routines just to play around and figure it out. I\u2019m a lawyer so as a dumb joke I made a routine that when I asked \u201cwho\u2019s the best lawyer in [my_town]\u201d Alexa would say my name.  She didn\u2019t stop there, though. Rather, she\u2019d go on a rant about a local lawyer I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t remember everything she said, but I do remember her calling him \u201cthat baby dick mother fucker.\u201d Up until somewhat recently, if you put an apostrophe in the middle of a curse word it\u2019d trick the content filter and she\u2019d still say the word. So, if you typed, \u201cfu\u2019ck\u201d she\u2019d say the word with no noticeable pronunciation difference. \n\nWhen you make a routine you can designate where the response happens if you have more than one Alexa. It can respond to the Alexa your talking to, or it can always respond to some other specific Alexa you designate. Most of the time, routines default to responding on the device you\u2019re talking to, but somehow this particular routine got set to always respond from the kitchen echo. I\u2019m guessing i probably changed the setting when screwing around to see how routines work. Anyway, no matter which Alexa I asked, she\u2019d respond always in the kitchen. I made the routine, tried it once, had a chuckle, then forgot about it. \n\nA few weeks later we\u2019re hosting thanksgiving at our new place. We\u2019d just eaten and everyone is just lazing around, many of whom are still seated around the table chatting, mainly the old folks like our grandparents.  I was in the living room with my brother in law and our Alexa\u2019s came up for some reason. We ended up asking her ignorant shit, as one will, which resulted in me showing some of the funny ones I\u2019d made. In doing so, I asked \u201cwho\u2019s the best lawyer in [my_town].\u201d  But, nothing happened.  I waited a few second and thought maybe she didn\u2019t register my voice correctly so I asked her again. About this time, my wife comes darting into the living room asking what the fuck I\u2019m doing. Apparently the old folks were just chilling in the kitchen when the Alexa started going on about some baby dick mother fucker.  When it finished, one had asked \u201cwhat was that?\u201d  On cue, Alexa started all over again from me having asked a second time, confused because she wasnt responding. The good news is that they just went back to talking and no one ever said a thing. I don\u2019t know if they were too old to hear, forgot, or didn\u2019t care.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Made a custom Alexa routine that told me and my wife\u2019s grandparents that a local lawyer is a \u201cbaby dick mother fucker\u201d among other things.

I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...\n\nThis is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. \n\nI now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.\n\nI know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. \n\nI know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.\n\nI know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife\u2019s room.\n\nIn reading through the comments he\u2019s made to others, I\u2019ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.\n\nOverall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.\n\nTL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit.

Throwaway as they use Reddit.\n\nMy best friend (m) is married to a photographer, she is actually quite well respected locally and has bad exhibitions... just not quite like this. \n\nThey have a young son who I went round to babysit for while they had a well earned break. My best friend being the loving but incompetent idiot he is, bought her an expensive Polaroid camera which is markedly worse than anything his wife owns. They've given it to their son who has shown no interest whatsoever. \n\nSo I'm pissing around with him, watching cartoons and spot the camera among his things. My friend and I have a childish sense of humour so I take the camera and take a Polaroid of my junk. It turns out horribly blurry, dark and you cant work out what it is. I leave it on my mates desk on his keyboard and forget about it, hoping when he sees it he will get a laugh when he works out what it is. \n\nBabysitting goes fine, I leave. \n\nI went round to visit today and immediately saw the polaroid, framed, on their kitchen wall. I absolutely crack up and ask why it's there. His wife replies that \"It's *childs* first photo, he took it and left it on Daddy's desk for him\". She was so proud that her son had used the camera, taken a photo and gave it to his dad that she framed and hung it. \n\nI haven't got the courage to break it to them that it's not their childs first photo taken, it's my dick.. and they framed it. \n\nTL;DR: Took a photo of my junk on a childs Polaroid camera and left it around as a joke for my best friend.

I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. \n\nI met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. \n\nWhen I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny.\n\nWell let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. \n\nSo first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked \"This looks very interesting. What is this?\" \n\nThey stared at me and the mother said \"It's a baked potato.\"  And I was saying \"Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?\" \n\nAnd she was like \"A potato.\" \n\nAnd I was like \"A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good.\" \n\nAnd then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. \n\nThey asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. \n\nThis went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my \"fucked up antics\", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was.\n\nWell let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like \"Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it.\"  And I said \"Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you.\" \n\nWell let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said \"Taste's very strange!\" \n\nThat is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying \"What are you doing?\" and my girlfriend went to some other room. \n\nFinally the father said I should \"Get the fuck out of his house\" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. \n\nNow in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. \n\nI wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway. ",

        "selftext": "This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of \u201cnot the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices\u201d and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. \n\nFast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don\u2019t really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.\n\nThe first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It\u2019s not good. For six years, I\u2019d still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.\n\nSo I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, \u201chey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it\u2019s just me.\u201d Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.\n\nI went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I\u2019d never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can\u2019t remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. \n\nAfter my breakup in 2016 and realizing I\u2019d been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.\n\nAnd so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like \u201choly fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?\" and \u201cWhat about this position?\u201d \u201cOUCH!\u201d \u201cOh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see.\u201d We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. \n\nIf this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven\u2019t done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn\u2019t felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y\u2019all are when you start out, after two hours, it\u2019s gonna wear off. We both felt like we\u2019d attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. \n\nWell, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it\u2019s about 6am. I\u2019m wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she\u2019s only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.\n\nWell, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we\u2019re engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. \n\nTL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we\u2019re engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. We'll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I've changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn't pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the \"oil business\" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...\n\nEDIT2: I guess now I probably have to show this to my fianc\u00e9e to which she will reply, \"I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?\" I still love her.\n\nEDIT3: A few of y'all keep asking, \"why in TIFU?\" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk\n\nFINAL EDIT: For real y\u2019all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. I told her about this post when I got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when I read it to her. We spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching Labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift Drive-thru theater setup",

In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of \u201cnot the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices\u201d and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. Fast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. \n\nThat timeframe is weirdly specific, cute though\n\n> After a couple of one-off messages that don\u2019t really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. \n\nIts going great man you go this\n\n> Except for two problems.\n\noh nvm\n\n> The first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. \n\nHaha word\n\n> If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It\u2019s not good. For six years, I\u2019d still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. \n\nToo high, didn't understand\n\n> But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. \n\nnah thats standard bro\n\n> I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. \n\nnah you prob looked fine, you prob look like your dad and he managed to get laid dint he? So you got a good chance of being an attractive dude\n\n> At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old \n\nNaaaaah you just aint used to it but I'm shup cause I don't want to suck your dick too much\n\n> with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.\n\nAhahaha tickled me\n\n> So I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, \u201chey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it\u2019s just me.\u201d Luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.\n\nget it done man\n\n> I went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I\u2019d never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. \n\nI aint seen it either\n\n> We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. \n\nOooooh shit I know where this is going\n\n> For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. \n\nooooh damn\n\n> For the third movie (which I can\u2019t remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. \n\nSee I fucking told ya\n\n> And this is where the second problem comes in.\n\nStop ruining itt\n\n> After my breakup in 2016 and realizing I\u2019d been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.\n\nDamn, F\n\n> And so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. \n\nha\n\n> Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like \u201choly fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?\" and \u201cWhat about this position?\u201d \u201cOUCH!\u201d \u201cOh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can't see.\u201d We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea.\n\nFuck this is getting viceral\n\n> If this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven\u2019t done any cardio in your fucking life.\n\nYou should jog dude its ace\n\n> And jesus christ the sweat. \n\nA short jog\n\n> So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. \n\nHahaha dude\n\n> This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. \n\nugh that scene :')\n\n> At one point our chests become suction cupped together. \n\nLOL\n\n> I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn\u2019t felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. \n\nYou're a poet man\n\n> No matter how ready either of y\u2019all are when you start out, after two hours, it\u2019s gonna wear off. We both felt like we\u2019d attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick \n\n_play laugh track in head_\n\n> just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life.\n\nYeah I don't know who John Waters is\n\n> Well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. \n\nPlus side thats a shit loads of calories burnt\n\n> It's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke \n\nawkward\n\n\n**Ok this is way fucking longer than I realised so need a piss break**\n(cont....)",

        "selftext": "This happened a year ago, but I just remembered this horrific event and the poor victims that never fully recovered. I was set to go on an 10 hour road trip through the interior of British Columbia and with me were 2 of my cousins and my uncle. However, before our 6am start I decided the night before to wolf down these chocolate chip Fiber One granola bars that had something like 75% of your daily fiber intake. These things were crazy good and I ended up eating an entire 8 pack of them in one sitting. After that I went to sleep and woke up in the morning to a bloated stomach but felt fine otherwise. 45 minutes into our ride the cramps began. My stomach grew larger and larger and I ended up needing to remove my seatbelt, and undoing the zipper on my jeans to give it more space to expand. My cousin next to me couldn't believe what he was seeing, he said it was like the blueberry scene from Willy Wonka. I couldn't hold the gas in any longer and asked my uncle to pull over, which he did and I struggled to get out of my seat as every move was agony. I waddled to the back of the car and let her rip. A thunderous roar escaped me like an asshole racing his Harley Davidson around the block on a Sunday Morning. The gas hissed out of me as my stomach grumbled, shuffled and shuttered. I am not exagerrating when I tell you that this fart lasted AT LEAST 15 seconds. Little did I know that I had just broken the seal and I would proceed to experience uncontrollable and obnoxiously powerful farts that lasted 10-15 seconds on average, with only a brief period of relief between said farts. \n\nThe fact of the matter was that I was now experiencing major flatulence every 2 to 3 minutes, and we couldn't stop the car every few minutes to escape the smell, so we decided to roll all the windows down and allow me to let loose whenever I needed. However, we had no idea that this would become a much longer ordeal than we initially thought. Truth be told, I couldn't stop farting for nearly 7 hours, and each fart just HAD to be more epic than the last. By the time hour 2 rolled around, my anus was sore and aching, and my insides feeling like shards of glass were ripping through me. And the smell had become so overpowering that we had to stop at a gas station and buy as many air fresheners as we could. I took one of the air fresheners and sat on it in the hopes that each fart will be freshened up - instead it just smelt like rotten eggs and pine. My cousins and uncle resorted to using Vicks around their noses to stop the smell. The pain from constantly farting brought me to tears at one point and I realized how ridiculous it must look to see a grown man crying while farting non stop.\n\nAt hour 4 disaster struck. I stopped farting, but I was still swelling with gas. I knew I was plugged up and if I didn't do something soon the pain is going to become unbearable. We stopped at a Coffee Shop and I ran in to use the bathroom. I gingerly sat down on the toilet and gently pushed but the pain was too much. I resorted to pushing on my stomach to help things along and suddenly I felt this wave of pressure hit me that made my butt cheeks break into a cold sweat and start to tingle. Suddenly, and without warning, a rock hard turd rocketed out of me like a cannonball and plastered itself to the back of the toilet bowl, and with that this tidal wave of what could only be described as peanut butter oatmeal. I could feel the muscles in my abdomen squeezing my intestines so hard that it actually hurt. It was like when you are throwing up and you can feel your stomach violently squish itself to push everything out, but instead it was my butt that was throwing up. Once everything was pushed out it was topped off by the longest fart in my short, pathetic existence, one that I could never accurately give the length other than say well over 20 seconds, and that I could literally feel and see my stomach shrinking. I destroyed that poor coffee shop bathroom and I frequently wonder what happened to the person who wandered in after me.\n\nFrom that point forward the farts were just as frequent and long, but they felt cleaner and less restricted. It began to feel like I was airing my colon out, blowing out all the accumulated dust. My ribs and anus ached horribly, but I was starting to feel euphoria wash over me that I assumed was just the endorphin rush my body was giving as a way to protect my fragile mind from this ridiculous ordeal. By the time hour 7 rolled around my farts had slowly faded away, but the smell permeated my clothes and the seat behind me. The family had gone through almost an entire container of Vicks, and they appeared to have survived the ordeal but I could tell that a part of them was broken that could never be fixed. It was as though they felt violated by having to breathe in my butt breath for 7 hours, and I knew my uncle was upset that his car's interior would never smell the same again, as it already smelled like hot garbage by this point.\n\nWe eventually arrived without incident, and we refused to speak of this event. Things were never really the same between all of us after that, and I have a feeling none of us will ever touch eggs ever again. They already ate enough of my farts, they don't need a reminder. I should have never eaten that much fiber. I had no idea it was capable of that.\n\nTL;DR -  I ate too many fiber bars and ended up gassing my family nearly to death over 7 hours in a car. I made the scientific discovery that your body can produce ridiculously large farts at an alarming rate. 15 second farts on average with an average rate of 1 fart every 3 minutes. That means I was farting an average of 300 seconds an hour, or 2100 seconds over 7 hours. I farted for 35 minutes. LMAO\n\nEdit: I am glad that we can all laugh at my Fart Attack and the pain and suffering that comes from it, but please don't do what I did. I was a dumbass that couldn't stop eating chocolate, and what I did was dangerous. I'm certain you will only hurt yourself if you attempt this so please do not try this.\n\nAlso I meant to individually thank people for awards via inbox but I lost count after 30 and decided to just say thank you from here. Thank you, from here.",

We decided to go up to my grandpa\u2019s hometown, which is about 8 hours away, and stayed with his brother. \n\nOn the way home my dad and grandpa decided to stop for food. They picked a Greek restaurant, which was odd. Maybe it was the only one around.\n\nI\u2019d never had Greek food, and am picky so I tried to stick to Canadian or American foods. They had some. However I ate something that my stomach didn\u2019t love.\n\nSide note: I have IBS and awful gas to begin with. I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t kill people when I go or fart.

When I poop I open the window, but it often smells the house up and he gags/opens doors \n\nWell, I farted about 30 times on the way home, and each one was ungodly. My dad and grandpa were rolling the windows up and down all the time, and cursing their choice of restaurant",
            "This is an excellent TIFU.  One of the best.  Fiber One bars are delicious though - I can see how this happened.  \n\nMy old business partner and I had a huge box of them in our office kitchen.  The office was an open-concept house with offices on the sides and our young administrative assistant in the living area.  \n\nWe binged on those things and the farting between he and I must have sounded like a brass band.  Finally he ran out and went home.  He said he was ashamed for others to hear him trumpeting into the commode.  I lived too far to leave for an hour - so there I stayed - defiant - playing my terrible orchestra.",

            "After some quick Googling, average fart volume is 5-375 mL. These average farts last on the long end for 5 seconds. So let's say 75 mL per second of fart. If you farted a total of 2100 seconds that's 157,500 mL or 157.5 L of flatulence. Average farts are 7% methane that's 11.025 L of methane. A mol of methane at STP weighs 16g, and takes up 22.4 L\n\n11.025 L methane * 16 g methane/22.4 L =7.875 g methane (CH4).\n\nMethane releases 50.1 kJ /g = 394.5375 kJ of combustive energy. I found that an average US firecracker (I searched for M-80 but not sure if this refers to that model) releases 500 J (or 0.5 kJ)\n\nSo 394.5375/0.5 = 789.075.\n\nCongratulations! Over that 7 hours, your anus released the equivalent of over 112 firecrackers of kinetic fart energy!!\n\nEdit: just had to add this only accounts for the methane, which as mentioned is only 7% of the total volume of average farts. If we assumed the noxious composition of the remaining gaseous products were energetically on par, the true value is over 14x what I calculated!!",
            "Bro, long ago, I once ate one fiber bar before meeting up with an ex-gf (new gf at the time). Every 30 seconds I was farting while we were doing grown up things in bed.

And it can cause massive amounts of intestinal discomfort if someone eats 6 of said bars.\n\nWe avoid any and all products with chickory root and the hubs now tops out at 2 bars max if we\u2019re traveling/hiking.",

            "I am crying!! I had a similar experience with the exact same bar. They were SO good, so we polished off the box between us. Oh, my, GOD! My husband almost went to the ER because the pain was so bad. I felt like I needed to poke a hole somewhere in the vicinity of my abdomen to relieve pressure.

            "I\u2019ve been in the same situation, with almost the same cause; in my case it was Fiber One cereal that I ate an entire box of while stoned. Dear *god*, the agony. I didn\u2019t get the diarrhea, I just couldn\u2019t shit for about three days, all the while in horrible pain and absolutely *blasting* out farts. There were a few times where it felt like I was about to shit my pants,m but my rush to the bathroom was met by horrible cramps and pain as my body tried it\u2019s hardest to birth what must\u2019ve just been little pebbles of pure fiber out of my poor, poor anus.  \n\nOn a related note, never eat fuck tons of peanuts and or pistachios in a day. I wasn\u2019t even high as an excuse for this one. The result is horribly similar. The difference, which might be better or worse depending on your point of view, is that I could still shit after that ordeal and it didn\u2019t last nearly as long. The problem was, no matter how thoroughly you think you chewed those nuts, it wasn\u2019t thoroughly enough for there not to be chunks. Now that might not be a big deal in a regular serving, but if your (soon to be very poorly) dumb ass plowed through a whole ass big bag o\u2019 nuts in one sitting like a large, stupid squirrel, those little shards of not well chewed enough nuts are going to be blasting through your poor sphincter in increasingly painful bursts throughout the day, with horrible gas in between. You thought the Fiber One was bad? Wait until each wave of fibrous hate loaf you pinch out cuts up your poor butt pucker like you\u2019d been shoveling shards of glass down your gullet instead of nuts.  \n\nI wish I could tell you that I learned my lesson the first time, but there\u2019s a reason I included the bit about thinking you chewed well enough. Less than a week later I had more pistachios and I had the brilliant idea that if I just chewed them a bit more before swallowing it would be fine this time. It wasn\u2019t fine. My poor asshole was cut to ribbons. Pooping was, for the second time in a week, horrible agony, swearing, tears, pleading to the gods for forgiveness, and acceptance of the hell I\u2019d made for myself.  \n\nLearn from our mistakes, readers.",

I ended up finding a plastic cookie container in my back seat, pulling down my pants, placing it under my butt and letting everything release. All while driving on a highway over a bridge! I filled the entire container. \n\nGot home, set the container under my car so I could throw it out later after I washed the shit off my body. Came back out and the container was gone...

            "I had a similar experience with FiberOne bars, though not to this extent.  I think I ate about 4 in a sitting.  3/10 would not recommend.\n\nThere was, however, another incident, involving a 52oz  Bolthouse Farms Blue Goodness.  \nDuring a long gaming session, I sat down with the big bottle of one of my favorite drinks.  I figured, it tastes great and it's fruit, so, it's good for me, right? Sure, one serving... but this was at least 6 servings.\n\nAbout a half hour after finishing the bottle, I began to get the stomach gurgles... uh oh.  Fortunately, I didn't have the need to run to the bathroom, however, it did result in what  I refer to as \"the plastic farts\".... dear lord... I wasn't aware that my body could produce paint fumes.  For about 3 hours I sat on my couch, frying my nostrils every few minutes with the most inhuman, foul chemical smell that I've ever experienced.  It was so bad that the cat and dog both ran out of the room.  I'm very surprised that I didn't set off the smoke/carbon monoxide/natural gas alarm.",

There are two kinds of fiber: dietary and just regular fiber. \n\nYour dietary fiber is what give you gas due to your large intestine breaking it down to Vitamin K and absorbing it leaving gas beind. This type of fiber when being digested in your stomach and small intestine traps and holds on to saturated fats (or bad fats) stopping them from being absorbed which helps with heart health.\n\nRegular fiber helps push stuff through your intestinal tract aka makes you poop. If you haven't had a good poop in a while I'd suggest some \"ruffage\".\n\nSource: took a college course about 6 years ago on nutrition.",

I told his order to the girl working the counter with me listing the large and medium coffees, but he ended up just getting the large.

He told us which roast my Uncle got and gave us each a cup on the house. He came to the funeral and donated money in his honor.

So from then on we would say \u201chey are you doing your usual for you and your friend?\u201d \n\nOne morning he came through during a rush. I didn\u2019t recognize his car and greeted him with our usual greeting. He said \u201cI\u2019d like a double espresso with sugar and no lid.\u201d I then recognized his voice/order and said \u201coh! And a dog biscuit for your friend right?\u201d It was silent on the other end for a second and I just heard a small whisper of \u201cnot anymore.\u201d My fucking heart broke, and \n I had just lost my dog of 10 years the week before. I almost started crying and all I could reply with was, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ... we\u2019ll see you at the window.\u201d after he left, I made sure to tell all my coworkers about it so they knew not to ask if he needed a dog biscuit. \n\nAnyways, three weeks ago I was alone for the early morning and he came through. I greeted him, asked if he was getting his usual and said I\u2019d see him at the window when I finished his drink. I made the drink and when I came to the window I saw a little brown puppy in his car. I couldn\u2019t help but let a huge smile come across my face and I asked, \u201cnow who is this??\u201d He smiled and said the little guy was Charlie. Let me tell you it took everything in me to not cry. I maybe see this guy for about 10 minutes total a week, but the amount we feel connected to our customers is so real sometimes.

However, eventually he did come in again, and I immediately felt terrible for having thought so negatively of him.\n\nHe was disheveled, appeared to be distracted by something, and he smiled when he approached and placed his order in a friendly manner.  He asked for an item we didn't carry anymore and instead of throwing a fit he said it was ok and not to worry about it.\n\nWhen he went to pay he struggled to remember which pocket he'd put his wallet in, he wore a coat so he had a few to check and he rapidly became flustered and embarrassed.\n\nThe stubborn, aggressive, independent angry man was gone and it still makes me tear up having  seen him having deteriorated like that.  Especially since he obviously understood what was happening to his mind.\n\nI told him it was ok since he'd been a regular for so long and that it was on the house.\n\nI told all my employees to give him his order for free from now on, he never got more than two coffees and a pastry, and I would cover it.\n\nThe last time I saw him he had a family member with him.  He was very out of it but did smile when he came up and placed his order.  His family member also ordered a few things and paid for it all, I let them know his coffee was free.  The man walked off with a happy smile on his face to what looked like more of his family, including what must have been his grandchildren.  The family member who paid thanked me, apparently he'd told them how nice we'd treated him and they appreciated it.\n\nNobody should suffer like that, losing who they are slowly, even if they are a rude person.  At least however it seemed he was now normally happy rather than upset.\n\nIf I'd known it would be the last time I saw him I'd have thanked him for being such a good customer.\n\nI like to think he forgot all the negative things and was left with the simple happiness of his daily coffee from our shop.  I hope he stayed the happy man he'd become until the end and didn't lose that too.",

He has all rings cleaned as usual. This happens again until June, and finally I ask why she hasn't come in and again he replies the same answer he gave me previously about how she has a cold and how she's slowly recovering from it. Well almost two months go by, this happened this past Tuesday; I ask how his wife is recovering to which he replies while handing me her wedding set and his wedding ring without the promise ring \"I layed my wife to rest with our promise ring\".

I nearly broke down and started crying with him. Since we were nearly empty I told him to just go take a seat and we\u2019ll have his food out shortly (he was rightfully confused by this seeing as he hadn\u2019t actually finished ordering or paid). I cooked 60 wings and brought it out to the table along with 2 cooks and 3 cashiers (we were the crew usually on duty when they would come in). We sat down, ate with him, and talked about her, Fatima, for about 45 mins before our shift leader busted us and said one person could stay out and we could sit with him in shifts.

His wife was extremely disabled, motor skills very low, couldn't talk, mostly grunts and spit, walked very slow and flailing. The way this man cared for her, the gentleness and patience and love was overwhelming, when he was alone I knew she must have passed. He was a retired archectect and invited me in to give me this ABSOLUTLY amazing mid century modern kitchen table. None of his kids wanted it and he said he appreciated my kindness and understanding towards her special needs. I am so grateful to think of them and him everyday I use it.",

One, really lovely older gentleman used to come in every single week after visiting his wife at the cemetery across the road. We developed a little bond and he'd tell me stories of their life together, sometimes with a year in his eye but always a smile on his face.",

They all ordered her regular drink to honor her. It was the first time one of my customers had passed & really upset me. Had to go have a cry in the back room. Saw her husband later at the grocery store, that sucked.",

            "Please don\u2019t feel bad. I\u2019m sure it was hard, but also nice for him to be reminded of his wife in a special way. The worst thing people can do when someone loses a spouse is pretend they didn\u2019t exist or there\u2019s nothing wrong.

            "I have a similar, but opposite, story. Shortly (few months maybe?) after my partner died, I went to a fast food place we used to frequent here in Stockholm. The staff were always quite friendly and talkative, even though they were't the best at Swedish. My partner was virtually always the one to pay (because my partner made a lot more money than I), and so, when I came in this time, ordered, and made way to pay, the cashier asked where \"the other guy\" was, since I was paying for myself. I think I just said that he had passed away, but in retrospect it would probably have been better to say something else given their horrified expressions.",

            "Really harsh on you, when you were trying to give great service. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nIt happened to a friend and co-worker of mine in my first job, working in a small supermarket, popular on housing estates and in petrol stations. We had a regular customer, a man in his late 50s or early 60s, who would ask for \"twenny black and blue, please\". This, translated into English, was a request for 20 black Superkings cigarettes, and 20 of the blue variety (the \"light\" ones, I think... I'm a non smoker).\n\nOne day the chap walked in looking a bit subdued and my colleague tried an extra friendly greeting to cheer him up. \"Morning [name], the usual twenny black and blue?\". The customer responded forlornly, \"Just the black today, thanks. The blue were for my wife and she's passed away\".\n\nMy colleague was mortified, and mumbled something about being sorry for his loss. The shop was silent. He took his cigarettes and left.",
            "It means you cared enough to remember",
            "Back when I was working at a fast food restaurant in the U.S., I was started on drive thru after they felt I was trained well enough. \n\nAnyway, there was this man who ordered the same thing every day: Two kraut dogs and a medium diet Pepsi. And I loved serving him because he'd tell me stories of his time in the service (at the time I was waiting out my time till I went into the Navy).\n\nOne day, I noticed that he had just stopped... coming.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what happened to him. Hell, I don't even remember his name, but I remember how he made me feel.",
            "Personally for me, this is the sweetest thing. I would want other people know that someone i cherish exist that they know what sandwich they eat or what coffee they drink. That i am not alone remembering them.\nPeople may perish but memories remains forever.",
            "He must understand you were just being kind and getting his usual order ready. He knew that you *didn\u2019t* know about the other coffee, the reason for him getting it in the past. You certainly didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t hold anything against you personally."

I don\u2019t drive at the moment so I decided to take a flight as it\u2019s only 40 minutes or so, and it was only \u20ac15. We haven\u2019t seen eachother for 3 months because of covid so we were both very excited. Now, to spice things up a lil I decided I will wear lingerie under my regular clothes, as he lives only 10 minutes away from the airport and I thought I could surprise him straight away. I also decided to spice things up a lil and wear a buttplug, not even thinking bout it, so I put it in right before leaving for the airport, I\u2019m gonna spare you the details but it\u2019s a small one so easy to go along your day with. \n\nNow, I get to the airport, and while I\u2019m going through the security the things beeps which isn\u2019t a surprise since I\u2019m wearing light jewellery so I didn\u2019t think much of it. The woman tells me to step aside and shes just checking my pockets etc. I take off all my jewellery and try again but the thing is still beeping, and now, I\u2019m only wearing sweatpants, a hoodie, and lingerie with no extra details. So I\u2019m standing there when the woman tells me to go onto an expectation into one of those machine x-ray type things when to my horror I remember I\u2019m wearing a butt plug with a HUGE jewel. Which I completely forgot about. At this stage I am mortified and tell the woman what\u2019s going on. Luckily she just laughed it off and let me go.I have NEVER been this embarrassed.\n\nTL;DR I wore a butt plug to the airport and got stopped.\n\nEdit ;for everyone asking how I could\u2019ve \u201cforgotten\u201d it there. It\u2019s not that I forgot that it was there or I didn\u2019t feel it was still there, I just got used to the feeling and my mind wasn\u2019t on that when I was entering the security.",

It took a few months to ship, and when it finally did, I was pretty unhappy with it. First of all, there was this big crack behind it, bending the metal in an unsatisfying way, but it wasn't that noticeable so I didn't bother sending it back. The worst, though, was that it was near impossible to write on it without leaving ghost marks. And you can forget about letting some writing on it more than 24 hours.\n\nAs a result, I wound up not using it for most of the last year. Basically, his only purpose was as a magnet holder, when it should have been used for so many different projets. \n\nToday, as I finally had some free time, I looked into the process of cleaning my whiteboard, and making it more usable. As I applied some store bought cleaner, I found this small tear in some kind of plastic coating. I freaked out, ripped it all out and came to the horrifying conclusion that I spent 1 1/2 years writing on plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now have a brand new, unused board that has been sitting in my office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: bought a whiteboard, forgot to take the plastic layer off and took way too long to figure it out\n\n[EDIT](https://imgur.com/a/zID4BuO)",

        "selftext": "This happened Sunday night.\n\n\n\nMy oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  \n\n\n\nI get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.\n\n\n\nWe discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......\n\n\n\nI walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......\n\n\n\nWhat i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her \"fuck me\" lingerie.\n\n\n\nSo no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  \n\n\n\nSo my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR  Didn't tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game\n\n\n\nedit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.\n\nUpdate: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    Son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.\n\n",

The cab driver was wearing a uniform and a cap. He carried my bags to the door. At night. When they opened the door, despite me standing RIGHT next to the driver, all they saw was a dude in a uniform holding my bags.

In this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. If you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. As this was my first laparoscopic surgery, I soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. Like many of you, I had no idea this role even existed, but I quickly accepted my new job as \u2018vagina sealer\u2019. I approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. I placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. After several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  The attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said \u201cdo you know where the vagina is?

Today you fucked up tho- not because you are a student that made a mistake but because you claim you don\u2019t pay 40k in tuition for this- it\u2019s exactly what you are paying for. You are paying for experienced professionals to teach you how to perform procedures and if blocking off the release of pressure through the vagina is part of the process- you should learn it and learn it properly.

        "selftext": "I'm in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being \"that person\" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn't afford to go.\n\nAnyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. When I get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.\n\nThis goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:\n\n*Explains above about material*\nProf: \"What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?\"\nMe: \"No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?\"\nProf: \"Pardon? I don't have a textbook for this course.\"\nMe: \"It literally says in the syllabus, look!\"\n*Shows syllabus*\nProf: \"Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?\"\nMe: \"What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?\"\n*Prof starts laughing*\nProf: \"Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I've never experienced this before.\"\nMe: \"Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.\"\n\nI then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn't make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing \"This is a new one for me.\" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!\n\nTldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.\n\nEdit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying \"You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha\". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:\n\n1. Ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto's birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.\n\n2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on\n.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. \n\n3. I highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. It's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I'm sure it will turn out fine. It'll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.\n\nThanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.\n\nEdit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn't crush it but there is no way I didn't pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said \"I usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam.\" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.\n\nJust wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:\n\n\"Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life.\" - CZ\n\np.s: for textbook help... IG: @redditecon202\n",

The class was CSCI 3650 - Analysis of Algorithms (Comp Sci class)\n\nHis deal was that whatever grade you get on the final is the lowest grade he will give you in his class. Makes sense that if you do well on the final, you must have learned the material right?\n\nI accepted the challenge. Didn't go to a single class, do a homework assignment, quiz, or the midterm. Showed up to the final sweating bullets. Professor looked at me funny and asked \"who are you?\" Awkwardly told him I was in the class and he just said \"good luck\". Pulled out an A in the class.

        "selftext": "I drink a lot of coffee. My mornings consist of two 300ml mugs of coffee, and I sometimes have a third after dinner later in the day. \n\nRecently, I got far too into James Hoffmann's videos and decided to upgrade my shitty drip coffee machine for a proper precision brewer. And when I say precision, I mean that this thing comes with a water testing strip so you can calibrate the machine for the mineral content in your water supply. Serious nerd shit. \n\nTo justify the ludicrous amount of money I spent on what appears to be the Hadron Collider of coffee machines, I did some research on brewing ratios in order to maximise the allegedly life-changing potential of this equipment. Now, coffee science says the ideal water-to-beans ratio for this brew method is about 60g of grounds per litre of water. Out of interest, I decided to prepare my usual ratio from the old machine and see how close I was. It turns out, since I got the old machine just over a year ago, I've been brewing at about 20g/litre, resulting in what I now realise is pathetically weak brew. \n\nI prepared a proper 60g/L brew with the new machine, and the resulting coffee was on another planet. The flavours were so developed it was like I could taste the touch of the Colombian farmer who picked the beans. I drank my full morning dose of two 300ml mugs in just over an hour. \n\nAnd then, I discovered an unexpected side effect. \n\nThe year of drinking weak-ass brew has conditioned my body for weak coffee. And I had just drunk over half a litre of coffee that was theoretically three times as strong as usual. \n\nIt has now been an hour since I finished that first pot and I can hear the passage of time. A fly flew past me in slow motion. I made an omelette for lunch and I beat the egg so fast it turned into steam. My heart no longer beats; it vibrates. And there is something unholy brewing in my lower intestine and I am fearing the wrath of God when it is released. Send help. \n\n\nTL;DR: My new coffee machine gave me the knowledge that I've been conditioning my body to piss-weak brew for a year, and two cups of the real strong stuff made me transcend the space-time continuum.\n\nEDIT: \n\n[Here](https://www.sageappliances.com/uk/en/products/coffee/bdc450.html) is the machine I bought, for those who have asked, although it appears to be sold out at the moment. Did I get the last one? \n\nAnd [here](https://youtu.be/HfkdkZRv6Mc) is the James Hoffmann review that convinced me to ruin my life in this particular way.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nTo everyone accusing this of being some kind of viral ad, it's true. Sage paid me, and in fact specifically requested I include the details of me plastering the inside of my toilet bowl following the intestinal catastrophe their product gave me. Aggressive shitting is exactly the kind of PR exposure they want for their brand.",

        "selftext": "Long time Reddit reader, first time making an account because i am currently stuck in my girlfriends room while she and her family are having dinner downstairs. I haven't eaten since morning nor showered and I need to take a shit.\n\nBack story to this morning, since the lockdown for covid 19 happened, I haven't seen my girlfriend for over month plus. Our government recently relaxed the quarantine so we are allowed to go out but not loiter. Woke up to my girlfriend's call around 11am saying that her parents went out to get something. I thought okay I'll come over, return her a camera I borrowed and maybe we can sit in my car around her neighbourhood and hangout awhile. It was a little rushed as her parents just left her house as I left mine. I'm about 20 min away from her place. She assured me her parents will be out for at least 1 and a half hours as they need to get lunch. I drove as fast as I could and picked her up from the front of the house and we drove to park nearby to hangout. After a couple of minutes, I ask if she brought some water as I asked her about it before I came and she said no. She said why don't you come in and take some water since her parents will still be far away. I said yes (obviously) and went in, drank water and we sat on the couch for awhile to cuddle. \n\nI was a little paranoid but I haven't seen her in a long time so i needed it. About 10 min, we hear a car outside her house and that's how tifu, it was her parents. They were only out for 40 min. FML we panicked. Luckily I parked away from her house and took my slippers in. I contemplated just owning up and lying that I needed to use the toilet but her mom is really difficult. She would assume my girlfriend was lying and get her trouble and I haven't even met her parents officially as her boyfriend yet. If you are from an Asian family or have heard of asian parents being strict about relationships, it's true.\n\nWe both ran up to her room and I hid behind her door. Mind you, her room is really small. Its about the siZe of two single beds. Can't hide under the bed as she has to keep her door open and you can see straight under her bed from the stairs. The only place possible is behind her door. I stood there frozen af as she went down to greet her parents. I could here them coming in as I hugged the wall as tightly as I could. \n\nShe came back up freaking out but I said it's okay. Let's just try formulate a plan. She said okay and she went down to eat with them first. Which I had then had to stay as silent a possible with no fan or air-conditioning so I sweated my ass off. \n\n1 pm ish. She comes back up and we try to listen whether her parents are coming up or not. They usually sit downstairs after lunch and nap, which they did. Gave me a little bit of relief as I could sit down in the floor. The space in between the door and her table is super tiny which is uncomfortable but I'm not complaining. \n\n2pm. Her dad comes up to shower and her door is right next to the bath area. Fuck I can hear the water rushing. But good news my girlfriend is in the room doing her work so she can look out. Its weird as I'm just standing up behind the door and looking at her look back at me. After his shower, her dad leaves to go to his store which leaves her mom downstairs. She gets on a long phone call which gives me a bit of room to relax. My girlfriend and I make out a bit to calm our nerves and I gotta say it did help. \n\nFor the next three hours, her mom stays downstairs and we try to formulate a plan but everything involves the timing of her parents which is impossible. Can't jump out the window cause it's grilled and she doesn't have the key...\n\nAround 5.30pm ish, her dad comes home and almost fucking COMES INTO HER ROOM. He asks her to print something and she quickly walks to her door to stop him from coming in. I hear his voice right outside the door. Thankfully he walks away and goes down to watch TV. And I swear to god the universe wants us to suffer because right after that her mom comes upstairs and hangs about the common area. My girls had recorded a zoom meeting so she tells her mom she has a meeting and plays it and closing the door giving my legs much needed rest and I sit.\n\n7pm, her mom calls her from downstairs that it's time to eat. And that's where we are at now. Its currently 9pm at this sentence and I can hear her family talking to each other. She has to turn off the lights and fan and air-conditioning so I'm freaking drenched in my sweat in the dark. I'm sitting down but I've got pins and needles in my feet now. I would stand up but because the area is so tight, I don't want to risk any noise. Oh remember how I haven't eaten and need to shit? That's attacking now. My stomach is growling and I'm making fart noises. I'm so scared to be caught cause my parents are gonna slaughter me too. My girlfriend and I will discuss our plans for me to escape when she comes up...\n\nUPDATE 1: they are done with dinner. My girlfriend brought me some water and biscuits but I don't have the appetite to eat. Don't want to drink too much as I would risk needing to go to the toilet. She went back to do the dishes\n\nUPDATE 2: its 9pm and my girlfriend is in her room. She told her family she is playing animal crossing with her friends so hopefully her parents don't barge it. We're gonna formulate a plan for me to escape now. I can finally stretch my legs\n\nUPDATE 3: WE HAVE A PLAN. 9.30pm\nWe're going to wait for their parents to head up to their room. She's going to check if their door is closed and where they are looking at it. She'll bring me downstairs and I'll hide in the storeroom. She'll then go and tell her parents she's taking photos of the night and no worry if the door alarm rings (cause they have an alarm system in place). She'll unlock the main door, the outside small gate and leave it open for abit (gated and guarded area so it's pretty safe). She'll go check on her parents as they like to look at what she is doing from their room. Once she's confirmed they are not looking, she'll get me from the storeroom, I'll go all the way out and hide behind a pillar in front of her house. She'll lock everything and go back up and check her parents are not looking out and I'll walk to my car (so I don't startle her dog). Sounds pretty legit as she knows her parents schedule the best\n\nUPDATE 4: 9:41 pm. Showed my girlfriend this post and we're reading the comments. Really means a lot to us that everyone is supportive. Makes the nerves less frightening. We're hugging it out and playing Animal Crossing till her parents go to sleep at around 11\n\nUPDATE 5: I'm still here and it's around 10.30. my time zone is GMT +8 for those who are still invested. We're just preparing for when her parents go to bed so we're trying to calm our nerves\n \nUPDATE 6: it's 11 but her parents are not sleeping. For some strange reason her mom decided to bake at like 10.30. starting to think they suspect something \n\nUPDATE 7:SHIT YES! my gf just went to down and her mom is done baking and says she is going to sleep soon. Which just leaves her dad still watching TV. I'm almost out I can feel the wind already. Just can't get too trigger happy and jump the gun. \n\nUPDATE 8: FFFK. her mom just walked past her room. Heading into her own room. Her dad also getting ready to sleep. Shit is about to happen guys. Phase one of our plan is about to commence! \n\nUPDATE 9: damn, her mom went to bed but her dad is still watching TV. It's like 11:30pm and he is still watching? At least her mom is in her room so that is good.\n\nUPDATE 10: OKAY plan is in action. Her dad is now in their room and she is moving my stuff downstairs to the storeroom. I'll update once I'm inside\n\nUDPATE 11: took my last sip of water and went down to the storeroom. Phase 1 complete. Her dad is showering, her parents door is closed. Now for the front door and gat\n\nupda12: gf opening the door and the gate. I have to wait for her\n\n13: slight change, I went out the door together with her. Her dog isn't barking so that's good. She has to open the gate\n\n14. Out the gate. Bending down. Waiting for her text me\n\n15. She's taking some photos to sell the story. Better not rush it. Her dog is getting very close to me and sniffing me thought the gate. Oh god please don't bark\n\nFINAL UPDATE:\n\nFUCKING HELL GUYS. I made it. I just started the engine and my heart is pounding. I'm safe and sound. TIME TO GO HOME. Got out 11:53\n\nPOST CLARIFICATION:\n\nIts 12.15am, I'm home sipping a hot cup of Milo and laughing with my girlfriend about the entire day. We just wanna thank everyone that supported us and this shitty situation we put ourselves in. The nerves were real and seeing how everyone wanted the best for us really helped us push through this emotionally. Wanted to clarify a few things for quite a number of questions:\n\n1. A lot of people were saying this story is a fake a similar to other \"stuck in ___ room with family in house\". Unfortunately, Asian people go through similar things and this is no exception. The strict family and rebellious child senario. Same coin, different sides.\n\n2. A few people mentioned how this is similar to another post a year a go and truth is, I was inspired by that post to share this story. It was a very emotionally troubling time for both of us and after reading the mentioned post and seeing how supportive everyone was and how it made the OP feel much better, I thought it would a good idea for my girlfriend and I to do the same. And it did! It honestly helped us feel like we could make this work. I'm really sorry I can't prove it happened but this was real to the both of us and that's more important.\n\n3. We own up to this mistake and that's why it's on tifu. We fucked up big time and have only ourselves to blame. But we survived it learnt never to repeat it again. \n\nADD:\n\n4. Situation happened in Malaysia. Its a very hot and humid country so it's very common for people to shower more than once or twice a day and sometimes before we sleep.\n\n5. We're Chinese. \n\n6. This is the most amusing part and I'm glad everyone was worried about it: yes. I did take a shit after I ate. It was brutal. Constipation due to the lack of water. Not only were my legs shaking, my asshole hurt too. Not fun.\n\n7. 4pm (next day) Oh god, this is still going on in the comments but I wanted to add something after my gf went through the comments. To those who opened up about similar stories about hiding or having strict parents (i.e. no friends over or always under watch), it really meant a lot to her that there are other people who go through the same thing as her and I would like to thank you for sharing! She always felt like the odd one out of her friends. Not being able to go out, tight rules etc and it's good to know she isn't the only one. Some people don't understand this and that's fine. Everyone grows up in different scenarios. Its not that she doesn't love her parents less, it just sucks to be in her situation. I wish I could give her more credit for what happened last night. She risked so much just for us to see each other. \n\n\nThank you again for investing your time in this. Didn't expect it to blow up like this but you guys helped us a lot. Time to sleep now. Good night everyone!!!\n\n\nTL ; DR : came over to my girlfriends house to see her and her parents suddenly came home and now I am hiding in her room as her family is eating downstairs",

So one thing leads to another and next thing I know I\u2019m being awoken by Big Puns voice screaming his daughters name from downstairs and nearly shit my pants. He starts up the stairs and she yells out that she\u2019s coming. As she starts walking down the stairs I try to figure out my next move. I look out the window and see a Pine tree 7-10 feet off of the roof. I go for it jump to the tree, shimmy down and run to the front to hide behind her car. Next thing I know she\u2019s outside whisper/screaming my name, I move from behind her car and wave her down and she laughs her ass off. 5 years later she gets married and decides to tell Big Pun about that day with me standing there, I thought I was going to die u til he started laughing.",

My ex stayed hidden in my open closet while crouching and I had to cover him up with a pile of junk. I remembered he also needed to pee but the cr was near where my parent were. So he peed in a plastic bottle coz he couldn't handle it anymore. I think the gods were really against us that time coz my whole family even went to my room just to have a chat, and that doesn't really happen often. I was so scared that he'd make an unnecessary noise and HE DID. Thank god I was able to cover the noise or else I'd be dead and wouldn't be able to type this down right now. \n\nHe basically stayed crouching for almost 5 hours lol.

            "For those who want muscular calves:\n\n1. Eat a caloric surplus when looking to grow them, you need bricks to build a house.\n2. Your calves have two muscles on the back (this is actually a matter of some debate). One group is Achilles to the back of your femur, the other is Achilles to the back of your tibia.\n3. The one that goes to your femur activates when you are in a mostly standing position, and tends to be comprised of a bit more fast twitch fiber. The other activates all the time but can be isolated when doing calf raises in a seated position and is comprised of more slow twitch fiber.\n4. One way of addressing this is to do really heavy sets of lowish reps for standing raises, and somewhat lighter sets of higher reps for seated reps. Both will require quite a bit of volume. You could do 5x5 standing raises, then 5x15 seated raises, three times a week.\n5. In both cases, you will again want volume and frequency and you will need to progress your weight over time to keep your body pushing itself and adapting to greater and greater stress.\n6. The technique for both are fairly similar. You need to stand on a solid raised platform so you can finish the range of motion with your heel below your toes. Tempo is to be fast on the way up (controlled but fairly explosive), hold at the top of the movement for a second, then go down the range of motion slowly, maybe 3-4 seconds, then pause for a full second at the bottom to remove any elastic energy in the muscle.\n7. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re doing the movement properly because you will be quite sore at first, because doing it that way causes more muscle damage that gets repaired and grown on.\n\nGood luck",

        "selftext": "so today I had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, I\u2019m still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn\u2019t make one hell of a story for you all\n\nokay so for a bit of back story I\u2019m 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we\u2019ve been together for 2 years now and through out that time I\u2019ve seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they\u2019re usually travelling so it\u2019s a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We\u2019ve also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....\n\nSo on top of making porn I\u2019m also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I\u2019d been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.\n\nnow fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I\u2019d always got the vibe they didn\u2019t like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that\u2019s not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.\n\nI panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn\u2019t want her dad getting us sick also.\n\nHer dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I\u2019ll keep you updated if anything else happens \n\n\n\nTL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won\u2019t talk to us",

Did you also know that a Mac booting up will ignore the fact there is a headphone plugged in and play stuff on the speaker while booting? It also won't respond to sound controls.

It\u2019s in the other edit, but I\u2019m putting this up here for visibility since it\u2019s come up in a lot of messages. Also, all y\u2019all getting political and sending angry PMs, chill.\n\nI have been following the election all day, every day waiting for a victory announcement. I had an appointment this morning to get a filling replaced and of course, the second I leave my apartment the fireworks and cheering start so I check my phone and lo and behold Biden has claimed Pennsylvania.\n\nAnyway, I finish my walk to the dentist's office, I'm in the chair, and the dentist and his assistant come in. I just say, \"It looks like they've called the election for Biden\" with no indication of preference one way or another. I was going to mention how I missed the news announcement and leave it at that. Instead, as soon as I mention it the dentist gets a look of total defeat on his face and then starts going off, calmly, about how the machines were having errors in MI, fake ballots, voter fraud, and having to recount all the states or something. At this point he has proceeded to drill my mouth, not fully numb, ~~terrified and~~ in pain.  ~~I've never been more scared in my life~~  worried that I upset the guy working on my mouth. (edited again for clarity)\n\nTLDR; I upset my dentist right before a filling by telling him Biden won the election. It hurt.\n\nEdit: So this exploded. Also, I just want to add based on a lot of the comments, the dentist was never angry or malicious. They were just calmly explaining their \u201ctheories\u201d while operating, to the assistant. Definitely distracted, which is why I think I didn\u2019t get enough numbing agent at first, but nothing to file any complaints about. I also asked for more numbing agent after a few minuets and things were fine after that.",

Again, I never liked her. Everyone I know stopped going to her because of her estimates, I just haven\u2019t needed major work. I kept going because I was too lazy to find someone else. Also she is now out of the way for me. That screen saver was what made me think, why am I here? I hate coming here. I didn\u2019t think I needed 10 years of history behind I never liked her. Plus the tech would talk politics with me while she worked on my teeth....so I just sat and listened to it. Politely declining and not going back to her is my choice.",

I was also told I was not allowed to reschedule due to the nature of the operation. \n\nAfter they convinced me the could sufficiently numb the area with local anesthetics I agreed, worst mistake of my life doesn't even begin to describe it. After 8 shots of novacaine they started. I could still feel fucking everything, it was terrible. The grinding is imprinted into my brain forever. After maybe 30 seconds to a minute I asked for some more novacaine and nitrous.  \n\nThey stopped for about half an hour to let it kick in and began again. It barely helped at all I was just high now.  I made it about two or so more minutes before asking for more. They gave me another four shots of novacaine on top of the 10 I'd already gotten, split between both sides of my mouth. \n \nI was fine until they started getting ready to pull the teeth. Pain isn't the right word. The second they started drilling I pretty much punched the dentist in the gut. It was one of the sharpest hottest pains I've ever felt and it was only made worse by the feeling of the drill grinding. They gave me another 4 shots of novacaine and upped the nitrous again. \n\nI don't think it would have been possible to numb my mouth enough to not feel it. After 18 shots of novacaine I could still feel everything it just didn't hurt as much. I can still feel the vibration and the drill chipping away if I think about it. 0/10 would not recommend. I haven't been back to that dentist since(I have a new one) and get anxiety any time I smell a dentist office.\n\nTL:DR got my wisdom teeth out without getting put to sleep. Never again.",

Got treated for my fever and tested for the virus. Speaking of the test, never again do I want those long ass swabs shoved down my throat again - it was so damn deep it practically touched my brain. Doctor conducted a thorough checkup. I winced when said doctor pressed on my stomach. Doctor narrowed her eyes and asked what the colour of my poop was. I said \"kinda dark but, you know, not outer space dark\". Doctor said \"hm\" before proceeding to spread my ass cheeks and jam her lubricated finger into my anus. For the record, that finger was thick as fuck and it happened to be the first time ever something penetrated me down there.\n\nGot discharged with a laundry list of prescribed medications and advised to self isolate until I recieve my test results.

Now I might be positive for the virus while having a phantom finger stirring the inside of my asshole, as well as World War 2 level flashbacks every time I wanna bust a nut.**",

The cotton swap rubs against the tonsils at the back of the throat and up the nostrils and the actual test only takes a minute of discomfort the worst things that will happen is a gag reflex when you\u2019re swabbing the throat, tearing up due to discomfort in the nose and sometimes nose bleeds when people rub too forcefully up the nostrils. Knowing if you have the virus no matter your age is sometimes all you need to save not only your life but the lives of people you could potentially transmit the virus to. OP I wish you all the best and a swift recovery and although your experience with the test was unpleasant and can be for many it\u2019s an essential part of combatting this pandemic and shouldn\u2019t be looked on with a negative light. Please don\u2019t be afraid to get tested guys.",

This happened this weekend.\n\nLet's lay out some plot points first..\n\n\\-I'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.\n\n\\-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.\n\n\\-I've always worked out, done yoga, I'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I've done it a lot and I know what I'm doing, lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan. I was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, \"deepest\" of which is to put my legs over my head. This way, I would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. But the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (I can draw a diagram if needed.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the day comes, I have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. By the time I arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like \"suck your dick!\" from the other room. I prepare myself with the girl I'm dating, and she invites her friends in. They are hooting and hollaring as I'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. The whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, I'm really into this idea now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI throw my legs over my head as I've done many time, and start to play along with the \"show\"... I circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. I put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and I hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. I'm trying to look back to see them, but I'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. I start getting more and more into it, and the girl I'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. At this point I'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. The girls really seem to be enjoying it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting \"Cum in your mouth! Cum in your mouth!\"... Now to be clear, I normally don't do this. I have before, lol, but it's not my thing. But I'm the entertainment, and I aim to please, so in my mind I'm thinking lets do this. I start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. The girl I'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. The whole thing is so hot and I feel like I'm about to cum, and.....explode. It was a lot. I'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. The girl I'm dating let's go of my legs and I fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. Her friends start to yell -- \"kiss him!\" \"cum swap!\" - I'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. So I stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and I look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. My assistant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe leaves the room, I race to the bathroom. The girl I'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and I tell her. She loses it laughing - \"SO AND SO is your assistant?! AHAHAHAH\". I'm not laughing. Assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's actually a bit of a scene, the girl I'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling Assistant and she is not answering. The girl I'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been working from home all week. I've talked to my assistant via Slack and we've said nothing. She is in the office. I can't work from home tomorrow. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. The girl I'm dating said that Assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. I really don't know what the fuck to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr - I sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. We haven't spoken about it since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  [The diagram](https://imgur.com/a/rR31eBi)!  I'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  I'm not a turkey, I promise.\n\nEDIT 2: To clarify, I don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  I think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  The diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until I stood up.  At least this is the logic I am convincing myself of.\n\nEDIT 3:  I'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and \"a girl I am dating\" because honestly I wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  I don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.\n\nEDIT 4:  Yes, they were staring at my butthole.  I'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. To be honest if,\n\nEDIT 5:\n\nSince everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts.  No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.\n\nAs for the \"I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked\" - I bring it back to the above statement.  A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you \"with a friend who told you\" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  Better than jerking off that's for sure.\n\nAnd yes, I have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

            "The post, which looks deleted for me:\n\nOhhhhh where do I begin. This happened this weekend.\n\nLet's lay out some plot points first..\n\n-I'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.\n\n-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.\n\n-I've always worked out, done yoga, I'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I've done it a lot and I know what I'm doing, lol.\n\nOKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan.

        "selftext": "Hello! So as a kid (and I promise this setup matters), I was raised in an Islamic household. Thing with being Islamic in America is there aren't any good Muslim schools to send your child so they could learn both Faith and have a decent education. So my parents decided to send me to a Catholic school since it was closest to the values they wanted me to live by. At home, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Quoran. I loved those stories, but sometimes, my grandmother would stop her storytelling voice and use her fact voice. Like she was telling me something that happened at the store. She was using her fact voice when she was telling me about the story of how a father had to sacrifice his son to God but when he tried to bring down the knife, it wouldn't hurt his son because God had willed that his dedication meant he no longer needed to sacrifice his son. So I asked my grandmother if I could become invincible to knives if I believed in God enough and she told me \"No don't take the story literally. Take the meaning of the story.\" Aka do not stab yourself. So I was like oooooh all of these stories are *metaphorical.* The Bible at my school and the Quoran at home are both collections of stories filled with wisdom meant to be interpreted as the situation sees fit. Like a superhero story where Jesus and Muhammad are the main characters. They're meant to help the story deliver me a meaning like Ash from Pokemon. I think you see where this is going, I thought they were stories. *They're not real*. And I grew up thinking that. That these religions were a way of life, not to be taken literally.\n\nCut to driving with a friend from school through California to Palm Springs to see her grandmother. We were talking about how hot it was and I joked about how we needed a flood to cool us down. Where's God's wrath when you need, right? She laughed and started to draw the conversation to her admiration of Jesus. We started talking about miracles and hungry people and I said \"Man, I wish we could do those kind of miracles for real. The world could use a few.\" and she replied something along the lines of \"Well who knows? Jesus could be back soon\" and I chuckled. Did that thing where you blow air out of your nose and smile. I thought it was a joke. Like ha, ha Superman is gonna come fly us to her grandma's house. And she looked at me and asked me why I laughed. I told her I thought she was being sarcastic. She corrected me that she was not. Then I asked her \"wait are you saying like.. Jesus could actually, really show up on Earth\"? She got upset and said yes. Then the rest of the car ride was quiet. So instead of thinking \"Jesus is real\". I thought \"wow my friend must be really gullible\".\n\nThen once I got home, I told my grandmother about it. I thought it be a funny story. Like telling someone that your friend thinks elves are real. But she looked at me and went \"OP, Muhammad is real. And so was Jesus. What are you talking about?\" For the next 10 mins we kept talking and I started to realize that oh my god, my grandmother thinks the stories are real. Does everyone think that the stories about water turning into wine, and walking on water, and touching sick people to heal them was *REAL???*\n\nLastly, I pulled my pastor aside at school. And I asked him straight up \"Is Jesus real?\" and of course he was confused and said yes and asked me if I thought Jesus wasn't real. I told him what I had thought my whole life and he goes \"Yeah, everything in the Bible actually happened\". So I asked him why none of those miracles have happened now or at all recorded in history and he goes \"I don't know, but the Lord does and we trust him\".\n\nSo now my friend doesn't talk to me, school is weird now because all of these ridiculous, crazy stories about talking snakes, angels visiting people, and being BROUGHT. BACK. FROM. THE. DEAD. are all supposed to be taken literally. And asking questions about it isn't ok either, apparently. So yep. That's eye opening.\n\nTLDR: I thought the Bible and Quoran were metaphorical books and that everything in them wasn't real but rather just anecdotal wisdom. Then I learned people actually thought things in the Bible and Quoran were real. Now everything is tense between me and my friends and family.\n\nEdit: So many comments! Wanted to say thank you for every respectful, well thought out theological opinion or suggestion. I can't say thank you enough to everyone in the comments and all your different experiences with religion and spirituality are inspiration and ideas I will consider for a while. Even if I can't reply to you in time, thank you. Genuinely, thank you.",

            "TL;DR You're right, the stories aren't meant to be taken literally.\n\nTo be clear, understanding the truth is not and never will be a FU. The FU here really is that the people around you are intolerant. They believe what they do because it's in a book, yet I'll bet not one of them believes Bilbo Baggins is real.\n\nWe can argue faith another time, but suffice to say that you're right in that these stories are meant as stories. A lot of the stories in the Bible are parables, which are specifically meant to not be taken literally. Additionally, I don't know much about the Quoran, but the Bible has been through many translations, requires context from cultures that no longer exist, and is a collection of stories passed by word of mouth until somebody wrote them down. I'm told that there are historical records of a man matching Jesus' description, but there's no reason to believe he was anything more than a really wholesome Rabbi. The story of Gilgamesh is much older than the Bible - it's the oldest known recorded story (or so I'm told) - yet it describes a massive, world-ending flood similar to the the one in the story of Noah's Ark; but there's no reason to believe that it actually flooded the whole planet as opposed to a large region of the modern day Middle East, which would have looked a lot like \"the whole world\" back then. There's even references in the Bible to ghosts/(holy) spirits/god's breath. Turns out, those all translate to about the same in Ancient Greek (or so says my childhood minister); so if the Greek Bible came first, then translation would have been difficult. Not to mention that there are multiple words for love in Hebrew, so passages referring to love in the Bible may be easily misconstrued.\n\nIn other words, there may be grains of truth to the stories being told, but without delving DEEP into the historical context, all of these stories should never taken at face value.\n\nInstead, think about the messages they're trying to impart. Love thy neighbor. Treat others with respect and kindness.",
            "Hey throw away name user... Here's some general advice to apply to life: Someone can be right/wrong some of the time. No one is right/wrong all of the time. Most things written/spoken come from people. Remain curious.",
            "I grew up Catholic, went to church sometimes twice a week, and always thought of the Bible as metaphorical. Problem is, people aren't that bright. My uncle is a priest, and even he doesn't believe a child should he forced to be a Catholic, that as long as you follow the general concept of kindness, charity, and forgiveness, then the rest is up to you.",
            "All of the stories in the Bible are literally true, except the ones we don't like. Coincidentally, the New Testament is a lot more true than the old.\n\nWe like the one about Jesus making the ultimate sacrifice so we are washed of all sins, no matter how heinous. He's totally real and has lots of magic powers and he's coming back soon to fix everything for us.\n\nWe don't really think the rules for how much you can beat your slaves are important in this day and age.\n\nSome people still like the one where God told a guy to knock a woman up, and he jerked off instead, so God murdered him and now masturbation makes you go blind somehow.\n\nWe mostly don't like the one where if you're too rebellious and disrespectful to your parents, the whole town will drag you out and stone you to death.\n\nWe really, REALLY, don't like the one where God said all pregnant women of a certain race should have their children ripped from their bellies and dashed upon the rocks. Like, nobody teaches that one. Kinda conflicts with all the anti-abortion stuff we have such a hardon for.\n\nThat 'cast the first stone' one is real popular though, makes a nice feel-good sermon.\n\nThe basic rule of thumb is, if it feels nice and righteous in a modern, western way, it's literal. If it sounds horrifying and barbaric, it's allegorical. Fortunately, we can just change these subjective interpretations over time into whatever's most convenient, so don't worry about it or argue with anyone who takes this shit seriously!\n\nSigned,\n\nSomeone who was raised to think all this horseshit was completely real.",
            "There aren't stories about Muhammad in the quran, the quran is, in the Muslim faith a collection of teachings straight from God, it doesn't talk about Muhammad, I'm not even a Muslim and I know that. Stories about Muhammad would come from the hadiths. This post is either bait/karma seeking or you just use quran as a catch all term for Muslim teaching.\n\nRegardless, if it IS real I wanted to say there is another layer that you should try not to get confused by in that jesus and Muhammad were very real people who lived and kickstarted their respective religions. The miracles and stories are what are debated over/what people do or don't believe in. No credible historian would deny the mere existence of either of these two figures, remember that because I can imagine from your perspective you might not be aware.\n\nThat being said I still don't think this post is real and very few children would have be raised in a religious household, who pray and attend mosque, believing everyone thought it was just a metaphor because your grandmother told you to look at the moral of a story",
            "Yeah this all sounds made up",
            "You were very bright as a child if you were able to separate the good spirited messages and the literal stories made up to tie them together. It's sad that the majority of the world takes these things very factually, and it makes the existence and suffering throughout history very sad if they were just waiting for something else (higher power or coincidence) to change things, instead of being a proactive and responsible lifeform for themselves and others, which I think is what religion wants in the first place.",
            "Context is everything. Some of the stories in the bible should probably be taken metaphorically BUT moody important is the context. In order to really start to understand the bible you have to interpret it past the words. Put it in its historical context (yes there is a \"timeline\" in the bible that matches actual historical events, like there is written evidence that king what's his face lived in yesteryear). Then look at that culture. And the language it was written in. The bible has so many translations it can be good to look at the original words and their meanings. Also the writer and intended audience. Also putting it back in the bible timeline about what happens after. Some rules from the old testament are no longer expected to be enforced either because they just don't apply or because the whole jesus thing changed stuff for good. Those things all effect what we should be looking to get out of the bible. Rarely ever are there words on the page the entire meaning. So as some have mentioned parables are metaphors. Straight up it says so in the bible. Each passage in the bible has its own unique purpose and should be looked at individually as a whole.",

            "Bro what you understood is the exact way religions should be understood. Not in the literal sense. Most people are educated in religion in a very serious way which they take to heart. Don't mind them, just agree with them. You take what meaning you can get from the books and imbibe it. Plus you must understand that these books are written from a cultural point of more than a thousand years back, so some points are not relevant today. If Jesus comes today and asks to write a new testament probably would be much relevant to today's culture. So take the underlying message that you understand. Even people out there will give multiple meanings to the same story. So take the interpretation that you understand. Don't take advice on religion from others.",

            "You're probably 99% in the right about thinking what you thought.

The rumor was that grandma had an affair with a man named \"Tillery\" when she got pregnant with my father. My grandparents always denied it, but the rumors have always hung around my dad. Grandpa was a Native American man grandma was white, and dad was their only biological child (his siblings were adopted). My dad was blonde as a kid but got darker as he's aged, and he looks like grandpa, so because we all believed 100% that he was biologically grandpa's son, we decided to finally set his fears aside and prove it with a DNA kit for his 61st birthday. The kit came back today after nervously waiting several weeks, and there's a lot of matched relatives, with the name \"Tillery\". No native American DNA results at all, no one with his fathers family's name. He's crushed and I feel awful. This has to be the worst thing I've ever done to my dad.\n\nTldr: I bought my dad a DNA kit to prove he wasn't the result of an affair, and instead proved he was.\n\nUpdate: We talked about the whole thing, and he's okay with the results. He was disappointed and needed to come to grips with it. He appriciates his dad even more now, and thinks he must have known all along. He is glad to have the information for health reasons, and to be able to look into some history in a way he couldn't before.",

On both sides some of the siblings took DNA tests to make sure they matched with me in case I was some kook just trying to scam them.\n\nOn my father's side my brother, Rick, and I matched...but my brother, Steve, did not match with me.

Turns out my mom, years after their father had passed away had some information about this man that messed some people up big. To them their dad was a saint. To my mom he was absent.

Mom was totally devastated, until I reminded her that her bio dad straight up abandoned her, and her real dad loved her unconditionally. So it\u2019s a bit weird when I tell people I have 3 grandpas.

I would tell him to just focus on who raised him and who his real father is - the one that raised him. This is a horrible thing to have gone through, so he should be focusing on the positive things instead of who donated the dna. As long as he remembers that this changes nothing. His mom and dad raised him, loved him, and would have done anything for him. Who cares about the donor.",

When I had the tests done to see my ancestry it showed me a \"close relative\" I had never known. We have now found a growing group of people who share a donor. My Brother has refused to take a test thus far. It can be extremely difficult to accept that your truth is anything different than you have believed for so long. I found myself in awe of my Father, who never once treated us like we were not his children despite the number of times over the years we made him mad or discussed things that could have made him feel like telling us.

            "But... you don't know the circumstances, and things 60+ years ago were very different.  For all you / your parents know it was a situation where grandpa couldn't have kids, and someone else \"stepped in\" so they could still \"have a child together\".  There was actually an artificial insemination boom in the 1950's-  AI was very private and parents were instructed to never tell anyone, even the child.  By the 1970's sperm banking became possible, but before it was mostly a very private byo sperm/donor situation. Background checks weren't possible- so they might've had to find someone on their own and do their own consideration process.    Grandpa could've been front and center in the selection and \"interview\" process and chosen someone with similar physical features by design.  It's possible this was a very carefully designed plan to have a child together.\n\nI'm completely guessing on your situation, but a family that has one \"biological child\" and numerous adoptions... it just seems like typical 1950's parents where they don't talk about complicated topics like infertility.  \n\nBlood doesn't matter.

I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6'3\" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.\n\nThough I couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.\n\nI noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, \"Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?\" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.\n\nHer eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled \"Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!\" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. \n\nA few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said \"bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???\" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. \n\nHang in there little buddy!

Knowing how last minute I was about homework occasionally, I never put a kid on the spot by asking about homework.  Instead, while they're waiting for the copies their mom or dad wants, I ask them \"What's the coolest thing you learned in school today?\"  or most interesting, or whatever.  \n\nThey start talking about the book they had to read for literature class, or the science experiment their teacher showed them, or about the history lesson they had that day, or even they learned the Spanish word for something that they heard all the time and never knew what it meant.  If their parents are waiting for a long time, and I don't have other customers, it can sometimes open up a fascinating line of questioning.  And most parents aren't asking them this, so they have no one to tell it to except their classmates who learned the exact same thing.  They're usually very happy to share with me.\n\nAnyway, I invite you to use my question in the future.  Instead of asking them about homework, ask them what cool or interesting thing they learned recently.

I went there to renew my auto registration, and bailed as soon as I saw the line descending into the staircase. Upon leaving, this guy pulls up in his giant white truck and asks if I voted for Trump. I say \u201cfuck no, not here for that.\u201d Bad move, i guess. He proceeds to drive next to me, screaming that I must \u201clive in my mommy\u2019s basement\u201d, that he\u2019s going to \u201cget me\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re a f*cking r*t*rd\u201d, etc. while following me to my car and trying to cut me off (I\u2019m walking down the road to get to the sidewalk that leads to the side parking area at this point. He waits for me to get into my car, and then several vehicles start following me until I pull up to the police station. I have a pretty recognizable car, so I put up the security/motion cameras that I bought months ago tonight just to be safe once this all blows over.\n\nThe world/country we (I) live in is sickening.

We have a strict No Political Speech rule so I reminded him that we can\u2019t engage etc. - very politely. \n\nAnyway long story short as he was walking away he leaned in kind of close and murmured at me something I couldn\u2019t quite understand. I looked up and saw he was pointedly still looking at me to see if I saw him.

I couldn\u2019t figure it out but started googling what it sounded like \u201ctsa-coll or za-corr\u201d.

Harassment at the polls, which has unfortunately happened regularly in the past, has led to people being killed, massive corruption, and riots (both political and racial).\n\nThis is serious, regardless of political affiliation; it would be just as illegal if they were mad about you voting for Trump and then harrassed you.\n\nAgain, I urge you to report the manner to all levels if possible.

I am bisexual and thought she was really cute, but never once thought that she could possibly be into girls as well, least of all me.\n\nMy self esteem was extremely low around that age and I did all kinds of mental gymnastics to explain away all of her flirting.

There was only one other thing in the gift bag, the only thing in the universe that could be gayer than heart-shaped chocolate from one gal to another: a little paper card with some kind words on it and printed on the other side was a picture (a manga panel from the looks of it) of two girls holding hands.\n\nAnd my only thought was: \"Wow, what a nice girl! I have to be really careful not to develop a huge crush on her, since she couldn't possibly be into me! She probably felt bad for me on Valentine's day because I'm so single and unfortunate-looking.

I told her I didn't want to be an inconvenience, and that I'd find something to keep myself occupied until I came down. she simply said okay, and hugged me good night. I wandered around the festival for the next few hours.\n\nit wasn't until daylight that I realized that a grown woman had told me she loved me five times in four days' time, and the most emotional thing I said back was something like, \"I really appreciate that right now.\"\n\nI went to her campsite that morning, and she'd already gone home. by the time a week had passed, she'd left our town altogether to start bouncing around the country.\n\nthat was years ago, and I still feel dumb any time I think about it.",

            "Solidarity from this fellow useless sapphic. It's hard navigating the dating scene when our sexuality isn't regularly modeled for us not generally accepted. I came out as bi at age 9 and immediately became the classic lezbo pariah at school, and anytime I platonically complimented a girl I'd be treated like a sexual predator and a pervert. That still affects me to this day and I almost never am able to make the first move unless I know for sure that they are at least somewhat interested, such as matches on tinder, especially since I came out as trans when I was 14 and then nonbinary when I was 16.

Gum, candy you name it.\n\nShe was really flirty and ohh so cute and good looking, we talked a lot when it was just me and her in the store and sometimes when we met in town which was rather seldom. So she gave me like a thousand hints, obvious fucking hints now with hindsight and all that.\n\nSo one day i went past there to buy some gum (that was just an excuse to see her really) anyway my mother had given me a lot of homecooked meals because she found out what i ate at work, microwave food only, i mean i could bring my own food but it was a good excuse to see this girl i had a huge crush on.\n\nSo i walk into the store and buy gum, and tell her that i wont be coming by for lunch for a few days as my mother has given me a lot of homecooked meals, and she said \"no but you have to come here, i will miss you if you dont\". So i still went there every day and bought gum just to see her, and she said on day 3 or something \"you dont have to buy anything just come here and im happy\".\n\nI dont know what the hell i thought, i dont think i thought at all i couldnt really understand what she meant somehow.\n\nThen it was all those hints, which i just mistook for cold talk. \"me and my friends are going to this concert\" \"im going to see this band but i have no one to go with\" \"i heard your good at math could you help me?\"\n\nI mean how blind can a guy be right? \n\nFound out like 3 years after that she also had a huge crush on me and only stayed working there because i came by every day, she had a good education and good job prospects and just took that job for a few months to pay her bills but ended up working there for over 1.5 years.\n\nPay attention was what i learned from that.",

Sadly often times when he called I was taking a nap (I would get sleepy after a day of school and long night playing MMRPG the night before). So I missed out all the hints. I had low self-esteem at the time too. Thought there was not way a popular guy would like me. \n\nAlso, there was a time the classmates were teasing him about having interests in me, in front of me. Their conversation somehow got to the fact that he would call me after school. One classmates jokingly said \"are you sure you are not just bothering her? Hey, banana, is he bothering you?\" And turned the conversation to me. I panicked and said, \"ugh, yeah, kind of. Because you often called when I was taking a nap.\" \n\nI still remembered his sad face after that. I felt sorry for him at the time. But now I felt sorry for myself because I actually liked the guy. I don't know why I didn't realise what was happening. Years later a classmate told me I was like an iceberg back then, so cold. \n\nSo OP, I feel you. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

I was hanging with some friends, and they introduced me to a cute girl.\n\nWe ended up talking all night, and around 6 am I needed to go back to my (thankfully solo) dorm room to crash, and asked her where she lived. It was close by, so I walked her home.\n\nAfter turning around to walk back to Transy, I heard her front door open and close again. She was following me, and had just grabbed a jacket.\n\nI looked at her, and asked \"what are you doing?\" \"Walking you home,\" was her reply. I was too tired to argue that was totally unnecessary, and just said, \"ummmm, okaaaaay, i have a spare dorm bed you can sleep on\"\n\nWe get back to my dorm, and I'm clearing off the other bed, and turn around to grab my dressing gown only to discover her in bra and panties sitting on my bed.\n\nI looked at her and said, \"that's my bed.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"That's where I'm gonna be sleeping.\"\n\n\"That's fine.\"\n\n\"I sleep naked.\"\n\n\"Ok\"\n\nSo i hit the light, got undressed and climbed in bed. I rolled over to go to sleep, and she actually had to roll me back over, and say \"you know we can do it if you want to\" before I got the hint.\n\nSMH\n\nI'm now 40 and can say that I don't know if I'm any less dense now, lol\n\nEdit: oh yeah over a decade after that another girl got me to realize that she might like me, by coming over to my house, and asking my roomies and friends if she could \"borrow me for a discussion in my room\". She closed the door, and bodily *shoved* me on my bed saying \"Pants. Lose em.\"",

The first cinema we went to wasn't showing what we wanted to see and then it started to rain, so my friend bailed and she and I went to a different cinema.\n\nShe was snuggled up against me in the theater, but still, I thought she was just being friendly. We got a cab back to my place and I walked her to the end of my street as she didn't live far away. I gave her a hug, said I'd see her later and then she just went silent. After a few seconds she sighed and just leaned in and kissed me.\n\nMe: \"Ohhhh... does this mean you're into me?\"\n\nHer: \"Yes! How have you not picked up on this yet??

I was like this and for a long time just thought I was missing signals. But as I got older and a little more self aware, I realized that I\u2019d gotten most signals. However, I didn\u2019t have enough experience to know how everything might go, and that the vast majority of the outcomes, including broken hearts, would ultimately be OK. I thought there were two outcomes, 1) together forever and madly in love, or 2) lifelong hatred for someone that broke your heart or vice verse. I was scared of both of those things when I was young since both lasted forever.  This led to inaction, which is easy to pass off as obliviousness. It is also a reinforcing cycle because the more signals you \u201cmiss\u201d the more it seems like people aren\u2019t into you which creates more anxiety, which makes it easier to not take action the next time.  The first time I took action was to reach out and hold my crush\u2019s hand when she was getting emotional about something. We dated for over two years after that. She broke my heart. I grew a lot and am happier than ever now. My only regret was waiting so long to reach out in the first place.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this didn't happen today, more like two years ago.\n\nTwo years ago I was living with my ex and our roommate. We will call him Tony. So Tony comes home one day with his girlfriend Taylor after finding a cat getting thrown out the car window and rescuing it. I posted on Reddit [This Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/9pptze/my_roommate_saw_someone_throw_this_kitten_out_of/) with a picture of the cat saying \"My roommate saw someone throw this kitten out of a window on the highway. Picked her up and went to the vet. She has a paralyzed leg and a concussion. She's getting lots of love now\".\n\nThis post ends up getting some traction on Reddit and some upvotes. Taylor, the girlfriend, has a history of being batshit crazy. Screaming and slamming doors during fights and just an overall crazy girlfriend. She is on Reddit herself and sees the post on [r/Cats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cats/). She comes to MY house and starts slamming doors and screaming at me threatening to beat me up because I did not mention her in the post! All I said is my roommate found the cat, not my roommate and his girlfriend.\n\nShe got so butthurt that I didn't mention her in a completely anonymous post for fake internet points. I honestly thought she was going to beat me up over this. Tony had to calm her down and I was half scared half laughing. She is much much bigger than me and actually works out. So if she did throw a punch I would be down for the count. I've never been in a fight or even close to being in a fight until this day. Probably because I am a sane and nice person and people just don't want to hit me. \n\nShe ended up taking the cat completely and never allowed me or my ex to see or hear updates on the cat. For fear I would gain more fake internet points...from strangers....on an anonymous site. And from that day on I am considered the toxic one.\n\nAnyway, be careful what you post on Reddit. You never know what crazy person you will offend.\n\nIf you're reading this Taylor FU. Hope I get more fake internet points because of you.\n\nTL;DR: Posted on Reddit and didn't mention my roommate's girlfriend's name in the post and she literally screamed at me and threatened to beat me up for not mentioning her.",

I took her to what people my age consider a pretty nice restaurant for a date.  She didn't know where we were going ahead of time.  A few minutes after we ordered, her face turned bright red and she told me to hide.  I was confused and about to ask why when an older couple approached our table and introduced themselves as Michelle's parents.  \n\nAfter some brief, uncomfortable small-talk, her father, who had already casually mentioned twice that he was a police officer, each time placing his hand where his gun holster would be, asked me a question I didn't know people still asked.\n\n\"What are your intentions with my daughter?\"\n\nFor the record, my intentions were simply to get to know her and maybe start a relationship with her.  Unfortunately, the question caught me off-guard and I tend to (read: unfailingly) use humor as a defense mechanism.  So I replied:\n\n\"I don't know, officer.  I have Intention Deficit Disorder.\"\n\nMichelle and her mother both burst into laughter, but her father was not amused. He dragged my date away, never to be heard from (by me) again.\n\nTl;dr: date's parents happen to be at the restaurant.

Sometimes they themselves were abused by their parents and don\u2019t know another way or need a fuckton of therapy. The possibilities are endless, but if you get to know your parents biggest moments in their lives it will open up who they are and why they do what they do. \n\nThink of you and your friends biggest moments and how it has affected you/them.

Don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.\n\nI came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse Reddit while I'm taking care of my business. Most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. I can't remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about \"The Donkey Show.\" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. I wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading.\n\nSomeone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, \"What the hell, I've never seen this sort of thing before.\" So I clicked.\n\nAs weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in.\n\nI finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.\n\nShe was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, \"What the hell is this?\" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of \"blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com\". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I'm pretty sure I'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...\n\nShe said to me one day, \"I know you won't leave me for another woman, but I'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.\"\n\nI doubt she will ever let this one go...\n\nTL;DR I went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.\n\nEdit: Damn! I fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, You guys are awesome! I'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.\n\nEdit2: Just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while I was pleading my case, we kept it very G rated.\n\nEdit3: Removed the race of the man in the description so people stop getting triggered.",

        "selftext": "I'm never living this down. It's pretty standard for a lot of other sex-related posts here, but it's really destroyed me on an emotional and spiritual level. Obligatory 'this wasn't actually today but last week and I've just been thinking about it every day since'.\n\nThe first thing you should know is that I am NOT a sexual person. I barely ever have 'urges', I rarely think about anything like that, my libido is comparable to that of a fence posts'...etc. However, I started noticing that I was becoming increasingly bitter towards things like that, so I decided, 'You know what, I'm going to try and explore that side of me, maybe bring it out a little more!' and so, I did... it. I bought two sex toys (nothing extravagant, just basic, cheap little items) and a bottle of lubricant because I work smart, not hard.\n\nThings SHOULD be fine, I think to myself, I'll order them and they'll come in in a week or so, no one's expecting any packages then, so there will be no issues and they'll hand it right off to me, none the wiser!\n\nAnd then that DIDN'T happen, can you believe it?\n\nNo, what actually happened was worse, and proved to me that my dad is a monstrous, monstrous man who lives to cause me pain. Unbeknownst to me, I was still under my trial of Amazon Prime (I'd forgotten to cancel it after buying a Vulpix plush, sue me), and the package shipped and arrived... The next day. Even this should have been fine, no one in my family opens packages that aren't theirs except one little thing: MY package came in with my MOMS' packages.\n\nI didn't realize they were coming in that day, so I was still curled up in bed watching TV. When I heard the delivery truck pull up, I thought, 'oh cool' and then went back to my show. It just so happened that my mom ordered a lot of different parts for her car, and then she assumed the box was one of hers as well without checking the label since I hadn't mentioned ordering anything to her (obviously).\n\nAccording to my mom, she opened it, thought, 'oh, \\*my dad\\* must have bought something.' and then... she checked the label. And saw my name.\n\nDid she do the respectable thing and tape it back up with clear tape like nothing happened? Did she just hand it to me and walk away silently? No, she went to my dad. Because of course she did. According to my mom, she walked in, said, 'our daughter ordered sex toys and I don't know how to handle it' and my dad shot up in bed with horror. A moment later, he giggled and jumped out of bed, taking the box from her and saying, 'I want to give it to her!'\n\nHe walks into my room. I say hey to him and sit up to look at him. He tilts the box towards me to show it's contents, and then we stare at each other in silence for several seconds before he sets it down next to me with the biggest grin on his face, and then calmly walks off.\n\nI can't look my parents in the face anymore. I might actually have to move out, COVID be damned because my dad won't stop making masturbation jokes.\n\nTL;DRI ordered two sex toys and lube off Amazon without realizing I had Prime, which meant that I didn't grab my package when it was delivered. My mom opened it, thinking it was hers, and then went to my dad for help. My dad is a monster, so he came into my room and stared at me while showing me the contents of the box, then set it down next to me and walked out. I think I'm getting an apartment soon.\n\nEdit: I've seen some comments about my dad being gross or weird for this, my mother is equally as weird, and a fair share of incest comments. I want to assure you all that this is pretty normal in my family dynamic, my parents are VERY sex-positive to the point it's an ongoing joke in our house. They encourage us to explore our sexualities and are just GREAT parents. My mom panicked and went to my dad, her best friend, and as horrified as my dad was, he saw the chance to tease me relentlessly and he did what any great father would do and took. That. Chance.\n\nAnd to the incredibly odd incest comments: Your kink, not my kink. Also, I'm a lesbian and my dad is pretty much exclusively into hot moms, so. Ya know.",

If you think this is going the same way your story went, you're wrong. I lived in a trailer pretty far away from the main house where my uncle and his stepdad lived, but I usually woke up, hiked to the main house, and spent my days hanging out there when we weren't gardening or working.\n\nOne morning I woke up, and as usual, my dog had already opened the door to the trailer and was gone. NBD, she liked to wake up early, say hi to the neighbors, and then check on my uncle and his stepdad. If she wasn't with me, it meant she wasn't done with her morning check-ins on everyone.\n\nI walk up to the main house and my uncle comes out to greet me, like usual. Except this time he's got a balled up shirt in his hands and his very elderly step-dad is yelling from inside the house \"Is that Sunni? Is she here?\" while laughing hysterically. My uncle says \"Don't be embarrassed, but your dog delivered this to step-dad this morning.\" and he hands me the balled up shirt.\n\nConfused, I start unraveling the shirt until I recognize the shape of whats inside. Its my GIANT purple, tripple pleasure dildo (ass, vag, and clit, kinda like [this](https://www.edenfantasys.com/vibrators/rabbit-vibrators/triple-stimulation-vibrator?tag=96ebc38e-72d4-7329-a629-00ffb0f80f4d&pnid=77442405) but bigger) that my dog for some reason stole from my nightstand and delivered as a gift to an 87 year old man that I barely knew. \n\nFor the rest of the 5 months I stayed with them, Every. Single. Night. As I leave the main house for my trailer to go to bed, they would BOTH tell me to make sure to hide my dildos. \"Keep your dildos away from your dog!\" Every. Single. Night.",

            "Listen, I know it's embarrassing, but in the grand scheme of things, it's just a blip on the radar\n\nYour dad could've taken this so much more differently. He chose to tease you about it and I find that awesome. You might even find this funny in ten years. \n\nMy dad would've rained hellfire prophecy on my head and quite possibly kicked me out of the house. Most will scoff and think I'm being hyperbolic about that, but he literally sat my family down and told me how proud he was that I was a virgin before I got married. He truly believed my husband and I slept in separate rooms before we got married (and I totally set up the second room to look like that for when he came over). There are a lot of dads out there today who would not have taken this well so you give your dad a hug.",

        "selftext": "This involves multiple FU\u2019s and happened a year or so ago.\n\nI bought a present for my grandmother from a website for her birthday. All went well. She got the present and was delighted with it. A few months later I used the same website to order a vibrator but it never arrived. I called customer support to complain and they went over my order including making sure that they had the correct address. It was then that I realized that I had sent the vibrator to my grandmother as her address had been saved as the default one from the previous order. \n\nI called my grandmother to ask if she had received the package. She said yes she had but she gave it to my dad because she thought it was a toy for his cats that I had sent to her house by mistake. Now I don\u2019t know if my grandmother honestly did not know that this was a vibrator and really thought it was a cat toy. I believe she really had no idea what it was. She grew up catholic in a small southern town and wasn\u2019t exposed to much outside of her little world. \n\nSo now, not only had I sent a vibrator to my grandmother, she had given it to my dad. I refused to call my dad. I was not ready to have that conversation. But about a week later I got the package from my dad that contained the vibrator. We never spoke of it. \n\nYou would think this is the end of the story but it is not. Remember when I called customer service to find out why I didn\u2019t get my package? They were very nice and sent out a replacement. Where did they send the replacement? TO MY GRANDMOTHER!!! I never told them to change the address. At this point I was just too embarrassed to ask anyone about it and tried to forget it ever happened. \n\nCut to Christmas. My dad came to visit. He told me he had something for me so I went to the guest room with him. He hands me the package with the vibrator and says \u201cplease, for the love of god, stop sending vibrators to your grandmother\u201d.\n\nTL;DR sent a vibrator to my grandmother who gave it to my dad to give to me TWICE!!!",

Like confusingly big. But I digress. \n\nNot sure why but instinctively I grabbed a T-Shirt to not touch it (ew) and wrist flip double play style tossed it across the room at my cousins face asking \u201cwhat\u2019s this\u201d. \n\nIt was a master shot.\n\nHe looked up perfectly and the dong managed to hit him squarely and effectively midsection on nose slapping both sides of his face at the same time. \n\nHe shrieked in disgust and I wept laughing. \n\nSomehow I like to think grandma saw that and got a chuckle, maybe guided my hands on the toss. \n\nAnyways god bless grandmas. \n\nHappy Friday Reddit.\n\nTLDR:\nPopped cousin in face with grandma\u2019s toy after she passes away.

        "selftext": "So my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in Australia 10+ years ago. My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I\u2019d eaten too much cheese and couldn\u2019t be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I\u2019ve never actually tried to play it (it\u2019s more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it\u2019s time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what\u2019s happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don\u2019t think my mouth will ever feel normal again.\n\nTL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.\n\nEdit; woah gold! And front page! Ta!

We then searched everywhere, kept calling his name, asked our neighbors and people walking in the sidewalk if they have seen my brother but we were still not able to find him. \n\nWe then went back home, mom was going to call the police for assistance and dad to tell him to come back home to help look for my brother. \n\nJust when she was about to sit on the couch and use the phone to call the police, something moved behind the thick curtain next to the couch and the window.

My grandmother for some reason assumed he was going out to the church for this.

Grandma, thinking she was home alone, walked by the basement door while doing some cleaning in the kitchen and noticed it was unlocked. Their basement is not fully underground and has a door that leads out to the backyard, so she locked the door. \n\nWhen grandpa was done studying he came upstairs and started banging on the door because he was locked down there. My grandma was still in the kitchen cleaning so she was right by the door when he started knocking. Needless to say she thought it was the escaped criminal breaking into the house.

Did someone target their family from the signs and birthday balloons? My boyfriend was at work and texted me that his store was on lockdown because someone had lost their four year old. I knew my friend lived over a block and her little girl was about to turn four. I called her and her voice sounded fine and composed, but when I asked if everything was okay, she absolutely lost it and told me the details.

He heads back to the other house and there she is, laying curled up in the yard, sleeping soundly, and her head was laying about half a foot from where his tire had rolled when he backed up.

Gone. It's a very small apartment so I have no idea where she went. I know for a fact she doesn't have work or school, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't have anything else going on. Her phone and wallet are still home, same with her car. We look for her for a bit, then my friends decide it's no big deal she'll come back soon, but I'm worried shitless. After searching and messaging for hours, she just randomly appears sitting on the couch in the living room. I asked where she was and she said the patio to read. None of us have used that patio in our two years at this apartment, and she doesn't really read often... Anyway, that concludes my story...",

            "I was working as a summer camp counselor, and as we were going around to do a bed check on the kids, I couldn\u2019t find one of them. So I started asking the other campers where this kid was, and none of them had noticed him when they got back to the dorm. All but one of the other counselors was at a staff meeting, and so, the other guy and I are just scouring the place for this kid.\nWe\u2019re calling out his name, and going to each bunk, nothing. So I call the camp director and tell him we can\u2019t find this kid. All the staff members rush out and search the camp. The camp director runs into our dorm, throws on the light, and shouts the kid\u2019s name at the top of his lungs. The kid sits up in his bunk and just says \u201cwhat\u201d. He also sleeps with earplugs, so he couldn\u2019t hear us normally. Also, his sleeping bag covered his entire eleven year old person.\nI was so relieved that I didn\u2019t realize how embarrassed I was until the camp was over. I\u2019m going back this year, and I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes. Prepare for all sleeping bags to be thrown off of beds.",

No luck.\n\nHe went outside and searched their garden. Not there either.\n\nHe wandered up and down the road. Nothing.\n\nReturned to the house, this time both my Uncle and Aunt looked. Still nothing\n\nAfter an hour or so they called the police. They came, set up a control centre in the lounge room and started a search for her. Everyone was panicked. \n\nA couple of hours go by and by this time everyone was really frantic and definitely thinking the worst. \n\nSuddenly the pile of cushions on the couch erupted, and my sleepy faced cousin crawled out from under them!! People had SAT on that couch all day. Not one had seen her/she had not woken up! It was the most ridiculous thing ever, but everyone was so relieved. We still give her heaps about it to this day.",

            "Happened to me, but my sister not my wife. I had just moved back to help my mom out and my sister was back from school. We had put a blow up mattress in her old room for her to sleep on. \n\nAnyway, she had gone out with some friends for the night and unbeknown to us she had come home late. The thing was the mattress had a slow leak, and she didn't want to wake us up by blowing it back up. \n\nJust so everyone know if you sleep in the center of a half inflated mattress, it can look like the bed is made and no one is in there. \n\nSo in the morning I had asked my mom where my sister was, as it looks like she hadn't come home. My mom, starting to worry, started calling all of her friends, all of whom said she had come home. So now her friends from the night before are calling the hospital and trying to find her. \n\nAbout 15 minutes later she wanders down the stairs asking what all the commotion was about and why we were being so loud. This is when we figured out what happened with the blow up mattress. \n\nSo my mom takes a sip of her coffee and says \"you better call your friends, they all think your dad in a ditch somewhere\" and walks out of the room.",
            "Don't feel so bad. My boyfriend did something similar when we were first dating. It was the sweetest thing and left a good impression on my Mom and Grandma. \n\nWe didn't live together yet and had a missed connection the night before, where he was supposed to come over, but never called me. Or so I thought; he had called, but my phone never showed a missed call. So for him I hadn't returned his phone call. Then comes the next day which was my last day working at a coffee shop... although he thought my last day was the day before because I was excited for my last OPENING shift. So while I'm having my last day happily saying goodbye to regulars he's trying to call me again with no answer... he's so worried at this point he starts looking for places I could be thinking that I wouldn't be at my work place. He goes over to my grandma's and gets her involved with his worry of my absence. At this time I finally look at my phone to find multiple missed calls from him, Grandma and my mom. When I called him back he was on his way to the local hospital to see if I was there. I know it's silly but it warmed my heart to have him care enough for my safety and whereabouts. Yeah, he was terribly embarrassed, however, he became even more integrated with my family that day and we love him for it.",

            "This reminds me of when we moved to a new apartment and we couldn\u2019t find our cat in the morning. My husband woke me telling me he couldn\u2019t find her. I was so freaked out thinking she escaped and was in a new town, so she could be anywhere.\n\nWe kept looking and my husband picked up my pillow and she fell out with her fur all messed up.\n\nI guess she was scared of being in a new place and got inside my pillowcase, staying all squished the whole night.\n\nI was so relieved but also like why can\u2019t you be a normal cat & sleep on my body when you want comfort.",

I've woken up to him sleeping on the stairs and sleeping legs crossed Indian style up right on the floor? And to him standing over me, very creepy. But one time I woke up at 5am he wasn't there I talked to him at 11pm and he said he would be home around 1 am.\n\nI started running all over our small apartment, even checked under the bed lol, and my heart was racing. For whatever reason I didn't think to check my phone but after my mini heart attack I was like I gotta call his mom! Mind you I just woke up in a panic at 5am, I wasn't thinking straight.

            "It's best to not make the bed in the morning.  Throw the sheets back and leave them like that for the day so that the sheets and mattress have a chance to air.

When I came home that morning I thought I would have a few hours of sleep before I went to my party. I went upstairs to my bedroom & passed out on my bed with the door wide open.\nI passed out without plugging my phone in to charge & when I was an hour or more late my sister started worrying. She didn\u2019t have my flat mates mobile number & tried calling some of my other friends but no one had my flat mates number.  She ended up calling the IGA supermarket opposite my house & they sent one of their lovely non-English speaking employees to knock on my front door.\nMy Flatmate was in the kitchen cooking & opened the door with a massive kitchen knife in one hand & this terrified girl had to try to explain why she was there. My flatmate was convinced I wasn\u2019t home because my bedroom door was wide open & I was doing my best \u2018pile of blankets\u2019 impersonation. He told the supermarket girl I had already left & that message was passed on to my sister who subsequently started panicking.\nI eventually woke up. Got dressed & went to my party.

He was also getting a little tired and was getting by on tons of energy drink that had him feeling a little off. About an hour later he had forgotten that I moved to the back and looked over to find that I was not in the seat next to him as I had been for the last 15 hours.

During my stay I met my new doctor, and after we exchanged a few words and all that, he told me he had to put a finger in my butt to test something. It was extremely awkward but fine. After I got out the hospital I had to continue seeing this doctor frequently for checkups and he had to perform 2 colonoscopies on me. After that my condition got better & I only need to continue seeing him now for checkups.\n\nDuring the checkups over the years my family and him formed a bond. He's a cool doctor and my parents really like him and were super thankful that he nursed me back to health, so my dad offered my doctor a service that he provides for work just as a thank you. That's how both of our families eventually came together and shortly after, I started dating my doctor's oldest son (he's 23, I'm 22).\n\nThis was (and still is) completely fine. My family loves him and his family loves me, we've been together for almost 2 years now. So here's where I fucked up.\n\nHe's been staying back at his family's house since quarantine started and we missed each other so I decided to go over (I've been quarantined as well) and hang out with them. He told me to come early so we could have some alone time (both parents are Healthcare workers) so I did. We were in his room and things were getting heated and I basically just flat out told him I wanted to try anal.\n\nHe was open to it but was hesitant because of my UC. He asked me if it was safe for us to do that and without thinking, my BIG ASS MOUTH said,\n\n\"I don't know, I'd have to ask your dad. He's the only one who's been in my ass before.\"\n\nI can't explain the look on his face but it goes without saying that that completely ruined the mood. I was laughing out of embarrassment and sorrow and I really just wanted to melt into the floor and disappear. I'm sure he already knew that his dad did that stuff to me because obviously I'm his patient but I'm also sure he'd pushed that thought way into the back of his mind and I drudged it up.\n\nDinner with the family was kind of awkward and before I left he tried to reassure me and tell me that it wasn't as horrible as I thought and we could just forget about it but I don't know how I'll ever recover from that.\n\nAnd no, before anyone asks, I'm not going to ask his dad if it's safe for me to try anal with his son.\n\nTL;DR: I told my boyfriend that his dad (My doctor) had been in my ass before (Because of procedures) right before sex.\n\nedit: holy shit i went to sleep and woke up and this is at 25k?? i don't really know what to say but thank yall for living through this nightmare with me i guess and thanks to the people w/ uc/chrons (AND doctors!!) who actually gave me advice on having anal LMAO\n\nedit2 (regarding uc/chrons) : for those asking because I can't get to everyone, I had alot of other procedures done too, even a pill cam which I didnt know existed until I had it, but the one thing that finally worked for me was Mercaptopurine (6MP). I think I got lucky and it worked wonders for me and basically gets rid of all my symptoms, even though I still sometimes have those horrible stomach aches. good luck to everyone who's still struggling with it",

It was far from my house and i knew the street, so i just left home and when i got to the street i realised i didnt know the number and didnt have the invite. I messaged another friend to find out the address, but he didnt have it either.\n\nThere were only about 40 houses in the court, and it was pretty quiet, so i figured id just have a stroll and listen for music and a busy house. \n\nStroll up to the only house with any sound music going, 25 year old bloke, bottle of happy birthday vodka in hand and knock on the door. 'Hi, im iamnotjacksnipples, im a friend of Stephs here for the birthday'.\n\nMum looks at me a bit confused but pleasantly welcomes me in, and walks me through the house, past a group of roughly 15 year old, family eying me uncertainly. I start thinking maybe thats just the younger cousins and the main party is out back. Takes me further through the house to her other daughters room, who coincidentally is named Steph. 'Steph, your friend is here...' as i round the corner into the doorway i look at this 17-18year old and my face drops, 'i... dont know you' i say awkwardly, then look at the mum desperately hoping i have not just become the biggest creep on the planet bringing vodka to a 15th birthday as a bloke in his mid 20's.\n\nVery fortunately i explained who i was and who i was looking for, and the lovely mum walked me down the street to the house i was meant to be at as she knew the family. I apologised profusely again, and thanked her for her help and understanding.\n\nTl;dr. i brought vodka to a 15 year old girls party that i wasnt invited to as a 25 year old man by mistake, but mother was really understanding and helped me get where i was meant to be.",

Sounded like fun, so I show up on Monday night or whatever it was. She said they supply the guns, so I'm just empty handed sitting by myself. At some point I start to notice everyone is like 8-16, or the parent of someone who is. Turns out it's a shooting league for children.

The guys elderly parents had a general idea of where we live and did not use gps at the time. They were running late. Found out they stopped at a gathering where there were some cars. Three houses before ours. With folks eating outside. They went to the back of the house, introduced themselves and had some chips and a Jell-O shot. They asked about their 50 yo son. Said they did not know him. Asked more questions and everyone started laughing. They had a few more chips, even hugged the hosts, and found their way to us.",

She knew generally which house we were going to, but not the exact address. We got to the street and saw a bunch of cars parked outside, so we knew we were in the right place. The girl whose house we were going to just said to go through the house and meet them out back. We looked at the houses where the cars were and saw one had the front door open. We assumed that had to be the house, so we just went in and walked towards the back door. As we got to the back door, we noticed no one was outside, so we turned around and started to head for the front. As we were going back towards the front door, a woman came down the stairs and saw us leaving her back room. She asked us who we were in a very confused tone and we just quickly apologized and left. Luckily we were dressed for prom so we looked more lost than like we were robbing her house.",

I show up at the party and same deal, I figured there were some kids inside and the real party was in the back. Finally I find somebody my age who asks me \"is that alcohol?\" \n\n\"Of course!\" I say. \"Do you want some?\"\n\nThis girl becomes livid with rage as she snatches the fifth of vodka out of my hands, opens it,  and pours it out onto the ground. I'm too stunned to do or say anything.\n\n\"MOM! DAD!\" this girl screams. Turns out she's the 19/20 year old older sister of the birthday celebrant. My friend was 2-3 years younger than me, and the party guests are 3-4 years younger than him. It's a party of 15-year-olds.\n\nI literally ran down the street and out of sight. As I crept back (thankfully it was getting dark) The mom and dad were standing in the driveway attempting to catch me leaving. I hid in the bushes for a solid 20 minutes until I hear the dad on the phone calling the police, so it's now or never. They parents didn't know which car parked in the driveway was mine (thank God mine was not one of the cars blocked in by another car), and the mother temporarily steps away from blocking my car in the driveway. I creep in with my keys and unlock the car from the passenger side.\n\nAs quickly as I can I started the car and threw it in reverse. The dad immediately reacts as yells \"IS THAT HIM?\" The older daughter screams \"THAT'S HIM!\" \n\nI pulled a Dukes of Hazzard and floored the car in reverse before shifting into drive and blowing out of that suburban cul-de-sac like a bat out of hell.\n\nStill one of my more embarrassing memories. \n\nMoral of the story, if you're being invited somewhere where you know only one or two people, scope out the vibe of the party before you go waltzing in.",

This friend had never been to my house before. \n\nHe eventually arrives and tells me he initially went to the wrong house. Apparently the lad in the house he first went to must have had the same name as me as the father let my friend (and his friend which he brought with him) into the house and told them to wait in the lads bedroom as he was just taking a shower. \n\nSo my pal (and his mate) are sat in this lads bedroom. The lad enters his room from having his shower and is like \u201cwho the fuck are you?\u201d My pal is like \u201cwho the fuck are you?\u201d \n\nHow awkward must that have been \ud83d\ude02",

It was wild because I was in town looking for a friend, but ended up riding around with his little brother trying to find him. He had suggested we stop (here) knowing good and well his brother wasn't there. Not only that, but not telling me it was a bunch of teenagers. It was awkward. I wasn't there long and the damn police showed up. So Everyone is fleeing the house into the damn woods, trying to get away. Some dude looks to his left and says...Dude, why are you running? Aren't you old enough to drink? I'm like bro, I'm the only one old enough to drink. They'll accuse me of buying the shit. He thought it was funnier than I did.",

Like 80th place, 80th ave, 80th drive... We got to the house and my friends thought it would be hilarious to put their bare asses on the glass storm door then ring the bell so our friend got some pressed hams to greet them.

Our entire elementary school gathered in the gym to find out who the winners were. I did ok in school but never spectacular at that age. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sitting there and the kindergarten teacher is running through her awards. She gets to the reading award and announces the winner is iamtheb06! I\u2019m in fourth grade at this point. I did have this teacher years ago though. I\u2019m confused but I stand up and start walking toward the stage. No one clapped for me. I got to the teacher who gave me a smile and said \u201cNot you, him!\u201d I turn around and there\u2019s a little boy standing there. We had the exact same first and last names. I turn around and walk away empty handed while the other child gets his award and a smattering of applause. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 25 years since this happened but I\u2019m still embarrassed just thinking about it. I think that kid is a doctor now, he\u2019s continuing to be the superior iamtheb06.",
            "Dude. That\u2019s hilarious. Somewhat similar story:\nA few years back, my friends and I had a tradition for Christmas Eve of having a party where we all grab a drink and Mexican food and sit on the driveway around a fire, waving at lines of cars driving through the neighborhood looking at lights. It\u2019s a whole neighborhood thing. Anyway, we do this every year and my parents who are church musicians find times between masses to come over and share a drink and hang out for a bit. One year, my Dad pulls up to the corner he thinks is the house, walks inside (because there are people lounging everywhere and we\u2019re all close), walks right up to a cooler, pops open a beer, and starts wandering the house asking where his family is. He walks up to one person and says \u201cHey, so how do you know Sue?\u201d They reply, \u201cSue who?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cwell this is Sue\u2019s house right?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He apologizes like mad for stealing a drink out of the cooler but they are so friendly, they tell him to keep the drink and they help him find my friend\u2019s house, one street over. When he comes in, he tells us the story and we laugh for like 20 minutes and accuse him of being senile. But soooo like him to make friends with random strangers by accidentally strolling into their house and taking a drink.",

I said out loud to my dad \u201cDad...I think this is a private event\u201d and some kid near by just shakes his head in a yes motion. I. Was. MORTIFIED.

        "selftext": "Like many other unfortunate souls, my nonexistent dating life has me turning to the dating apps. This particular one is from Tinder.\n\nI'd been chatting with this guy a few days, and everything was going swimmingly. We had so much in common and were looking for the same things. His pictures were cute, and he didn't live too far away. All seemed well.\n\nI invited him over to grill out some burgers in my backyard. He asked if he could bring anything - I said sure bring some bacon for the burgers! He agreed and said he'd be over soon.\n\nGiven his distance, I expected him to be over in \\~15 minutes. I started the grill and seasoned the burgs. Half an hour later He messaged me, \"I've driven by a couple times and chickened out. Are you sure you want me to come over?\" Maybe a red flag, but I chalked it up to nerves and just said come on I'm hungry.\n\nSo this Hagrid lookin guy shows up, much different than his Cedric picture. That's alright, I can move past that. From the minute he walked up, and I kid you not, he did NOT take a breath. Within the first five minutes I knew his life story from his aunt who hated their grandma to his father who likes to collect taxidermy. Not a single breath.\n\nAgain I figured he was just nervous. I put the burgers on, and when they're ready he pulls out a ziploc from his POCKET with two pieces of bacon in it. He puts them only on his burger. Okay...\n\nWe sit down at the patio table to start eating (I finished my burger before he even started his - he did NOT stop talking the entire time). When we sit down, he reaches into his pocked out pulls out... a vial? It is about 2 inches tall with a cork in it. It's filled with black powder. He must have noticed me staring at it flipping between if he was about to snort something strange or build some sand-art. He said, \"Oh,\" all super casual. \"I'd like to INTRODUCE YOU TO MY MOTHER.\"\n\nI just stared at him for what felt like an eternity. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry or run. \"I like to bring her to any important event in my life. She also has ashes in this necklace I'm wearing, and in this ring I have on, and this half-sleeve tattoo is for her.\"\n\nNow, mind you, I've lost too many people close to me, and I do not judge people based on their grief cycles, we all cope differently and I respect that. But homeboy brought a VIAL of his mother's ashes, and set them on the table for our FIRST date. I simply could not.\n\nHe finally finished his burger and I made some excuse about having to clock in and finish some work... at 9:30pm. He texted me before he even got to his car and told me \"My mother really liked you, I can't wait to see you again.\"\n\nI told him I didn't feel the connection - to him, or his mother.\n\nTL ; DR Tinder date brought his mother to our first date... in an unconventional way.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened over 5 years ago. I just saw a comment that reminded me of what happened so here we go.\n\nI used to play an MMO with a bunch of people I knew IRL. Out of all of them, I was the most interested in PvP but sucked at it. One day a new guy shows up. He used to play, but stopped for a few years. Everyone starts talking about how he was basically a legend, a god at 1v1s, was one of the former top players in the game, was so inhumanly good he got mistaken for a bot, etc.\n\nI immediately developed an awkward crush on him. He heard I was into PvP and challenged me to a 1v1 where he promptly kicked my ass. Then he spent a lot of time condescendingly giving me tips on how to improve and said he would show me the ropes. Being a dork with a crush, I was so grateful for any attention he gave me.\n\nHis idea of teaching me was basically beating me over and over again. After a few days of this, he got bored and stopped paying attention to me. I was embarrassed that I was so bad and kept losing, so I though if I could impress him, he would spend time in game with me again. I spent a stupid amount of time practicing on the side and researching. I'm talking like 6 hours on weekdays and 10+ on weekends. I literally lost weight because I stopped snacking on the side and ate the minimum amount at meal times.\n\nSo after like 10 months of nonstop playing, I improved a stupid crazy amount. Managed to jokingly convince him to duel and I beat him. He thought it was a fluke and demanded a rematch. So we played again and I beat him again. He got so mad he changed his build to exactly counter mine, and he beat me. I was so happy because I thought he was into it, so I changed my build to counter his and beat him. And it turned into this stupid back and forth.\n\nI was having the time of my life. I thought I was showing off my improvement to a guy I liked. I learned theory-crafting, I learned how to play properly, etc etc. Meanwhile he was fucking raging his head off on his side of the screen. After a lot of back and forth killing each other in turns, he finally says he's done and logs off. I had no idea what happened and figured real life things was going on.\n\nAnyways, he didn't log back on for a while and I heard from our mutual friend that he quit the game. He claimed he only came back temporarily from a break and needed to focus on real life job stuff or something.\n\nI did not connect that with beating him. I just thought the timing was bad and I was sad I wouldn't be able to see him around anymore. He never logged back on again. A few months later we had another IRL hangout and he basically ignored me. Then made a few pointed comments about how he didn't like girls who were as into gaming as he was. And that girls who liked games too much were basically guys and he wasn't into guys. And that's when I finally realized he was mad I beat him.\n\nAnd he literally never returned to play again. And after a few more years, I quit gaming. And funnily enough, I heard from our mutual friend again that that's when he decided to start playing again.\n\nTL;DR I got good at a game to impress a guy I liked, beat him, and turns out he didn't like girls who were into gaming and also quit the game.\n\nEdit: Fuck I wrote this on a whim before going to sleep. To clarify, he wasn't actually that good. It's like how everyone knows that one guy who's super good at Smash, but then goes to a local tournament and gets wrecked by actual pros. He was the best out of our little circle of friends, but wasn't actually top tier in the game. And at the end of that day, I wasn't even considered close to top tier either.\n\nAlso dug up my old reddit account because I knew a bunch of people were going to call me fake. Feel free to peruse my post history to confirm my level of obsession. It's a bit sad, I definitely had an unhealthy interest/addiction. I ended up quitting cold turkey and haven't logged back on in years. Sorry to all my old teammates, I literally left them with a \"see you next time\" and vanished off the face of the planet.\n\nEdit2: I didn't quit the game because of him. I played for several more years after and got back into PvP and shot up the ranks because I went from a keyboard turning skill-clicker into someone who could actually play. Did weekly tournaments for a bit, got good enough to see the occasional pro players in my queue and formed a little team with other people around my level. The game itself went through a ton of bad balance patches and a ton of people left. I ultimately left because the gamemode was \"dying\" and I realized it was making me depressed and more angry and toxic the more I played.",

How is this a fuckup?\n\nIf there was a girl that kicked my ass at a game I loved, I would probably develop a crush on them because they share the same love of the game that I have for it. It's a significant interest that I'd have and they have just as much interest or more than I do. Plenty of people have met their future spouses on EQ or WoW. Games like that are a huge time investment and it's a common interest that can serve as a foundation for a relationship.",
            "BF and I bonded over WoW when we first got together. We made characters to compliment each other and leveled and have ended up playing on and off for our whole relationship.

A while ago I decided to go the DPS route so now we\u2019re kind of competing on that, too. I was a priest for many years. As a demon hunter, I\u2019m faster and hit harder which is more fun than I thought it would be and I worked really hard on my vacation week to learn a new way of playing from what I was used to as a priest. \n\nYou absolutely dodged a bullet with this guy. He was just mad you were better than him. It had nothing to do with girls liking gaming and he probably didn\u2019t really like you to begin with (no offense to you). He just wanted to be superior and was butt hurt that he couldn\u2019t lord over you anymore.",

            "Just another toxic gamer. \n\nPro tip for relationships. Gaming is a very very good tell of character. People let their guard down, get immersed, and react to what\u2019s happening. If your fella doesn\u2019t rage and scream at failure or other people it\u2019s a good sign that he\u2019s a decent guy. See how he treats others online. How he approaches games. Puzzles. Difficulty. Failure. So much can be learned. \n\nI was both flattered and humbled when my GF commented on how she loves how I am with games... confused I asked her to elaborate, and she says it\u2019s adorable that whenever I die or fail I just laugh about it with a smile joke around and try again. And with puzzles I get super invested and she can see my brain ticking working it out. And that I have the exact same personality in real life, and it\u2019s how she knew I was great when we dated. That was super sweet. But I thought about it. I love playing rogue likes and also difficult games, love the soulsbourne games to death and always crank games to hard. That\u2019s how I like them. I\u2019ve definitely been stressed and such but my enjoyment is still always higher than that. She was right, and it was really nice to see that she caught that.\n\nI don\u2019t play many multiplayer games but when I do I\u2019m always support. Like, medic, buffer, engineer etc. She says I\u2019m just as compassionate IRL and she loves it.  And I love gaming with her. \n\nEven my friends I can see their personality shine through the games. That one twat in halo or whatever who rages and screams and says there was lag and other BS turns out to be THAT guy in the group who blames everything on everyone. \n\nThe one who always picks the \u201cbest\u201d character or exploit is the same one trying to cheat real life and is self centred. \n\nThe one who gets the group together is the sociable one.\n\nYou don\u2019t realise it but you shine through your games. Toxic players are shitty people. If you are a parent and you see your child acting up with a game, you need to address it.",

He put himself on pedestal, wearing a pretty little prince crown and you took that crown and reduced his pedestal to dust with it.\n\nI've been a gamer for a long time now. Used to code on a Spectrum 128k and for almost two years I hid the fact that I was a girl because of the shit talking that happened around me.The first time I turned my mic on, I'd been in a GW guild for about six months and no one knew I was female. I then went on to run a pretty damn good guild in WoW and met some of the most awesome people ever. But there were always a few that couldn't believe girls played a game because they enjoyed the challenge. And the learning. And that they weren't just a pair of boobs on a life support system.\n\nIn some ways, dealing with the kind of rubbish that a few idiots spew helped me to gain confidence. I could be assertive and I could definitely say \"Nah mate, your Dad's better\" if someone decided to send pervy whispers. It also opened my eyes to the startling number of girls who, sadly, prey on nice guys for attention. And gold. And items.\n\nOne of the biggest loot drops in my guild turned out to be a recently joined female member who was, uhhh.. \"giving away experience\" and not in any kind of liberated good way. More of a \"If you don't do this for me... I'll post screenshots of private PM's\".\n\nThere's a lot of awful people in the world, both online and offline and sometimes people do silly things like escape from the best of themselves online. Like playing an RPG from the darker side of the moral colour chart.Importantly though, there are awesome people who become genuine friends for life through games, the joy of shared experiences and silly banter.\n\nI hope that one day, if you want to and enjoy it, that you game again and you don't let that experience put you off forever.

Still like it, but used to be the walking-pokedex kind of person to stay up and watch national tourneys at ass-oclock in the morning if I had to. I was decent and came up with some strategies for myself a while back that became pretty mainstream eventually.\n\nAnyways, my first boyfriend ever and I had first started talking years prior specifically about competitive pokemon, so after we'd been together a few months he said he wanted to have a battle on X date (so we'd both have time to prepare our teams). I figured since he knew I liked competitive, he'd also have at least a well-rounded team, and so I designed one knowing some of his favorites, expecting he'd do the same.\n\nDay comes, and I don't even complain when he admits that most of his team is cheated, since this is a just-for-fun battle. Turns out he didn't think to cheat EVs on though, and drama ensues.\n\nBattle 1: I play exactly like I would play a Showdown match. Type advantage swapping, etc. I didn't use the item shooter because I didn't care for it at all, and didn't need it, but he did use it. I wipe the floor with him, it isn't even funny.\n\nHe says it's cheating to \"keep swapping like that\" for type advantage, and says we have to battle again with me not switching so much. Okay.\n\nBattle 2: I don't swap, I think at all, just let him knock them out before moving to the next so he can't accuse me of type swapping. I do use the item shooter in this battle because he used it in the last one, so clearly not cheating, right?\n\nWrong. He says using the item shooter is, in fact, cheating. I call out the fact that he used it before and he said \"only because you cheated first.\"\n\nWe had I think 2 more battle, but I don't remember what offense I caused in the 3rd one to make us have the 4th, until I eventually just gave up because it was no longer fun to be at such a massive handicap just so he could feel like he was better than me at pokemon.\n\nAnyways he broke up with me like 3 days later citing something that I did to a mutual friend that, upon asking said mutual friend, neither of us remember, so.

        "selftext": "So a little backstory here I guess. My first girlfriend would always take of my glasses before we made out (she wore glasses, too, so we sounded like two lustful wineglasses otherwise). She did this every time, so eventually it just became a habit for me. Things are getting heavy? Better take off my glasses. It went that way for years, and I never really questioned it. I just assumed it was normal.\n\nThe thing is, I have pretty bad vision. I'm not legally blind by any means, but I certainly can't read any kind of text without glasses unless it's inches from my face. Everything goes blurry immediately. That's not a big deal though if you're getting it on with someone--that's 50% by feel, 50% by sound, right?\n\nWell I recently learned otherwise. I was seeing this new girl, and she jumped me one time with a surprise sexy encounter. We were ripping our clothes off so fast that I didn't have time to take off my glasses. And I'll tell you what: it was like hitting the HD button on pornhub after you've been watching nothing but scrambled VHS tapes for your entire life. Everything snapped into focus! It was amazing! I could see everything! Nipples! Goosebumps! The sweaty wet spot on the bed!\n\nIs this what it feels like for normal-sighted people? Is your sex life just a walking, talking porno? Do you not look down and say, \"wow, what a sexy brown blob\" but instead say \"wow, NVidia did a great job this year!\"? This is absolutely life-changing, and I need anyone who reads this and wears glasses to take a long hard look at themselves, and then do it again but this time while wearing your glasses. Hopefully you can avoid my mistake.\n\nTL;DR: wear glasses during sex and turn your pp into a 1080pp",

            "I'm not as blind as you, but im pretty blind and didn't get my first pair of glasses until 22. The amazement of looking a tree and seeing individual leaves rather than a green blob was something else",
            "This is the same as me, but with my hearing aids. I used to take the off before sex, the one time I forgot, it was incredibly hot hearing the sounds of my partner with more clarity rather than it being muffled or me missing something she says. Now it turns me on more hearing her, and sounds I didn't realise we make. The negative, I realises how much sound the bed makes.",

            "\"We sound like two lustful wineglasses\" is the best way to describe that. My partner and I have a inside joke of just looking at each other during close moments and saying \"clink\", because we kept hitting our glasses when we went to kiss.",

            "I used to leave my glasses on, but the first time I went down a lady... things were going great, and after a while, she started to respond to my efforts... enthusiastically.\n\nAt the time I was 19 years old and on leave during basic training. The military was covering all medical expenses, including eyewear. All you needed to do is to explain how you broke your glasses.\n\nIt never occurred to me that I could have lied and told them I sat on them...\n\nThe medic was laughing so hard she almost pissed herself.",
            "Bruh I felt this lol. I too have terrible vision and have coke-bottle glasses like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys. My glasses will come off if we're making out or I go down then they'll stay off. If it's more like a quicky, they'll stay on. Definitely a big difference.",
            "My and my boyfriend had been together for a little over 3 years before we realized he has very poor vision. When he got glasses I was extremely nervous that he would see me in full vision and find out I was actually ugly LOL",

            "I hate when I can't wear my glasses, because everything goes shrink without glasses (not so much blurry, as one would assume, but smaller like looking through the binoculars the wrong way).\n\nSex is definitely something where I wish to have a better vision. Swimming is another one, fuck walking barefoot on the beach without glasses.",
            "Well lucky you. My wife only does the deed with the lights off. So I'm in there like Stevie wonder.",
            "I am getting laser eye surgery in 2 days and I CANNOT wait to have sex in HD.\n\nThat and also swimming, waking up and seeing your partner clear and not a blurry moving mass, falling asleep during impromptu naps and not waking up with contacts stuck to your brain etc etc\n\nExciteddotcom!",
            "I am not that bad thankfully, but I have had similar revelations since I started wearing my glasses to bars. Turns out I am a lot better at pool than I thought",
            "Many of the comments here talk about using glasses in other areas of your life and how dramatic it was for people to see individual leaves, etc. So I thought I'd share.\n\nAt 68+ I had cataracts. Even though I had glasses since I was 17 (eventually trifocals), they finally could not help me. For those that don't know, cataracts cause your lenses to get 'cloudy'. Since my 50's it's been getting worse and worse. As it progressed slowly, I didn't really notice the change as it occurred. But finally I couldn't really use a computer (even with glasses) without zooming in.\n\nSo 3 years ago I had cataract surgery. You get one eye done at a time. It's important to note that since your lens is replaced with an artificial one, your vision improves immediately. You just have to wear very dark lenses for a few hours.\n\nSo while my wife is driving me home, I'm looking around and start talking like a 5 year old. \"Ohhhh, look at those trees, I can see every leaf. Ohhh, that street sign say Lombard street. Ohhh, that billboard says ......\" My wife was cracking up.  Later when driving at night I realized that I could distinctly see the different light and dark areas on the moon. It was a crazy emotional moment.\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n1. You can get corrective cataracts which gives you the vision I describe. Just getting cataract replacement doesn't improve your vision except for the cloudiness.\n2. In the U.S. and you are over 65, Medicare pays for the cataract surgery. If you request correction along with the cataracts, you pay the difference.\n3. My lens included UVA & UVB protection built in.\n4. Do not, I repeat, do not watch YouTube videos of cataract surgery. You'll never have the guts to get it done.\n5. Not to gross anyone out, but even at 70 years old, I can confirm you can appreciate your partner that much more.",
            "I sometimes leave my glasses on for a treat! Your vision sounds similar to mine - it's great when everything is in HD. \n\nI don't like contact lenses so wouldn't get them for the purpose of sex, and glasses can get really dirty, but it's still fun to keep them on sometimes.",

You can see my face!!\" She then explained to me that her ex-husband wore glasses and always took them off for sex, but the dude was virtually blind without them, so he could NEVER see her face during sex.

        "selftext": "**TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**\n\nPreface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won't be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nI work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It's safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.\n\nI have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. \n\nAs a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: \"Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!\", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.\n\nRecently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.\n\nAbout an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.\n\nOne of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. \n\nThe afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.\n\nEventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.\n\nAnyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?\n\nYeah...\n\nSo it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...\n\nSo yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.\n\n**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out. ",

        "selftext": "This did, essentially, happen today.  \n\nA couple weeks ago my 5 year old daughter found a black widow mom and her egg sack.  She wanted to look at it, so I very carefully scooped it up into a jar, twisted on the top and went around it with duct tape for good measure.  She begged to let them hatch so she could watch them, and this seemed to be decent science homeschooling, after which point I planned to put them in the freezer for a somewhat humane death.  What\u2019s the harm, I thought?  They are sealed up well.  \n\nWell guess what, they weren\u2019t.  The jar I used was plastic and something some toys had come in.  There were small HOLES in the bottom and sides, barely visible.  Smaller than a hole punch, but plenty big for a baby black widow.\n\nSo today we\u2019re going about our lives, when she notices a tiny spider.  I kill it.   Then there\u2019s another.  Then another.  I start to think....oh no.  I grab the jar to find the egg sack has indeed hatched, with hundreds of tiny little venom weapons.  But I see with the relief the duct tape is still there, there\u2019s no way they could have gotten out.  Til I look at my hand.  IN THE MOMENT I WAS HOLDING THE JAR ONE CRAWLED ON TO MY HAND.  At which point I noticed the holes.  I screamed, said some words that definitely shouldn\u2019t be said in front of a 5 year old, and wanted to fling away the jar but managed to hold on to it in fear that tossing it would further distribute its murderous contents.  \n\n\nNow my child is playing outside while I furiously vacuum and clean and wash every surface.\n  G-d have mercy.\n\nTL;DR Thought I was showing my child some cool nature in action, ended up with nature all over my bedroom, where nature means hundreds of baby black widows.\n\nEdit:  here are pictures of the ones that didn\u2019t escape https://imgur.com/gallery/sF1PERS\n\nAnd my daughter\u2019s rendition of them:  https://imgur.com/gallery/2fJCmq3\n\nFurther edits:\n\nThank you so much to the kind people who Venmoed me money for the exterminator who am I now definitely going to get to come tomorrow!

We\u2019ve raised lots of other insects in jars with no escapees, so I guess I got a little overconfident about the status of jar impenetrability.  Yep.  I FUed.\n\n\nEven Further edit: \n\nWhile most people are upset that I didn\u2019t immediately KILL IT WITH FIRE and I stupidly brought it inside, enough people are upset about my inhumane treatment of the spiders that I wanted to comment on it.  They were originally on the porch, not far out in nature, and given how dangerous they were, I felt I was making a choice between killing them then and there or later.  I don\u2019t normally have the ability to drop what I\u2019m doing in a day a drive out to the middle of no where, far away from other humans, to release dangerous spiders.  The observation option, if I had done it correctly, seemed like it would at least offer the opportunity to see them hatch, which does make a pretty educational impact on young kids, I think, more than another YouTube video.  I do not torture animals for fun, I\u2019m a vegetarian and hold that life is sacred.  Besides mosquitos and dangerous insects I don\u2019t kill things.   I get why compassionate people were upset by this.  \n\nThe spiders are still alive, not frozen, and now, since she\u2019s Reddit internet famous, today I WILL drive to the middle of nowhere and release the mom spider to go about her spider life far away from people.  If anyone wants to suggest a name for her, go for it, and she will live in hated/beloved infamy.\n\nIn the true spirit of the internet, I\u2019m sure this will manage to displease everyone, the people who are upset I did this in the first place and will exterminate the inside ones now, and the substantial number of people who want me to KILL IT WITH FIRE  and will think it\u2019s crazy to release the mom ;-). Sorry bout that!  I\u2019ll post a picture of the release later, if I get a chance, and everyone can sleep with their preference of more soundly / less soundly for knowing she survived.",

It kept happening every few days and I then realized there must be a spider trying to live rent free. I cleaned and bug bombed my entire room to make sure nothing would be there. Shortly after this, I went out on a short trip, just 3 nights and when I came back home and into my room, I see little black things everywhere. Upon closer inspection they were little spiders. There were hundreds of them coming from a vent in the tv when I started spraying. Ended up getting a wet microfibre and wiping them all up. Messy.

We took the sac out and put it in a (clean) spice jar. After a couple weeks, she laid another sac. When we went to take it out, I suggested that we just toss the old egg sac in the garbage and reuse the same container. The first sac was looking sort of moldy, so I figured it wasn't viable. My parter wasn't comfortable with that (it was a bad suggestion) and we agreed it would be cooler to burn it.\n\nWe stuck the old sac to the end of a qtip, and at the last moment had the idea of putting it over a small baking tray, just in case it burst into flames.\n\nFlame applied, and to be honest it didn't light very well. Just sort of singed on one end and a little crackle. We joked about how funny/terrifying it would be if it exploded into a million baby spiders. Haha.\n\nThen. A little spider crawled out. And another. And another. Oh shit.\n\nWe shoved the partially burnt egg sac back in the jar and quickly squished the 5 or 6 that had already escaped. \n\nThank dog we attempted this little pyro experiment over top of a tray.\n\nSo yeah, all week when I've been on work conference calls I'm staring at my little spider babies.

He marches to the front, and begins his slideshow, entitled \"The Case for Contraceptives.\"\n\nIt's fuckin great. He tells a story about bees, who, if they want to get some sweet, sweet nectar from flowers without spreading any of their \"pollen\" around, need to learn to wear little \"booties\" on their \"feet.\"\n\nI laughed through the whole thing and then turned to the class to discuss the presentation's effectiveness. But several students had blank expressions.\n\nFinally, one of the students, Goober\\* (this student and his nickname is pure gold, but that's another story), raised his hand and said, \"Miz Holt\\*, whut's a...cont-ruh-ceptive?\"\n\nI started to smile but stopped as I realized he was serious. I paused and and remembered my life before college, shuttled in a bubble between homeschooling and church and youth group.\n\nWe had a brief discussion about contraceptives then and there.\n\nThe next day, my classroom behavior under review, I was warned I was under unofficial probation (everyone at this university signs up as an \"at-will employee,\" meaning we can be fired at any time for any reason).\n\n\\*Names changed to protect the guilty\n\nTL;DR - I nearly lose my job at a conservative Christian university after explaining what contraceptives are to a few of my confused students.\n\n**Edit:** Many people are asking why I choose to work at such an institution.

Until education about safe sex, consent and access to birth control methods becomes part of their philosophy, because that's what will actually reduce abortions.

You were not condoning sex before marriage or sex for any reason outside of procreation.

            "This reminds me of a time I was playing Civ 4 with a friend. He was beating me pretty thoroughly and kept offering increasingly more rediculous offers for peace. Eventually he sent me an offer wherin I would cede every city but my capital to him in exchange for an end to the war. \n\nNow at this point we'd been playing a while. It was late and I was ready to be done. So I thought, fuck it, what do I have to lose? Much to his surprise I accepted the offer. \n\nThen, because of the way occupations of cities worked in Civ 4, his civilization became unbelievably unhappy. Within two turns, his mighty empire began to spinter as cities descended to anarchy and, with him unable to use his battered army or war weakened economy to counterbalance the unrest, soon left him on equal footing with my suddenly relatively stable city. We called it a draw at that point because neither of us wanted to suffer through rebuilding the chaos we had just unleashed on the world.",

So we turn to our friend and ask her if she wants to trade a single useless card for all the cards in our hand.

We have fallen into the expectation of instant gratification and \"either it works or it doesn't\".  Yes, chemistry has a lot to do with it, but so does commitment and learning how to truly love - putting your feelings aside and learning to be unselfish, forgiving, compassionate, kind, patient, and humble.  That's why it's such hard work - because it requires going against the human urge to emotional reactions and satisfaction of self.\n\nIt's always refreshing to see that some people still understand this and put it into practice every single day.  \n\n\nBut this should also serve as a lesson why you should find someone who has the same values and priorities you do, not just someone who excites you.

        "selftext": "This just happened last week. I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. \u201cBeth\u201d comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. \n\nI am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  \n\nWe get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says \u201cOh. My goodness, what happened?\u201d  So I respond as a joke \u201cEh, she got out of line\u201d.   \n\nI know!  It\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I\u2019m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It\u2019s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. \n\nHe comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor\u2019s office to talk.  \n\nThere is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth\u2019s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. \n\nThe police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. \n\nThe police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. \n\nWe get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  \n\nThe county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don\u2019t need to make for this week.  I can\u2019t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I\u2019m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  \n\ntl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  \n\nEdit: Spelling\n\nEdit 2:  Update\nThank you for the gold kind strangers.\nWow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.\n\n1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.\n\n2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.\n\n3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  \n\n4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for \"clean up\".  It turned out to be nothing.",

            "Similar thing happened with my mom one time but with less consequences. We were in a grocery store when I was about 7 or 8 and I told her I was hungry and asked if we could get Burger King across the street. She replied, as she always did, \u201cwhat day is it? Tuesday? No you don\u2019t get to eat on tuesdays.\u201d \n\nI pretended to be super sad like I always did and she would order me an icee or something and it was all well and good. It was a running joke we had. Single mom and all that, we had a unique relationship. Well this particular day, some middle aged woman behind us in line flipped her shit and got on her soapbox about how she was a defender of children everywhere blah blah blah and called the cops. She made a huge scene in the grocery store and the manager got involved and everything. \n\nLong story short, my mom works for the police department and one or two of the officers who lived near us would watch me from time to time while my mom worked her other jobs. One of the female officers was the person who responded to the call and immediately busted up laughing when she saw it was us. The lady continued to create a scene for about 5 minutes before storming out, leaving her cart of groceries in the line where she stood.",

One day I'm over at her place and she's making a sandwich in the kitchen and I was in the living room.  I hear a crash and run over to find her on the floor with a 1 inch knife wound in her cheek with blood pouring out everywhere.  She gets up after a minute and we drive to the urgent care where I had to explain that she accidentally stabbed herself in the face.  Nobody really believed me, and they grilled me hard but never got the police involved, luckily for me.",
            "Receptionist doesn\u2019t speak to anyone else and just immediately calls the cops/CPS? Not the office manager, a nurse, or the doctor?

Not only is this wrong on so many levels,  it's also illegal. \n So my friend forbids his daughter from seeing boyfriend,  takes away cell phone, computer  gaming systems, etc.... and drives her to and from school.\n His daughter, being the shit that she is, calls the police and says \"my daddy touched me\". \n My friend gets arrested, can't go home until it all goes to court, and when it finally does go to court, she says that she lied because she was mad.\n Even after she said she lied, he still wasn't allowed to go home for another 90 days and he had to hire a lawyer to keep his name off the sex offenders list.

My dad lifted her to his chest, and she used her nails to scratch his chest to the point of bleeding (she commonly would use this to hurt me when she was mad). \n\nMy dad was pissed and bleeding when he dropped her off at the gym daycare, understandably so, and the childcare worker called CPS on him. I don't remember it, but apparently I was pulled out of kindergarten and stripped to my underwear by a case worker to examine abuse.

However, that's also a part of the zero tolerance policy when it comes to reporting child abuse. When in doubt, report. \n\nWas she a mandated reporter? Maybe, I don't know and neither do you. I was an intern in a hospital in NY and was a mandated reporter despite rarely coming in contact with patients. If you look up mandated reporters in NY hospital personnels engaged in admission are mandated reporters. \n\nCould she have discussed this with the doctor? Yes, but she might not have to.  It would be wise to do so, but mandated reporters can report straight to the SCR.\n\nWhat happened to OP is very unfortunate, but everyone should hold their judgment of the receptionist unless we have more information.",
            "i cant really fault the receptionist for looking out for your dauhter.  imagine if it wasnt a joke and she didnt report it.  i guess maybe she could have told the doctor and he could evaluate before getting authorities involved?  tough situation, glad u sorted it tho",
            "Maybe it\u2019s already stated and not sure how it works where you\u2019re from, but in some places there may not be a lot of leverage for someone to use their judgement. Im in Canada, had a similar thing arise last year when the staff at summer camp called children\u2019s services on me. Long story short, my young daughter heard some older kids talking about choking, and gleaned that this involved hands on the throat. She recalled that I had placed my hand on the back of her neck when speaking to her recently and said something that likely sounded like \u201cmy dad does that to me\u201d.  Like you, I was frustrated and the investigation obviously turned up no concerns. It was really driven home though that there was very little leeway for those staff to use their judgement and that the call was absolutely required by law. They are also discouraged from asking any further clarifying questions because doing so could be detrimental to the investigation later. ",
            "It was fathers day and I was about 7 years old. Mind you, it's just my dad, my two sisters, and me (the youngest). Well my sisters had a fight and I was in my bedroom playing Super Mario on a Saturday morning while my dad was mowing the lawn. One of my sisters runs into the room and hides under the covers of my bed. My eldest runs around the corner in a fit of rage and throws a plastic eraser in the shape of a frosty that you got at the time in the Wendys kids meal. Pretty much cracks open the back of my head and im bleeding. My dad takes me to the ER. I needed stitches but right before that happened, my dad left the room and a cop comes in and asks me what happened. I just said \"stupid Jenny!\". Apparently the hospital called the police thinking it was child abuse. I was too young to realize what was happening but now that im older, I can see just how frightening that experience must have been for my single parent dad. ",
            "I'm having a hard time believing this one.  You can't just call the police and have someone's kids taken away.  Wouldn't she, at a minimum, have to have some sort of injury for this to even be a reasonable act by the police?

Not because it\u2019s my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as \u201ca Christmas gift\u201d to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn\u2019t think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).\n\nAnyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it\u2019s working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say \u201cmore\u201d and \u201call done\u201d and \u201cdrink\u201d! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. \n\nWell today with my husband out of town, I didn\u2019t feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn\u2019t hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs \u201cdrink\u201d. And every time she wants my attention, she signs \u201cdad\u201d because apparently the slightly different sign for \u201cmom\u201d isn\u2019t as fun for her. Ok, whatever. \n\nWell I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they\u2019re looking over at us and snickering. I\u2019m like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It\u2019s fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of \u201cshe\u2019s calling you \u2018dumb\u2019 and telling you she wants to drink alcohol\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for \u201cdrink (non-alcoholic beverage)\u201d and \u201cdrink alcohol\u201d and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would\u2019ve done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. \n\nTL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing\n\nETA: Thanks, everyone! I\u2019m glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!\n\nAlso please note that I literally searched \u201cbaby sign language\u201d and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all.

        "selftext": "We are in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I got a phone call last night saying that I didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.\n\nWe decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.\n\nThe bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.\n\nBecause he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.\n\nWhile he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.\n\nI now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell.",

I told him my oil comes out really quickly. The bottle has a twist-off lid and a separate seal beneath which sticks into the top to prevent leakage (picture a twist-off with a cork of ~1.5cm diameter beneath). The third time he tried slapping out the oil the cork thing popped out. There was a flood that covered my back and ruined our sheets.\n\nThe other time was with lube. I spent a fair bit of one paycheck on a big ass bottle of the brand of anal lube I like. We were getting into it, forgot to seal the top, and left the bottle on the bed. We went through a bottle that should have lasted us months in about two weeks. The sheets were also in a bad way once again.\n\n\nSuffice it to say, we now have a dedicated sex blanket or two.",

        "selftext": "So this actually happened today. A few hours ago.\n\nSo a friend set me up with this woman because she thought we have similar hobbies and a similar dark humor. We met today the first time for a coffee/tea. We were actually having a good time, or at least I thought so. We clicked right away and had a lot to talk and laugh about.\n\nAfter like an hour she suggested to pay our drinks and go somewhere else for launch and I happily agreed. As we were about to pay our drinks she started searching her purse for her wallet and put various objects on the counter because she seemed like to have a bit of a mess in her purse. One of these objects was a pepper spray. I casually mentioned after leaving the coffee \"Id consider getting a different pepper spray if you plan to defend yourself. This one is quite useless.\"\n\n*For a bit of context: I used to test various of pepper sprays and tear gas in the military. We were stupid and young but it was also kind of thrilling. And the product she had was by far the worst/weakest we tested. I just recognized the bottle because it was so bad and thought I should let her know that this is probably not the best option to go with. But she obviously didnt know about that because, well, we just met an hour ago.*\n\nAfter this comment our conversation kind of died and she suddenly had a work emergency and had to go. I took me a few minutes until I realized that my comment was beyond creepy without any context. I am definitely not used to meet new people. I hope Ive not traumatized her.\n\nTLDR: Creeped out a woman Ive only met an hour before by telling her her pepper spray would be not very effective if she intended to defend herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Its all good. She called me, she apologized for running off, I apologized for my weird comment and we are going out again. Yey. Ill try to not do any weird comments about her precautions again.\n\nEdit2: Thanks for blowing this up. She found the post and now we are sending each other screenshots of weird/funny comments. Thanks for the entertainment.\n\nEdit3: I am not an expert for defense spray. We were just some bored soldiers with some examples. And this one was outstanding mild/bad, that is why I have recognized it. So dont ask me for pepper spray advice.",

        "selftext": "So I'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally I was watching the match on my living room little did I know there was another match going on my neighbours house. About ten minutes into my game, I started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.\n\nBetween the game and the distance between us I really couldn't distinguish any words, so I just raised the volume of my TV and kept watching. During half time I got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so I lower the volume of the TV as I microwave some popcorn.\n\nBy this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as I take the popcorns out of the microwave I hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so I went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case I had to call the cops of something. Now I have two dogs so I didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so I brought it with me.\n\nSo here I am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. For the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. By now I could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so I thought. Suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as I gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.\n\nNow try to see this from their perspective. They've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. This got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.\n\n\"ENJOYING THE SHOW YOU \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*!?\"\n\nI honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. They both flip the finger at me as walked inside \"Can YOU BELIEVE this fucking guy!?\" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.\n\nWhen I got inside I was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.\n\nEdit: I know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments I've gotten.  You all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! Also shut out to all the Cruz Azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game I was watching!\n\nEdit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a TIFU and it probably isn't a dramatic one I'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.\n\nTL;DR My neighbours were having a big fight while I was watching a soccer game, I went out to check while she slapped her husband as I was holding a big bag of popcorn. My nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",

It looked like he was going to start getting violent, so we tried to deescalate the situation. I don't remember how the conversation went, but we talked him into coming up to our place to let him vent a bit. \n\nLots of drunken conversation. Only part that stuck in my mind was that he was a big Gordon Lightfoot fan. We told him that we honestly had never listened to his stuff. He went on about how Gordon was a fantastic musician and was underappreciated by everyone and was wrongly mocked and disparaged. This went on for some time when he finally decided that he was going to bring us some Gordon Lightfoot music. He went wandered back to his house(we didn't try to stop him since he had calmed down and we had seen his girlfriend/wife leave) and a few minutes later brought us a Gordon Lightfoot cassette. He told we needed to listen to this and then he went to go sleep it off. \n\nA few weeks later he came over to get the cassette. He was confused as to how we winded up with it, but happy to get it back. I don't think we ever talked him again.\n\nI never did listen to that album.",

Nothing physical just screaming and carrying on. They were on first name basis with the cops in town.  You call the non emergency number (911 only if throwing shit started) and as soon as you said where it was they would ask if they were at it again.\n\nBy the 2nd month of this we pulled the lawn chairs out, popped popcorn, and enjoyed the show as the cops show up get the dude to leave only to see him come back as soon as they left, steal the distributor cap, and try to outrun the cops in the most obvious vehicle, when everyone knew he lost his licence for DUI. It was better than COPS and more entertaining than most things.\n\nIt got way too quiet after they finally broke up when she was caught cheating with his best friend.  And revealed the youngest was not his publically. He finally snapped and punched the guy and was banned from the property.  She moved out shortly after and lost custody of both kids to her parents.\n\nYou did not fuck up. You just enjoyed the reality show live and in person.",
