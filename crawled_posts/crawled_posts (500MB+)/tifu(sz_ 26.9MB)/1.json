        "selftext": "\nA little back story; when I first started having sex I researched into ways to be better as I was a little stiff and pretty much had no idea what I was doing. I read online that you can play music and match the rhythm in order to put on a better performance.\n\nI searched love making songs and started slowly creating a playlist in which I was comfortable matching the rhythm.\n\nThere are a few songs to my playlist. However there is one song in particular, which actually happens to be my favourite, that my girlfriend hates and says turns her off in a major way. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why it has taken her two years to tell me she hates that song, it\u2019s a good love making song with good rhythm. I feel the way I fucked up is I could have possibly asked her previously if she likes the playlist or any songs she\u2019d like to add/change. But to leave it for two years thinking our sex life is great but in her eyes has just been ruined by my music has left the whole situation feeling awkward and I\u2019m a bit annoyed. \n\nI pretty much played this tune every single time so the amount of times she must have not been enjoying it, when I thought the complete opposite is annoying but also embarrassing in ways. \n\nNot to mention my previous partners, however they never complained about the song so maybe it\u2019s just her?\n\nIt\u2019s fucked up the relationship tbh because sex feels awkward now. The other day we were having sex with no music but I was still thrusting to the tune playing in my head. She recognised this and asked me to stop.  \n\nI thought this song was perfect and I always thrust along with the tune and feel it gives me the perfect rhythm for doing the deed to. I usually bust to this song and find it devastating she hates the song. \n\n[the song itself](https://youtu.be/KAwyWkksXuo)\n\nTL;DR She hates my love making tunes and didn\u2019t tell me for over two years making sex now awkward.",

        "selftext": "Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. \n\nAs soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn\u2019t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. \n\nFast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. \n\nTL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. \n\nUpdate:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. \n\nUpdate 2: CHRISTMAS ISN\u2019T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!\n\nP.S. Sorry my mom isn\u2019t a whore. No you\u2019re not my daddy. ",

And I was like yeah? And he asked to see it and then he said, I have to call my brother.\n\nTurned out that my uncle has been convinced for decades that his ex-wife had an affair and his youngest daughter, Karen, wasn't really his.\n\nTurns out she has been this whole time.",

Genealogical records show no relation, but she told my Dad that of her three siblings, only one of them had the \"expected\" ancestry report. Their parents were no longer living, so no one to ask.\n\nAnyway, upon further conversation, my Dad finds out that when this woman was born, she lived in the same city as most of my Dad's family.

But there is no record of George being born on our family tree. Turns out one of my Grandma's female cousins got pregnant very young and had arranged for her OBGYN to adopt George. So she gave birth in this doctor's basement and then went on with her life afterward. The doctor forged George's birth certificate to say George was born to him and his wife. George did not know he was adopted until his father admitted it on his deathbed. But he did not tell George his mother's name. So in the family there are 4 possible candidates to be George's mother. We have no idea who. Also George is a jackass who started cursing at my Grandma through email after we could only narrow it down to those 4. We no longer correspond with George.

My aunt then used the same donor to have two kids, my cousins G and B. \n\nI took my 23AndMe, and then a few months later my first cousin G did as well. When we were looking over her results, I showed up as expected labeled as a \"first or second cousin\" genetically.  But there were also these other people showing up as \"first cousin or closer\".  I'm 100% her first cousin, so I said to her \"G... these people are more closely related to you than I am. They could be siblings!\" \n\nThis was not totally unexpected, but intriguing, so G proceeded to look into it. \n\nCome to find out, she has not just one or two, but HUNDREDS of half siblings! Apparently this particular donor that her mother used was WILDLY popular in the early 90's, and despite the fact that they're not supposed to do so, the donor company used him over and over and over again.\n\nThere's a Facebook group of this man's offspring, they have meetups, and somehow one of them even found the guy and contacted him!

My grandma had given him away for adoption when he was a baby. He never knew his mom, his adoptive parents died many years ago, and he has no children so he has no family, or at least so he thought!  What's cool is he was recently introduced to his 91 year old mom who is still alive and well, three other siblings and a ton of nieces and nephews.

        "selftext": "Sigh. \n\nWork was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. \n\nFood ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah's Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it's nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. \n\nPertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. \n\nBoth dogs were in the neighbor\u2019s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog\u2019s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the \u201dvoice\u201d for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. \n\nPup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling \u201dRUNAWAY\u201d and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I'd left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. \n\nI didn't have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. \n\n\u201dIs that your dog?\u201d\n\nMy bullshit meter didn't go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? \n\nI\u2019ll be nice because you brought my food. \n\nBut she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, \u201dokay weird\u201d but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking \u201cokay weird...\u201d again but didn\u2019t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. \n\nI went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. \n\nUh...ok? What\u2019s going on here?\n\nI go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn\u2019t notice me. I walk up like I\u2019m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you\u2019ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I\u2019m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. \n\nI don\u2019t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. \n\nI continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor\u2019s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. \n\nIt clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. \n\nNo hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver\u2019s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor\u2019s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn\u2019t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. \n\nHowever, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. \n\nI splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn\u2019t end worse. \n\nTL; DR\n\nOrdered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn\u2019t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn\u2019t get shot but got cake in the end.\n\nEdit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!\n\nTaking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I\u2019m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.\n\nI appreciate the sub this was posting to for restoring it after being removed. I apologize that this topic bent the rules and didn\u2019t think 100% before submitting. This was a way to vent. Thank you for allowing this to be a place of dialogue!\n\nStay classy, everyone!",

            "**FULL WITH ALL UPDATES**\n\n**This happened an hour ago, and I\u2019m still shaking in fear about how my life will now become from now on....\n\nThere\u2019s 2 \u201csituations\u201d that leads to the conclusion of the FU.\n\nFirst situation:\n\nAsked sister-in-law to borrow her 360 pocket camera for a trip wife and I are soon vacationing to.\n\nFound out the memory card still had content.\n\nHer husband travels a lot, and she made a 1-hour POV style 360 \u201cporn\u201d video, assuming sent to him a while back.\n\nI\u2019ve had the hots for her for the past 8+ years. Before she got married and I have, there were several times sexual tensions arose between the two of us. Living together for a year as strictly roommates, movies, dinners, getting drunk while watching movies just the two of us, breakfasts, etc.\n\nA certain trust (or test?) was implemented and nothing ever happened between the two of us, as at the time I was dating my now wife which was working at a distance. But damn it at the time if she just had touched my hand once back then, I think I would have lived a whole different life.\n\nSo finding this video... I thought I struck gold, I could have what I\u2019ve always fantasized about, \u201cgifting my past self\u201d, while living my happy current life.\n\nSecond accident:\n\nI have an automated house that lights up the house with geolocation. Before the app worked with Apple HomeKit, a third party app needed to be downloaded which tracks your family and friends. Free version only allows you to add 1 person, so my wife.\n\nWife and I have had this app for 3 years now even if it\u2019s useless now after an app update a couple years back on the original app. We never deleted it since it was so useful for tracking each other using notifications. I get a notification when she\u2019s at work and when I arrive at work, we also both get notifications when one arrives home. Good for times where she does groceries for example and I get a notification to prompt me to go out and help her out. Or when I work late and finally leave the office prompting her to set-up the dinning table.\n\nLast night she fell asleep without charging her phone. I hate when she does that, today she goes to work with barely any battery, what if she needs to call the police or hospital for an emergency?\n\nI have the day off today, today was the day I\u2019d do the \u201cdeed\u201d. I don\u2019t only go with simple 360 video.... but literally set it up on my VR headset in bed with AirPods on. The whole experience.\n\nThis would have lasted me tops 5 mins.\n\nBut the \u201cforeplay\u201d she does, is long and boring. Then the action starts and I go on.\n\nWife\u2019s phone didn\u2019t give a notification as she arrived, because of her now dead phone.\n\nShe comes to the bedroom to see me master bating in bed with VR goggles on.\n\nShe knows I masterbate occasionally but never saw me do it, I sneak it in here and there.\n\nBut VR porn was never \u201cdiscussed\u201d as an \u201cis it cheating if....\u201d thing. You know the convo I\u2019m talking about, \u201cis it cheating if you have a sex doll\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if it\u2019s a robot\u201d, \u201cis it cheating if you put a pleasure toy on and someone from across the Internet strokes you in real time\u201d, etc...\n\nIt was the type of convo we\u2019d have at the very start of our relationship when we were still friends 10 years ago, to see how far one could take it. Weird I know, but let\u2019s say it was one of these pre-game convos to see if we\u2019re on the same page before things started getting serious. Pre-game convos were not only about sex by the way.\n\nAnyways, VR wasn\u2019t a \u201cthing\u201d back then so was never discussed. So I never knew if it was \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for me to do so. I guess it was \u201cwrong\u201d since she rushed in and ripped the goggles from my face. That\u2019s when I see her in the room.\n\n\u201cThe fuck??\u201d she says.\n\nThen she looks inside.\n\n\u201cIs that my sister?!?!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fucked.\n\nShe still had her shoes on from arriving. So she just grabbed her bag WITH the VR headset and left the house.\n\nSeeing from the tracking app... she\u2019s at her parents house.... which are neighbours of the sister-in-law.\n\nI\u2019m fucked.\n\n**UPDATE**: So basically this is what happened tonight... once my wife arrived at her parents house, that\u2019s when I received notification her phone was back on and charging. Some people asked about the app, it\u2019s called Life360, it also gives battery percentage notifications when it runs low or when phone is back on.\n\nI was already typing the long story on Reddit when suddenly that notification appeared, which I last minute checked and wrote she was at her parents house before posting.\n\nSo basically... after posting... after feeling a \u201cbit\u201d better by \u201ctelling someone\u201d and having a bit of weight off my shoulders... I was pacing around the apartment while trying to give her calls after calls but it kept saying her phone was busy...\n\nThis went on for 45 mins, or forever, couldn\u2019t focus on the time. All of a sudden the sister-in-law calls. I ignored... I was way too scared to face this. She called 5 times in a row while I just watched it ringing, then she gave up. Then just a text saying \u201cCall me\u201d.\n\nI left the apartment and decided to go watch a movie at the theatre, needed to get distracted, which didn\u2019t help as I didn\u2019t focus once on Detective Pikachu.\n\nI received a call from my wife during the movie but I ignored. She knows I have an Apple Watch and I receive all notifications, so she knows I was ignoring. She only called once. Sister-in-law 3 more times during the movie. I left the theatre and decided to go back home....\n\nOn the drive back I received notification she arrived home. Now I was petrified... but my out of body experience just told me \u201cfuck it, suck it up. Just get it over with it\u201d\n\nArrived home... was getting ready for the shit storm about to happen. That out of body experience came back really quickly to reality as I got to the door and then had that fear again... I know she got notification I was back....\n\nI get in the house, and both wife and sister-in-law are in the living-room on the couch.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything. Wanted one of them to speak first. What if I said \u201csorry\u201d but there was nothing to be \u201csorry\u201d about? At this point I was trying to gauge the mood. I\u2019m not for confrontations or leading conversations, I\u2019m very introverted. But I know I should be the first to say \u201csorry\u201d.... but didn\u2019t know how.\n\nWife then says \u201cI spoke to sister-in-law about what happened. She knows.\u201d\n\nFucked up in the head of a me, out of reflex says \u201cknows what?\u201d\n\nShe says \u201cdon\u2019t lie, the video\u201d.\n\nI was red flushed I\u2019m sure. My heart was beating so fast.\n\nThen wife said she has deleted the video.\n\nThis is when I apologized to both of them... so very very much. Almost crying. I saw all the Reddit comments about divorce and all, and I was really upset at myself, but deserved it, but not.... but yes... but no....\n\nThen sister-in-law speaks... she says \u201cyou do understand this video wasn\u2019t for you\u201d, then she goes on for 10 minutes to tell me what I already know. I was wrong. I kept nodding.\n\nBut then this drama comes out that fucked with me, she said that it wasn\u2019t for her husband neither. He\u2019s been constantly traveling to Bulgaria voluntarily at any chance he could for work, but also through the years he\u2019s been having an affair with a colleague there which works at that branch. She knew for a while and let it slide as he was still providing for sister-in-law. But the providing became less and less, wife knew too about this as she and her sister are so close, but the info was kept within the family to avoid dishonor. This is a big eastern mentality to have... and it\u2019s not the first time family info was kept secret from me. But now they told me because of the circumstance, I was told NOT to apologize or speak to her husband as he does not know about this video.\n\nSister-in-law is seeing someone else, her husband and her both live as roommates \u201cfor now\u201d. The divorce word can never go out, but she\u2019s found someone long-distance and that video was for HIM. The reasons for all the calls was to not mention anything to her husband, sister-in-law feared that if I did, then this video would have been proof held during divorce process as if SHE was at fault.\n\nIt was a very emotional afternoon... I felt like throwing up many times. The focus was more on sister-in-law and her life though, and her shame for having kept her relationship going as long as it has, the guy is barely leaving any money on the side for her anymore so she\u2019s been sleeping more and more at her parents house.\n\nMe obtaining the video didn\u2019t come up more than once. I don\u2019t know if it was because it was too embarrassing for everyone or what. But it will come up another day for sure... maybe after everyone has relaxed and tears dried. I\u2019ll have an honest conversation with my wife about my wrong doings and also include if VR porn is fine or not.\n\nFor tonight, my wife invited sister-in-law to stay and sleep-over. We got some food and drank a few bottles of wine to make us forget a bit, although it felt awkward as fuck. Sister-in-law seemed to be feeling better... she was smiling and laughing and slapping my shoulder or kicking me under the table every time I made a joke. She seemed more open with me now I was one of the people to know her secret, she could trust and talk to if she needs.\n\nWe will all 3 sleep in sleeping bags in the living-room like camping to keep her company during this tough time for her.\n\nWife seemed ok for now too.\n\nTL;DR: Masterbated in VR with sister-in-law\u2019s 360 porn video, got caught in the act by wife, now feeling out of body experience and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to my life.",

You can't act on base instincts like that with family.\n\nAlso, it sounds like you need to figure your shit out. You add in backstory about this thing you had with your wife's sister like it pardons you for jerking it to her because it's just 'fantasy' and not 'actually sleeping with the woman I still seem to be crushing on'. No man, that makes it worse. You need to let this fantasy of the two of you together go COMPLETELY, and treat her like your biological sister, if you want any chance of staying with your wife. \n\nTLDR; stop perving on your wife's sister.

        "selftext": "EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu\n\n\nThis TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. \n\n-------------------------\n\nAnyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.\n\n\nAnyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. \n\n\nI end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. \n\n--------------------\n\nFor the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would \"go away in the winter\". \n\n\nAbout a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.\n\n\n**Worst mistake I have ever made.**\n\n\nYou see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. \n\n\nI screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. \n\n\n**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**\n\n\nTL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Jesus this exploded.

Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back\n\nEDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes.

I managed to make it go out of my room, but little did I know the fly was a mother.   \nI didn't notice little maggots moving in my old semen because it was not clear at the bottom.

But some of the maggots stayed in the cup. I had to remove them. By making tissue paper into a thin stick, I did the job very, very carefully, trying not to touch them. I could see the translucent creatures moving merrily.    \nNext, I had to do something about the pupae. And what I found out was that they had stuck themselves onto my notebook or other things. I had to remove them carefully again. I didn't want to crush them. I didn't want them to leave anything on my things.    \nIt took a serious care because if I hadn't I might've lost one or two. If that had happened, there would've been flies in my room again.   \nI disposed them in the drain too. I apologized to them in my heart. \"If I hadn't had my cum cup in my room...\" I thought. \"They would've hatched somewhere I don't know.\"   \nTo this day, I don't have a single load in that plastic cup.",

I'm 6'2 and have a pretty \"tough-guy\" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.\n\nSo while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.\n\nI'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she \"needs to think about what kind of man\" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.\n\nLater on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.\n\nWe are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.\n\nTl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nShe's a nice girl, she's just not pickin up what I'm puttin down.

In fact, if it says anything about you, it probably says you're stupider, because while you're standing there, wet and cold in the rain, he grabbed an umbrella and is dry.\"\n\nThe other is, \"The toughest, most \"alpha\" thing you can do in any situation is the thing you want, while everyone else is catering to others whims, you are confidently being you with no fucks given what others think.\"",

It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit\n\nThis morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence.

David Lane was serving his 190 year prison sentence for having a Jewish talk radio host murdered in 1986.  1488 is NOT a 4chan troll, made up, or meaningless, it has a very real and very evil meaning and signifies the codified values of the more violent style of white nationalist alive today.  These are the guys who think the KKK is run by the Jews. You know, morons. \n\nNow, the 88 precepts, the rules all of these white nationalists are required to live by, are low key ridiculous.  Like Precept 36 straight up bans pornography, if you ever see a white nationalist with a hentai profile picture or something along those lines, ask him about rule 36 and he will lose his fucking mind. \n\nThis has been a PSA: White nationalists are mad all the time because they can't jack it, true story.",

She\u2019s perfect for me. We\u2019re perfect for eachother. We\u2019re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.\n\nWe went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. \n\nShe went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago.

Some photos that I really shouldn\u2019t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.\n\nThere she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. I\u2019ve watched porn - a lot. I\u2019ve never seen a dick like this. I\u2019m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.\n\nI could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.\n\nI closed the pictures and I\u2019ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I\u2019ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I\u2019m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.\n\nWe haven\u2019t had sex since.

            "Bi guy here. You prob won't read this as it's too far down, but I think my perspective might give you some comfort: from my experience, guys with big dicks usually have trouble staying in long term relationships. While it's an exciting thing to look at in porn, it's nearly impossible to have sex with a large penis. Oral sex, as you describe it, is impossible. Vaginal sex will hurt immensely, and don't even talk about anal sex. I'm also above average and most men won't even consider anal sex, some women have complained about pain after vaginal sex. And I can understand why. I dated a man who had a 10 inch dick, also very thick, but I didn't find out until 2 months into the relationship. Three months later I had to break the relationship because we could not have any sex. He wasn't a bottom and I couldn't bottom for him. Our only sex was jerking off. I hurt him immensely by breaking up the relationship, and I myself was hurt. I felt like shit finding out all his relationships ended because of his dick size. He must go through every beginning of a relationship thinking that it may end sooner rather than later because people get tired of how difficult it is to simply enjoy sex. Think about it?

Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes and yes!\"  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like \"what is an ounce?\" or \"how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?\"  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.\n\nAnd it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.\n\nWhen we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.\n\n\"Dose size: 1/2 cookie,\" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. \n\nAnd then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   \n\nAbout 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say \"Diarrhea?\"  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.\n\n\"You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?\" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.\n\n\"Of course not.\" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.\n\nA few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.\n\n\"Keep it together, man,\"  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.\n\nThe waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. \n\nThe moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  \n\n\"You are sweating... from your entire face,\" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  \n\nAt this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  \"Are you alright?\" she asks kindly.\n\n\"Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,\" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   \n\nMy wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. \n\"Bathroom. Now.\" she hisses. \"Get it together.\"  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  \n\nNow, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.\n\nBut deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?\n\nBut the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. \n\nAfter finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table \"for being gone such a long time\" just in case my math was off. \n\nNext, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --\n or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.\n\nSmart man. \n\nHowever, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  \"Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?\" I suggest helpfully to my wife.\n\n\"What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.\"\n\nAnd at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  \"HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!\" she demands.\n\n\"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,\" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  \"I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.\"\n\n\"REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.\"\n\nI look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.\n\nTL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.\n\n\nEDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.\n\nAs for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves \"good-bye\" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at \"getting handsie\" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: \"Please don't die, we have a mortgage.\"",

            "I know a girl in California who sometimes sends me edibles. Years ago, she sent me this giant rice krispie treat with a total dosage of 80mg of THC. I decided to eat half and see what happens. Almost nothing. I didn't feel a damn thing. It actually wasn't quite half, probably more like 45%. So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can't get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don't work very well on me. But I didn't know this then.\n\nShe sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I'd get a decent high.\n\nOh my, was that a mistake.\n\nAs it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I'd just eaten 220mg. I remember saying at one point, \"I can actually feel myself getting higher every second. It's like I'm riding a weed elevator.\" After about an two hours, I'm losing my shit and then I realize something. My kitchen is messy and the police are definitely on their way to arrest me for letting my kitchen get so messy. So I started freaking out and panic cleaning my kitchen. It's also 2am. So, imagine an insanely high person desperately cleaning his kitchen at 2am, positive the cops are about to break his door down any second and arrest him.\n\nI eventually realize I have to work the next day and I really need to sleep. My shift started at 9am and it's already 2am. I slept for like 5-6 hours and actually woke up feeling completely fine. I don't remember the day at work at all, so I assume it was uneventful.",

            "Edibles are savage. \n\nI tried them for pain relief after a surgery a few years ago. I'm chilling watching one of those home decorating shows where they make over one room of the house. Anyway, the hosts voice starts to morph and sound weird. The colors are vivid. He's implementing this insane living room design where he makes a wall of gold chains and the focal point is this monstrous purple velvet ottoman with a blown glass teal chandelier hanging over it and I suddenly cannot. I descend into this hellscape where the homeowners lives are ruined because this shit is too grandiose for the rest of their house and everything is out of proportion and their property value tanks and I'm so overwhelmed by this that I have to turn off the show and just sit there in the dark stressing about the madness that I have just witnessed. \n\nI'm trying to clear my head and my mom, who was there trying to clean the house and take care of me after surgery comes in with the basket of mismatched socks that I have been ignoring forever and she's going to sit on my bed and match them. I try to stop her but I can't speak so she just plops down and dumps the basket of mismatched socks on the bed. I don't know how to fix the situation so I start crying and she's concerned thinking I am having some type of surgical complication and all I can say to explain through my tears is \"chaos socks\". At this point I think she realizes that I am trashed and she just gets a bag and throws them all away and tells me we will just buy all new socks that match.

            "I cringed in empathy just at the title.  But yeah, those edibles do not play.  I made the same mistake prior to a 2nd date with a guy once.  Some friends and I had tried edibles for the first time, and I unwittingly ate 3 super-strength edibles the night before the whale watching date.  \n\nI woke up still fucked up, but figured that I'd be fine by the time I arrived at the whale watching meet-up spot.  Well, I figured wrong.  My date spotted me being dropped off by the Uber and ran over.  I promptly opened the door and immediately vomited all over the ground nearly on his shoes.\n\nI ignored my date and ran to a nearby alley wall and resumed vomiting and wretching and vomiting some more.  He asked if I'd be OK, and I told him I was just a little hungover and that although I'd understand if he was grossed out and wanted to leave me behind, I'd be fine after puking out all the excess edibles.\n\nHe immediately ran off, but I felt too sick to even bother feeling ashamed of myself, and continued puking. \n\nMiraculously, he came back with some Dramamine and water for me, and dragged me into the boat boarding queue.  \n\nThe dramamine helped, and before we departed, I was cleaning myself up and apologising profusely to him.  But I thought I'd be fine from that point onward.\n\nNOPE.  After 45 minutes on the tiny boat in the choppy waters, I was hunched over the boat.  But, so was he.  And everyone else.  It was a collective Niagara Falls of innards by everyone on the boat.  (After having made a spectacle of myself puking in public earlier, it almost felt like god's way of patting me on the back saying \"s'ok\")\n\nAnd we saw not one fucking whale.\n\nAnd 5 years later, my husband and I are still too afraid to eat an edible or go whale watching.",

            "I had a very similar experience in Telluride, CO during the winter a few years back! \n\nI visited Telluride with a sizable group of friends. One of said friend\u2019s parents came along and rented a huge house for us to stay in. They were incredibly sweet and made it a point to have meals together each night of the trip. \n\nSecret time: I hardly ever smoke. So, when I do, I always get **debilitatingly** high. I attribute it to my competitive nature; I have to keep up with how much everyone else is doing.  \n\nAnyway, we walk in to this dispensary and Seth Rogen\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger is standing there, grinning Cheshire Cattingly behind the counter. \n\nGood sign. \n\nAfter much debate, we decide to get a large brownie and a blunt each. \n\nAfter making the purchase, our group wandered out and found a nice spot next to this peaceful little stream. A short discussion later and we decide on eating the edibles first.\n\nWe scarf down the brownies. And wait. And wait (for about five minutes so really not long at all). \n\nFriend 1- \u201cThis is dumb, nothing\u2019s happening!\u201d\n\nFriend 2- \u201cMaybe it didn\u2019t work, let\u2019s smoke the blunts to be sure.\u201d \n\nWe then get on the lift to make our way back to the  house and proceed to hot box the *shit* out of it with **all** of our respective blunts. For the entire ride back. \n\nBy the time we get off, it\u2019s been maybe 30 minutes (or two days, I can\u2019t tell) and it hits me like a dump truck. I stood outside of the lift building for about a day, wondering why this Whole Food\u2019s automatic doors wouldn\u2019t open (it was a window). \n\nEveryone finally manages to regroup and we make our way back to the house. We opened the door to a couple that wasn\u2019t my friend\u2019s parents. Unbeknownst to us, another family was staying with us and had just arrived (to this day, I have no idea who they were or which of us they knew). This new family consisted of the husband and wife, plus 12 and 10 year old boys. We were introduced to each of them in turn and I could only think one thing.\n\n*\u201dThey know.\u201d*\n\nThen, time skipped for me. The next thing I know, we\u2019re in the middle of dinner. I\u2019m standing, with my arms outstretched like a priest giving a sermon. Everyone at the table is quiet, staring at me with rapt attention. Clearly I was saying something, but I can\u2019t remember how I even got to the table, why I was standing up, and what the hell I was saying.  I did the only logical thing to do in that situation and eloquently said: \n\n\u201c......**GOODBYE.**\u201d \n\nAnd walked to my shared room. That particular room was in the basement and had a large window. That window pointed out beneath the wooden deck outside of the main floor. \n\nThe odd thing about the view that afternoon was Friend 2 huddled under the deck, with his back towards the window. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure if he was actually outside or if the reflection of my face was someone else\u2019s back now. So I tapped on the glass. \n\nUnderstandably, he panicked. \n\nWithout turning around, he jumped up and tried to sprint out from underneath the deck. His head slammed into one of the low-hanging planks with a hollow-ish **thud,** laying him out in the snow. I remember giggling, and then waking up the next morning. \n\nI wish there was a conclusive end to this story, but that\u2019s the last thing I remember from that day. I kind of just woke up the following morning in a haze. \n\n\nTL;DR Ate an edible and smoked a blunt back to back, gave a dinner sermon, and caused a friend to almost concuss himself. \n\n",

I was him and I was the person I was sawing in half simultaneously. \n\nDecided that was enough and closed my eyes and went to sleep. \n\nI woke up at 3 AM, motion sick from the fucking waterbed and rushed to the bathroom to puke my guts out. I don\u2019t know how long I was there, my head in the bowl just lingering over my puke before I wake up to my brother\u2019s vomit landing on my own head. \n\nEveryone seems to think we just had too much to eat but no - we have this secret. Our sibling puke pact. "

        "selftext": "So, didn't happen today, but last weekend. Finally getting around to really processing it all and I guess trying to deal with it.\n\nWent out for drinks with my girlfriend and met up with my younger cousin at the bar. We'd all hung out once before and had a great time. My cousin invited a couple of her friends to the bar too; we did some barhopping. I got shitfaced pretty unintentionally (The last bar was, I swear, not putting any mixers in my cocktails, they were straight alcohol). So anyway we're about to leave and my cousin's friends are trying to get her home, because she's shitfaced too. Well, my gf was our DD so we offered to let her stay in our spare room. Everyone was cool with that because who's safer than family, right?\n\nWrong. We get home and (I had to piece together some of this later because I blacked out for most of it) apparently initially everything was cool. My cousin went to the spare room and my gf got her situated. The problems started a little later when I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to walk straight out of my bedroom with my girlfriend in it, and into my cousin's room. I don't particularly remember much except for two details which I guess are not important to the story. Well, okay so one might be. I remember her giving me a *very* enthusiastic BJ, which, as you can imagine, makes a lot of noise. Apparently after a while my gf came out of the room wondering where I was because I just fucking disappeared. She didn't barge into the room or anything, but she heard the noises which is pretty fucking obvious. So at that point, she left. Like, me. She left me, and I don't blame her.\n\nAnyway that means I wake up the next morning, having blacked out, oblivious that my gf was gone already, but I'm fucking naked next to my naked cousin. There's cum all over the bed where her face was, she didn't even sleep with a pillow. There's obviously no hiding this but I'm still half-drunk and I went to try to go sneak back into my room, which I found empty. So yeah.\n\nI haven't heard from my gf all week, and I'm sure we're done, and I don't blame her. All I can hope for now is that this shit doesn't get out to my family, because I would probably implode. No, my cousin and I are not going to start hooking up regularly. It's actually super awkward and she has hardly said a word to me either. Again, I don't blame her.\n\nTL;DR drunkenly slept with my cousin, ruined my relationship, family might hear about it, I'm an idiot.",

I\u2019m 30 now and to this day I honestly don\u2019t remember what happened to it, and my parents also don\u2019t remember what happened to it.

I took it over because it was weird to me.

Never got past the first level and it just sat in my drawer, until I'd find it again and play it for nostalgia's sake. Well somehow, the entire case made it's way from my drawer, to the goodwill donation pile. Despite my pleas to my mother to not donate it since it had good memories.\n\nWell I find it gone and go to my mom like \"wtf is my Gameboy?\" She's like \"I donated it since you didn't play it\" And I was upset, but she was right, so I set it go. Well, classic games started to serge in mainstream popularity and value, so every time I'd see a Gameboy going for big bucks online or on tv I'd always tease her about it. It was our \"personal meme\" before she passed away.\n\nI still wish I could play that helicopter game again, but now anytime I see a Gameboy I think of my mother.",

It's a good job overall. I'm underpaid, but the benefits are nice, and I get overtime when I want it.\n\nA little over a year ago, during the week leading up to Christmas, we had some really bad weather that delayed all the flights. I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer\n\nI was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it's a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.\n\nMom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.\n\nKid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he's about 13, maybe 14.\n\nI hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.\n\nI tell him that I have to pat that area down. He's a little nervous, I figure that because he's so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.\n\nI do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn't look chubby at all.\n\nI move to the right side of the chest, read what's on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He's not wearing sweatpants, \\*she\\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn't even know the couple that just came through.\n\nI look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.\n\nI immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what's wrong, and I explain the situation to her.\n\nMy supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she's trying not to laugh.\n\nShe takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.\n\nOnce that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it's fine, that it wasn't the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.\n\nShe tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won't happen, and I shouldn't be worried.\n\nThat reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.\n\nI swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there's no way I have the energy to cook dinner.\n\nI saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).\n\nI apologize again, she says it's fine, and I ask her if she's planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.\n\nI tell her that I'm getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it's only fair that I buy her dinner.\n\nShe agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.\n\nShe said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it's not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men's bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn't walk into the ladies' room.\n\nShe laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.\n\nShe said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.\n\nI agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.\n\nWe just celebrated our one year anniversary.\n\nShe has long hair now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: Thought an adult woman was a teenage boy, touched her on the boob, everything worked out better than expected.",

My state is \u201copen\u201d and while I\u2019m not thrilled, I need both the job and my scored sofa accommodations to make it work. To give them their space, and myself a break from the doomscrolling, I take a run by the lake in the mornings. This lake is bombass and draws scuba divers to the flooded town at the bottom.\n\nToday, I was in my own head running when a dark mass floated to the surface 40 feet away. I was on the craggy side of the lake and this dude looked dead. D.E.A.D. Facing away from me, his head was tipped back, eyes closed, bobbing like a fishing lure. No one else was around, so I thought he was quantum crazy out here scuba diving alone at the crackass of dawn, giving himself the bends or some nonsense.\n\nLike a jackass, I didn\u2019t yell at him to check-in. Instead, I toed off my shoes and stripped to my skivvies to save the imbecile. The movie trailer in my head had me taking three glorious steps and launching into the deep blue water, black widow style. Instead, my tender feet hit the sharp rocks and I contorted under the pain like a slinky as I uncoordinatedly pitched myself into the water, doing a side-flop. I was also wearing my contacts so I swam hard in his direction with my eyes closed.\n\nWhen I open them, he was dead-ass staring at me like I\u2019d lost my ever-lovin\u2019 mind, so I blurted, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\nHe removed the regulator and incredulously said \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nMy brain blue-screened while I tread water. The lake felt infinitely deep. Before I could terrify myself by hearing the jaws theme song, I turned to nope the hell out of there, yelling over my shoulder, \u201cI thought you needed saving\u201d to explain my idiocy.\n\nAs I pivoted, another dude cleared his throat from 30 feet away on the other side. I never heard a sound from him so I freaked out, failing and belting an ear wounding scream at him.\n\nBoth asshats laughed as a few more heads surfaced around us. I was surrounded by divers all wildly entertained by my ridiculous high-octane FU. After pointing to me and the beach, the merman that was my original target cautiously swam toward me after I nodded and \u201cescorted\u201d me to the shore.\n\nThe beach was much further than I had anticipated, so I was trying to low-key breath, hiding my need to suck all of the O2 from the air. Also, the comedy of the situation consumed me and I started to giggle. Finally, I joked, \u201cDude, you are lucky you weren\u2019t actually dying because It would have taken everything I have to drag your sorry ass this far.\u201d\n\nHe chuckled before offering me a \u201ctow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHell, no! Not gonna happen.\u201d Even if I had to dog paddle, I wouldn\u2019t openly accept that defeat.\n\nHe quietly mocked me the rest of the way to the shore. I\u2019m a secret sap for it.\n\nThey were cadets or recent graduates from a military college, here for the summer. They\u2019ve been training in pools and were doing some \u201copen water\u201d exercises; they had been out there at least part of the night. I\u2019m sure I blew-up whatever drill they were running. He\u2019s training for pre-dive school (?) and since I am an expert googler, I\u2019m guessing that means combat diving.\n\nAt the shore, I did my best to throw my shoulders back and march out of the water in my sports bra and undies in front of what I can only imagine are some pretty badass men. I did invite him and his clandestine crew for an absurdly overpriced beer at the bar tonight before shame-jogging back into the woods for my clothes.\n\nTL;DR I tried to save an injured diver-ended up crashing some kind of military training.\n\nEDIT: It's Lake Jocassee in SC. Also, the mereman cheated: he was wearing a floaty vest and fins, that bastard. Ok, I\u2019ll admit there is a part of me that is attracted to his mysterious appearance from the shadow realm, and I\u2019m definitely imaging that he\u2019s constructed from some kind of aluminum steel alloy, but he was also funny and kind. I was vibing his proclivity for witty and sarcastic comments and have a million questions I want to ask him. Ha\n\nEDIT2: Okay, at work now and had to turn off the notifications because you snippers are blowing me up. To all the ladies giving advice earlier...yes, I left the dragon-flies at home and went full cute sundress and Jesus sandals. Tried to wear my hair straight, but it's hot as hate out here and it'll be beach wave sweaty before long. My sister's BF has blabbed the whole thing and all of the staff is in full-on ribbing mode. Kinda great actually. They are currently reading the Reddit post so they are cackling at you people too. So, even if he doesn't show, we're gonna have a great night. We have a long way to go since it's just the dinner crowd, but thanks for making my day great people.\n\nEDIT3: Solid dinner crowd, but no mereman, or frog prince as you people have started to call him. Our lakeside drinking crew will start rolling in another 1-2 hours. I thought you salty bastards of TIFU would chew me up and spit me out, but look at you all showing up in the name of love! You guys are awesome, even if I get ditched it was worth the day with you.\n\nEDIT4: 1 hor later. Still no show :(\n\nEDIT5: HE SHOWED! Holy shit, a little bit ago. Yes, I was as dorky as you would have imagined and now I\u2019m typing this from the bathroom like a dumbass again, but I feel like you people are on the ride with me. He\u2019s handsome and funny and he smells great. Yes, I hugged him. I\u2019m southern\u2026its what we do\u2026not the smelling, the hugging. He\u2019s nice, and smart and keeps defending me from my jackass friends at the bar, who have almost called him merman to his face. I think he low-key likes that everyone knew who he was, but not sure how he\u2019ll feel about being a Reddit celebrity. I\u2019ve learned a lot about him, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to share without his permission. His whole crew did not come, only one and his bud immediately started flirting with my co-worker. That\u2019s a good sign. I think. Holy, shit you\u2019d think I\u2019d never met up with a guy before. Also, my friend straight up asked him if he saw my \u201cdragonfly undies that look like penises with MASSIVE, glow-in-the-dark turquoise blue balls\u201d only she used the Reddit version  (thanks for that nickname Reddit). He didn\u2019t answer but smirked the truth to me after she left. It was cheeky but cute. He\u2019s also been sharing some of the shit that he's been taking today from being \u201csaved\u201d. He has the same self-deprecating sense of humor as me. I think we are vibing. So, that\u2019s all the updates for tonight. He\u2019s getting the rest of my attention. Keep sending me those good vibes and peace people.\n\nEDIT6: Last and final update because you guys are not letting up. I know this may seem weird since I posted this whole situation out into cyberspace for everyone to see, but yesterday it was just a comical story about a guy I didn't think I would ever see again. Something funny to share when we all need a giggle. Today...well...it feels different to talk about him now that we've spent some time together. I like him. There\u2019s chemistry and similar interest and we have plans to see each other again. I don\u2019t need the pressure of Reddit to help me screw things up. You guys know I\u2019m a bit of an expert in that regard. That\u2019s all, so go do something you love and find a way to at least balance the doomscrolling with some belly laughs. Sending much love to each of you.\n\nEDIT7: \u201cUpdates!\u201d You people keep screaming over 3 weeks later. Don\u2019t you have better things to do than pester me about my love life? Ha. The merman, the frog prince, the dashing man from depths, the king of the shadow realm (and the many other nicknames that Reddit has bestowed) is still very much in my life. He\u2019s better than I can describe with my mortal words. Fangirl him if you must because I will understand. Thank you all for the well-wishes and positivity that this post has given. I hope something amazing and magical happens to each of you, and if it happens to be shamefully funny, I hope you will share because we all need as many laughs as we can get. Be safe, everyone.",

But due to confidentiality they where unable to tell us whether or not it was a training exercise that we where blundering into. There was an arrangement where they where allowed to notify our launch authority whether or not a training exercise was being undertaken, but they where not allowed to disclose the nature of the exercise, or whether it involved bodies in the water, due to this our due diligence dictated that we still had to launch & chase up the call in.\n\nIt's gone as far as the navy launching a helicopter to aid our search pattern, and after 30 minutes of searching alongside the naval helicopter for the naval SMC to call their helicopter back.

            "In your defense if someone is drowning they cannot scream because fight-or-flight instincts take over and focus on breathing and keeping the head above water and the body alive. Here is an awesome read that I found on a fishing forum about drowning, how to identify it, and what to do if you think you see someone drowning:\n\nOriginal source:  http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/\n\nThe new captain jumped from the deck, fully dressed, and sprinted through the water. A former lifeguard, he kept his eyes on his victim as he headed straight for the couple swimming between their anchored sportfisher and the beach. \u201cI think he thinks you\u2019re drowning,\u201d the husband said to his wife. They had been splashing each other and she had screamed but now they were just standing, neck-deep on the sand bar. \u201cWe\u2019re fine, what is he doing?\u201d she asked, a little annoyed. \u201cWe\u2019re fine!\u201d the husband yelled, waving him off, but his captain kept swimming hard. \u201dMove!\u201d he barked as he sprinted between the stunned owners. Directly behind them, not ten feet away, their nine-year-old daughter was drowning. Safely above the surface in the arms of the captain, she burst into tears, \u201cDaddy!\u201d\n\nHow did this captain know \u2013 from fifty feet away \u2013 what the father couldn\u2019t recognize from just ten? Drowning is not the violent, splashing, call for help that most people expect. The captain was trained to recognize drowning by experts and years of experience. The father, on the other hand, had learned what drowning looks like by watching television. If you spend time on or near the water (hint: that\u2019s all of us) then you should make sure that you and your crew know what to look for whenever people enter the water. Until she cried a tearful, \u201cDaddy,\u201d she hadn\u2019t made a sound. As a former Coast Guard rescue swimmer, I wasn\u2019t surprised at all by this story. Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for, is rarely seen in real life.\n\nThe Instinctive Drowning Response \u2013 so named by Francesco A. Pia, Ph.D., is what people do to avoid actual or perceived suffocation in the water. And it does not look like most people expect. There is very little splashing, no waving, and no yelling or calls for help of any kind. To get an idea of just how quiet and undramatic from the surface drowning can be, consider this: It is the number two cause of accidental death in children, age 15 and under (just behind vehicle accidents) \u2013 of the approximately 750 children who will drown next year, about 375 of them will do so within 25 yards of a parent or other adult. In ten percent of those drownings, the adult will actually watch them do it, having no idea it is happening. Drowning does not look like drowning \u2013 Dr. Pia, in an article in the Coast Guard\u2019s On Scene Magazine, described the instinctive drowning response like this:\n\nExcept in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled, before speech occurs.\nDrowning people\u2019s mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning people\u2019s mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water.\nDrowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the water\u2019s surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water, permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe.\nThroughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment.\nFrom beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response people\u2019s bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs.\n(Source: On Scene Magazine: Fall 2006 (page 14))\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that a person that is yelling for help and thrashing isn\u2019t in real trouble \u2013 they are experiencing aquatic distress. Not always present before the instinctive drowning response, aquatic distress doesn\u2019t last long \u2013 but unlike true drowning, these victims can still assist in their own rescue. They can grab lifelines, throw rings, etc.\n\nLook for these other signs of drowning when persons are in the water:\n\n- Head low in the water, mouth at water level\n- Head tilted back with mouth open\n- Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus\n- Eyes closed\n- Hair over forehead or eyes\n- Not using legs \u2013 Vertical\n- Hyperventilating or gasping\n- Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway\n- Trying to roll over on the back\n- Appear to be climbing an invisible ladder.\n- So if a crew member falls overboard and everything looks OK \u2013 don\u2019t be too sure. Sometimes the most common indication that someone is drowning is that they don\u2019t look like they\u2019re drowning. They may just look like they are treading water and looking up at the deck. One way to be sure? Ask them, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d If they can answer at all \u2013 they probably are. If they return a blank stare, you may have less than 30 seconds to get to them. And parents \u2013 children playing in the water make noise. When they get quiet, you get to them and find out why.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award! My first one!",

I'm an first responder in a semi-big town. We got a call in the middle of the night. A hiker saw a guy trying to drown himself in a lake. We took it seriously, ofcourse. Called in a helicopter, a boat and everything. Came there and saw a fisherman with these thighhigh rubber boots on looking confused AF. He was just night-fishing and wading the water. \nThe hiker felt pretty stupid but we told her she did great by calling us!",

            "This is the meet-cute of a romance novel I would definitely read.\n\nSo, let me summarise the rest of it.\n\nAt first, they don't come to the bar. With COVID, rank says the guys in training should limit their interaction with the general public and they are not allowed to come.\n\nSo, you spend a pensive shift becoming more and more disappointed. But as you walk towards your blue beat-up pickup truck, keys in hand, you hear a movement in the gravel. It's the guy. They call him #1. He has snuck out to tell you why they didn't come. It's awkward. It's tense. It's awesome! You're falling in love.\n\nNext day, the team gets a mission and that requires a woman with a very specific hero complex to go undercover and save the kids in a small town from the bottom of a lake in Rwanda (shut up, it's fiction). Trouble is, in the \\*whole of the military\\*, they can't find the right woman for the job.\n\nLightbulb!\n\nYou're recruited and fast-tracked through a gruelling training program. But oh no - you can't fraternise with one of your team. This is the sexual tension part of the romance novel where arbitrary thing keeps the couple apart!\n\nOver the next couple of weeks (while the kids in Rwanda... I don't know... hold their breath or something) muscles you didn't even know you had, turn to fire as you train your ass off with a bunch of hot, sweaty guys. You put all that sexual frustration into the training and impress everyone.\n\nWhen it's time to go, #1 pulls you aside, breaks the rules and kisses you passionately. Then he says that you don't have to go. That he's in love with you. He says it's going to be dangerous and he wants to keep you safe. Indignation! You brush him aside; you aren't afraid of anything; you're annoyed that he's treating you like a child. (This is the get pissed off with each other / fight section of the romance novel).\n\nYou refuse to look at him on the trip over.\n\nWhen you get there, despite all the careful planning, it all goes to hell. The planning is all wrong. The place is wrong. One of the team dies in a harrowing display of pg13 rated tragedy.\n\n\\#1 injures himself protecting you in a dazzling display of stupidity - the exact type of thing military types always say is GOING to happen if you deploy men and women together. You and #1 are stuck out there. He's seriously hurt, he asks you to leave him, but you won't. He just saved you. You're dam well not going to do everything you can to return the favour!  You don't want to leave the kids either. He begs you to just save yourself and that makes you even more annoyed.\n\nSo, grumpy and determined, you guide him through the forest terrain. You happen upon the real location, and there are the kids. Down there, in whatever freak of human depravity brought you here. The rest of the team are there too, but communications are limited. #1 is finally coming around and has learnt what a determined badass you are. He encourages you to go for it and gives you a knee shuddering good luck kiss, against all the rules.\n\nYou do the all the daring, adventurous, insane feats of bravery, and the mission is a success. But when the choppers arrive to take you away, you come under heavy fire. As you fly over the place you left #1, he is gone.\n\nYou go home. Broken. Lost.\n\nMonths pass. You can't stay in the military and see the same faces every day. The ones that look at you with that slight frown that tells you they miss him too, and they know what you've lost.  It hurts too much. You return to the bar. You return to your life. The other guys come to see you occasionally, but they are like brothers to you now.\n\nOne night at the end of your shift, as you walk back to that same beat-up blue pickup truck, just when you're finally looking to move on with your life, you hear movement in the gravel behind you, and there is #1.  He's got a cast and some bandages around his head, but it's him! He had to bug out of his hiding spot, but he was still alive. He crawled across the entire African continent, made a raft and sailed back to the states. The only thing that kept him going was you.\n\nQueue kissing, and marriage and 7 kids. The end.",

I looked in my wallet really quick and see the only $10 bill I had was still there. I almost started to panic, $100 to me back then was the difference between eating and not eating. Anyways, for a second I thought of going back in and explain the mix up but immediately shot that down, how big of a dick would that make me? Nope, I couldn't even think of doing that to that lady.

            "As a delivery driver, I wish people knew the effect better than average tips have on orders. Even if it\u2019s 25-30% its better than the usual 2$ or 3$. Most people feel we don\u2019t do anything, which granted, it is a very easy job... but our car maintenance? Is all on us. If we get in a wreck at our job, regardless of who was at fault, we are suspended without pay for a week and our job takes zero responsibility for damages to our cars or physical being. Those two factors mean I need money. It\u2019s discouraging working hours on end for less than minimum wage some days, as our wages change to about 4$ and hour while on road, so I rely almost entirely on my tips to survive. Kindness can really go a long way, a good tip has sometimes changed my entire mood for that shift.",

The next morning my wife was going to the store so I told her to take some of the remaining Benjamins, because they are a pain in the ass to break.  She counted out 10 bills, griping about how they stick together.  It was at that moment she realized she had inadvertently tipped $130 on a $70 bar bill the previous evening - which explained the waitress's reaction.   So we made a young woman very happy, we didn't do any life-altering financial damage to ourselves, and I got a little exercise pushing a walk-behind mower around the yard.",
            "Former delivery driver here. I remember going to work on fumes and needing to put my first couple of bucks into my tank right away. Couple months ago I ordered pizza at about 4 pm. Paid online and only had a 20 so I thought with covid and everything the driver could probably use the 20 so I just gave her the 20. She said oh man you're my first delivery today thanks. I just knew she was running on fumes.",
            "When you're struggling a big tip is enough to change your whole week. One situation that stands out in my mind was when I was waitressing overnight at denny's. I had a guy maybe around 30 come in by himself at 2am and order some chicken tenders. I'd had a rough night with every table arguing with me over prices like I made all the prices for denny's myself. He wasnt really paying attention and just said chicken tenders. So I'm trying to figure out if he wants the meal or like an appetizer but hes like uh yeah yeah the meal. Like I said, I was struggling so a 13$ chicken tender meal seemed outrageous to me. So I said \"that's 13$ is that okay?\" And hes like yeah that's fine and paid. After he got his food and was going out the door some friends of his walked in so he sat down with them.\n\nSo now I have an 8 top but it's just one if my 2 tables at the time, the other being a man who was clearly drunk, sitting alone. I spoke with then a few times because I overheard them talking about some musical artists I liked and they were discussing the Grammys that aired recently which I had watched, mainly talking about bruno Mars'preformace with cardi b at that show. I spoke to then off and on for the hour and a half they were there. The guy who originally ordered literally at none of his food, but whatever. When I took them the tickets (2 tickets for the 8 top) the first guy took the more expensive one and said \"hey, earlier when you said my total you asked if that was okay... why did you ask that?\" I said \"because for some people that's just 13 dollars but for other people... that's 13 dollars\" I put emphasis to basically imply thats a lot. He just said okay and a few minutes later I head to the register to cash then all out. \n\nHe paid first and he added a credit card tip at the card reader. The receipt printed out and i saw he left a 100$ tip on this ticket. I just looked at him a second and then I just burst into tears because I really needed that. He came over and gave me a hug while a girl with them paid for hers. She tipped me $60 and I just speechless. Just thanked them many times. So when they left the old drunk guy said \"that guy is famous. He plays bass for Bruno mars\". Thatsbwhy they were talking about the Grammys so much. He had just gotten back from performing there. This was in his hometown so I guess they got a break after that. I will never forget that night and his act of kindness.",

Then when I dropped it off, someone else came out to get the order and gave me a hundred and said \"here ya go, thanks\" and then started to walk away and I saw what the bill was that he'd handed me and stopped him and let him know he didn't need to pay for the order because it'd already been done in the app and he took the hundred back and said \"thanks\" and then turned around and gave me thirty instead for being honest about it, pretty cool guy (they'd already tipped 10.00 in the app).",

You got it bro.\"\n\nThis got me excited because there was a spring masquerade ball coming up that I was gonna skip since I didn't have anything nice to wear. The $200 bought a cheap but well fitting three-piece suit from H&M and I felt like Cinderella walking into that ballroom lol",
            "I don\u2019t eat out often, because when I do I generally tip in the 100% range and try to get out before the server notices.

It's a renewable resource, but, you'll remember his reaction.  \nWhen I do stuff like this, I call it a \"dumb\\*\\*\\* tax.\" And laugh at myself.  \nWhen I delivered pizza at nineteen, I had an order at the Red Roof Inn at the very corner of our delivery area.  It was snowing to beat the band.  When I delivered it, he gave me a twenty dollar tip, saying, \"Hazardous Duty Pay.\"  I still remember it 38 years later.",

They weren't having sex, they were _eating hummus_.\n\nI was shocked, and initially didn't believe it. We had never had hummus before and I asked him to show me the hummus if this was true. So he did, and I ate hummus for the first time, and oh my god was it good. We experimented with different things in it like bread and carrots and it was great. Apparently his friend had heard about how he had never had hummus before and thought this was absurd so had planned a date for a hummus party.\n\nSo yeah, it ended up being quite a good ending, i discovered how nice hummus was.\n\n\nTLDR: Thought my son was having gay sex, he just really liked hummus.",

            "Long Hauler here. I've done a ton of research over the course of my illness. It is incredibly hard to tell fact from fiction, especially since I don't have a medical degree to interpret these studies. But what else can I do as I heal.\n\nI literally watched as they spoke ivermectin into existence as a \"legit\" treatment. If you watch the interviews they never had any real evidence. Youtube banned one of their accounts for a week, and next thing you know they are on Joe Rogan's podcast claiming that they were being repressed, that it was all \"money and lies\". They were just trying to \"help spread the word\". If you dig into their arguments, it doesn't take too long to see all the red herrings. Because of them people are being poisoned, and they should hold some responsibility for their actions.\n\nThe problem is no one wants to spend time doing the research. So they see that its posted on a big subreddit, or website, and it legitimatizes it. But ban them and they are \"being repressed\". Its a lose lose situation. Reddit has done the least of all the platforms I am on, and I hope they at least label posts as misinformation, like twitter. But I'm afraid it is too little to late.",

        "selftext": "I think I have wasted my whole life to be honest.\n\nI am Joe, I have been a lurking for a while. I created this account to get my story across, I have no idea what I am planning to achieve by doing so, but I hope it can help those who are at crossroads and are stuck between passion and safety.\n\nFor the past 15 years of life, I have been a dentist, a path that I chose after leaving a job to study further in the hopes I will make more money. I do not even know why I cared about money when I did not even spend any of it. I met my wife before I started school, when I was 20, when I was a risktaker, a dreamer and wanted to change the world.\n\nNow I\u2019m in a place where I have chronic pain, a cheating wife, kids who don\u2019t love me, a life of staring into mouths all day, a dull brain, no more passions and hopes, no real purpose in life.\n\nI wanted to work as a social worker or an educator, but my parents and wife thought that I could help people in other ways that pay well. They convinced me to take dentistry and I did. I hated every minute of school, I did not want to be in a place where my back would ache, neck would ache and it was not solving the real cause of the problem, but just the result of what happens after people let go of their teeth. All my friends convinced me that it will be rewarding, and I will make a lot of money when I am out of school and I let them.\n\nWhen I was a young man, I wanted to do so many things, I used to play music, I wanted to become a musician, I wanted to be a teacher raising future people who could change the world. I loved physics and mathematics, but my parents told me to follow money instead of passions.\n\nToday I have 2 kids, a wife and they all expect me to provide them with a luxurious lifestyle. I have never cared for money, the most enjoyable time in my life was when I was sleeping on a futon in a rental running a small business selling jars of jam made with strawberries from a local farm and also working as a tutor for a bunch of spoilt kids. I had very little, but I was happy, I feel like I should have become an educator/business owner instead of taking a career I hate.\n\nFrom the past 15 years, I have developed chronic pain from doing dentistry, gained at least 20 kilos, made a million dollars but for what? I can\u2019t even do anything because of chronic back pain.\n\nAfter becoming a dentist, I worked 9-4, 5 days a week,  I would come back home exhausted, plan my next day, manage the business side of things, have dinner with my kids and wife, sleep and repeat. Have a few weeks here and there as holidays where I would take my family away for a vacation.\n\nMy kids don\u2019t even talk to me anymore, my wife and I have not had sex for months and I\u2019m 100% that she\u2019s cheating on me with a better-looking man who is older than me, I have seen her phone and confirmed this, but I will not bring it up because I don\u2019t have anyone except her left in my life, she has been my only support throughout this and if she leave, I have nothing left. My kids will probably be split and hate their dad because their mom has raised them, my life feels like a joke.\n\nI remember when I was in my 20s, I used to be popular with the girls, I had countless opportunities to go out with girls I found more attractive than my wife but I didn\u2019t because I cared for her. In hindsight, I should have just done what I wanted to. Maybe my wife would still be attracted to me, I would be healthier and fitter.\n\nIf I had my life all over again, I would not settle down so early, I would date more and find more interesting friends, I would never choose to be a dentist!\n\nI should have stuck to my passion for business/physics/teaching/music etc. Even though I would have been broke, I think I would not have cared, I would wake up everyday working towards a better future, work harder because I am not handed money on a silver platter, the list can go on.\n\nI feel that it's too late to go back to pursue my passions now, my kids have expectations, my wife has expectations, society thinks that I am useful and important.\n\nSorry if this is a long read, but I just had to say it. I truly have made a joke out of the one life I was given by choosing money, stability, safety, other people\u2019s opinions over my real passions.\n\nTo all the people stuck between money/stability/safety and passions, just chase your passions because the safe path does not guarantee that you\u2019ll live a life that was worth living.\n\nTL:DR \u2013 I ruined my life by continuing  to do what I hated \u2013 dentistry. It has ruined my marriage, health, family, my passions, my mind. Do what you are passionate about, f\\*\\*\\* societal expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:  \nI was not expecting this post to get so much attention as it has, I just posted it as a whim to tell atleast someone about it. I was very emotional at the time and did not proof read anything that I typed.\n\nHonestly reading your thoughts, encouragement and most importantly your own personal stories, I feel like I'm gaining a new perspective at life and how I can change it, for the first time in a very long time, I feel that maybe this is not the end. I don't have to die a slave to a system that does not support my life or adds any value to my life.\n\nI will put down answers to recurring questions below as they come up and keep you guys updated on what I will do with my life in this post. Thank you reddit for giving me hope.",

            "I'm reading through your responses and list, and it seems like you're having a hard time with the abstract advice that you received being given, so I'm going to try a different approach. \n\nFirst off it seems like you have forgot than you have agency over your life. Yes, you have some responsibilities to others, but you have the agency to make decisions in your life. If you don't make yourself the priority in your own life, NO ONE ELSE will. \n\nIt seems like you have several issues. You feel disconnected from your family, no friends or family structure. You do not enjoy your job, though it does bring in substantial monetary benefits, and you have physical issues with pain and weight because of it. All of this puts extra mental strain on you that makes you feel a bit dead inside. \n\nFrom what I hear, you have specialized skills and monetary resources. So here are my suggestions to you. \n\n1. Your first task immediately tomorrow morning is to make an appointment with a pain clinic in your area, ask for the soonest available slot as you are a healthcare professional and suffering immensely. Take what they say seriously.  Show them your physical sitting and set up, spend whatever you need to do, figure out how to make it as ergonomic as you can. \n\n2. You can afford a personal trainer, have the pain clinic recommend you someone and sign up for one at least twice a week and have themake you a meal plan. Pay someone to cook and meal prep it for you if you can't do it yourself (totally fine in the beginning) \n\n3. REMEMBER YOUR PRIVALEDGE. DENTISTS ARE AN ESSENTIAL TO LIFE LONG HEALTH AND CAN HELP THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MAJOR FACIAL PAIN ON A REGUALR BASIS. you have an incredible skill, put it to good use, not just for those who 'mess up and you need to deal with'. Dentists schedule 6 months out generally from my understanding, tell your scheduler to block off an hour a day moving forward. One of the hours that your regulars don't like/miss, easiest to my schedule. Call up the local shelter, woman's clinic, whatever charity or organization you have any feelings left for, and introduce yourself. \"hello, I am Mr. Dentist, I am looking to help out in my community, I would like to help those in need of dental care that can otherwise not afford it.\" \nYou are a good business man, figure out the logistics and volunteer your time to those who have been having issues. Make it a regular thing you do, and something tells me you will feel a little bit better seeing the help your highly specialized skills are able to provide people who cannot otherwise get it. \n\n4. Talk to your kids. After dinner each day, look at your kids and joke 'who is walking dad today, take a 30/45 min walk around your area every day with a different member of your family' ask them about their day, their friends, whatever it is, but take interest. (Hey, maybe the kids have always wanted a dog? Take in a rescue that has about as many years left as your kids do before college, walk that cutie every day) \n\n6. After six months of the following, sit down and look at your finances. How much do you have to work as a dentist in order to make sure your kids have a college fund, can you get an office manager to take some of your workload? Ending work at 4pm is earlier than most professionals, how can you find a way to maximize your time, and income, while exploring if there is something else you would be doing .... I promise you, teachers work longer hours than dentist, as you have a lot more agency over your hours. I say this as my old dentist only worked mon/wed/Fri, and he said it was enough for him monetarily since his kids left for college. \n\nOk... And if you need someone to break this down with, DM me. I truly believe you are young smart and capable. You can't possibly be lazy to run your own practice and it seems like you're just stuck in a rut. I have plenty of other suggestions to help you deal with your kids, wife, and lack of creativity in your life if you would like a gentle nudge in those directions (didn't want to overwhelm you) \n\nHope you're well, I think that you have the foundation to do good for yourself, your family, and the wild and free kid you hold in you. It takes effort, but this internet stranger believes in you.\n\nEdit: I noticed some of the comments you mentioned about your relationship with your wife, and it's clear to me that you care about her, and she cares for you. Even if in this moment it feels insane to some people, I think you can deal with this depression you've fallen into and better this relationship as well. Even if divorce is where you end up, it seems you want to improve that relationship from your end.",

            "Hey, I'm actually really happy that nearly 1000 people have replied to you, because it means that my comment is going to be lost, only visible to you in your inbox.\n\nSo this is my personal response to your post.  I am 49.  I was in a similar place.  I am not in the same bad place anymore, and I need you to know about it.\n\nMy wife was fucking her fitness instructor back when we were 38.  By age 39, we were divorced.  By age 44, my daughter was alienated from me, and I've never heard from her since.  My son, thankfully, is now an adult but as of this moment is sleeping peacefully in his room here in my apartment.\n\nWhen my marriage fell apart, I lost my wife, my home, my dogs, my car, my good tech job at Yahoo, and entered into a 5 year scorched-earth hellfire & brimstone legal battle.  I didn't want any of that misery, but my wife was furious, and punished me severely for wanting the divorce.\n\nBut here's the important part.  I dropped out of the rat race.  I started a career as a writer for a short while.  Couldn't make enough money at it, was *probably* going to leave the area, and then through contacts & friends, I found a job that would pay OK and let me be a single dad, too.  It was in tech and not ideal, as I was burnt out on tech just as you're burnt out on dentistry.  But the hours were sorta flexible.  I could go pick up my kids from school at 3 PM.  It was nice.  And then things got better -- I found a job with a friend.  I run his Web sites and the hours are CRAZY open-ended.  For example, this week my girlfriend had to move in (emergency), and I *just didn't work at all.*  I now have a couple of employees, so I told 'em \"I'm real busy with life, so close bugs, see ya in a few days.\"  And that's *okay.*\n\nSometimes I work 6 PM to midnight, and spend my days doing things with family or friends.  Sometimes I play video games until late, and sleep in.  One thing is for sure: that \"sleep debt\" you might have heard of?  It's possible to get healthy.  Years ago, I was profoundly in sleep debt.  My friends joked that I had early amnesia.  I was groggy all the time.  Now?  I'm *sharp.*  I caught up on years of sleep, I work when I want, I love tech work again, I do only what I want when I want, and if I prefer to make love to my pretty girlfriend all day and work tomorrow, I'm allowed.\n\nWe're planning my first trip out of the country!  I'm almost 50 and never left!  By 55, I'll be somewhere else.  I love not knowing what my future will look like, for once.\n\nI make half what I used to.  I have almost no savings.  But I am less stressed out at this moment than I have ever been in my life.\n\nAll of this is to say one thing: *you can do this.*  Life is safe only because you're forcing yourself to behave that way.  Life itself doesn't even *want* to be safe and predictable.  You have to force your life on rails and be bored out of your mind and drive yourself to stay in that mind-numbing mindset in order for it to be like that.  Give yourself even a little bit of freedom to do something unexpected or wild, and life will come alongside you like your best worst friend, handing you rewards & consequences both.  In other words, it can be tough and heartbreaking but also amazingly freeing and heart-poundingly wonderful.  The whole world can be wonderful, if you just engage it.\n\nYou have a million dollars, you've said.  You could literally give your wife and kids 800,000, take 200,000 for yourself, and live cheaply for decades.  You could go anywhere.  Learn a new language.  Meet new people.  Start a new job or business.  You could make a little bit of money, then a lot, then a little, and it'll be *just fine* no matter what.\n\nHell, maybe the wife & kids want to come along for that wild ride.  Maybe they don't.  You can be open to anything.  You can start over, even at age 40, or 60, or 80.  I did it, I survived it, and I'm happy.  You can change too.  Really, you *can* do this.",
            "\"The grass is always greener on the other side.\" Who is to say that you wouldn't have the same or similar complaints had you taken another path? No point dwelling on decisions made in the past. You can't go back and you just feel shittier thinking about what you could have done diffrent. If you can financially,  physically and emotionally make a change in your current situation go for it. It is either that or continue to wallow in it.",

You might feel like you're drowning and in too deep, but you just can't see clearly because you're in the middle of it. You're still young in the scheme of things with a lot of resources too. Only YOU can change things around.",
            "Omg. You are young enough to change this trainwreck around. Im 38. Please for the love of god stop what you are doing and pursue this dream.

In a comment you mentioned not being able to go into the field as you may cause others to regret choosing the profession. If you are passionate about teaching go for it. I'm not sure if you are referring to university or k-12 education with the phrasing. However, one thing I respected about the professor and teachers I've had who swapped into the profession is their bravery in doing what they love. If you do not love being a dentist, telling you students \"being a dentist isn't for me but teaching you is\" they will not think less of you. In a high school setting, it will encourage students to do what they love. In a university setting, coming forward and saying I wanted to be a teacher but I took dentistry for the money is not a bad thing. It may inspire students to do exactly what you suggest they do in this post. And for those that are interested, you have a whole lot of experience that you can use as teaching points. It would be invaluable. \n\nWhatever you decide to do whether that be teaching or something else, it is never to late to change your path. \n\nI also noticed you mention that you do yoga, I recommend you look into dharma (roughly translated to true calling).

I too, like my friends and family suggested me to, was to follow the money. I have always been expected to become a doctor. I bailed out 4th year in undergrad and switched over to dentistry  (process of elimination? b/c someone told me I had a knack with my hands? who knows at this point). Dental school was probably the worst 4 years of my life. I lost it in more ways than one. I became emotionally unstable. I set my alarm for 5 am everyday so I can snooze for 3 years instead of having the day sneak up on me as it would have if I woke up at 8 am for clinic. \n\nEven after graduating, speeding down my debt and buying my first property, I still feel immensely empty and still feel behind my peers who did engineering or comp sci. I wish I had explored better my possibilities as well. I currently am learning about real estate and finance and have found myself fully engaged in it and lifting up my spirits. My compromise for myself at this point is there is no doubt dentistry can pay your bills, but it doesn't have to become your life. Step back, disengage yourself from the toxicity, find something else to push yourself forward. While I am more burned out with patient management and the BS bureaucracy and drama that comes with every office, I still find myself excited to learn more about the science behind the dentistry.  My goal in the far future when I get closer to 40 is to decrease my dentistry days and hopefully increase my real estate side hustle into a full time job when my back gives out on me. My peers and I are only 31-32 years of age and we already feeling the musculoskeletal repercussions of dentistry so I have no doubt that your back is killing you. \n\nNot sure if this is any consolation but you definitely aren't alone.

Set small goals and try to learn something new (especially the things you enjoy) each day. It\u2019s easier to pivot towards a new goal since many of us have access to a wealth of information. But a skill is considered mastered when you commit enough time to make that a talent. Again, don\u2019t let age define your abilities.\n\nStep four, rely on a network of people that positively help you grow. If what you are saying about your wife and kids is true, leave them. Otherwise see if you can salvage your relationship with them. Regardless on whatever decision you make regarding your kids and wife, rely on other people (family and friends) to support your growth and development and celebrate your small victories with them from time to time.\n\nStep five, keep iterating the above approach and you\u2019ll start to see hints of light here and there.

You are depressed now and look what is around you. Join activities outside your family. Learn a new skill. In the end, start living more for you",
            "Dude. I threw my dreams away for abusive men and took the long hard road of abusing drugs to kill the pain of my own choices.  I wasted my life. Got knocked up at 19, it all went to hell in a handbag after that. I spent my 30s single, working 3 jobs and raising my kids alone. Still dabbling in drugs, but nothing compared to the years before.  I had lost my dreams. I had lost myself.  I had nothing to show for it. I didn't even have a favorite food. I was too busy feeding my family to care what I ate. At 44, I've been sober for half a decade.  Quit cigarettes and drinking in 2020. Chronic pain from all the beatings and destroying my body with drugs. My kids are raised. Woo-hoo! That was a bitch job. Finally found a damned great man, and my dreams... I just imagined up new dreams. I have new dreams, new goals and I'm actually going to achieve most before I die. Hopefully.  You do you. The rest will fall in place.",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.\n\nMy son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard \"well child\" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.\n\nToward the end of the visit she says to me, \"Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,\" to which I reply, \"Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.\"\n\nI should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.\n\nAs my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, \"Okay, well I have to tell you this,\" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. \n\nTl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.\n\nEdit: Of course we took the gardasil. Shout out to nurse Pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. I wish everyone could have a nurse Pete.

It wasn't you - I've had a doctor explain to me point-blank that they effectively aren't \"allowed\" to interpret something as a joke, they must check the comment wasn't made because a patient doesn't understand.\n\nSo it's like making a bomb joke to airport security; fellow people get it, but they're working in an environment where it is considered risky to dismiss as a joke what might be a nervous reveal, so they're trained to respond differently.\n\nJust thought you might like to know others have the same experience with jokes and doctors too.

I should point out this was relatively late, like six months or something, wife was very obviously pregnant.  \n\nDoctor: *\"Are you the father?\"*  \n\nMe: *\"Yes, but we aren't sure if she's the mother\"*  \n\n\nNow, I thought this was at least a little bit funny. Doctor did not. She just looked at me deadpan for about 5 seconds then turns to my wife and is just like *\"Right, shall we continue?\"*  \n\n\n// Edit: Obligatory \"Thanks for the gold\" edit!

That's not offensive, if so to anti-vaxxers, so in my book who cares. You seem to have a wonderful sense of humor. Doctors just take everything a tad too seriously.

We shouldn\u2019t need to bring back epidemics to prove the benefit of vaccines.",
            "Huh, they didn't give gardasil to boys when I was a kid (like... 6 years ago when we had our last boosters). Good thing they are now. HPV is no joke and 50% more autists can only be a good thing. GOD how many poor men have to suffer as adults, knowing they're neurotypical because they were denied that sweet autism juice. The suffering.\n\n/s, of course. Neurotypicals can be perfectly functioning members of society with the right support.\n\n...Sorry, I'll stop. Serious on the HPV thing, though.

If someone thinks you have asperger's, they'll assume that you're incapable of sarcasm, which renders *them* unable to pick up on *yours*. Whereas they would otherwise be on the same page and have no trouble detecting it and the conversation would go on as normal, they are filtering their perception of you through stereotypes they've picked up and letting confirmation bias dictate their beliefs.

        "selftext": "So, three months ago or whenever it was that the Quarantine started I started an online course for a few subjects. To provide some background, these aren\u2019t my school classes or anything and I\u2019ve never met these people before. There are maybe ten other kids in class and the teacher is actually pretty great. \n\nSo the first two days go pretty well but on the third day I fuck up big time. We were in between a Physics class that had already been going on for an hour and I\u2019d completely gotten distracted half way through. I have an incredibly low attention span and this was already too much for me. \n\nWhen the teacher called my name to answer his question, I had no idea what he\u2019d been talking about so I tried to google it. However I have shitty internet so it took like really long to load and the teacher was getting pissed as to why I wasn\u2019t responding and why I was typing. So, completely freaking out I decided to text him on the Google Meet chat and make an excuse that my laptop\u2019s audio AND microphone are not working today and I\u2019ve been reading the subtitles which take quite some time to load so I hadn\u2019t quite gotten his question. \n\nIn my immense panic I phrased this somewhat vaguely and said - *I can\u2019t actually hear I\u2019ve been reading the subtitles they take quite some time to load*\n\nTo which the instructor said - *Oh! I\u2019m so sorry. I wasn\u2019t aware that you are deaf*\n\nIn my intense panic and anxiety I just went along with it. \n\nDumb as fuck.\n\nIt actually worked out fine, I\u2019d type out all the answers sent to me and even bought a hearing aid that I sometimes wore in class. Now I say *sometimes* because I don\u2019t actually have the focus and commitment to remember to put it on every class. When asked about it I told the people in class that even with the hearing aid I can\u2019t hear much so I don\u2019t usually bother wearing it. They bought it. \n\nEveryone in class likes me a lot now too and they find me very endearing. There\u2019s a girl, Carla who says I have the most beautiful smile she\u2019s ever seen. So this was actually going really well for me. \n\nBut like most of my antics, this backfired on me big time. \n\nWhen I made this godforsaken decision all that time ago I was sure I\u2019d get away with it. We were never going to meet irl. However, about a week ago the instructor decided to meet irl as the lockdown in my country has been lifted. I spent all night watching videos of deaf people and trying to figure out how to behave. I decided to pretend to also be completely dumb so I wouldn\u2019t have to try to speak like them. It seemed very hard and I didn\u2019t want to try. \n\nSo anyway we meet up and everything goes well. No one uncovers my secret or anything. I spend the entire irl meet with Carla who is completely fucking stunning in real life. She\u2019s smart, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s kind. We keep handing each other notes on tissue papers and it\u2019s the cutest shit ever. I haven\u2019t ever been this attracted to anyone in my entire life. Toward the end of the meet however, Carla hands me a tissue paper with one little heartbreaking sentence on it.\n\n*Will you date me?*\n\nFuck. \n\nPanicking, I tell her I need some time to think and she\u2019s chill with it. \n\nI\u2019m supposed to be meeting up with her tomorrow. I can\u2019t pretend to be deaf and dumb while dating her it\u2019s fucking impossible but if I have to keep this charade up I\u2019ll have to let her go and I don\u2019t want to do that either.\n\nThere\u2019s also the other option where I tell her it was all an act. Best case scenario is the extreme embarrassment + amazing girlfriend and the worst case scenario is she thinks I\u2019m an asshole and I lose her anyway. \n\ntl;dr - I pretended to be deaf because I wasn\u2019t paying attention in class and now I might be missing out an amazing girlfriend.\n\nEdit - She just texted me what time to pick her up. The date is actually TONIGHT not tomorrow so I have way lesser time to make this decision than I expected. Haha, I\u2019m like a disaster that keeps on happening. Anyways, you should have an update in about 6-7 hours which is when I\u2019ll meet her.\n\nUPDATE - So this is the update y\u2019all have been waiting for, I just got back from the date with Carla.\n\nSo basically I prepared really hard for the date, googled what the appropriate flowers for apologizing for your lies are and got her White Orchids. I then put on my best clothes and set out. \n\nShe\u2019d come to the date with a cute little notepad and two pencils for us to write notes in which melted me instantly but I was so anxious and nervous that at first I couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell her. But as we sat waiting for our order to arrive, I kinda snapped cause of guilt and scribbled down into the notebook.\n\n*Hey, there\u2019s not easy way to break this but I\u2019m not actually deaf . . . . . Or dumb*\n\nTo which she replied with,\n\n*I know you\u2019re not deaf but you ARE pretty dumb :)*\n\nAt which point I said *What the fuck* out loud.\n\nShe then laughed and explained that she\u2019d thought I was so cute that she\u2019d googled me long ago and found my Instagram which has highlighted stories from concerts where I\u2019m screaming and vibing. So she only asked me out to figure out for how long I\u2019d keep it going. \n\nSo she was actually playing me the whole time.\n\nI was feeling pretty bummed that she only wanted to date me for that but nevertheless I apologized profusely and showed her the Reddit post to explain myself. \n\nBest.move.ever. (Thank you so much everyone in the comments who asked me to do this)\n\nShe found the post funny and cute and \u2018adorkable\u2019. I told her I totally understand if she wants to end the date now but she didn\u2019t! We had a great time and aren\u2019t officially dating or anything but we did set a second date for next Wednesday.\n\nShe also told me that while she understands why I did what I did and that anxiety, especially social anxiety is so hard to deal with but she also believes that I was a little offensive especially with the hearing aid. She explained to me why that was so insensitive and I\u2019d like to apologize for anyone I might have offended on here, it really wasn\u2019t my intention!\n\nAlso, for our second date we\u2019re planning to volunteer at a centre for deaf kids so I can redeem myself. \n\nThank you fucking Reddit, y\u2019all might\u2019ve just got me a girlfriend!",

            "I teach the deaf and hard of hearing. I just finished the year teaching the deaf and hard of hearing over Zoom. This story is a complete fabrication. You sign up for online classes that are not related to school when you already have an admitted attention difference? That is enough to disqualify your post. But, you expect me to believe that your internet connection was strong enough for the Google Meet, but not strong enough to Google the answer? Also, teachers would not get mad at students not answering questions; that was one of the main challenges during the past months: learning how to be patient with distance learning and student needs. But, to underline your lie, let me make this clear: if you are deaf or hard of hearing, that fact is NOT going to come up casually in the middle of class. Either you are going to make that known ahead of time so that you will receive proper accommodations or, in the absurdly impossible and ridiculous scenario where you do not inform anyone of your needs ahead of time, the teacher, in the very least, will be aware of what rights you have to access as a deaf or hard of hearing person or who to contact regarding getting you access. Lastly, you are showing your extreme ignorance by using the term \u2018d and d\u2019. That is NOT an appropriate use of language in the Deaf community. It is akin to other references we use for persons that we do not say out loud. You should truly be ashamed, not just for lying for attention, but for casually throwing around an insulting and degrading term about a marginalized community, especially during a time when marginalized persons are experiencing such public pains right now and struggling to find themselves both seen and heard. I am sorry for your lack of awareness. I hope you might grow and learn and think for a few moments more before you value attention over honesty. Creativity is a positive, but in all that we do, honesty is crucial, lest it lead us down paths of ignorance.",

She might think you're a complete idiot, but it's also kind of amusing, so she might find it funny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I'd go with option one, explain what happened then say you were too embarrassed to correct your teacher.

        "selftext": "Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, \u201cSome of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they\u2019re just boring and far too controlled\u201d. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...\u2019Hitlerish\u2019. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep if I didn\u2019t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I\u2019ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let\u2019s see what I go back to now...\n\nLink: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the gildings you\u2019re all giving me, it\u2019s rather overwhelming.\n\nThe original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. \n\nAs of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won\u2019t necessarily be responding to them all.\n\nI\u2019m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn\u2019t the original intention, but it\u2019s a great positive to take away from this experience!\n\nEDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-\n\nEDIT 3: UPDATE - It\u2019s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it\u2019s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they\u2019ve subsided and I\u2019m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn\u2019t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. \n\nEDIT 4: Finally I\u2019m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it\u2019s been a truly interesting experience. I didn\u2019t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn\u2019t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It\u2019s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!\n\nEDIT 5: Final edit, I\u2019m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It\u2019s been great to see this happen, and I\u2019m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment\n\nTL;DR - Made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks I\u2019m a racist bastard.",

        "selftext": "**UPDATES BELOW**\n\nThrowaway account, this literally happened like an hour ago. So I (M25) have been involved with an older woman (F44) lately. \n\nIt started a few months ago with the onset of Coronavirus, I was on Tinder trying to find someone to hook up with during quarantine so as to stay safe and also kill some time. I saw this very attractive older woman and decided to swipe right because you know, it\u2019s every 20-something year olds dream to hook up with a Milf. A few days go by and I get a notification that I have a new match. Wahoo! I open up the app and lo and behold it\u2019s the fine ass cougar I was hoping for. \n\nWe start chatting and flirting, it\u2019s going really well. Out of nowhere she messages me and says \u201cI\u2019m not sure how this app works, do we just meet to have sex or do we go on a date first?\u201d I was drinking coffee at the time and promptly shot it out both nostrils. My chance had come. I replied back that people generally just meet up to go to the Bone Zone together but I\u2019m easy either way. She replies \u201cwell good because I hate formalities\u201d I nearly shit my pants in excitement. She sends me her address and tells me she\u2019s free on Friday and to bring wine. The rest of that whole week was a complete blur of anxiety. I could not fuck this up. \n\nSo Friday comes, I show up with wine, she looks fucking smoking hot. Better in person. We talk about music and travelling and all that, not many personal details (which would come back to haunt me) just sort of arts & culture talk. A few glasses of wine later and were full blown going at it like rabbits on the middle of her living room floor. I left a little while later feeling like I\u2019m the king of the entire universe and go to sleep. \n\nThe next day she texts me saying how she had a great time, and it made her feel young again and blah blah blah. She says she\u2019s off every Friday and Saturday and that next week we should do the same. \n\nThis has been going on for roughly 3 months, we meet up once or twice a week, fuck like animals, and then go on our merry way until one of us gets horny again. Sweet deal right? Wrong. \n\nI messaged her yesterday saying that I had today off of work and asked if she wanted to meet up, she said her son was taking her out to lunch, and that I could come over at 3pm. She had mentioned she had a son before but didn\u2019t go any further and I didn\u2019t really care to ask.\n\nSo 3pm comes and I\u2019m almost at her house when she messages me that she\u2019s running late; no problem. I park on the road and sort of just wait in my car because her car wasn\u2019t in the driveway yet. I\u2019m sitting there listening to the radio when an oddly familiar SUV pulls into the drive. I sorta looked at it funny and then I immediately realized where I knew it from. My coworker(M23) jumps out of the front seat, goes around to her side of the vehicle, gives her a kiss on the cheek and a hug and then jumps back in the car. My jaw was on the ground. \n\nHe reversed out of the driveway and stupid me is sitting like a deer in the headlights in plain sight. He turns around and is literally 10 feet in front of my car and staring directly at me. My face goes bright red and I feel like I\u2019m going to vomit. Me and this guy work together every single day and I consider him a friend of mine, I even trained him when he started at my company. And the kicker is I\u2019ve been telling him (in detail) about this older lady and he\u2019s been giving me immense kudos about it saying that it\u2019s \u201chis dream\u201d.\n\nHe pulls up beside me and looks very confused, asks me what I\u2019m doing and how funny it was we ran into each other. I panic completely and stumble over my words and pretend like I\u2019m on the wrong street and trying to find my cousins house. He looked skeptical but sort of shrugged it off. The whole time his mother is standing there watching us through the curtains. He directs me where to go and I pull off and then circle back once he\u2019s gone. \n\nNeedless to say I went inside and told her what was up, and we both sort of sat there in silence before I left. No boom boom today. \n\nI am now panicking, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s not going to know right? And he\u2019s gonna realize all these wild escapades with this she devil night mistress I\u2019ve been telling him about is actually his mom? Fuck. I already called in sick for work tomorrow because I cannot look him in the eye. \n\nWill update if anything happens. \n\nPray for my soul Reddit. \n\nUPDATE: she just texted me and says that we should tell him and come clean because it\u2019s the right thing to do. WHAT THE FUCK. How do I politely explain that I\u2019ve told her son in detail about our escapades including the time I dripped candle wax on her butthole? (she a freak) \n\nUPDATE 2: she\u2019s adamant about telling him, even after I informed her about the explicit details I\u2019ve been sharing since we started doing this. What is wrong w this woman. I\u2019m seriously debating quitting my job, I know her son well and he\u2019s gonna want to fucking kill me. She keeps insisting that \u201che\u2019s a grown up and he should realize that his mother is a person too with desires like any other person\u201d THATS NOT THE POINTTTTTT. Fuck. I\u2019m fucked bro\u2019s. \n\nUPDATE 3: she said regardless of what I say she\u2019s telling him tomorrow, because she can\u2019t \u201clive with the guilt and deceit\u201d she won\u2019t answer my calls at all. Not going over to her house because she\u2019s out somewhere. I\u2019m fucked, will update again. Let my tombstone read \u201cdied doing what he loved best\u201d. \n\nUPDATE 4: Well gentleman, the cat is out of the bag. His mother pulled the trigger and came clean about it all. I don\u2019t even know what to say. He called me saying it was super weird and he\u2019s mindfucked but he\u2019s not mad because he knows we had no idea. He asked if it was her I\u2019d been talking about the whole time and I said yes, then he must\u2019ve felt suicidal because he asked \u201c....even all that crazy stuff?\u201d RIP BRO. Needless to say I laughed and changed the subject, you\u2019ve been through enough today my child. \n\nHe also said he\u2019s gonna look for a new job & already gave his two weeks notice because it\u2019ll be weird working together. Damn. He genuinely just seems bummed as fuck. His mother is an idiot and I feel scummy as hell. He also said he put in a transfer so we won\u2019t be working in the same building until he\u2019s gone. Jeez. Going to see his Mom later and telling her we can\u2019t do this anymore, she caused him to lose a job and a friend and a reason to go to therapy over something we could\u2019ve likely played off. I think that\u2019s the end of it though, didn\u2019t expect this to blow up so big but thanks for all the awards and comments! At least someone gained something positive from this rollercoaster haha. \n\nCan\u2019t believe I made my own son quit his job. Damn. \n\nThanks Reddit! \n\nTLDR; banging hot older woman for a few months, go to meet with her. Coworker drops her off and I learn that she\u2019s his mother. He sees me waiting and seems skeptical about my lie as to what I was doing. My world crushes. RIP Me.\n\nEdit; fix spelling / grammar",

I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.\n\nThe week after, she mentions she\u2019s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn\u2019t expecting it but I\u2019m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn\u2019t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she\u2019s just having a good time?\n\nThe next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a \u201cbreak\u201d from \u201ceverything\u201d right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we\u2019re over. She\u2019s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she\u2019s with him. I\u2019ve heard from her friends that they\u2019re dating now. \n\nTLDR; Agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",

She is doing you a MASSIVE favor by telegraphing the bullet you need to dodge.\n\nGet more standards. If anyone I was in a relationship with asked ME to purchase a hotel room for THEM to have sex with someone else... I would drop that relationship so fast and without any warmup or warning. Regardless of being in an open relationship or not. UNLESS that is YOUR SPECIFIC Dom/kink fetish or whatevs. \n\nWhen your SO starts pushing things like that, they can tell if you aren't 100% comfortable with it. If they still choose to go through with it, they don't care or respect you enough for you to give them any more of your time. SO DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM.\n\nFinally, when she does try to come back (and she will if you keep distance from her after this) do not take her back. She will try to take advantage of your emotions, and it will be even worse after the new wears off again. Because this time she knows she can take advantage of you easily. \n\nFinally. It's easier for women to benefit from an open relationship. Some see it as a easy way out of an existing monagomous relationship because they can keep the emotional support from their SO while looking for someone else... Then swing over to someone they consider \"better\" without much emotional fallout. They have more options as men typically approach them, and all they need to do is swipe right on tinder when they find someone attractive. \n\nStart lifting/eating clean and go dark on social media for about 3-4 months. Don't communicate with her or her friend circle. Focus on improving the areas of your life where you can. Other people will notice a change after 4 months of focused dedication. You may not have the relationship you want... But you can cultivate a better relationship with yourself, which will provide returns in buckets.\n\nTldr: Dodged a bullet, don't pay for a service you don't want. Focus on improving yourself going forward. I wish you the best\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the silver!",

Any person suggesting that being in that financial situation should be kicked to the curb.\n\n3. You bought the hotel room.\n\nMan oh man.

She became extremely relaxed and talkative. It was cute at first, listening to her go on and on about life and love. But then shit kind of got specific. She mentioned how she never expected to be with someone like me. \n\nI didn't even have to encourage her to explain because the floodgates were already wide open. All those details spilled out without any fucking filter. This is what I learned from my fiance\u00e9 that I never knew before: \n\n1. Most of her past relationships ended because she was notoriously promiscuous.\n\n2. As per #1: one of those relationships came to an end after she cheated on her boyfriend by hooking up with his younger brother, while also cheating on the damn brother, with his best friend, who just so happened to be the same sex.\n\n3. I'm the first guy she's had to do the \"fake orgasm thing\" with. Apparently all her exes pushed all the right buttons whereas I don't.\n\n4. My asthma is a turn off when it comes to sex because she feels like she needs to hold back, so that I don't get too excited and die.\n\n5. All her exes had horse dicks (of course they did!). I'm her first average.\n\nThose were some of the key points. I was too traumatised to register whatever else she said afterwards. I don't think I blinked for the rest of the evening.\n\n**TL:DR Convinced my fiance\u00e9 to get high on relationship-destroying weed.**\n\n*Update: Even though I knew what my fiance\u00e9 said would haunt me forever, I was willing to bury it in the back of my mind and pretend like last night never even happened. However, my fiance\u00e9 wanted to talk. So we did. It was brutal. She said my mom was right about her being wrong for me. Long story short, all of this shit was building up to her admitting she'd been sending nudes to one of her horse dick exes. A fucking Chad. I'm emotionally destroyed. It doesn't feel real yet, so I have trouble accepting it's over. But it is. Guess I'm returning that ring and getting a PS5. Appreciate all the advice.*",

But honestly I\u2019d talk about it sober, they might not be easy topics you wanna bring up again but at the end of the day she\u2019s ur fianc\u00e9 and u should be able to talk about anything with her. So talk to her and if she really loves you, she won\u2019t cheat on you and be promiscuous, it might be hard to trust after hearing that but if she\u2019s genuinely in love with you and ready to be in a serious relationship she won\u2019t even think about cheating. \nAnd honestly you can still have some good sex with an average size dick, like yes that matters to some point but really the connection and communication plays a big role! Because one of my ex\u2019s I had the best sex with was on the smaller side so be creative and try new things and tell her not to worry about ur asthma and maybe try to joke about it so it doesn\u2019t become an awkward thing.",

        "selftext": "Hello, Reddit, this is u/spez, your usually confident CEO. But today, I'm here in a different capacity, as a fellow Redditor who's made a big oopsie. So here it goes... TIFU by deciding to eliminate third-party apps, and as a result, unintentionally creating a crisis for our beloved platform.\n\nLike most TIFUs, it started with good intentions. I wanted to centralize user experience, enhance quality control, and create uniformity. I thought having everyone on the official app would simplify things and foster a better, more unified Reddit experience.\n\nBut oh, how I was wrong.\n\nFirst, the backlash was instant and palpable. Users and moderators alike expressed concerns about the utility and convenience that these third-party apps offered. I heard stories of how some apps like RiF had become an integral part of their Reddit journey, especially for moderators who managed communities big and small.\n\nThen came the real shocker. In protest, moderators began to set their subreddits to private. Some of the largest, most active corners of Reddit suddenly went dark. The impact was more significant than I'd ever anticipated.\n\nFrustration mounted, and so did regret. This wasn't what I wanted. I never intended to disrupt the community spirit that defines Reddit or make the jobs of our volunteer moderators harder.\n\nYet, here we are.\n\nI've made a monumental miscalculation in assessing how much these third-party apps meant to our community. I didn't realize the extent to which they were woven into the fabric of our daily Reddit operations, particularly for our moderators.\n\nIn short, I messed up. I didn't fully understand the consequences of my decision, and now Reddit and its communities are bearing the brunt of it.\n\nSo, here's my TIFU, Reddit. It's a big one, and I'm still grappling with the fallout. But if there's one thing I know about this platform, it's that we're a community. We're in this together, and we'll figure it out together.\n\nI'm listening. Let's talk.\n\nTL;DR - Tried to unify Reddit under the official app, phased out third-party apps, caused chaos, possibly destabilized the platform, and learned a lesson about the value of diverse user experiences.\n\nEdit: a word\n\nNote: this is a parody",

        "selftext": "My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman\u2019s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. \n\nAbout three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. \n\nWell, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?\u201d Well, my son isn\u2019t really a fighter. He\u2019s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he\u2019s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. \n\nNow, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he\u2019s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don\u2019t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. \n\nThe next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. \u201cHave you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.\u201d I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. \u201cI warned him.\u201d I was so proud. \n\nHe had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. \n\nTL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn\u2019t think he would and he did it.\n\nEDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn\u2019t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn\u2019t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn\u2019t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully\u2019s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. \n\nEDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he\u2019s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!\n\nEDIT THREE: Thanks for the precious metals! And holy shit! Front page?!?!",

            "Not sure how this is a TIFU. Honestly just a great story",
            "Yeah the bully deserved it. In my books if someone hits you first then swing away. \n\nDid the school punish the kid who dislodged the bar? In my books that is something that should have been handled, especially if it caused another surgery.",
            "You need to make a formal complaint to the school board.\n\nYour son acted in self defence after being punched, he should not be suspended, his teacher should be suspended for letting this go on.\n\nI\u2019m proud of your son too.",
            "You did the right thing honestly. The school is in the wrong in this case. But be proud that your son defended himself.",
            "I tell my son (13) and daughter (7) that they will never be in trouble for defending themselves no matter what the school says, but I didn't always take that stance.\n\nI used to tell them that under no circumstances were they to hit other kids, until my son came home in tears with anger...a kid moved to their school who had \"issues\" and he was basically riding rough shod over the teachers and kids in his class, which up to then had been in perfect harmony, apparently they were all colouring in and the shithead said \"this pen is blue\" to which my son looked up and said \"it's grey\" ...long story short, shithead explodes and attacks my kid, having to be dragged off him by the teacher as he tried to strangle him. \n\nI got a call from the school; \"Mr Bollicks, there was a wee incident in school today, shithead got upset and there was a little bit of an altercation, nothing to worry about, just letting you know.\" So I think \"OK I'll talk to kidder when he gets home\" \n\nThen I get the full story, so I told him \"Remember when I told you never to hit? Forget it all, Dad was being too soft, the minute someone puts their hands on you, you light them up on the spot...OK?\" \n\n\"OK Dad.\"\n\nNow, I was an amateur boxer in my day and also did some Judo and 6 months of JJ, so I know a little bit when it comes to unarmed combat, obviously I have a great respect for martial arts and had been showing my son a few things so he had the tools in his box should he need them, and self discipline, hoping to give him a bit of knowledge before sending him to a gym or Dojo. \n\nFFWD 3 weeks, I get a call from the headmistress; \"Mr Bollicks there has been a serious incident resulting in BabyBollicks punching shithead to the ground, this sort of behaviour is unacceptable in our school and we are suspending him for 3 days\" I asked what led to this happening as I don't think my wee man would instigate violence; \"Well...shithead hit him with a chair and tried to strangle him again, and we will be dealing with it...\" \"Let me stop you there, I told my son that if anyone was to put their hands on him again that he was to let them have it,  far from being in trouble, he is going to McDonald's tonight and the cinema, also you realise that the action of putting both hands around someone's neck is usually a stark warning of serious intent to harm? In an 8 year old that is terrifying, and maybe shithead needs moved to your unit where he can get the care he needs rather than disrupting 32 other kids who get along fine? I'm going to the board with this\" \n\nAnd as if by magic it all disappeared and my kids know that dad always has their back, so double down OP, fuck that bully.\n\nEdit; when I was training my son the problem was that he was afraid of hitting people, not getting hit, I remember being like that when I started in the gym, it always took me a couple of shots to wake up and get into the flow of the fight.\n\n\nEdit; forgot to add that shithead turned out to be molesting his kid brother and sister, he got caught doing it at the bottom of his garden one day and the whole story came out. Aged 9 and all that shit going on.",
            "As somebody who took the bullying and didn't want to involve my parents when I was in school, this is the best outcome.",
            "Wait, wait wait. So your son was punched and had to go get surgery to put it back. So the bully doesn't even get punished for that? BUT Your son gets suspended for decking out the kid for giving him surgery needed injuries. LITERALLY SUE THE FUCKING SCHOOL. Like Idf care what country or state you live in, its 1000% the schools fault for even allowing that to happen.",

            "This is indeed a TIFU, but it seems you don\u2019t even realize why.  \n\nIt would be great if it wasn\u2019t for his medical condition.  But your kid was cleared for easy stuff.  If he can\u2019t ride a skate board or bike, then he can\u2019t fight.  He can throw a punch, but can he take one?  Not to the chest he can\u2019t.",
            "This only qualifies as a TIFU for the bully.\n\nBut, great story! A+ and worth the three days for your son.\n\nMy point being called into the office would have been to ask why the bullying was allowed to continue for so long by the other kid to illicit the response.",

            "Jesus christ. I had the nuss procedure done as well and I cringed when I read he had one of the bars dislodged. The pain after surgery was incredible, the most pain I've been in and it lasted a month or more. Having one of those bars dislodged was a huge fear of mine.",
            "My dad's small group church pastor had 6 sons, all adopted. He always told them if someone was bullying them in any physical way to tell the bully three times to stop, then they could fight them. I love this rule, they've only used it a couple times, but one time was to defend a much younger family friend of theirs. All six of them told the bully to stop three times, when he didn't, all six of them jumped him. Good job OP.",
            "Honestly you should seek legal action against the school of your child has been assaulted every day in class and the teacher isn't there with the children...",
            "Bruh don't listen to all these idiots. \nYou really really fucked up,  you horrible idiot. \nWhy?  Because pectum excavatum is NOT a joke.  Your son beat the bully and he was LUCKY that it didn't turn into a situation where the bully could hit your younger son in chest or some of friends of the bully might have hit.  It could have gone wrong VERY EASILY and since kids are pretty much unaware of when is 'too much' or whether the person in front has a problem,  your son could have very well taken a kick with boots on his chest and this could have damaged his heart.  Not joking.  Sternal fractures. In pectum excavatum and especially when there is a metal bar behind are NOT SAFE.  Your son could have been to a emergency had this gone even a little bit astray. \nFighting seems cool till you realize that in a condition like this,  the mere immaturity of bullies and kids in general could have lead to something entirely entirely dreadful. \nThe mature thing would have been to talk to school and believe me,  school does give a fuck when it comes to things which can lead to someones death and school being shut down,  they take it seriously.",
            "This is the only way bullies learn... I don't see a TIFU at all....",
            "I have pectus excavatum, while it\u2019s not as severe as your sons, it did have an affect on my self esteem. I\u2019m 24 years old now and it is in the back of my mind that it\u2019ll never be fully fixed but it doesn\u2019t affect the way I live.\n\nWhen you talk to your son again can you tell him a 24 year old stranger from the internet has the same condition and he says don\u2019t worry about it at all. Take your mind off of it and don\u2019t take shit from no one (I can see he\u2019s started already which is good). \n\nIf anything, this condition will help him be a wiser, kinder, and more sympathetic to others.",
            "The kid is in trouble and the wife is suddenly like: \u2018go pick up YOUR son\u2019 lmao",
            "I was picked on alot in school. My father had a talk with me about standing up for myself and self defense.  I was bigger than most kids so i used that advantage. I got suspened a few times for fighting different bullies.One day a kid  was insulting my mother and i snapped.i had my hand on his neck pinned against wall with his feet off the ground ready to punch his face when a teacher grabbed my arm. I got suspended 3 days. My dad was proud of me lol. Found out other kid got nothing. My dad stormed into office(retired military) and ripped the principal for about 10 min. Other kid was promptly called to office and suspended 3 days. I never really had issues after that.\n\nYou better believe ill put the fear of god in any principal that fucks with my kids lol",
            "I have that condition. The doctor's recommended against that surgery due to proximity to lungs and heart. Wish they had done it anyways: It makes even the smallest of colds a huge ordeal since I can't expel mucus as efficiently as a normal person. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCongrats to your son for sticking up for himself and making new friends.",
            "\u201cWe won\u2019t suspend this horrible child who punches a somewhat disabled kid every day, but we\u2019ll suspend the disabled kid who\u2019s had enough and decides to fight back.\u201d",
            "You didn\u2019t fuck up at all. Your dealing with the consequences of a broken system. There is absolutely room for violence with bullies.\n\nAs a kid who thought he had to always take it, bullies do not back down unless they are challenged.\n\nI even considered suicide because I thought I was trapped between teachers who I couldn\u2019t talk to and bullies who wouldn\u2019t give up.",
            "As an school psychologist in training, I would never condone violence as an answer. But I will ALWAYS promote self defense. Good for him for standing up for himself. I once had to do the same to a kid who bullied me relentlessly (punching, kicking, ripping chunks of hair out, etc). My mom attempted to handle it and addressed both the kid and his mother, but what finally stopped him was when I punched him in the face. After that day, neither he nor his group of friends harassed me. \n\nThat being said...one of the most effective ways to combat bullying is to address the bystanders. When bystanders help someone being bullied, it creates a force against the bully. \n\nTeach your kids to help others, people.",
            "3 day suspension is better than seeing your son with depression or hanging in a closet with rope on his kneck. \n\nBullies don't care about your feelings and the only way to get them to stop is by getting physical. I don't want to meet a guy who isn't proud of his son standing up for himself.\n\nI grew up with a personality and looks of someone who would get bullied a lot. But every single time someone tried to do something to me I would do anything to stand my ground like kick or punch. They would think twice about messing with me after that.",
            "I would of sued the kids parents who thought it was okay to let him punch a kid post surgery and had to have surgery again because of it",
            "Your son rules he handled business so the bullys next victim who might not be able to doesn't have to. Good job!",
            "While violence isn\u2019t the answer, a lesson was learned by the kid your son hit. I would make sure the school and his teacher knows that your sons action was the result of him being hit by this other kid repeatedly. There is something to be said about an eye for an eye.\n\nEdit:  Based on the replies I got, I want to clarify -  I do believe in situations like this in an eye for an eye and self defense. To add, your son learned one of the most important lessons that he could: to stand up for himself and not take anyone\u2019s shit.",
            "[deleted]",
            "Your kid did what all of us who was bullied did (or wished to do in some sad cases).\n\nNow talk to him about it.\nHe's a nice kid and defending himself is a good thing.\nBut warn him about not doing this on any small provocation, or he can become a bully without knowing.\n\nGetting bullied can leave some scars on him, but as long as he has a good family support ( and by the post i think he does) he should be fine.",
            "I don\u2019t see the fuck up. It\u2019s a validation post.\n\nYour son protected himself in the way he had to. I am 100% for resolving conflict without shouting or violence but some people are just pieces of crap, and the only thing that will get them to stop hurting *you*, is to make it hurt for *them*, if they do!\n\nWhat would make you the asshole is if you retroactively try to remove this permission. If you threw your kid under the bus and weren\u2019t the first person to say \u201cI told him to do that\u201d. If you punished your son. Even if you just didn\u2019t support him.\n\nI worry a lot more about the conflict he must be feeling right now, than about some little shit who makes a habit of abusing sick/injured/disabled classmates. He deserved a lot more than one punch and your son deserves a pizza and video games night.\n\nI grew up with parents who never ever wanted me to defend myself. To this day, they want me to live as a doormat and there is no situation, no matter how wrong or criminal, where they would encourage me to stand up for myself, or have my back and stand up for me on my behalf.  It has killed my confidence and set me up for a lifetime of being bullied and taken advantage of.  I try my best to cope through it, but since I never had the tools in the first place, I\u2019m often unsuccessful.\n\nIMO you did the absolute right thing by supporting he stand up for himself in self defense. But now is when your support and reaction matters the most.  If you punish him for following your advice or you threw him under the bus, that\u2019s wrong. \n\nIf you continue to support him, which you have to to reinforce the positive parts of this and keep his trust, just make it clear that hitting should be self defense and a last resort.  \n\nYou should be proud of him. As someone with many disabilities, injuries that won\u2019t heal, and a terminal illness, I am now frightened basically all the time. I used to do martial arts, now I need a wheelchair. The ability to know you can defend yourself, physically and mentally, is priceless.\n\nEven if your son is healing well, I can assure you that it is much more daunting to go into a fight when your attacker has a major physical advantage. So it took extra fortitude for him to do this. Have his back, OP! Don\u2019t be an asshole!",

            "My ex had this condition. He didn\u2019t tell me until after we got intimate. Never went shirtless or wore a fitting shirt because he is conscious about it. While he was never bullied because of it, he\u2019s pitied by every living person that knows about this.\n\nI didn\u2019t care much. Sometimes I asked him to lie down across my lap, I placed a tissue and pour chips/popcorn. Great use of a bf lol ;p\n\nThink I\u2019m the only one who didnt pitied him and adjusted to it so well that he doesn\u2019t mind being an involuntary bowl sometimes.",
            "Problem with school is they always only see the last person doing the hitting. They don't care about back story's.\n\nI gave my son permission to rectify his bully issue. He has ADHD and is on Vyvanse so it makes him not really care but emotional some times. I told him to do what he had to do and I will take care of the school. I sent him to school without his meds so he was clear headed on what he wanted to do if the situation arised. When I got the the call to come in after my son punched the kid and broke his nose, I walked in and I wasnt even looking at the principal. I asked my son if he started it and he said \"no but I finished it\" I told him I'll take him out for ice cream and I was proud of him for standing up to the bully. They escorted my son out so we could talk one on one with the principal. The principal told me I wasn't a good parent and that I shouldn't have taught him to do what he did. I had to explain that we complained several times to the school about kids being bullied and they did nothing about it. A good parent is backing your kids in almost any situation but know when not to. This was a backable situation. I have no regrets allowing my son to do what he did and I would do it again.",
            "This is pretty close to what happened to me in my sophomore year of high school. I am a second degree black belt in Taekwondo and managed to receive my first black belt fairly young. There was a kid that bullied me all the time. He wouldn't stop telling everyone that he was going to \"Fuck me up\". I finally had enough and asked my Dad if I could do something about it without worrying about getting into trouble at home and my Pops told me to call him out first. (His thinking was that the kid would puss out and just stop his BS.) The next morning I actually walked to HIS bus stop to tell him that I wanted to handle our issues and he reveled in it haha. Great plan Dad! Yea this guy was so ready to fight me. We ended up waiting until after school and I even rode his bus home while they all barked at me from the back telling me I was going to get fucked up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got off the bus, waited for his to drop his school supplies so it was a fair fight, and then slammed his ass on the ground. I started on the Varsity wrestling team that year and I don't think anyone realized how hard that kid hit the ground. I let him get up and connected a few times. Split his face open pretty bad.\n\nHe told everyone at school that I hit him with rocks.\n\nI wasn't his only victim but I ended up making a few great friends after that as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStand up to your bully.",

I always held the office of the FCC to be an office of great respect, dignity, and responsibility.  I would never do anything to violate the rules of the FCC and I work hard to defend them.  The FCC has all of our best interest in mind and its role is to defend the spectrum against those who might cause it harm.\n\nNow I know that none of that was true.  It is easy to determine, by observation, that the office is run by people who have been paid for and will personally benefit greatly by harming the public.  And that's exactly what they are going to do.  They will do the thing that benefits themselves most.  I treated that office as if it had integrity and now I found out that it has none, and it's like finding out that my dad was cheating on my mom.  I've been personally hurt by this.",

The same consumer who is paying isp but is taking YOUR IDEAS and then selling them for more profit.

With that being said I\u2019m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. \n\nWe have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.\nThe previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? \nThe next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. \nI typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my \u201cintentions\u201d where with the video and that he\u2019s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before.

Wife and I looked into the symptoms and there was practically no hope of him making a recovery, so she asked me to euthanize him.  Looking into methods, it seemed pretty agreed upon that the most effective and quick way to euthanize a fish was blunt force trauma.\n\nNow, when I was a kid my family were huge anglers, and I was designated as the fish killer when it was time to cook them.  Back then, I was told to slam them on the ground as hard as I could.  Well, my 8 year old body wasnt strong enough to kill them instantaneously so I had to do it multiple times.  Honestly it kind of fucked me up a little.\n\nFlash forward to last night, I didn't want that happening again and I wanted it to be painless.  I asked my wife to leave the room because she was very upset and I chose to do the deed by putting the fish in a plastic grocery bag and slamming it on the counter as hard as I possibly could.\n\nThe poor fish was absolutely obliterated.  The force ripped open the bag and sprayed bits of what used to be a goldfish in every direction.  Told my wife to stay upstairs and she started getting suspicious so she comes down after 5 minutes and its just everywhere still.  On the counter, on the stove, on the fridge, on the freaking Christmas tree we still have up, I was still finding pieces of it this morning.  Wife was aghast and traumatized.  Cried until she went to bed.\n\nTL;DR I euthanized my wife's dying fish quickly but in the most visually traumatizing way possible.",

            "That is hilarious and sad. I grew up in the country doing the same shit to rabbits that we'd shot but not killed, and learned how to rip birds' heads off from hunting dove. Probably messed me up a bit too. Fast-forward about 10 years to college. Riding in a car with a girl going to veterinary school. As we're nearing the on-ramp to the highway, she sees a pigeon that was fucked up, flopping around on the side of the road and what not. She pulls over and puts the poor guy in her trunk to see if she could do anything. She couldn't, bird was all broken up. So she and the other guy start talking about how to put it out of its misery--their best idea was to set it under the car tire and run it over. I said I could just pop its head off, she said really, I said sure and just picked it up and--pop. Their jaws fucking dropped. They couldn't believe it, thought I was terrible, and so on. They were cool after a bit, but it was definitely one of those moments when the brutality of my upbringing slammed headlong into the more sheltered sensibilities of my friends.",

After lockdown ended in my country there\u2019s been a huge sale at my local laser hair removal clinic and so I thought fuck it, I might as well go for it.\nSo I paid for my 10 visits and set off for the first one, a little nervous but excited for my new, hairless body. Now I decided it would be a great idea to get a full Brazilian, allll the way from front to back. Pretty normal right?\n\nThe lovely nurse comes in and gives me a brief heads up, explains how it all works sorta thing. So she leaves the room, leaving me to strip down. She comes back in, and decides that we are going to laser away the hair around my asshole first. All well and good right?\n\nSo the instructions I\u2019m given are \u201clay on your right side, and use your left hand to pull up your bum cheek\u201d\n\nSo here I am, lying on my side, hand pulling up my bum while this lady sticks a laser round my asshole. Now, on my left hand, I wear this gorgeous silver ring with a bright blue gem- it was handmade by my best friends boyfriend so it\u2019s pretty unique.\n\nSo this lady saw my gorgeous ring, and decided to break the awkward silence with a \u201cthat\u2019s a cute ring you have there\u201d.\n\nAnd of course, I happened to forget I was wearing the damn ring. It just made sense in my head that this nurse was complimenting the ring of my asshole. Yeah. I know.\n\nSo, still on my side, I tell her \u201cthank you! It\u2019ll be a lot nicer when it\u2019s hairless lol\u201d\n\nCue awkward laugh and then silence, until I realised that she was not, in fact, talking about my bum. Finished the rest of the appointment without speaking and dashed out of there as soon as possible. Still recovering.\n\nTL;DR: my laser hair removal complimented my ring on my finger while doing laser hair removal on my asshole, and I thought she was saying I had a cute asshole\n\nEdit: clarity\n\nEdit: for everyone asking, this is the [ring](https://imgur.com/uqhSqij). It\u2019s not super intricate but I was more impressed that it was handmade and the stone is pretty imo.\nFor everyone asking, my friends boyfriend has started a jewellery business and I bought the ring to support them- nothing funny going on there.",

            "Oh hey, a situation similar to one I experienced as a teenager. I didn't think I'd ever share this with anyone, but what the hell, if not now when? So I had to get a physical as a teenager, and had recently started experimenting with shaving the downstairs and was still pretty uncertain about it. I had also recently decided to shave my head completely bald, down to the skin. At one point the doctor is doing their thing down there and decided to try and make small talk, so they asked what made me decide to shave my head. I was mentally preoccupied with self consciousness (because I felt I was fairly young to be shaving my junk and wasn't sure if I was going to be judged, teenager overthinking and shit) so of course they mention shaving and that's where my mind went. Not a single part of my brain thought of the fact that my head was shaved, I just heard head and was so mentally preoccupied that I assumed they meant the *other* head (all I remember thinking was that's a weird way to refer to someone's bits). So I replied with something non committal about preferences and added \"the hair grows back fast too, that's only a few days growth.\" At the time there was absolutely no hair on my head, not even a little bristle, so there's no way they didn't know I was talking about my junk. It wasn't until I was lying in bed that night that I had the oh shit moment and realized there was no chance in hell they were talking about my shaven genitals, when I certainly was. The small talk attempts stopped immediately after my comment, and in the moment I was just thankful to not have to make idle chit chat while being examined, but it was definitely an awkward silence on the doctor's part in hindsight. I occasionally remember this and die a little inside. I wonder if that doctor was more selective about small talk after that?",

I saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. A lot of women I know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.\n\nA bit later, I got around to talking to her. I complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. She looked very confused, said \u201cmy skirt doesn\u2019t have pockets, why would you think that?\u201d I mentioned that I had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. Her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. What I thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.\n\nI apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she\u2019d never heard that comment before. I\u2019m still dying inside though.\n\nTL DR; Complimented a girl on having a skirt with pockets, turns out she just didn\u2019t have a hand.",

The students were supposed to take their own prints, and she came to me, looking worried, and asked if it was OK if she only printed one of her hands. At which point things finally clicked, and I realized she wasn't one of those people who wear impractically baggy sweatshirts to go with their Uggs, but that she only had one working hand, and had been self-consciously hiding it all along.\n\nShe sat all the way in the back and never asked for help, which initially made me think she simply didn't care and was satisfied with turning in below-average work.

Immediately, the clerk realized what was really the case - that my friend didn't have that arm - and blushed and started apologizing profusely.  You could tell it was one of those situations where as soon as she started saying, \"Hey, are you cold.....?\", she realized what was actually the situation but it was too late to stop the words coming out.

Today. I did not. \n\nI couldn't tell you why my dumb ass decided to just fold the plastic over a few times and place it back on the shelf, but here we are.\n\nSo my spouse comes running down in their few minutes between endless meetings to make their lunch quickly. We are the only two in our house, plus our little rescue dog who was a stray and an absolute MOOCH.\n\nI mean, this dog will weave between your feet, eyes GLUED to the floor hoping for even a single speck of crum because woe is him he's never been fed a day in his life.\n\nSo we're all in the kitchen, I hear the fridge open, and it suddenly dawns on me in horror that my spouse is MOST DEFINITELY going to go for those hotdogs I wrapped like a dumbass.\n\nI quickly turn around to say something, and my spouse in slow motion, wide-eyed stares at me as the hotdog package unrolls like a fruit-by-the-foot commerical and DOUSES my dog's entire skull in too-much-to-be-reasonable-in-one-fucking-package of hotdog water.\n\nMy dog lost his SHIT.\n\nLike a Christian grandma with the second coming of Christ my dog just tears ass across the entire apartment with the worst case of the zoomies I think we've ever seen him have.\n\nHe proceeds to spend the next 15 mins singing our praises as the greatest humans alive as he rolls across every piece of furniture we own.\n\nI'm talking every. Piece. Of. Furniture.\n\nNow I don't hate hotdogs but the smell is weirdly  overpowering, and every time I sat down on something else all I can smell is godforsaken hotdogs.\n\nMy dog loves it though. And now I'm figuring out how to shampoo out hotdog water from my life. I have so many regrets.\n\nTLDR: My dumb ass didn't seal a package of hotdogs properly and my spouse accidentally dumped hotdog water all over my dog's head and now I'm living in a hotdog smelling hellhole because my dog decided to excitedly roll on EVERYTHING we own. But at least he's having the best damn day of his life because of it. I probably hate hotdogs now.\n\nEdit: Oh my gosh I'm trying to go through all the comments! I'm so glad so many of you got a good laugh out of this too! I don't know what awards do, but I want to thank you kind folks for being so cool. <3\n\nEdit 2: I didn't know how to add the doggo tax so I posted pics in the comments!",

            "I had a wonderful redbone hound who was nearly starved as a puppy. As a result, he was never food secure, though I think we gave him a great home for about eleven years. About once a year, he would decide, \"Damn the consequences, that food is so good the it is worth whatever might happened.\" Once he ate a dozen chocolate covered donuts and ran and pooped for a solid day. He did get the Christmas Turkey leftovers off the stove while everyone else was looking at the baby. It was a lot of turkey. His biggest near heist? We are Brethren and observe Love Feast which is a ceremony that reflects the Lord's Last Supper. In our tradition, we eat roast beef and my wife had prepared four large boneless roasts and had left them to cool. I was watching the dog pretty carefully and he acted like he needed to go to the bathroom. He was actually deeking me. As I went for his leash, he dived at the roasts...I was able to intercept him in mid air (he was 70 pounds, it was not particularly easy) and Love Feast was saved.  Bo, who I have missed terribly, would have told you that sometimes you just have to take your shot at life.",

My basset hound mix (she\u2019s got the short stubby legs) who is by far the dumbest animal I\u2019ve ever met. She repeatedly runs into screen doors and glass doors because she\u2019s too excited to go outside. She throws her food around in the air and chases it around. But she\u2019s also a pig.

Well, she decided to pull a chair out from our table enough so she could get onto it, pull the Tupperware down, chew it open, and eat all 40 pieces of meat inside the tub within a matter of under a minute. My dad and I came in giggling before coming to a complete stop, to see my fat chubby mutt laying on the ground surrounded by grease and bits of meat.

I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  \n\nI made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I'm a 4'11\" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! \n\nI panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I'm calling the police (total bluff because I didn't have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna's neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  \n\nSo, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  \n\nTL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",

He noticed some kids toys but knew our other cousin and her kid had been staying there, so thought nothing of it. \n\nWhile he was waiting, decided to call his dad and asked where grandma was. He said she was at home. My cousin explained, not she wasn\u2019t, because he was in her house and she wasn\u2019t here. His dad asked if he was at her new place? Cousin had no idea what he was talking about. Turns out my grandma had moved recently and a new family with kids moved into her old place, the place my cousin had just let himself into.\n\nHe booked it out of there quick smart, and we never found out if the new owners realised someone had been in their house while they were out.

On this day I needed to go to a fire station and ride with the firefighter paramedics and get some on the job training. I was told what station to go to and I GPS\u2019d it the day before to make sure I knew where to go. I drove passed what looked like a run down fire station but I didn\u2019t judge because this was a small town in Texas. \n\nThe next morning at like 545 I showed up at this fire station and found no lights on in the front of the station so I had to go around to the back. I found the door and it was open so I let myself in. It was dark minus the TV on. I had no idea what was going on. There was no one in this small room which I thought was the common area. In my mind I thought to myself maybe they\u2019re all asleep. It was early and fire alarms are loud. So I walked towards the garage where the trucks would be. There was a door with a glass window that looked out into the garage. When I peeked through there was no trucks at all. Just looked like a storage facility or something. I thought to myself where the hell are the ambulances and fire trucks? I walked down the hall and back in the common area and then I saw a man walking around only in his boxers. In the dark I said \u201cHello sir! I\u2019m here for my clinical rotation!\u201d He freaks out and goes \u201cHoly shit!\u201d I introduced myself and extended my hand for a shake. He said \u201cWhat? What are you doing?\u201d I looked confused but explained that I arranged with the Captain to be here at 6 to start my rotation. He said very sternly \u201cDude....this is a decommissioned fire house. This is MY house. \u201c Well my heart sank. I said \u201cI...I....I\u2019m so so sorry. My gps told me this was the place. Man I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He said it was alright and he was cool about it. Thank goodness. I called the firehouse and asked for the appropriate address. Probably should\u2019ve done that sooner.

I'm 23M and my female friend, whom I've known for the most part of my life is currently 22. \nI still remember us playing every day as little kids to hanging out almost everyday as teenagers, we often went on vacation together either with my or her parents. \nShe was sort of like the sister I never had, and people now hearing that I got her pregnant feels almost like it's illegal. \n\nA few months ago, I was at her apartment both of us super drunk, and  yeah it somehow just happened. \nIt was good, so I guess in the following weeks it accidentally happened quite often\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\nWe did use condoms , but she isn't on birthcontrol.\nHow the hell did she get pregnant. \nI know that there are a few, who even get pregnant on birthcontrol, but never thought it would happen to   us.\n She took 5 pregnancy tests and 1 week later went to the gynecologist, who comfirmed.\nWe both can't bring it on ourselves to abort the baby, so we're keeping it, we're financially stable so I don't think it would be a problem.\n\nWe're planning on telling our parents this evening, so akward since they've seen me grow up with her etc. The only one who's been shipping us since day one, was her grandma lol\n. Still can't believe I'll have to spent 18 years of my life ,well it's not even 18 years it's a life commitment lol.\n\nTL:DR Got my childhood friend\ud83e\udd30\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd30\ud83c\udffe\n\nFor those of you suggesting me to get a partenity test. : \nYes she even told me she doesn't mind if I'm doubting that the child is mine, since the scenario is somehow unlikely. She told me she didn't sleep with another guy for the last 2 months. \nI'll be taking a paternity test, but I'm already 99% sure that child is mine.\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nOk guys, I just went with her to her parents house, we actually wanted to go in the evening as I said, but the sooner the better I guess. \nI was really nervous ,her dad was working in the garden and her mom was cleaning around the house. After thirty minutes, everyone was gathered in the kitchen, so we thought a better opportunity wouldn't come. We told them and I could see the horror in their eyes lol. \n\nIdk they seemed kinda happy, but also shocked.\n Her mom started tearing up, so I guess she's either happy or disappointed.\n Her dad asked why we didn't tell them that we're ,,dating\" and my god that was such an akward moment because both of us didn't reply, (akward silence). \n\nThey were asking a bunch of questions, and we even called her grandma telling her that her prediction was right. We made up an excuse and left, later on in the car she gave me a kiss and told me that she was proud of me, the whole drive her hand was resting on my thigh.\n Like does that mean she likes me?? I don't want to misinterpret anything to make things even worse. She's a very very kind person in general, so a bunch of guys always thought she liked them meanwhile she was only being nice.\n\n\n\nFinal UPDATE:\n\nOkay Guys that'll be my final update, maybe if I remember I'll update in 9 months let's see. \n\nI discussed everything with her that needed to be discussed. We're planning on moving together when she's 6-7months pregnant, and we'll just see how it works. We both admitted to having feelings for eachother, so we'll just see were it goes, and leave our relationship how it is bestfriends, who live together and fuck I guess. \n\nThanks for all the encouragment, this post shouldn't even be on TIFU anymore lol. I'm kinda excited on being a father.\n\nAnd btw she's reading the comments......\n\n*To clarify, apparently a few didn't get it,yes we are dating*\n\nBestfriend+ fuck= Dating\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nHey Guys, It\u2018s been awhile.\n\nAlmost forgot about this post. I\u2018ve received alot of nice messages, unfortunately I couldn\u2018t reply to all of them, since it were alot.\n\nAnyways here is the Update, can\u2018t lie but those months were definetly more stressful and complicated than I expected them to be, considering Us being so young , nontheless it was all worth it the first time I held my little baby girl in my arms.\n\nWe didn\u2018t know the gender of our baby, since we wanted it to be a surprise.  When it comes to gender I don\u2018t necesseraly have a preference, but I\u2018d be lying if I said I never wanted to be a girl dad .\n\nAnd for anyone wondering if she\u2018s my child , Yes she is haha, she even inherited  a family illness of mine (not saying that\u2018s good)\n\nSo I think the question most of you want answered is, what happened between me and my bestfriend ?\n\nWell we did move in together , which was definetly a financial burden for us, and money in some months is really  tight, since we pay everything out of our own pocket. (I don\u2018t really like the idea of using our parents money, even if this would help us alot)\n\nI found it sort of funny how people were actually believing that I was this oblivious, which I actually wasn\u2018t haha. Well maybe a bit, realizing she has been dropping hints, since we were like 16 .\n\nBut yeah there isn\u2018t much to Update, I feel like I mainly highlighted the negative consequences , but it\u2018s honestly pretty awesome too. \nThe best feeling is to find a Bestfriend in a Lover, and I couldn\u2018t imagine loving anyone as much as I love her. \n\n\nThat\u2018s it have a nice day :)",

But we took time to see if we would work as a couple but went in agreeing it wasn't guaranteed or necessary to be a couple just bc we were having kids together (surprise, it ended up being twins!). Seen too many ppl who try to force a relationship just bc of kids when they are a bad match and thus it's bad for the kids.\nBut taking that time we forged a good friendship and saw we had all the right comparability that we really wanted in a partner that we likely wouldn't haven't realized otherwise. The situation also forced us into total honesty, so there were no games and just good, open communication.\nIf this girl is your long-time friend, you're already steps further ahead than we were.\n\nEmbrace the honest communication and be open to it working out, but also open to not staying together if it isn't working for you two. You can still be great and active parents to this child even if not a couple, but that still starts with good communication. \nGood luck!",

            "This actually happened to me as well.\nWe were good friends growing up, and our families knew each other very well. I always was attracted to her, but felt a dating relationship would ruin our friendship, plus I didn\u2019t think she was attracted to me.\nOne day she asked me to come over, and we hung out, and she asked would I ever sleep with her. I told her I only would if it meant saving humanity. Fast-forward a couple weekends later she asked me to come over again because she had contractors working on the house for a few days. I went, and stayed a few days and we ended up doing the dirty on the second day. After that we kept doing it, almost daily sometimes multiple times a day. She ended up pregnant less than a few months later, and we both agreed to co-parenting. By the time our baby was delivered we were dating, and to this day we are married, and our families are still extremely close. I don\u2019t think it could\u2019ve went any better to be honest looking back at everything. The woman I grew up playing with on the same street as me, with extremely close families ended up being the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. It was a real easy, and smooth transition for us. No \u201cmeeting the parents\u201d, or any of that other stuff with other relationships. I believe our friendship it what makes our relationship so strong, because deep down we\u2019re really good friends, and I believe that gave us a stable foundation to raise our family on.\n\nI wish the best of luck to you, and the baby, and your friend going forward.",

I had to use the restroom, so stayed downstairs while she went up to bed. While I was sitting on the toilet I got a text: \"Bring a bucket and a mop.\"\n\nCrap, one of my kids must have thrown up. I finished my toilet biz and went down to the basement to check the cleaning supplies. I found a bucket, but couldn't find a mop. i found one of those squeezy sponge things, but the sponge was missing. Figuring the vomit was probably congealing by this point, I just grabbed the bucket and a bunch of paper towels and ran upstairs.\n\nI got to the upstairs bathroom and found no mess. I carried the cleaning supplies down to my kids rooms, but found no vomit. I went to our bedroom and found my wife lying on the bed. She asked what had taken me so long, and I said I couldn't find a mop, and where was the mess?\n\nShe started rolling around on the bed laughing. Suddenly I realized \"Bring a bucket and a mop\" was a line from \"WAP (Wet Ass Pussy).\" My wife had been in the mood, and I had spent 15 minutes looking for a mop in the basement. \n\nShe was laughing so much that the mood was basically dead. \n\nTL;DR: My wife texted me a line from a Cardi B song to tell me she was in the mood. I thought she wanted me to bring cleaning supplies because a kid threw up.",

            "I\u2019ve laughed so hard I\u2019ve had a wheezing fit.\n\nI remember scrolling through a friends camera with him, looking at a shoot we had been working on for our degree and then it going to a day at the beach with all of us etc.\n\nScrolled one more and...his girlfriend. Fully nude. Finger in mouth. Other finger elsewhere. Lying in bed. He went white as a sheet, said \u201cOops, I\u2019ll take that back\u201d and we just looked at each other for a moment. \n\nThis story just took me back",

            "First off, dude, I\u2019m dying laughing and cringing simultaneously. \n\nSecond, it\u2019ll be hilarious in a few years so have a sense of humor about it. Don\u2019t sweat it",
            "When I worked at a gas station a guy came up to the register texting on his phone. He set the phone down face up while he put his items on the counter, and his finger accidentally scrolled up in the chat. As I\u2019m grabbing items I happen to glance at his phone and see that it had stopped scrolling on a photo of his girlfriend fingering herself in the shower. He saw my eyes widen, looked down, and flipped the phone upside down. When he glanced back up and met my eye he said \u201cI don\u2019t think you were supposed to see that\u201d and I couldn\u2019t help laughing. Thankfully that seemed to break the tension and we finished the transaction both laughing. As he walked out the door he called his gf and I heard \u201cBabe, you\u2019re not going to believe what just...\u201d before the door closed behind him.",
            "Look on the bright side. At least it\u2019s ur family that saw it and not hers lol. Also why would u record yourself fingering her?",
            "It\u2019s a bit late for this, but in the future- Apple does have a folder to hide those kinds of pics \ud83d\ude02",

            "Oh dear. To avoid future embarrassments, you can choose to hide photos and they won\u2019t make it to those memory videos.",
            "Better than Tifu by showing my girlfriend a short video of me fingering my family.",

And I may not be alive much longer, because I\u2019m probably going to be murdered.\n\nI\u2019m at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it\u2019s over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I\u2019m just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me \n\n\u201chey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?\u201d\n\n \u201cUhh what?\u201d\n\n \u201cCan you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me\u201d \n\nto which the bartender said \u201coh you can trust Greg, he\u2019s really nice\u201d. Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.\n\nGirl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical \u2018meet a girl at a bar\u2019 flirting shit. She asks if I\u2019ve ever seen the show Years and Years. I say \u201cno, but I\u2019ve seen the band perform live\u201d. So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. \u201cYes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT\u201d. So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I\u2019ll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said\n\n \u201chey do you live close by?\u201d \n\n\u201cYea, like half a mile\u201d\n\n \u201cwe should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car\u201d\n\n\u201cIdk, my house is kind of a mess right now\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I have pets too\u201d (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)\n\n\u201cI mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I\u2019ll have to go home\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine\u201d heh, cuz that\u2019s all the time I\u2019ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??\n\nNo. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.\n\nIt\u2019s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I\u2019ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.\n\nSo we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say \u201coh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!\u201d Which I\u2019m excited about, because at this point I\u2019m thinking to myself \u201chmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid\u201d\n\nWe talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn\u2019t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.\n\nGo inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to \u201cwatch HBOGO\u201d.\n\nShe runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.\n\nIt\u2019s fucking Evan Williams.\n\nAnd this is the first time where an \u201coh no\u201d thought crosses my mind.\n\nKids, I\u2019ve slept with some strange in my time. I don\u2019t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I\u2019m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.\n\nSo after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn\u2019t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.\n\nSex.\n\nSo after, we\u2019re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We\u2019re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.\n\nNow, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nI say \u201cthat was great we should do this again sometime\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my husband would appreciate that\u201d\n\n\n\nI am speechless. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I\u2019m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.\n\nMe: \u201cUmmmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you\u2019re at? Like, why didn\u2019t you tell me that?\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cidk, does it matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh yeah, I\u2019d be pretty pissed if I was him\u201d\n\n\nNow I\u2019ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn\u2019t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn\u2019t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.\n\nSo this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don\u2019t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:\n\nHer: \u201cwe\u2019re getting separated soon\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cwell you\u2019re still fucking married to him\u201d\n\n\u201cYea but that\u2019s okay\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been..... abusive\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She\u2019s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I\u2019m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.\n\nQue the panic attack.\n\nShe starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.\n\nShe asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).\n\nNow this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me \u201c(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy\u201d Btw, Evan Williams isn\u2019t that bad when you\u2019re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.\n\nWe finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn\u2019t like morning sex. I\u2019m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.\n\nAnyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can\u2019t because she didn\u2019t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn\u2019t move it because \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to drive it\u201d \n\n\u201cUhh, this is the third time we\u2019ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car\u201d\n\nI move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she\u2019ll probably leave before I get home.\n\nA couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I\u2019m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn\u2019t think to log out or shut it off or anything.\n\nI tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nGo back to work. Thinking everything is over. That\u2019s the end of that. Wrong again.\n\nI get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I\u2019m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She\u2019s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.\n\nOh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.\n\nShe hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she\u2019d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.\n\nI kid you not. I\u2019m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says \u201cmake it quick\u201d\n\nThis bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I\u2019m just ready for her to leave.\n\nSex.\n\nAfter, we\u2019re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I\u2019m like \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018no\u2019? You can\u2019t get in an Uber with your pussy out\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\n\nSo I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.\n\nMost guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That \u201carch\u201d thing that women do when you\u2019re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.\n\n#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.\n\nPizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.\n\nWe never even opened the pizza box. She\u2019s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I\u2019m starting to panic myself. Because I don\u2019t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.\n\nShe eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that\u2019s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it\u2019s her sending multiple texts saying \u201cI\u2019m so sorry babe\u201d \u201cidk where I\u2019m at\u201d \u201ccome get me\u201d. And him saying \u201cnope sorry\u201d \u201cthis is on you\u201d and \u201ccall 911\u201d\n\nThat last one though. That\u2019s what I did.\n\nBefore I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I\u2019m starting to worry about my safety. I don\u2019t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that \u201cyou don\u2019t know how to drive my car\u201d with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.\n\nI told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn\u2019t answer.\n\nThe ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, \u201cgirl you need to get dressed, you\u2019re gonna be going home\u201d\n\nFinally got her panties back on, I didn\u2019t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.\n\nCops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can\u2019t force her to go anywhere she didn\u2019t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She\u2019s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I\u2019m like \u201cI guess?\u201d, and then I let them in.\n\nShe yells \u201care you fucking serious? You called the cops?\u201d \n\u201cUh yea, you didn\u2019t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that\u2019s what I did\u201d\n\nThe officer said to her \u201cyou\u2019re on this man\u2019s property, and he wants you to leave\u201d\n\nQue crying and what not.\n\nCops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what\u2019s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn\u2019t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.\n\nI had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer\u2019s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.\n\nAnyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she\u2019s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll let you take that\u201d\n\nCops didn\u2019t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say \u201cusually this is the other way around, ha\u201d\n\nPo-po leave, I call it a night, and it\u2019s over.\n\nFlash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she\u2019s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn\u2019t able to check. But I\u2019m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.\n\nOh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.\n\nSo that brings us to now. I haven\u2019t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I\u2019m glad I could share this story with y\u2019all. There might be more to come, but you\u2019ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.\n\nThe moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. \ud83d\ude02\n\nJk don\u2019t do that.\n\nAnd don\u2019t stick your dick in crazy.\n\nTLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married.

Can\u2019t get it towed, because it\u2019s on a public street. I\u2019m still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I\u2019ll get to them when I can.\n\nEdit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.\n\nEdit 5: I\u2019m still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor\u2019s house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it\u2019s front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she\u2019s most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her \u201chey do you wanna get this car that\u2019s in front of your house towed?\u201d She said \u201cno, noooo hehe\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cyea, I\u2019ll talk to y\u2019all tomorrow\u201d just wtf.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI\u2019ve been texting a mutual friend of the couple. Apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. I\u2019m in the works of a TIFUpdate. But I\u2019ll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. I\u2019d like to protect the privacy of those involved, but I\u2019m just too lazy to do it right now.",

You wanted sex, so you did what it took to get sex, including letting her drive obviously drunk. Then you got more sex even though you figured out that she was clearly not okay and she was scared, medicated, and apparently abused.

            "Ok so I'm coming at this from a slightly different perspective and hoping to encourage some reflection. I'm sorry if it comes across preachy or if ultimately people feel it's not applicable, but this comes very close to some challenging areas and there isn't much room for reflection in the story. I accept there is a chance this story isn't real / was written by a 12-year-old etc, but the reaction is real and I think we can take a moment to stop and think.\n\nIf this story is real then it seems highly likely it is a story of a man sexually taking advantage of someone who is unwell (even just from 'pass me my meds please', but also the memory problems etc) and who behaves like someone who has unquestionably clearly been repeatedly abused ('don't drug my drink while I go to the bathroom please?'), and who has clearly learnt from her experiences that sex is the only behaviour that makes her valuable or protects her from abuse (hence offering it every time there is a threat to throw her out or she is in any kind of danger).\n\nThis man then ultimately had the police throw them out when they were no longer useful - and cheerfully ends their account of their interactions with an abused/emotionally vulnerable/sometimes drunk married woman with 'don't stick your dick in crazy', totally abdicating all of their responsibility to her and any harm they have done by dismissing her as crazy (as if that invalidates her as a person). They don't write here about e.g. asking why she was so reluctant to leave that she would offer sex, they just had sex with her. If she was having sex in the hope that it would prevent her going home and getting abused, does she really have capacity to make that decision or is OP also abusing her?\n\nI don't fully understand why this thread is full of OP revelling in this, and other people congratulating them like it's a huge achievement to take advantage of vulnerable people. Vulnerable men and women don't just always cower in a corner and cry, they may present by ignoring red flags and inappropriately making themselves vulnerable to exploitation at the first signs of being treated in a way that is anything close to non-abusive (here - no beatings, no drugging, listened to her for an hour or so).\n\nWe don't know what kind of abuse this woman normally gets at home. We don't know if OP asked. Reading the story, we are left having to use the evidence of the content of two texts ('call the police' etc) to reassure ourselves that she's not going to be beaten or sexually coerced or shamed and shouted at etc when she gets home. The evidence here is pretty flimsy that the other partner is a great guy, but as readers we are alarmingly comfortable to dismiss this woman as some crazy slut whose experience is a sidenote in an entertaining anecdote. I think that's a bit troubling and that it may be worth OP at least *trying* to consider any way they could still now try to avoid reinforcing the ideas that sex is this woman's only currency, that all humans are ultimately out to use her, and that all abuse of her is acceptable because she is 'crazy'.\n\nThis is pretty reminiscent of frat house/lad culture and I wish it was over already. There is so much good that can be done to help people in these situations and this kind of wink-to-camera 'sex!' braggadocio will only encourage others to take advantage of vulnerable people and feel no guilt for repeating abuses perpetrated by others who came before.\n\nDoI: Psychiatrist in London who has worked in mental health services looking after vulnerable people",

There\u2019s nothing illegal about this, unless they thought she was stealing your property.",
            "I stopped reading after you disparaged Evan Williams. \n\nLet me tell you about Evan Williams.\n\nEvan Williams was the FIRST bourbon distillery in Kentucky, built in 1783. \n\nEvan Williams makes a great bourbon, and had a very distinctive bottle. The square bottle, black label, with white font looked great and still does. You know who really loved that bottle and label? Jack Daniels. He loved it so much, he copied it. But Jack Daniels didn\u2019t want to make his whiskey in Kentucky and didn\u2019t want to use the much more expensive sour mash recipe, so he set up shop in Tennessee and thus was not able to call his spirit a bourbon. That\u2019s why it says Tennessee Whiskey on his bottle.\n\nSo everything was going great for a hundred years or so, and then Prohibition hit. Jack Daniels, who was making his whiskey for far cheaper than Evan Williams, had a large store of cash. They focused on marketing their product, knowing prohibition wouldn\u2019t last forever. So when it ended, they were in a good spot. They jacked up their price and started calling their whiskey a \u201cpremium\u201d product and the public went along believing it.\n\nEvan Williams, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t raised their prices since prohibition ended. That\u2019s why you can get a bottle of Evan for $11. Not because it\u2019s a bottom-shelf product, but because they\u2019re a quality company who believes in their Bourbon and isn\u2019t going to use any marketing tricks to make a quick buck. \n\nEvan routinely wins whiskey of the year awards, including this year https://kybourbon.com/henry-mckenna-single-barrel-awarded-best-in-show-whiskey-at-2019-san-francisco-world-spirits-competition/\n\nSo don\u2019t ever disparage Evan Williams. Next time you\u2019re in a liquor store, hike up your pants, pop a squat, and grab a bottle of the best bang for your buck whiskey in the country."

            "Reposting this for visibility.\n\nOn May 16, 2018, Robert moved to a new city. He was excited to start his new job, and lay down roots in the community. He wasn't worried about losing connections to his old friends, because Robert would play games with them every thursday night. Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\"\n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online?\n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\"\n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the \nbox, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"GoG?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet. The long list of third party services had come with service charges that ballooned his rate to twice what he expected to pay. \"My last service provider didn't charge me extra to use Netflix or Spotify or Steam. This seems like a racket!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you're welcome to use a competitor, then. LARGENET services the other side of town. I think their service charges are pretty much the same, so if you care about it so much, you're welcome to move. I won't keep you here.\"\n\n\"That's it, I can pay your fees or move?! Those are my only options?\" Robert was incredulous. \"This can't be legal!\"\n\n\"Completely legal, sir. Net Neutrality is a thing of the past. I am a BIG ISP Co shareholder, and I would be furious if they weren't making all the money they could. LARGENET does it. GIANT CONNECT does it. We have to do it to compete!\"\n\n\"Fine\" Robert said, \"lets just sign this thing.\"\n\n\"Hold your horses, Cowboy\" The technician guffawed at the idea that he was finished. \"We haven't even talked about your data cap yet.\"\n\nCredit to /u/Novelize.",

All of the sudden I can't use createspace to publish or Amazon to buy things I can't find elsewhere that I must have for caring for my disability. Now I can't look up health questions or support because someone at Comcast doesn't believe in this or that so they block it. Now they can block information sites as well. Block news sites that post stories they may not like. Block watchdog sites or heck even charity sites they don't like.

It\u2019s a very funny story though.\n\n\nWhen I was young, my brothers and I snuck a copy of San Andreas into the house. We spent days holed up in our basement taking turns playing, and down there my parents didn\u2019t bother us too much. In order to get tons of money for guns (we had yet to figure out my parents\u2019 dialup password so cheats weren\u2019t a thing for us yet), we would go to the strip club and stand on the stage, absorbing the money dudes threw at the women and just let the game sit for 10-20 minutes. We had to be careful though because sometimes the strippers would do a move and bump into CJ and the bouncers would shoot the place up. One day while I was playing my mom yelled down to the basement at us to get ready, we\u2019re going to Pizza Hut. In a stroke of genius, I drove to the GTA strip club, got on the stage, and then turned the TV off and we left. It was to be the heist of the century.\n\nMy dad, however, was at church at this time, practicing for a gospel concert he was singing in. He always filmed the practices so he could take notes at home upon playback, and this time was no different. While my mom and brothers and I were still at the Hut, he arrived at home and plugged his camcorder into the VCR. We had just one VCR, and it was connected to the basement TV.\n\nBack at the Hut, my mom gets a phone call. She puts her napkin down and slowly looks around the table at us and says \u2018ooookay\u2019 a few times into the phone in this really calculating, specific way that she always did when she knew us kids were in trouble before we did. Naturally, it was at this point that we kids knew we were in trouble. For what, though, we didn\u2019t know.\n\nAfter a very quiet minivan ride, we get home and my mom says \u201cBoys why don\u2019t we go down to the basement. Your dad wants to show you his gospel practice downstairs.\u201d It was then at THIS point we knew why we were in trouble. So we drag our feet down the stairs, and lo and behold, my dad is sitting on the couch, TV on, a stripper\u2019s polygonal titties swung stiffly back and forth onscreen to En Vogue\u2019s \u201cMy Lovin\u2019\u201d, with CJ standing mere inches away, collecting money.\n\nMy dad starts in, \u201cboys I don\u2019t even know where to begin. This PlayStation was a blessing to you for Christmas and this is how you repay us? By breaking our trust??\u201d He is holding the controller up now, gesticulating with it. \u201cHere I am, practicing to bring glory to God, and-\u201c but he was cut off, as he inadvertently squeezed the controller, causing CJ to punch the stripper.\n\nMy entire family stands in silence, watching together as the bouncers in the strip club shoot the place up for what seems like an eternity. After the shooting stops, and CJ appears in front of the hospital, I look back and see my mom silently weeping into her hand. I look at my dad as a single tear rolls down his cheek and he prays under his breath. After another eternity of silence, without a word, my dad bends down, disconnects the PlayStation, walks back to the family computer, disconnects it, goes to his car and drives away. For the next four months he kept the PS2 and PC locked in his office at work.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favorite memories of growing up. I miss my brothers.\n\nTL;DR: Wasn\u2019t allowed to play GTA growing up, of course got caught playing it, my dad interrupted his own lecture by accidentally punching a stripper and immediately asked for God\u2019s forgiveness.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the response, I\u2019m glad I could spread some laughs with this story! I just want to clarify that my parents weren\u2019t crazy at all, so no need to insult them. I love them so much, they just got overzealous and dramatic from time to time. I had a really great childhood with two loving and involved parents who tried really, really hard to live and raise our family by their convictions. It just doesn\u2019t always work out for everyone involved, like in this case, but it made for a great story that we can all laugh about now. I\u2019m very much an atheist and my parents know it, but we still get along great :)\n\nEDIT 2: Also my brothers aren\u2019t dead, we\u2019re all just spread out across the country now! I don\u2019t get to see them very much anymore, that\u2019s all!\n\nEDIT 3: Alright now I\u2019m not being so nice. I\u2019m an atheist, but all you other atheist weirdos calling my parents crazy are weird. I hesitate to inform people I\u2019m atheist because of houseplants like you. So self-informed on my life because you\u2019re drunk on your own over-inflated, homuncular ideas about spirituality in people\u2019s personal lives, it\u2019s no wonder r/atheism isn\u2019t a default sub anymore. Look how you\u2019re acting, trying to tell me \u201cbro you need to get out of there.\u201d The story is over a decade old, apparently none of you can read! I shouldn\u2019t be surprised at what I\u2019m reading! However, if you do still feel inclined to let the pea that rolls around your empty head, whose sound you mistake for a competent thought, inform you of some truly transcendent comment in which you consider calling my parents whack jobs and nuts, it says way more about you and your small-mindedness in acting like you know better just because you have an internet connection and a lifetime full of trauma on your own.

            "Loved your story, OP,  but if I were to post my similar story, people would have an outcry and accuse me of copying you, so if you don't mind:\n\nThere was a time when my late great grandmother thought that anything on a screen either happened at one point or has happened in real life. I was playing GTASA one day and was always careful of my actions depending on who was watching because I also grew up with religious parents. I was antsy to beat a few missions instead of looking for the fabled Bigfoot so I started driving to some. I assumed that she would not understand what she was seeing or that she would be too blind to see the television from that distance.\n\nNow, I wasn't too good at driving, so what my great grandmother saw was this man of colored descent (yep, she was a racist) mowing down innocent pedestrians and then subsequently shooting up thousands of civilians. She was horrified and I hadn't noticed until she started to yell for help and when my mother came in to ask what was wrong, she pointed at the tv and starting to say in Spanish, \"Look at what is on the new!\"\n\nEdit: Spelling.",

I\u2019ve had sleep paralysis on/off since I was little, the last time maybe a year and a half ago, but the worst by far happened when I was 12.\n\nI was sick with strep throat, so running a pretty high temp (which, idk, \u201cfever dreaming\u201d might\u2019ve played into it). My door was in front of/to the right of my bed, so that when it was open, I could see the hallway to my right and just a sliver of a shadow between my open door/the wall behind it. And right behind that, was what I later called \u201cThe Pie Man\u201d. I could see half of the round outline of his face; all crusty and toothy and smiling, and his arm curled out from behind the door with his sharp fingers holding onto the doorknob. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t call out for my mom, and I didn\u2019t even want to because if I did that creepy motherfluffer was gonna slam the door the moment I did. Ugh.

One time actually coincided with a massive asthma attack. Thankfully my little sister was going through a phase at the time of not wanting to be alone at night, so she would either try to go climb in bed with our parents or me (I shared a bedroom with our older brother, but he had the top bunk and she wasn't climbing up). Apparently she came into the room to lay down on my bed, noticed something was wrong, then woke up our mother and asked her \"Why is /u/skrubaul blue?\". \n\nHere's hoping that massive asthma attacks and sleep paralysis are some things that only happened when I was younger.",

        "selftext": "Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.\n\nSo here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\n#tldr\n\nMy borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.\n\n*Edit*\n\nWow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.\n\n*Edit 2*\n\nI don't think I'll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn't change any names \n\n*Edit 3.0*\n\nOk it's been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. \n\n*Edit 4.0*\n\nUhh this post is getting deleted. It's been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.\n\n*Edit 5*\n\nFinal edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.\n\nThanks for everyone who said I'm not the asshole. I may have autism, but I'm not an asshole. \n\n*Edit 6*\n\nOnce again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up\n\nGive me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. I've got it, I've just got to convince my wife to release it. ",

I go to the toilet about 3 times before work this morning but it\u2019s eased off a bit so take tablets, grin and bear it then leave for work. \n\nNow my job is a working within the Prison System and escorting prisoners to certain places, including courts. This is where it all went downhill. \n\nI had to escort this prisoner over to the witness box and stand next to her (open court) So I do my usual but my tummy has started to really hurt again. I\u2019m trying my absolute best to put off a fart which I know is brewing but can\u2019t hold it much longer. So I do a really silent one and pat myself on the back thinking I had got away with it....\n\nThat is until the Prisoner starts coughing and retching and shouting, \u2018what the fucks that?!\u2019  I quickly realise what it must be but can\u2019t admit to such a foul, putrid smell so start crinkling my nose as well and gagging. The admin clerk walks slightly closer and retches so hard she had to swiftly put her head in the bin. By this point it\u2019s getting loud and chaos is starting to ensue (not what you want in court, in front of the District Judge) \n\nHe quickly tells me to take the prisoner back over to the closed dock and states it must be the pipes. He stands down the whole of court and makes maintenance come in to check all pipes for any leaks, cracks, ANYTHING which could of made that smell happen.  Prisoner still has watery eyes, Im pretending to gag and the clerk is sipping water next to a bucket. \n\nTLDR: So yeah, court was stood down for over an hour whilst it was searched for the cause of a smell. Not knowing the cause was back down in the cells, hanging her head in shame and regaling to her co-workers about the \u2018leaky pipe\u2019 upstairs.",

I had the most rotten, foul smelling shit through a screen door diarrhea while I was sick, but afterwards, the farts were just as bad. We were underway in the 41 foot patrol boat, and it was cold and windy out, so the four of us were huddled in the pilot house staying warm. I felt one rumbling down deep, and knew that I had to vacate. As I was leaving, I was asked to prop the door open, as it was getting stuffy. I did, and stepped down into the well deck approximately ten feet from the pilot house. I let it rip. A few seconds later, the other guys were yelling at each other, and the coxswain brought the 41 to idle. They all piled out on deck, blaming each other for the nasty fart.",

You know, how like when you have a habit so ingrained into your brain, you kind of forget that you did it?\n\nWell, my husband had been working on running internet cable all throughout the house. And he had put a pretty good sized hole in our bedroom (behind a dresser), but the cable wasn't running the way he wanted it to, so he just kinda gave up after a while and covered it back up.\n\nWell, later that night, he comes into the bedroom. I'm standing next to the dresser, probably browsing reddit on my phone, and he asks me what that smell was and that he thought it might be gas.\n\nMind you that it's getting pretty late. The (small) kids are in bed. And now we fear we may have a gas leak (since he had been messing in the walls). So, we call the gas place, and they say they can be out in like an hour. So, we drag our kids outside. Thankfully the weather was ok.\n\nMy youngest gets put in a pack n play in the driveway. I drag out blankets for my oldest to sleep on. Eventually the guy comes and says there's no gas leak.\n\nLater, I think to myself that I probably farted and just forgot. Oh well. Better than a gas leak, I guess.",

            "I can relate.\n\nI was 12.  My hobby at the time was Taekwondo.  which had a small building downtown where the students would go in, practice/learn, then come back next week.\n\nI'd had my share of bad farts before.  Making people crinkle their nose, complain about the stench, then go back to their normal activities.  I never tried to create bad farts or mess with people, but it just happened.\n\nI wasn't feeling good that afternoon.  Where I'd normally fart and just go about my day, either my butt or my brain decided that what I was feeling was definitely not fart-related.  And so, it festered.\n\nBy the afternoon, I could barely bend my upper body.  By the time I got to the studio, the slightest motion caused me agony.  It took me about 5 minutes at the studio to finally realize, \"hey, maybe I need to take a crap,\" so I went to the restroom in the back.\n\nThis was your average small restroom.  Single-person, at the far back end of a studio-like building that was easily 250 feet x 30 feet..  One of the only walls in there.  I finally sat on that toilet, my guts feeling like they were 6 sizes too large for my belly, then strained to relieve myself.\n\nThere was a brief second of resistance, then whatever was capping all that air into me dislodged.  The sheer amount of air pressure lifted my from the seat.  In a panic, I grabbed hold of the toilet, forcing myself downward as a hurricane of fetid air flowed from my rear end.  This high-pressure wind force lasted easily 6-8 seconds, but it felt ten times longer.  \n\nBy the end, my deflated husk of a body shakily rose from the ceramic throne.  I felt terribly empty, and all that I had to show was a tiny nothing within this bowl.  I wiped, flushed, then walked out into the studio.\n\nIt took a minute or two, but the concentrated gas of that restroom started to proliferate through the building.  The people nearest the restroom began to gag, moving further down to get out of the wretched stench.  But the concentration was too high, its payload too potent.  It spread through that entire room, causing the entire studio to close early for that night as none of the instructors, students, or parents could stomach sitting within that horrendous smell.\n\nMy family did not let me live that one down for a while.  Though, that was the last terrible-smelling fart I've released since.",

I'll have to have service department track it down and clean it\" I was so embarrassed but of course I didn't admit to anything.

            "I have a somewhat similar story from a little over 22 years ago.\n\nMy little brother had notoriously bad farts for a while. He was only about 5 or 6 but his farts were those of a 300 lbs man dying of dead bowel syndrome. I mean they were REALLY bad.\n\nNow at this particular time we were taking a trip to D.C. We live out on the West Coast and my mother is an attorney and U.S. history buff so to her this whole thing was practically a religious experience.\n\nAnyways, so we do all the tours, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Capitol building. While at the Capitol we luck out and our tour guide gets to take us into Newt Gingrich's office as speaker of the house. This was apparently a pretty big deal as it was not a planned part of the tour since Newt Gingrich was in town and apparently dealing with some crisis or something. We get in and almost immediately my brother lays this extremely toxic SBD. You could see the smell ripple across the crowd by the sudden look of disgust finally reaching the tour guide moments later. She stopped mid sentence on a history lesson and tried to regain her composure, but couldn't. She basically said:\"SonowitbelongstothecurrentspeakerNewtGinchrich...moving on.\"\n\nThe sad part is my mother was crushed. \n\nBut the BEST part of this story is that the next day Newt Gingrich formally announced his resignation as speaker of the house.\n\nI have never been more proud of my brothers farts.\n\nTLDR; Little 5 year old broski lays a fart in the Capitol building so rancid it may have contributed to the resignation of the speaker of the house.",

I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. \n\nBasically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, \"I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to...\" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. \n\nI didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. \"Oh fuck,\" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said \"Hey [my name], how was your break?\" \n\nI looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, \"Is that all your having for lunch?\" and I was like, \"Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something.\" \n\nThen he said, \"Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?\" \n\nI was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. \n\nWell. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, \"So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?\" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, \"It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you.\" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). \n\nEven with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. \n\nWell, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! \n\nWe have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.\n\nTL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).\n\nEdit: Yes, I accidentally wrote \"guess\" instead of \"guest.\" My b, my b. ",

        "selftext": "Obligatory this story actually happened about a year ago: I (18F at the time) was dating a boy named, Jacob (18 M at the time). His father (early 60s) was a mechanic, and his mom (mid 50s) was a SAHM. They were a pretty typical white suburban family in the south and had asked Jacob if they could meet me even though we had only been dating for a month.\n\nAt the dinner, I met his mom, dad, older brother, older sister, and her newborn daughter. The dinner went well and I was chatting about my volunteer work at my college's blood drive, to which his father explains that his doctor told him he was O negative and a universal blood donor. My boyfriend mentions he is also O, but his siblings casually mention they are both AB. I don't think anything of it because my bf had mentioned that his mom was married once before and was widowed. The following conversation went like this:\n\nMe: Oh that's really cool. You're a really rare blood type. If you don't mind me asking: is your mom's blood type A and your dad's B or your dad's A and mom's B?\n\nOS (older sister): What do you mean? He's O. \\*Gesturing to my bf's father\\*\n\nMe: Oh I know. I was just asking about your bio father, but of course, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.\n\n\\*I notice his mom get really pale, and it was in that moment I realized I fucked up\\*\n\nOB (older brother): What do you mean bio father?\n\nMe: I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.\n\n\\*Jacob's dad got real quiet and looking at his wife's face. He knew instantly. I look over to Jacob who I think was starting to put the full picture of what was happening together\\*\n\nJacob's dad: Are you saying they're not my biological kids? Because my wife swore up and down in marriage counseling (By \"Marriage Counseling\" they mean with a pastor) that they were my kids and she would never cheat on me. (yeah... turns out she never had any kids from her previous marriage)\n\nJacob's Mom: I would never cheat on you. OS and OB are your kids.\n\nJacob's Dad: OP, why do you think they're not my kids?\n\nI tried to excuse myself because it was very clear the cat was out of the bag, and with a quick google search from my boyfriend he starts cussing out his mom. She starts to sob and apologizes over and over again. And I am forced to explain 9th-grade biology to his father about the fact that the only kids he could have produced were with the blood type: O, A or, B; but absolutely not AB. Jacob was the only one with the possibility of being his son.\n\nThey all start screaming at one another. OS eventually leaves because her newborn is screaming too. His mom goes and locks herself in the bedroom. His older brother follows her screaming asking who his real father is. My boyfriend is trying to figure out if his dad still wants to *be* their father. I eventually have a friend come pick me up.\n\nYeah... we broke up shortly after but not after figuring out that none of the kids produced from the marriage were his (Edit: They found out via paternity tests, for sure weren't his kids) and they divorced soon after.\n\n**TL;DR I accidentally revealed that my boyfriend's mom was unfaithful by pointing out the fact that his older siblings who both had the blood type AB could not have been biologically related to their O negative father**\n\nEdit: For those asking how they knew their blood types -- Jacob donated blood for the blood drive at our school. His sister just had a baby so she was probably informed during pregnancy. Jacob's dad was told by his doctor for (probably) underlying medical reasons I don't know (I wasn't ever really close to his family after that for obvious reasons) and I don't know how his brother knew.\n\nEdit/PSA: Reading through the comments I have discovered many of you don't know your blood type: **Go find out your blood type! It can save your life in an emergency!** If you are parents find out your children's blood type. If you discover you are not biologically related to one or either of your parents. I am very sorry, but you should still know your blood type and I would suggest some therapy.",

Turns out that these blood types all matched my parents and my sister.\n\nExcept that, in my family's case, it was my mom who had the \"impossible\" blood type, so it was just really bad writing on the soap opera, and my parents found it hilarious to think that my mom couldn't possibly be the parents of the child she gave birth to. *laughs*",

Whilst the article talks about the other way (two AB people having O child) I presume that the opposite could also be true, if the mother had the rare single AB allele, and an O allele, which she could pass on to their kids.

If you want proof, check our TikTok accounts (hhhhggggllll and sandx.lop)\n4. It was also her first (maybe last?) college football game\n\nAnyway, the internet is full of horrible people and I haven't done any work this weekend, so I'm gonna go do that now. Peace\n\nTL;DR I didn't kiss a girl at a football game and now I'm paying the price.\n\nedit: I'm using a throwaway so people don't read my post history, not to hide my identity, for all those asking.",

The camera man happened to start recording as the guy was taking his arm from behind her back and had a concerned look on his face. It looked like he was \"caught\" with another woman and the clip went viral. In reality they were married and had been together for a long time. They had to make Twitter accounts just to prove everything because they were getting tired of the publicity.",

We were both drinking and for the life of me I can't remember what he said, but I said back: yeah well your face is stupid. \n\nFight ended. Cos two 28yr olds realised how stupid I sounded and had a laugh. \n\nIt became a term of endearment between us, I love your stupid face, oi stupid face, hey bring that stupid face over here type thing. His father heard him say one of those to me one day and lost his shit, he didn't raise his son to be nasty to women, how dare he call me stupid when I'm not, how dare he use such language towards me. \n\nPoor dude had no idea why we both started giggling like children and stormed off to bring his mother into it. Thankfully she was someone we were able to get a word in with, explained what the deal was and his dad felt rather embarrassed to go off like that in front of me/to not know the joke and react badly to it. \n\nShit happens.

        "selftext": "So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. \n\nI would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. \n\nCame with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It\u2019s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. \n\nI\u2019m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit \u2018coffee shops\u2019 and buy and smoke joints. \n\nHad a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. \n\nIn a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...\u2019did I ditch that joint\u2019?\n\nAt this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. \n\n\u2018Sir, do you have anything in your pockets\u2019 says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. \n\nHoly. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I\u2019m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. \n\nGo to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I\u2019m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I\u2019m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. \n\n\u2018Sir, empty your pocket please\u2019? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. \n\nI\u2019m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, \u2018oh god. I\u2019m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...\u2019\n\u2018HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY\u2019! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. \n\nI\u2019m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. \n\nCustoms man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry Sir! Don\u2019t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won\u2019t be last! I\u2019m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can\u2019t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home\u2019. \n\nI almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he\u2019d taken joint off me....and that was it...\n\nI\u2019m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You\u2019re the best. I\u2019m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.\n\nTLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. \n\nEdit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)\n\nEdit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I\u2019m from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I\u2019ve just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, \u2018joints\u2019. \n\nEdit 3-Schiphol doesn\u2019t frisk as matter of routine, yes I get it. Thanks for correction.",

            "Did that once flying out of Los Angeles(2005ish), TSA acted tough, brought us to the little security area and gave us the speech along with a wag of the finger. Told us they could call the police but since it was just a minor quantity we were let off with a warning and sent to our gate for boarding. Dude probably took my weed home and smoked it. \n\n\nOne other time, flew from New Orleans to Denver for a weekend conference(2008). Successfully transported 4 joints in an opened pack of  cigarettes with me. Went on a walk every so often away from my hotel and smoked when I could get away.  On the airport shuttle bus, heading back for the return flight, I decided to abandon my last joint in an empty cigarette pack. Luckily for me as we went thru security this time, after they xrayed my just opened cigarette pack, then visually inspected the contents to find just cigarettes. Had I not ditched it on the bus, I would have been caught. I hope whoever found my joint on the shuttle bus smoked it and that it didn't get thrown away. \n\nWas the last time I snuck weed on a plane.",
            "Man, when I left Amsterdam after a 2010 visit, I was so baked I genuinely forgot the joints I stashed between pages of a book, hash left in my jeans pockets and a couple grams of shake in my carry on. Flew out with no problem. In NYC, I got stopped by customs at JFK and pulled into a room. Had no idea what was going on. The agent goes into my bag and pulls out some sausages I bought during a layover in Iceland. Told me to always declare any food from another country. Then he gave them back to me. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I found my stash while unpacking. Keep the party going for another week lol. And those sausages were bomb .",

            "Went to Amsterdam 10 years ago.  My last night there I was sitting on a park bench rolling a joint so my buddy and I could have a goodbye smoke.  Two cops on bikes slowly road up to us and asked if we were tourists.  They informed us that the neighborhood we were in got a little dodgy late at night (it was probably 2am) and tourists were frequent targets of pick pockets.  They recommended that we smoke on our way to our hotel and keep our wits about us to stay safe.  Off they road into the night after a cordial goodbye. \n\nI don\u2019t even smoke anymore but god damn I miss the feeling of freedom and camaraderie I had there.",

The TSA's charter is not drugs, but they loosely say they might refer you to the authorities.\n\nIn Denver there are no authorities to refer you to. The police won't arrest you for possession.  They can't, possession is a civil right per our states constitution.

            "That's way better than the time I accidentally left my pocket knife in my carry-on when leaving Amsterdam. \nI had brought it to Amsterdam in my checked luggage with a bunch of other tools I use for work, but on the return flight I had to rearrange my luggage to make the weight restrictions. In doing so, the knife accidentally made it into a side pocket of my duffle.\nWhen my bag went through the xray scanner, they saw it on the image on the screen, but for whatever reason when they looked in the pocket they couldn't find it?? So they turned the monitor around to show me what they were looking for and asked me to dig for it. As soon as I saw the image, I felt like the world stopped. I reached into the pocket and pulled out the knife, which was a 3.5 inch folder with a spring-assisted opener. I immediately started apologizing, explained how it got there, and told them they could keep it, obviously.\nHowever, even though it's a perfectly legal knife in the state of California where I live, being spring-assisted must not be cool at all in the Netherlands. They informed me it was illegal to even have it in the country, and I was going to have to wait for the police to come over and decide how they were going to proceed. I was already imagining my episode of 'Locked up Abroad'. \nThey set me to the side and some security guy in a suit stood nearby watching me. An eternity later, two incredibly scary looking Dutch cops in barets carrying rifles came over and started going through my stuff, asking what I was doing there, why I had the knife, how I got it there, etc. They told me I was likely going to have to pay a fine, but they needed to make some calls to see if that would be sufficient. I told them I'd pay the fine, whatever it was, because obviously this was my fuck up. Then they asked me how much money I had with me, which seemed all kinds of sketchy, but what the hell was I supposed to do in that situation? I told them I only had like \u20ac80 because this was the end of my trip and was going home. They said it'd be over 80 Euros (duh) but they had to make another call to see how much exactly. One officer took a photo of my passport with his cell phone and the other made the call. Then they both came back and said whoever was on the other side of the phone had decided I wasn't much of a threat and let me go with a warning and no fine.\nUnfortunately by that point I had missed my flight and ended up having to buy a whole new ticket home, but I was just glad to not be in a Dutch prison!!",

While queuing to go through security he was looking for his passport but it had slipped through a hole in the pocket so he rooted around and to his horror he found a couple of shotgun cartridges there too! He left the queue, went to the toilet and dumped them in the bin and then spent the rest of the flight terrified that he\u2019d be searched or found out. The thing was, he was sure that he\u2019d been through airport security at both ends many times before with those cartridges in his pocket as he hadn\u2019t been shooting for a couple of years.",

I didn't even realize I was running through customs, because I had never traveled internationally before, and the agents flagged me down, caught up with C and R, and brought us all back for a thorough search.\n\nThe agent, of apparently Indian or Pakistani origin, who was searching our belongings was extremely thorough, literally pulling the lint from every pocket and feeling through it with his fingers. Unbeknownst to anyone but R, it was at this time she realized she had a cassette tape case in her carry-on that contained a long-forgotten about joint.\n\nAs the agent opened the nylon sack that contained the case, he found it also contained her tampons. He immediately became embarassed, stuffed them back in the sack, put the sack back in her luggage, and pushed it across the table to her.\nThe search was over instantly, despite his obvious intent to search every particle of our stuff, because he'd found feminine hygiene products and was so uncomfortable about the very idea that he immediately stopped doing his job.",

I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said \u201cUs Gov.\u201d I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. \u201cCrap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn\u2019t?!\u201d I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all \"Don't answer it!\" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was \u201cYou probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.\u201d I know he\u2019ll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.\n\nTL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said \u201cUs Gov\u201d so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.\n\nEdit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam\u2026orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that\u2019s a common occurrence :)",

        "selftext": "**UPDATE SEE BELOW**\n\nBackground: I'm an American living in Germany.\n\nObligatory this didn't happen today, but a few weeks ago.\n\nI\u2019ve finally made a close friend here - a neighbor and she is my conversation partner. I help her English she helps my German. She and my wife are close friends too.\u00a0\n\nA little background, I joke around a lot and am always messing with ppl, etc. She knows this.\n\nSo, over the last year we\u2019ve seen each other more often due to Corona and we\u2019re able to talk more and I\u2019m getting more comfortable being myself.\u00a0\n\nA couple of weeks ago I said something to her in a joking manner and she took it seriously. My expectation - I followed up with, \u201cI\u2019m just fucking with you.\u201d She gives me another look, a little concerned. So I said, I\u2019m just joking.\u00a0\n\nI leave it be, think nothing of it.\u00a0\n\nA week later we\u2019re talking again and she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean you were fucking with me, like in your dreams?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a this point I realized that when Americans use the word \u201cfuck\u201d or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse.\u00a0\n\nTo Germans, it ALWAYS means sexual intercourse in all of its variants.\u00a0\n\nI was a bit embarrassed as was she. But once I explained it, a lightbulb went on over her head and Netflix started making more sense to her.\n\nSo she's been practicing the proper use of the f-word since with me as her coach - what else am I going to do? The other day she wrote to me, \"I like fucking you.\" As much as that would be nice, I had to correct her to \"I fucking like you.\"\n\nI told her she's not ready to use the word in the wild, yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I forgot that when Americans use the word fuck or its variants, it rarely means sexual intercourse. Embarrassment ensues and good cultural exchange.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nNot all Germans have the same level of understanding of idiomatic English. My neighbor is trying to improve her English and in the past year it has progressed far further than my German has. That said, she grew up in the 70s and 80s and learned English in gymnasium and didn't really use it except in passing for 20 years. My wife fully understands how she could have had this misunderstanding as she, herself, had a hard time when she first moved to the USA in the 1990s understanding how fuck was being used to modify everything. My neighbor is NOT stupid, so I don't appreciate that. The reason she wrote what she wrote in the text is because we were joking around and she was trying to use a variant of fuck in a sentence.\n\nAlso, to all of the Germans out there taking offense, stop. Part of story telling is to take the truth and make it more interesting, so saying things like \"To Germans it ALWAYS means...\" is a literary device to make the point POP and set the stage for what's to come next.\n\nAll stories have embellishments, this one too. But it's not all that embellished. ",

            "A friend of mine (well call him David) used to work at Best Buy in NYC when he was going there for theatre school, and he was one of the shift supervisors in charge of the new hires. They had hired on this Italian guy, Giuseppe, who was a young student and he evidently did not have a full grasp of all the words we use in English. Especially in NYC, where the vernacular is already pretty profanity laced by nature. Giuseppe also was very loud, boisterous, supposedly had an infectious laugh, and a very thick, pronounced, almost *comical* accent.\n\nDavid takes the young new hires under his wing and gives them the usual spiel: \"if you have any problems, or questions, come see me. I'm always there to help.\" He sends them out on the floor and starts their day.\n\nAt the end of their shift, he and the New Hires all huddled together to talk about the day: any issues they had, or any questions they needed answered. Most of the newbies have simple questions: where are X in the store? How many X do we usually stock, that sort of thing.\n\nA nervous Giuseppe approaches David after the team huddle, obviously wanting to ask a question. So David breaches the silence:\n\n**DAVID**. What's up 'Seppe?\n\n**GIUSEPPE**. (*a little too loud*) Daveed, what is thisa 'Dou-sha-behg'?\n\n**DAVID**. I'm sorry, what?\n\n**GIUSEPPE**. (*louder*) DOO-SHA. BEHG. What is, please?\n\n(*cue mouth agape from everyone in the office*)\n\n**DAVID**. W-why? Who said that to you?\n\n\n**GIUSEPPE**. A customer. He said it to his friend when he wanted to buy a TV. He said too big TV make him look like a... Doosha Behg.\n\nSo David pulls him aside, tells him what it means, and its usage in the vernacular. Giuseppe nods, seemingly understanding.\n\nThe next day on the floor, David is doing his rounds and gets to TV's, Giuseppe is showing off a front projection screen to an older customer. David overheard the conversation.\n\n**CUSTOMER**. I dunno, I think it may be too big.\n\n**GIUSEPPE**. Yes, I understand. You not want to look like a doosha behg.\n\n(*CUSTOMER stares in silence*)\n\nDavid was mortified and began to intercede, horrified that he wasn't clear enough with his instruction.\n\nThe customer suddenly bursts out laughing, slaps Giuseppe on the back and says he'll buy the TV. David, who is now wary but happy, helps finish the expensive sale. He knows he needs to talk with Giuseppe again, but he doesn't want to interrupt the sale.\n\nAfter all the transaction parts were completed, the guy takes his receipt and begins to exit. Giuseppe called after him:\n\n**GIUSEPPE**. Enjoy the new TV, Mr. Doosha Behg!\n\nDavid can't believe he did it again and is not looking forward to the blowback, but the customer turns, stares blankly for a moment, and bursts out laughing again.\n\nDavid then went and had a long talk about colorful metaphors with the Italian student.",

During this time I taught him a great southern phrase of \" That shit ain't gonna happen!\" \n\nHe went back to China and he and our companies owner met with some representatives from a Chinese government owned concrete pump manufacturer. During the negotiations for the pipe systems pricing and they were asking for special pricing. He stood up; all 5'2\"; and slammed his hand on the table and in perfect southern style extracted a piece of paper where he had written the phrase. He then proceeded to tell the other Chinese people in English, Mandarin and German \"THAT SHIT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!\". About 2 hour later I got a phone call from my German boss (the owner) who cursed me up one side and down the other and then told me it was the funniest thing he had witnessed when the Chinese firm agreed to their terms on pricing.",
            "hmmm... seems sus",
            "Ah! Time to drag out this old corker again!\n\nI spent a few years in China teaching English. I'd been out on the turps with a colleague (who was a fellow Aussie and an old friend) and a ~20yo neighbour of mine. Conversation ebbed and flowed, covering many different topics and although we were mindful to keep the language simple, two old buddies kept lapsing into rapid, native speech patterns. We noticed Kate was getting pretty bored and noddy so decided to call it a night.\n\nChinese culture is generally pretty shy of public displays of affection and openly talking about sex. As we walked back, Kate suddenly bursts out with, *\"Will you two stop talking about sex, please?!\"*\n\nSteve and I looked at each other as if to ask \"WTF?\" and I said, *\"We weren't. We were talking about <computers or cars or whatever it was>.\"*\n\nKate: *\"Yes you were! It's always fucking this and fucking that! It's disgusting!\"*\n\nSteve and I burst out laughing and it took a good 30 seconds (in our inebriated state) to recover enough composure to continue. That did not improve her mood at all!\n\nI put my teacher hat on briefly and explained, *\"I'm sorry Kate. Fucking can mean sex but it's also used to mean 'very very'. Like 'Kate, you are fucking beautiful!'\"* as I got down on one knee and took her hands in mine. She melted, looked slightly embarrassed and floated on cloud 9 for the rest of the walk home.\n\n--\n\nBonus story... Another night at the pub, a year or so later. Kate comes in after a few of us have already assembled, drops her handbag on the table then her bum on a chair, then announces, *\"I have a* ***fucking*** *problem!\"* The table full of native speakers burst out laughing. The best I could manage was, *\"Well, I'm sure that anyone of us here would love to help you with that.\"*",

        "selftext": " About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I'll call \"Ray,\" to celebrate 4 years of dating.\n\nWe live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.\n\nI ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.\n\nOne small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I'm a brilliant hacker (I googled it).\n\nWhile carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn't open the email, but the damage is done. Secret's out!\n\nMy heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I'm a ghost writing this.\n\nI probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. \n\nHere's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.\n\nMy punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!\n\nA romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying \"damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.\"\n\n\"Why would you think that I'm going to propose to you?\" He said. \"That sounds like something you wouldn't know about because I'd keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!\"\n\nNow he's started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, \"Gotta tie this shoe!\" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.\n\nOne more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.\n\nI guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.\n\nIf we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.\n \n(Edit-a misspelling)\n\n\nTL;DR tried to hide an email receipt for some fancy underoos, found out about an incoming engagement ring, now I'll never get a husband",

            "I love this! Your boyfriend is a gem, not only for being cool about your *flagrant privacy invasion*, but also for having fun with something (a proposal) that should be fun, not stressful.\n\nI'll share my proposal story with you. \n\nMy now-wife always told me that she wasn't ready for marriage. She knew we would get married, but not until she was ready. So we were together for 5 years, and she booked us on a 12 day cruise. Without saying it aloud, she basically was telling me it was time to propose. Cool.\n\nSo I begin preparation. I go out and find the right ring. I actually just found the diamond and had them set it in a standard band, so I could take her back after the cruise to the jeweler to pick out a band she liked. I also knew we'd be mostly out of contact with her family and friends on the ship, so I let her family and closest friends know what was going on, and asked them all to record videos congratulating her/us, so I could play it for her after the proposal.\n\nSo we pack and fly across the Atlantic. I've hidden the ring inside a small box where i keep my cufflinks and collar stays, rather than the tell-tale ring box, so as not to arouse suspicion. This turned out to be smart, because when we got to our cabin on the boat I passed out on the bed (jet lag). She UNPACKED MY BAG while I slept. Luckily, she knew the little box was for my cufflinks, so she put it in our room safe without even peeking inside. \n\nSo we're on the cruise having a good time. Visiting beautiful places. I almost proposed on a bridge in Venice but we were sweaty and miserably hot, so I held off. Finally one night we have dinner, and decide to go walk around the ship. This is it. I make an excuse to change out of my fancy dinner clothes into regular clothes for comfort. I put the ring into that little coin pocket on my jeans. I come back down and she actually pats me down as a joke...'You gotta ring in there somewhere?!' But she doesn't feel it. \n\nWe go for a walk, and end up all alone on the top deck of the ship, in the night breeze. She's standing at the railing, actually she's half-complaining about this trip...it was really expensive...it was a lot of time off work...she wishes we had gone on a different one that went to Greece instead...I'm standing behind her, and I call out, 'Well, does this make it any better?' \n\nShe turns around and i'm holding out her ring. Even though she planned this trip, and looked for a ring, she's still shocked. So I propose. The first thing she says after she says yes is, 'I need to sit down, i think i'm going to throw up.'\n\nShe didn't. She was very happy. I showed her the video of her family and friends, one of which was her grandmother who passed away shortly after our engagement. \n\nMarried for 5 years now. We're taking the same ship out for our anniversary in October. Good luck and long happy life to you both!",

            "A guy I used to know decided to propose to his girlfriend, got the ring, and waited months for the right time to pop the question. One day at brunch he got blitzed, tired of waiting, and asked her to marry him. She got angry that he'd joke about something like that so he pulled out the ring. Then she got angry that he'd propose to her while trashed and told him to ask again when he sobered up.\n\nAll day long he kept asking, and she kept saying no. They were at home that night and she said, honey would you get me a soda? And he said, only if you marry me. So she said, fine I'll get it myself.\n\nIt took about a day for the two of them to get on the same page and for her to accept his proposal.",

This was my dream wedding ring and I have constantly been looking at pictures of it and saving it to Pinterest, the whole shebang. I showed it to him cause I thought it was funny and ironic and he told me to send him the link to it because he'd look at it later. Five minutes later he bought the ring right as I was sitting next to him talking to him with his phone in clear view. He's never been good at hiding things.",

Everything was fine until one day I open an envelope with not a lot of info on the front. It was the bill for my engagement ring. Not wanting to spoil the surprise I grabbed a glue stick, glued it back together and handed it to him when he came home that evening. It took three more weeks for him to propose (in the most unromantic way possible). \n\nWe made it a cautionary tale for our friends.

He started telling me about these rocks and why they were important and I totally thought he was going to propose. He did not. He also would get down on one knee and look at me and then tie his shoe.\n\nThe funny thing is, he didnt even get down on one knee or even had the ring on him when he proposed. He was so nervous that he forgot to grab the ring before we took our pup for a walk.\n\nKnowing its coming is the worst, but congrats on your impending engagement!",

            "I did something very similar, but it involved seeing banking details (I forget why, but it wasn't important, and I totally regretted it afterwards). My Husband also acted like yours afterwards. The actual proposal ended up being very low key the day *after* a special event. I pretty much forced him into proposing because I was so upset about ruining his surprise, then sad that he didn't propose when he had planned. It's definitely not one of those romantic stories I'll go on and on about -- my children will only hear about it if they ask ;)",

She claims she was looking for her graphing calculator. \nThat story, when told, is way way WAY the-fuck-funnier then if it hadn\u2019t happen, and we simply became another couple where the guy surprised the girl with a proposal. \nEmbrace it.",
            "I remember when my husband proposed to me. I had totally guessed it was going to happen and like super psyched myself up (and we had talked about marriage too, so it wasn't like it was coming out of nowhere). And of course the day before, my mom (who can't keep a secret to save her life) told my dad \"I can't wait to see which ring he picked\" before dad hushed her. \n\nSo on Christmas Eve, I'm totally expecting it to happen during the gift giving part. And he gives me this box, and it was oddly shaped, and I was super confused. And it was a... A video game (one I had actually wanted, though!). But I had never been so sheepishly embaressed in my entire life. For like the rest of the day I was so sad and felt terrible that I had assumed something so big and blah blah blah...\n\n...Turns out he had actually planned a public proposal at the yearly light show that same night. He got my dad to ask to \"take pictures of us\" in front of a bunch of dancing penguins (both of our favorite animals) and proposed then. He basically used my mom's inability to keep a secret to trick both myself and her on the actual proposal. Way better than whatever I thought he was going to do.",

        "selftext": "So this happened yesterday... my family (wife, kids and in-laws) and I had just returned from a pontoon cruise for the evening.  It was later than usual so I sent the wife up on the golf cart with the kids and in-laws to get them some dinner while I covered up the boat.  About halfway through covering up the boat, I notice someone halfway across the cove in the water all on their own and she appeared to maybe be in distress.  She wasn\u2019t making progress swimming one way or the other and occasionally going underwater.  There were people on the opposite shoreline yelling at her but I couldn\u2019t tell what they were saying. I yell asking if she needs help and she says yes.  I call my wife and tell her to come down on the cart, someone is in the water and needs help, I\u2019m going in. I might need help getting the person out. I put on a life jacket and grab the throw cushion from the boat.  I swim out to the person and pass off the throw cushion.  She appears out of breath.  First thing she says to me is \u201cI\u2019m topless\u201d.  I responsd with \u201cumm ok, but are you okay?\u201d. \nI also immediately think to myself:\n1. My friends are never going to believe this\n2. What is my wife going to think with a topless woman swimming to shore with me\n\n She then says she\u2019s running from her boyfriend who is \u201cmessed up\u201d.  She also asks if it\u2019s shallow enough to touch yet.  It wasn\u2019t going to be. I help her to the dock where my wife meets us.  She tells my wife \u201cI\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t have a shirt on\u201d.  Again my wife just asks if she\u2019s okay and she tells us the boyfriend story again.  Sure enough as she gets out of the water she is topless.  But she is carrying a white Tshirt that she quickly throws on. She then immediately begins running to shore.  At the same time we notice a pontoon cruising towards our dock yelling at us.  At first I think this must be her boyfriend chasing her and we are in the middle of some domestic dispute.  They quickly get closer and I realize it\u2019s two sheriff deputies who flagged a pontoon down to carry them across the lake.  As they are jumping onto the dock we notice the girl had just jumped into our golf cart and was riding away on it.   Apparently she was allegedly involved in a string of burglaries and the \u201cboyfriend\u201d she was running away from was the cops.  I had unknowingly aided her swim across the lake to escape and she used our golf cart as getaway. The cops chased her for awhile through the night tracking her down once more but she escaped again.  We looked all day for the golf cart today with no luck.  I notified insurance if the theft around lunch. About an hour ago someone notified us through social media that it was parked behind a house in a neighborhood over.  So we recovered the cart and it seems ok.  They put more warrants out for the suspect and are still looking for her.\n\nTLDR: thought I was saving a topless woman in distress but unknowingly aided a crook in escaping the police.",

I backed up a little and pulled into the petrol station on the corner just to get some space between me and the dude, and suddenly there were police cars everywhere surrounding my car and the car this woman had gotten out of. \n\nThe cops lined us all up and they asked me who I was and what I had to do with these people and I said nothing, she just jumped in my car and then I moved it to here. And then they let me go, after making sure she hadn't stolen anything out of my car. I have no idea what was going on.

        "selftext": "This was a few years ago.  Took the family to Ginnie Springs, a beautiful Florida water spot for a day of swimming and a little picnic.  So as I was swimming in the crystal clear water, watching my son floundering around in his water wings, and just having a good ol time, my son suddenly stopped, pointed at the water and said \"Look daddy, a lizard!\"\n\nI looked over and saw that no, it was NOT a lizard that was swimming over to us, it was a snake. After a quick examination, I realized that this was a Water Moccasin, and a large one at that, heading right for us!\n\nSo Yelling for my son to back away, I waded out to grab him and drag him back to shore. The snake was making a beeline for us, which is weird because most of the time they avoid human contact. I started to splash water at it, trying to slow it down enough so I could reach the shore before it got too close. \n\nSo as I was backing up, slapping water at a poisonous snake with one hand and dragging a laughing child (who had no idea what was going on) with the other, I reached close enough to the shoreline to grab a branch that had fallen from a tree. It was long and pretty sturdy. It was perfect for what needed to be done.\n\nSo as the snake got in close, I went all caveman on it and bashed it a dozen times with the branch. It worked. The snake started to float away, dead as a doornail. I then realized that all the people swimming around in this water would not take too kindly to bumping into a four foot dead moccasin, so using the branch, I launched the snake for a stretch of woods off to my right.\n\nWell, I guess the snake was not balanced right on the branch, and I was full of Adrenalin, so instead of the woods, the snake flew high into the air, drifting off to the right where **PLOP**. It landed square on a picnic table.  To make matters worse, it landed on a pile of shoes that a girl scout troop had left when they went wading in the water.\n\n\"Oh Crap!\" was all i could think, as I began to quickly swim across the spring to remove the snake from the table, but as I was swimming, I heard them.. the giggles and laughter of little 12 year old girls returning to get their shoes. I stopped cold. I was too late. I began to swim away, trying to hide myself as I saw the first curly haired head approach the table. There was laughing, there was chatting and talking... then there was a pause.\n\nAnd that is when the screaming started.\n\nIf you have never heard a dozen 12 year old girls scream in horror as they saw a large, bloody snake draped across their shoes, I cannot even begin to explain the sound. Even as i dove underwater, I heard the screaming. \n\nSometimes... at night... I still hear the screams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR- Killed a snake, launched it with a stick across a table filled with 12 year old girls shoes. the screams... they still echo in those woods to this very day.",

Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.\n\nOne thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.\n\nHow Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.\n\nWill I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.\n\nBTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.\n\nUPD: [Russia unbans Reddit](https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/13/russia-unblocks-reddit) as they comply with request and blocked that post for Russian users.\n\nUPD2: [This is how Russian Internet censorship works](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/08/13/this-is-how-russian-internet-censorship-works)",

This isn't Russia. They saw your request. They just ignored it. It's not going anywhere.\n\nBut maybe they should be focusing on changing their backwards laws that criminalize the growing and ~~smoking of a weed~~ eating shrooms rather than censoring speech.\n\nAnyway, to our Russian users (who ~~smoke weed~~ eat shrooms or otherwise) in the unlikely event the Russian government makes good on this threat, here is an article on the five best VPNs that will allow you to continue to access the site.\n\nhttp://lifehacker.com/5935863/five-best-vpn-service-providers\n\nIn addition, simply google searching \"browser vpn\" should turn up a host of free ones. One good free one (up to 300mb a month) is Security Kiss. \n\nWe should at least be prepared in case that government continues its campaign to persecute proponents of free speech by broadening its reach to American sources of information. \n\nWhether they give pretext or not.",

This lack of filter sometimes has the tendency to get people into trouble because not all the information is provided, even when it's meant harmlessly. \n\nMy parents are a bit older (prime \"Ok, Boomer\" age). I was talking to my Dad the other day on the phone because his birthday dinner was a few days later. I asked how mom was doing and he goes on to tell me a story how my Mom and Aunt (Karen) were at the store and the cashier made a mistake. My Aunt went off on the cashier and asked to see the manager. My Mom was mortified and tried to calm her down but she wasn't having it. \n\nI then mentioned to my Dad, \"That's such a Karen thing.\" He goes on to say \"Yeah, your Aunt does that a lot.\" I tell him, \"That's the funny part, the Karen meme is a real thing. It's when an entitled (typically white) woman gets angry at the smallest mistake and asks for the manager.\" \n\nMy Dad found this hilarious and I explain in more detail. I send him a few links to sites explaining it online. He finds all of this hilarious and she even has the Karen hairstyle. This sends him down the google images rabbit hole and the next few days he sends me random meme's of \"Karens\" doing Karen stuff adding \"Your Aunt did this last week\" or \"I think this one is about your Aunt.\" This leads up to his birthday dinner with extended family. \n\nMy Dad's birthday dinner is going well. Everyone is having a good time, good food, and drinks, etc. Suddenly my Aunt (sitting a few seats down from me) leans forward and loudly shouts down the table \"Hey [my name], what's this whole thing about making a meme about me?\" I respond \"Huh?\" She then tells me my Dad sent her all these memes about things she's done. He didn't give her the context that it's a generic meme from the internet and what it's about. Now, my Aunt thinks I made all these memes about her real life events.\n\nAt this point, the entire family thinks I created this meme on the internet about my Aunt's antics in public. There is a back and forth discussion about it being really rude of me. She's pulling a Karen and starts chewing me out. Meanwhile, I am looking at my Dad like W-T-F, back me up here. My Dad finally steps in to say that this is just a random viral internet thing and that I didn't make these up behind my Aunt's back. \n\nEven after explaining, she's a bit irritated. It is apparent she is embarrassed that she is so much like a \"Karen\" and couldn't tell the difference between the stories online and her own encounters. \n \nTL;DR: I told my Dad about the Karen meme because my Aunt is named Karen and acts like a \"Karen.\" My Dad sends my Aunt memes he found, my aunt think I made them about her, she bring it up at my Dad's birthday dinner, and pulls a Karen on me.\n\nedit: redundant sentence",

After the third time it happened she said  \u201cI\u2019m really gassy\u201d. I took this as an opportunity to quickly press down on her stomach which then almost immediately triggered an enormous fart.\n\nI lost it! It was so funny and I could feel the vibration as the pressure caused her to fart again and again. I couldn\u2019t help myself and kept doing it. \n\nThis is how I f**ked up.\n\nAfter a few successful attempts I tried for a final push. I wanted to end it on a huge one. It was so funny and she was laughing so much!!\n\nI pushed down and nothing. So.. I pushed again but this time MUCH harder... \n\nNow this is where I should note that she was wearing nothing but one of my T-shirt\u2019s. Hence she had no underwear on.\n\nMy girlfriend sharted. She sharted and then had a SEVERE follow through... all over our bed.\n\nShe was mortified. It went from pure joy to absolute chaos and horror... she was just staring at me blankly like she had just killed someone..\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do as she went quiet.. my legs covered in shit..I stared right back, gently held her hands and walked together to the shower without looking back at the bed or down at my legs.. we didn\u2019t say a word.\n\nI cleaned up my legs before leaving her to clean herself up. She made me promise not to go into the bedroom.\n\nI adore her completely. She looked so scared when I left her in the shower and wouldn\u2019t let me clean up despite my offering to do so.\n\nEventually, I walked in the bedroom to help. She was so apologetic although I assured her that it\u2019s completely fine.\n\nShe burst out laughing when I said to her \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You will always be my little shit\u201d.\n\nDon\u2019t worry guys. All good!

I turned on the hallway light and it was EVERYWHERE, like, 360 degrees of puke. she came out of the bathroom looking embarrased. she apologized for making a mess in the hallway, and I said \"hey, I'm not even mad, I'm more impressed that you were able to make such a mess! it's on the ceiling! it's on the door behind you! how did you even do that?\"  \n\n\nbodily functions can feel embarrassing, but they're natural",

CottonDynoSaur is mostly known for his MHW streams and his part on the RageGaming channel but he still consistently finds topics inside the genre of MH to pull people in. \n\nAs for the information gathering, you need to scope out the total player base for the game, see how many other people are streaming it, calculate the likelihood of you reliably pulling from those numbers etc etc, there\u2019s tons of things you need to do before even starting. \n\nLastly like with OP\u2019s s/o don\u2019t be discouraged by low views. Disguised Toast didn\u2019t build is followers and subs in a day, neither did Regiskillbin, Dekkster, Markiplier, Ninja, or any of the other big names (granted some of those you may not consider big names). It takes time, lots of time, often weeks/months before you see any significant progress. \n\nThis is just an informative comment, it\u2019s not directed at/to anyone. Just my way of trying to help anyone having a tough time getting started.",

            "I know how the feeling of talking to yourself to an empty chat room. The game he is playing might be part of the problem. Something that is very popular it is hard to get noticed on. So new popular games or things like Fortnite and Warzone are over saturated with streamers. What I ended up doing was switching to something I liked that was older and had a large following but very few streamers. Pokemon go me from around 20 followers to over 100 and affiliated in a few weeks. Problem is when I moved away from that game only a few followers came to watch the other games. Eventually I ran out of steam I didn't want to be talking to myself anymore so I quit. Every now and then I stream again and a few people pop in but not very often. Also I'm a bit jealous that he has someone like you to show up for him I was streaming for months and my wife never showed up once to a stream. She supposed it and everything just never showed up to chat or anything. I think that telling him will let him know that you at least cared enough to show up for him.",

            "\"Although he only has one person watching, that is one person believing in him\"\n\nHe's absolutely right. You believe in supporting him so much you signed up for an account, watched and made comments. That's big.",

We then had a brief back and forth and he laid down the challenge. \n\nHe wants us to go at it either in a ring or in a dojo. I told him to message me before he gets here so we can actually make this happen. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in over my head or not but I\u2019m not about to back down. I have a surface-level amount of training from my time in the infantry and in law enforcement but he has a similar background. While I highly doubt he will follow through, I better start legitimately training just in case.\n\nNever in a million years did I think he\u2019d respond let alone challenge me to an actual fisticuffs like we\u2019re in the 1800\u2019s but here we are. \n\nI can provide redacted screenshots in the comments for proof if mods allow it or I can provide them with screenshots if they want to verify. \n\nTL;DR - I pissed off a sitting U.S. Congressman enough that he challenged me to fight him in 2022 and I accepted.\n\nEDIT: Welp, this blew up. Just woke up. I will read through all comments as time allows today and reply where I can. I just posted a couple of redacted screenshots in the comments. Thanks for the encouragement, fellow Americans and random fellow humans around the world.\n\nEDIT 2: As usual, internet sleuths have figured it out. The congressman is Clay Higgins. Do your thing, internet. Maybe we can find a way to use this to raise money for charity even if he backs down. PR folks, message me. Not sure how to proceed but I\u2019m willing to train and make this happen for a good cause.\n\nEDIT 3: Here\u2019s a quick update: I have had a couple of PR folks and trainers reach out to me and we will see where all of this goes. Realistically, I suspect Clay will continue to ignore all this as numerous people mentioned that is his MO and apparently this isn\u2019t his first time challenging people to a fight on social media. But I will train anyway as it\u2019ll be fun and good for me. For those who were wondering, I was a Republican until around 2012 when I shifted left of center a bit and became an independent. I joined the Democratic Party in 2020. I hope someday the GOP shifts back toward moderate but I won\u2019t hold my breath. We really need more Adam Kinzinger\u2019s in that party. Anyway, it\u2019s going to take *days* to read through these comments and reply to some so bear with me. Thanks for the support.",

            "Alaska  is a weird place. For some reason I went to Alaska for college, don\u2019t ask me why. Just looked beautiful and I had a scholarship so I figured \u201cWhy not\u201d.\n\nIt was actually really hard to make friends because I was the only out of state student, but I had this really hot chem professor named Dr. Lee. She was really young for a professor, I think she went to grad school young, and probably one of those students who were always several grades ahead. But she was one of those new-age chicks who wore her hair up in a bun with hornrim glasses and clogs to work every day. She seemed so stylish yet nerdy and intellectual at the same time. \n\nI went to every office hours and tried to make sure I was signed up to the smallest lab section I could. It paid off one day when we had lab on Saturday, due to some renovations, and NOBODY showed up except me. It was a small department so we didn\u2019t have a TA which meant Dr. Lee was teaching the lab herself. \n\nAt first it was pretty normal, she just walked me through the basic titration experiment. I was nervous as hell so my hands kept shaking, but she took it as I was worried about my grade. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stress so much!\u201d she said with a laugh. She put her hand on my shoulder and I sort of jumped and felt my heart pounding. \u201cIf you make a mistake you can start over. I\u2019m here all day anyway, in fact I\u2019ll be in my office if you need me since you\u2019re good enough to work on your own for a bit.\u201d\n\nShe left me in the lab and it was actually pretty easy, not that I was good at chem or anything. I had just been busting my ass studying chem and ignoring everything else because I wanted to impress her. But then I realized how dumb I was being rushing to finish sooner when she already said she\u2019d be there all day. *This was my chance*, I told myself because I was a dumb college kid. So I looked around, saw the coast was clear, and dumped it down the sink. \n\nThen I went upstairs and up to her office. \u201cHuh, her first name is Griselda, weird\u201d I thought looking at her nameplate. *What am I doing this will never work?* I tried to push that inner voice down as I knocked on her door. \n\n\u201cHey um Grisel-, er um, I mean Dr Lee, I uh messed it up. I keep trying it and it\u2019s going way past the titration point.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Well don\u2019t worry you\u2019re the only one that showed up. I\u2019ll give you an A just for coming in, so you won\u2019t be nervous, then we can work it together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow really? Great thanks,\u201d I said thinking *That\u2019s not why I\u2019m nervous* but trying to keep my cool. \n\n\u201cJust let me finish these emails and grab a bite to eat first and I\u2019ll enter your grade.\u201d\n\nI looked up at the posters on the walls. It was all Alaskan wilderness stuff, forests and mountain streams plus a big poster from the periodic table.\n\n\u201cBarium, huh?\u201d I said looking at the poster, desperate to make conversation. \n\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s my favorite element. Alchemists used to think barium had magic powers to transform living things just because the rocks would glow after absorbing light.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, okay cool.\u201d *I feel like such an idiot.* She finished her emails and reached into her mini fridge. I was getting desperate to make conversation as I looked in her fridge. \n\n\u201cWow that\u2019s a lot of salmon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I try to eat healthy. You know, salmon, berries, nuts, and sometimes a little honey. All natural foods.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh cool I\u2019ll have to try that instead of ramen, heh heh\u2026\u201d *I buried my face in my hand while her back was turned. \n\n\u201cOkay just one second,\u201d she said with a mouthful of blueberries. \u201cI\u2019ll just log into your account and enter the lab results so we can save a trip back to my office. Looks like your username is your email and your password is\u2026..drleeishot?\u201d\n\nI froze. *This is the worst moment in my life*, I thought to myself. \n\n\u201cIn the future you might want to bear in mind what you say when someone might read it.\u201d\n\nSomehow through all the blood rushing to my head, it all hit me as I was trying to avoid her piercing glare. \n\nHer favorite element was barium. \n\nShe ate a lot of berries and salmon. \n\nHer name was *Gris*elda *Lee*. \n\nShe told me to *bear* in mind what I say. \n\n*Oh my God\u2026*\n\nDr. Lee was a bear disguised as a human. \n\nRealizing that I had seen through the deception, the bear tore off its human costume and began chasing me down the hall. I cried out for help not realizing it was Saturday and the offices were empty. But I kept crying out as I ran for the fire exit, the bear gaining on me with every step. \n\nJust as I pushed the fire doors open, the bear grabbed my leg and I felt shooting pains as it dug its claws into my skin. The fire alarm started going off and the flashing lights momentarily distracted the bear allowing me to pull my leg free. I limped across the landing but lost my footing as I frantically ran down the steps, tumbling down the lower half as I began to feel excruciating pain from the wound in my leg. The bear seemed to pace at the top of the steps, buying me only a couple precious moments as it found its way to the wheelchair ramp and came barreling down on me just as I reached the main quad. \n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d I shouted out at no one in particular. The quad seemed desperately empty on a Saturday and my cries just seemed to echo off the building. Just as I felt the bear shove me down and pounce on top, ready to tear my throat open with its powerful jaws, I heard a loud \u201cPop!\u201d and the massive bear fell down on top of me, fast asleep from a tranquilizer dart. I saw three men in Game Warden uniforms trying to pull the beast off of me as I passed out. \n\nWhen I woke up there were paramedics checking me and one of the wardens came over and put a blanket over my shoulders. \u201cNot what you expected when you came to Alaska, huh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis whole semester, it was really a bear just waiting for its chance to kill me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah they\u2019re a lot more clever than most of you down in the Lower 48 think. Knew a guy once was married to one for three years before it mauled him. So, when you go back home and people ask you which is the worst state, what are you gonna tell them?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh Mississippi for sure. Fuck that place!\u201d",

For some reason I (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say \"Well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? DAB!\" and promptly did the deed. Also I have ability to cry on demand so I just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.\n\nShe finds it funny. Extremely funny. So funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. After a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. I asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. Freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, I start to reach for my phone.\n\nAnd in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. I only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying I think she's having a seizure and I'm calling 911. Fortunately, I was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.\n\nTurns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. Whoops.\n\nTL;DR. Made I joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. She ended up in the hospital and I almost lost my job.\n\n",

        "selftext": "So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.\n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't \u201cwork\u201d. This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a \u201creal\u201d job I was cutting and running from this work.\n\nWell, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.\n\nSo, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.\n\nI want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.\n\nTl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor \u201cwant's to talk\u201d and I want to die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nobligatory update:\n\nWell, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.\n\nI ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.\n\nHe had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of \"Customer\\_Commission\\_2nd draft.doc\"). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and \"realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read\".\n\nI gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would \"pretend this never happened.\" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was \"well written at least\" from what he read.\n\nLike I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",

None of which are his wife.  \n\nSo I print my pictures and just hand it back to him without saying anything. I don\u2019t want to embarrass co-teacher on my first day at that school. Now for some reason, I forget the exact details, he wants me to do even more pictures. So I throw them on the flash drive in their own clearly labeled folder. \n\nThis time he follows me over to the computer. I figure that since the pictures are in their own folder the software is only going to bring up the pictures stored there. Nope. It again does all the pictures. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking at a bunch of pictures of my co-teacher banging some chicks with him looking over my shoulder.

I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it\u2019s versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. \n\nFast forward to this morning and as we\u2019re getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it\u2019s show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me.

We\u2019ve been playing with that thing for days. \n\nTeacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?\n\nI start to panic- oh shit it\u2019s not a toy...\n\nTeacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. \n\nI get confused. \n\nTeacher notes my confusion: it\u2019s um, used to collect menstrual blood...\n\nI\u2019m still confused...\n\nTeacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood\n\nMe: It just...stays in there? \n\nShe nods. \n\nMe: are you sure? I don\u2019t think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. \n\nTeacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....\n\nWe\u2019re both clearly uncomfortable. \n\nMe: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. \n\n\nMy wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.\n\nTL:DR thought my wife\u2019s menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell\n\nEdit: WOW!!!! I cannot believe this got so much attention. I\u2019m glad everyone got a good laugh. A bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn\u2019t know it was me, though. \n\nMy wife has been reading the comments and insisted that I clarify that I know all about her cycle. We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she\u2019s ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it \u201cfitting\u201d because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I\u2019ve seen a tampon- they\u2019re much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn\u2019t even feel it\u2019s presence after it\u2019s im position. \n\nI\u2019d like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife\u2019s approval.",

She was my first girlfriend and I was head over heels for her. \u201cBabycakes\u201d was my pet name for her. Only a few weeks into dating, my family left on a cruise to Alaska, so I was calling her constantly, which my brothers endlessly mocked me for. One time my phone was out, so I called her from my younger brother\u2019s phone - after the call, he found the number and changed her name in his phone to Babycakes. All good fun.\n\nFast-forward a few years, my brother has now met a nice woman and they are planning their wedding. My wife is involved in some of the planning, including some special surprises the groom and our family are planning for his fianc\u00e9e and her family. So of course, my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is seeing texts pop up on his screen from Babycakes, and him get all secretive about them, shielding his phone with his body, or sneaking off to make a call after. Now, this woman is no shrinking violet, so she asks him about it straight up. My brother (he isn\u2019t too swift) doesn\u2019t quite get the implication, and he makes things worse by being secretive about it, since he can\u2019t see it\u2019s his sister in law because she\u2019ll be able to guess it\u2019s a wedding surprise, since my wife is a professional event planner and particularly known for cool and surprising things. \n\nThis is going on right up until the week of the wedding. There is noticeable tension between them.

I think she was nauseated by the reference and figured out everything that had happened in the same fraction of a second (she is much smarter than my brother). I won\u2019t say everything just laughed it off after as it seemed like there were some real hurt feelings but at least everything got out before the actual wedding.

That\u2019s right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. \n\nSeriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory \u201cnot technically today\u201d) but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I\u2019m off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren\u2019t batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. \n\n[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here\u2019s the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I\u2019m jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can\u2019t come on my own if my head isn\u2019t under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I\u2019ve only slept for four hours. I\u2019m losing my mind. \n\nAnyway, at this point I\u2019m abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I\u2019d put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.\n\nI\u2019m sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn\u2019t. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I\u2019m bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? \n\nOnce my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I\u2019ve ever done. \n\nI continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn\u2019t go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of \u201cwhat the fuck have i done\u201d red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. \n\nNow I\u2019ve got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I\u2019ll probably have to cancel. I\u2019ve been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can\u2019t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I\u2019m shit out of luck. \n\nTL;DR: I masturbated and now I\u2019m\ndown one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.\n\nEDIT: Sweet baby jesus\u2019s clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn\u2019t stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I\u2019ve never been more grateful for the colloquialism \u201cbooty\u201d). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.\n\nEDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I\u2019m bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess.",

We are both on our second marriage, I\u2019m a widower and she\u2019s divorced. \n\nMy late wife was very very adventurous and her first husband was vanilla missionary or nothing. \n\nOver lunch yesterday we talked about sex and how it\u2019s become mundane with her admitting that she\u2019s only really ever felt comfortable with \u201cordinary\u201d sex because that\u2019s all she\u2019s known.  I suggested we get a book for her to read to get an idea of what she might like to try. \n\nSo we went into town to the bookshop and bought a book which she spent the next three hours reading in the bath. \n\nCome bed time, 9pm unusually, I\u2019m dragged to bed and set upon in very pleasurable way until about an hour in I feel fingers caressing my anus and perineum.  Then a finger followed and to my surprise the one and only vibrator (a small one) we have was pushed inside of me.  Much pleasure was had until my wife gasped and started to sound worried. \n\nBehind me I felt a lot of fumbling, wife was sounding worried then just stopped and said sorry. I  asked what had happened, the vibe had slipped (been pushed) a little to far and had gone all the way in. \n\nFor the next hour we tried to excrete the thing and finally gave up, still buzzing inside. \n\nAs we\u2019d both had a drink a taxi was booked and a trip to A&E was made.  \n\nIt took only a few minutes with a speculum, lube and forceps to remove the then quiet vibe from me and after promising to be more careful in future we returned home. \n\nThis morning I skipped my normal bike ride and have sat gingerly at my desk. \n\nWife just wandered in and wondered if I\u2019d like to get a bigger vibe so it doesn\u2019t get stuck.  I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve awakened. \n\nTldr: bought wife a sex book and ended up in a&e with vibe stuck in my anus.\n\nUpdate. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i0v2ld/tifupdate_by_buying_my_wife_a_sex_book/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nThank you all",

        "selftext": "Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I\u2019d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I\u2019ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady\u2019s second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I\u2019d spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn\u2019t enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked \u201cwhy are you buying all of these boxes of staples\u201d. But I brushed it off as a work issue that I\u2019d get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn\u2019t know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis past Thursday after one of my \u201clate nights\u201d I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying \u201cwhat are you talking about\u201d until my mom said \u201choney, we saw the pictures\u201d. Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me \u201cdo something\u201d with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I...I like staples.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn\u2019t laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelieve it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a \u201cstaple hour\u201d once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.\n\nEDIT: \n\nThank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people\u2019s perspectives on my problem.\n\n1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.\n\n2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.\n\n3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn\u2019t think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn\u2019t think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.\n\n4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It\u2019s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",

        "selftext": "As preface to this TIFU I am commiting one of the greatest societal taboos and revealing a secret that heretofore has been zealously guarded throughout the ages. It is a correlate to childbirth in that just as post-menopausal women wouldn't dare tell an expectant mother how truly agonizing childbirth is, no man in his 50s would traumatize a man in his youthful prime with fears of the anatomical horror that is to come. But times have changed and new technology places men in grave danger, so now you must know of this biological atrocity, in order that you might avoid my disastrous FU....  \nSometime around midlife, men's hair follicles undergo a revolting mutation. While hair atop one's head thins and drops, new hair grows in places you never imagined. Bristle-stiff tufts sprout outside and inside of ears, and up nostrils. Eyebrows become bushy, unruly and coarse. Pubic hair turns gray and scraggly (I shit you not). All these hairs grow alarming fast and require constant attention, lest you become that guy with a bunny paw sticking out of his ear. Their eradication is a battle men wage stoically and silently through the second half of their lives. And, as with any battle, there are casualties. Now, onto my TIFU.\n\nI found a great nose hair trimmer in the As Advertised On TV aisle at CVS. It looks like and operates like a minature hedge trimmer. It's virtually impossible to cut yourself but mows down the hair.\n\nYesterday I was trimming ear, nose and eyebrow hairs after a shower. I was so happy with the results that I decided to try it on my pubes too. It worked great! Soon I had gone a bit overboard and pretty much shaved my balls and the base of the shaft to the skin. I liked the new look, but my bushy taint was a testicular neck beard that had to go.\n\nI positioned a make up mirror on the bathroom floor and laid down spread eagle, knees up, so I could see and trim everything well. Where once just a few wispy hairs prevailed, unbeknownst to me a virtual forest had arisen! Worst of all, my butthole was sporting Borat mustache assbrows. Trusty new nose hair trimmer in hand, I prepared for battle. \n\nThe assbrows had to go first. I began on the left and quickly decimated the bunghole caterpillar. I moved decisively to the right, prepared to take down assbrow two with one swift stroke close to the skin. However, this was not to be. Instead, my ass hairs wrapped around the trimmer blade like Rappunzel using a superheated curling iron, pulling the device tight against my skin and jamming the blade. The hairs were being ripped from my flesh and the pain was excruciating. No matter how I tried, I couldn't remove the trimmer. Wiggling it  tugged the hairs more; restarting it was a double down that I lost - the hairs were wound even tighter against the blade.\n\nI frog walked naked to my bedroom, one hand holding the trimmer tied between my butt cheeks, and searched for my cuticle scissors. No luck. I did however find a carpet knife. Unbearable pain breeds desperation. Back on the bathroom floor, I tried in vain to cut myself free, nicking the tenderest of flesh twice and drawing the first blood of battle. I was making little progress and it was time to make the ultimate sacrifice. After a suitable prayer, I gripped tight on the trimmer and committed reverse harakiri, Brazilian wax style, ripping off the trimmer blade along with its assbrow net trap. Blinding pain left me curled fetal, hyperventilating, while blood slowly trickled down my ass crack.\n\nI decided to share my TIFU and expose life's cruel secret in the best interest of mankind, that others may avoid falling prey to the technological wonders of As Seen on TV hair removal tools. Young men of Reddit, I beg of you to heed my warning. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nTL;DR used nose hair trimmer on bunghole brows, tore myself a new one.\n\nEdit:. I was pretty sure this TIFU would be popular but I'm genuinely blown away. 57,000 upvotes in a day!?!  54 awards!?!  My post in the same league as the coconut and poop knife!?!?!?!\n So humbling. Thank you. \nMany of you complimented my writing, and you have no idea how much that means to me.  I toiled as a construction industry technical editor for decades. I am writing a book but I've stalled several times. Your compliments are giving me inspiration to pick it up again.\n\nEdit 2.   This is the trimmer.

Obligatory didn\u2019t happen today, but I\u2019ve never told anyone this story so I figured I should before I die.\n\nSo when I was about 7, my parents took me and my little sister to the park, as parents do. Someone had graffitied the slide with the word \u201cfuck\u201d and being the curious kid I was, asked my dad what it meant.\n\nI hadn\u2019t had the \u201cbirds and the bees\u201d talk yet, so my dad figured this was an appropriate time to do so. He goes through the basic idea, man puts peepee in woman and she has a baby grow in her tummy. That\u2019s what the word meant! Too bad he forgot to tell me that it was a swear and NOT the proper term for the act.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, my parents sat me down and revealed that my mom was going to have another baby. I was confused. Don\u2019t two people have to fuck to make a baby? I certainly never saw my parents do such a thing. So I had to ask.\n\n\u201cWhen did you fuck?\u201d\n\nObviously my mother lost it and demanded I tell her who taught me that word, whether it was one of the neighborhood kids or someone from school. I told her dad taught me. \n\nNeedless to say, my dad probably didn\u2019t get another fuck for a while after that.\n\nTL;DR: Dad told me what \u201cfuck\u201d meant but forgot to tell me I shouldn\u2019t say it; ended up asking mom why I never saw them make a baby in the most inappropriate way possible",

            "Lol I remember learning that 'fuck' was a bad word when my family was sitting down to dinner when our grandma was over one night. My sister wanted to go through all the words that rhymed with 'duck' starting from the beginning of the alphabet. Neither of us knew the word was bad, and it's not like my parents didn't see it coming. So she says 'fuck' and immediately my mom gets super pissed. Yells at her to go to her room. I'm older than her, but at the time I was also too young to understand. So I keep asking what did she say? Why did you get mad? Etc. And meanwhile my grandma is just laughing in her cute little old lady chuckles. My dad was just like, really? The kids don't know. Let her come back for supper. Took me a long while afterwards to really know what that word meant lol.\n\nEdit: thank you for the awards! Very cool that this goofy story has gotten this much attention.

        "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\nWe've all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.\n\nI couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. \n\nWithout even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. \n\nMy irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled \"What kind of question is this? Of course not.\" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. \n\nI left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. \n\nFor the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. \n\nI feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life\n\nTLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside\n\nUPDATE:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bbcqlk/tifupdate_by_destroying_the_entirety_of_my_family/",

I ask him to slide the picture a little as I don't want to touch other people's property, so without looking he swipes his finger, which accidentally jumps to the next picture which is nothing but dick.

At first it was because all the barber shops were closed but then even after I got my hands on a hair clipper it became more amusing to see how far I could take this. Covid had put a stop to my dating life so I wasn't trying to clean up for anyone. So after a year of letting my hair grow out it is now shoulder length.\n\nAnother side effect of covid is my weight. I used to go to the gym regularly but stopped once the gyms were closed due to covid. I have never been the type to run on the streets so my weight gained the covid 25 akin to the proverbial freshman 15. I have a pretty skinny frame to begin with so what that means is that all the fat went to my stomach and my now \"man boobs\".\n\nThere is just one last piece of information before I can start. I am the type of Asian that has trouble growing facial hair. \n\nSo now we can begin. As most of you know, we are reaching the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of covid. Most states are relaxing their lockdown restrictions and my gym finally reopened last week. Eager to get back into shape, I went on the first day of the reopening. I do my thing on the machines and maybe pushed myself a little too hard or perhaps I am just that out of shape because I was a complete mess by the end of my workout. I make my way toward the men's room but this cute gym employee who was sanitizing the water fountain in between the men's and women's room intercepted me. She said \"you can use that one\" pointing to the women's room and in my exhausted and muscle already starting to ache state, I only thought perhaps there was something wrong with the men's room and that they closed it off. So I go in the women's room (it was empty because the gym just reopened) and I take care of business. When I come out, she said \"I think what you're doing is brave\" and I for some reason thought she meant going to the gym again and said thanks. It wasn't until I got to my car that the light bulb in my head finally turned on - she must think I'm a transwoman. The long hair, man boobs and no facial hair.\n\nNow it wouldn't be so bad if that was the only interaction I have with her but the next day she came over as I was running on the treadmill to introduce herself. And because I have been going to the gym almost everyday (since I'm serious about getting back into shape) she and I have developed a sort of friendship. Just today she asked how long I have been transitioning and I said since covid. I don't know how long I can keep this up for... this is the cheapest gym in my area so I don't want to switch.\n\nTLDR; Gained long hair and moobs during covid. Gym finally reopened and cute employee thinks I'm a transwoman.",

If someone wants to tell you they're trans, they will if you are genuinely open & welcoming- and making assumptions is neither.\n\nAnother example besides the one this post: I've been in so many group  situations where a well intentioned cis stranger comes up to me and asks me my pronouns, and then doesn't ask anybody else in the room. A lot of people heard \"ask people their pronouns\" but only apply it to those they clock as trans.

Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. \n\nAs such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing \"boobs\" and \"butts in thongs\" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. \n\nOne night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had \"homework\" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. \n\nSo I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.\n\nNow this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.\n\nYou see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. \n\nThe desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.\n\nBut what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. \n\nI also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. \n\nI eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.\n\nAnd that's when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.\n\nSo I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. \n\nNo one ever brought it up. And I'm thankful. But I know what they saw. And I'm still cringing.\n\nTl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.\n\nEdit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.\n\nEDIT: Holy fuck lmao. I'm proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this.",

When we got home my brother was there, and sat down with us and talked for a bit before I made an excuse for me and my girlfriend to go downstairs to my room.\n\nI was, for some reason really horny and really wanted to go at it with my girlfriend. So we got to my room and closed the door, and started going at it. I\u2019ll mention right here that in my room I have absolutely no vents, but there is one on the ceiling outside of my door. So, it went from me fingering my girlfriend, to eating her out, to getting my strap-on out and just full blown fucking her, doggy style. In the heat of it all she was more than just loud, but I didn\u2019t really shush her cause I knew I didn\u2019t have any vents in my room. At one point she told me to stop and we did, me hunched over her like savage animal. She told me she thought she heard my door open, I turned and saw it was closed. We shrugged it off and continued for a bit longer.\n\nThe next day me and her both go to work early in the morning, and I come back home late evening. I went to my bro\u2019s room, just wanting to talk. When he saw me, he immediately explained with such as one could only describe as a broken look in his eyes, how he went to my room the previous night wanting to ask if our cat was in my room, and instead saw his sister boning her girlfriend doggy style. Apparently he could also hear her yelling as well, and that\u2019s when I realized I did have a vent outside my door. \n\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh my ass off, and he kinda did as well. I knew this thing would probably happen at some point to me. Now he knows not to open my door without knocking. \n\nTL;DR My bro walked in on me and my gf fucking like animals, and I was too horny to recognize he had opened the door and got a serious eye full."

I'll never forget one time server waited on customer that left a decent credit card tip (nothing crazy but definitely a day maker). They called the day that the tip posted in their bank and complained that they were supposedly dyslexic and they transposed the numbers in the tip amount.

I haven\u2019t had much opportunity, at least that I was aware of, but I try when I can. I have been on the receiving end of kindness that made a difference.\n\nThis is back over 10 years ago, when my son was a toddler. Before mobile banking was popular. My ex was living in Germany, got there and decided to do a solo tour, after his deployment. Money was really tight, because him changing his mind last minute meant no BAH. It might have helped if I had know that beer, bars, and prostitutes had apparently been a priority over his wife and son, but I digress. \n\nIt was the day before payday (def a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle) and we had enough that I could take my son and I to his fave restaurant. I called the bank before we left to make sure. Got there, *ate* and went to pay. Declined. I called the bank to see my ex had over drafted like 600$, and I had no cash. I was calling him over and over, because it was like 3am his time, and he was supposed to be in bed. Anyways, this man figures out that I can\u2019t pay, I was near tears, no one local to call. Oh yeah, two guesses why he needed the money.... yelled at me that I was wasting money on restaurants. Yeah. \n\nHe just came over and said he\u2019d taken care of my bill, and gave me 20$ to also take the kiddo for icecream. I cried and thanked him as much as I could. Tried to refuse the cash. He was insistent. It was a lucky thing I did. Because even after we got paid, because of all the OD fees, my ex called his grandpa to bring me money to replace it. He always had a bailout, so what did he care. That 20$ kept us in milk while we waited, which having a toddler, I couldn\u2019t have done without.",

I was psyched as it was my first; and so far, only; time going. \nMy parents had put aside $400 for the trip to pay for food, and souvenirs as well as my tickets in. \nWell... the day before I leave, my mom, sister and I are doing some last minute things. Buying some shoes, haircuts, trip things, etc. Well, some time between those stops, we had to go the the currency exchange in our neighborhood for something... well... somehow... the $400 dollars in cash was left there. My mom was freaking out, rightfully so... she sped back there and to our dismay... someone must\u2019ve found it and kept it. \nI was upset that my mom was so upset and remember saying it was okay... I didn\u2019t need to go. Ultimately my oldest sister gave my mom some cash and I still got to go on my trip. Something I\u2019ll always be grateful for. \nLooking back, when my family look back and laugh on the absurdity of the day... she sped back, driving in tears as my older sister was panicking saying for her to pull over so she could drive... we like to think that maybe... just maybe... the person who found it; it was an unmarked envelope full of cash; maybe needed it badly. Maybe it was a mom or dad, worrying about paying the mortgage, or if they were gonna be able to buy groceries, or they needed to pay a bill to keep the lights or gas or water on, and that money got them out of the weeds. It was a very lower to middle class area, so I like to think it helped someone who needed it. \n\nWho knows? It could be something completely different, but we like to keep that day optimistic.",

I was told everything was paid for (but no one said anything about a tip), and so when I went to pick it up I tipped again. I didn\u2019t really read the receipt too closely (middle of the quarantine, just trying to get out) and essentially ended up accidentally tipping 40% on a $70 takeout bill. Luckily no one was too mad since it was supporting a small business in my town that was having to deal with the pandemic.",

It was an incredibly stressful event, and combined with my innate shyness about pooping anywhere but at home, at first I didn't notice that I wasn't pooping. After about two weeks I began to feel awful and tried, without success, to shit. It had built up so much that I think it was impacted. To top it off, my aunt and uncle were weird about bathroom stuff (partly due to having one bathroom in a household of 5 people) and twice while trying to force it they knocked on the door and asked what was taking so long, which made the whole thing worse. \n\n\nI didn't tell anyone, partly out of embarrassment and partly out of fear of getting in trouble. (They were strict and I did get in trouble for random things). Another very uncomfortable 2 weeks passed, until one day, a month to the day that I had first arrived and the last time I had pooped, I was sent out to rake some leaves and I was just in total agony. I went back inside and told my aunt what was going on. She was thankfully very understanding (although incredulous that I had waited so long to tell her) and told me she'd had poop issues her whole life. She went out and got me laxatives, suppositories and a fleet enema and showed me how to use it. At this point I was in so much pain and just sweating bullets and dying for relief. \n\n\nThe remedies barely helped matters, but in an hour or so I hopped on the toilet and tried to make things happen. \n\n\nI put both hands on the walls and pushed with all my force, knees up to my chin, straining with all my might. I've since given birth and I pushed harder during this shit than I did pushing out my son. It hurt *so bad* and I felt I was straining every muscle in my body to void this beast. After 10 or so horrifying minutes I still wasn't having any luck, and I began wondering if I should ask to go to the hospital, but the idea of a doctor digging shit out of my asshole way just too much to bear, so I pressed on. After 15-20 agonizing minutes, grunting and straining and thrashing and pleading with my ass to cooperate, finally, finally, I heard my first heavy *plop*. Oh thank God! I cried from the pain and shock and relief. The first foot or so of poop wasn't much easier, it was so hard and dry. I had to twist and strain for awhile, but after that it got a bit easier. About 30 minutes in I stood up and looked into the bowl. Have you ever had a shit so large, so complete that it entirely filled the rim of the toilet, halfway up the bowl rising above the water in thick brown and black coils, iced with a significant amount of blood? I have. I have never and I mean never seen a pile of human shit like that and hope never to again. I would say about 3-4kg of shit. About the size of a large round birthday cake.\n\n\nI flushed once, twice, plunged, and got back on the toilet for round 2. It just kept coming. This part was significantly easier, despite the fact that my ass had torn a little in the process of round 1. Round 2 was about 3/4 of the size of round 1. Finally, the flood stopped, and I gingerly wiped, flushed, cleaned the toilet and emerged from the bathroom a changed person. I ached inside for a few days after but oh my god the relief was incredible. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. \n\n\nTL;DR; didn't shit for a month, had the most painful shit apocalypse ever and lived to tell the tale.",

I throw the gun in the plains, get my pants off as fast as I could and then hit it hard. The final result was something that looked like a brown folded snake. I got so much relief after that, but it wasn't over yet, something was missing and that was toilet paper.\nSo i pull off my blouse, wiped my ass with it and then  threw it in a barrel near the sentry box. After that i put it on fire as the sentry box was far away from buildings in some distanced corner of the camp and i didn't want someone to find that shit after me.\n\nI think, 17 years after the event, that maybe that brown snakey thing is still there as a monument of my service in that camp.\n\nSorry for my bad English.",

            "I quit smoking about 8 years ago now, after smoking for 22 years. I guess you could say Cold Turkey because one day I was smoking and the next day I lost interest and never had another one. I always enjoyed an outdoor smoke later in the evening, after my wife went to bed and it typically caused the overwhelming urge to poop. I was regular like a German railroad. Smoke = Poop.\n\nAfter about a week smokeless, I noticed I was quite backed up and I started taking a very gentle OTC laxative, but got nothing. Moved up a notch in efficacy but got nothing. Couple more days go by and I am taking serious laxatives, doubling and tripling the dosage, but I am plugged up tight. Did some internet research and concluded I need to go to the ER.\n\nTook about 4 hours to get in, told my story, told them the list of the products I tried, was given some official weapons grade laxatives. They said go home, charge your tablet, phone in sick, change into something easy to open, with a drawstring perhaps, no button fly jeans. When you are ready, take the dose, only a single dose and go sit on the toilet. It didn\u2019t soften stool like most laxatives, it stimulated rectal peristalsis.\n\nTook 10 minutes after swallowing the meds dissolved in a glass of water for it to kick in. I shit out shit from 1974, I shit out shit from my neighbor, I shit out shit from Jimmy Hoffa, I shit out shit from JFK! Repeated the whole process again about 3 weeks later. Ultimately took about 6 months to learn to poop again naturally, but now I am #1 at #2!\n\nEDIT; Wow, this really blew up! Reminds me of that day! I will address numerous common themes at once. The name of the substance was the aptly named **Manevac** which is a distilled Senna product.\n\nI hadn\u2019t been enjoying smoking for sometime and eventually something just changed in my brain. Many people have asked me over the years how I did it and I wish I could say, if I could market it I would be rich. One day I was a smoker, the next day not and never had a single craving. I used to panic if I was out of cigs, so I kept the pack I was working on, there were 3 smokes in a box of Winston 100\u2019s, in the glove box of my truck for about 5 years. Knew I had them, so no panic, just chose not to smoke them. This will be 8 years in September, pretty sure I don\u2019t have cancer. \n\nYou are all correct, I do not know anything about German railroads, it has always been a metaphor I used for reliability. I won\u2019t anymore. Maybe Swiss timepiece?\n\nI learned to poop without stimulants, I also do not use caffeine, over time by eating correctly and drinking lots of water. Also pooping at the same time every day is a good thing, trains the conveyor belt when to run.\n\nThank you for all of the awards, especially the Gold - kind stranger! \n\nI never knew what RIP inbox meant until this morning.",

I didn't know these 7 guys. \n\nI thought fuck. Do I call the hospital. I can't close my ass. It's starting to come out but it's painful and i can't push anymore.

As I was enjoying my peak, my intestines started gurgling. It sounded like trapped demons were trying to scream their way out. I ran into the bathroom.

The moment of reckoning arrived and between the stitches and nearly three weeks worth of shit, it felt like I was passing a brick covered in broken glass. Gave myself a gnarly hemorrhoid for my trouble. \n\nKid number two I was prepared. I had ditched the dumbass boyfriend shortly after the positive pregnancy test and began stocking up on stool softeners. I began eating them like candy the moment I arrived at the hospital to deliver. Two weeks after I had my daughter I gave birth again. Significantly less painful this time, but still a long hour of sweating buckets and gripping walls. \n\nThird kid, I thought I was prepared. Unfortunately, the universe threw me a curve ball by having me have an emergency c-section two weeks early. I hadn\u2019t stocked up on stool softeners yet. After surgery I requested stool softeners from the nurses. They never came. My daughter had been sent to another hospital\u2019s NICU, so two days after my c-section I was discharged and traveled to her hospital. I got some softeners at the pharmacy and began eating them like my life depended on it. I was not interested in doing poo-battle with a fresh incision in my abdominal wall.  I spent the next few days waddling around feeling like a massive shit was imminent but nothing happened on the toilet. Finally on day eight, all alone in my Ronald McDonald House room, I grabbed the bathroom bar in one hand, the sink in the other and by the grace of god delivered what looked exactly like a bunch of bananas that had turned brown. \n\nTL;DR: if you find yourself with a positive pregnancy test in your hand, start taking stool softeners immediately.",

I couldn't stand up for 10 days because my leg was swolen so i had to do num 1 and num 2 in bed. Let me say you i hate those things they give you to shit in. Didn't work. At day 3 of those 10 days i get urge to shit but i suppress it. Then at the day 6 i get it again and suppress it.

I am praying that in the morning they give the green light so i can stand up and use crutches. They do. I stand up so fast and literally start running to bathroom, in the middle of the way to it, i fall down (because at that point i was almost 15 days in laying position, the blood left my head), and i am starting shitting myself.

            "Long story short, in college I was screwing around and cracked a vertibrae. Doc prescribed muscle relaxers and pain killers (opioids) and told me to stay off my feet because it could heal on its own and surgery would cause more problems. \n\nA week later, I realized I hadn't pooped. I stopped the drugs and waited. When I could finally poop, I had to give birth to what felt like an ostrich egg of a turd.  In the middle of it, I tried feeling it (using toilet paper) and it was pretty damn hard. Each push was agonizing not only from pushing the gigantic hard turd out of my rectum, but also because it put strain on my vertebrae that I had just broken and was feeling the full pain since I had stopped pain meds. \n\nAn hour and a half of agony later, it was done. I stopped taking the pain meds after that. \n\nTL:dr - Decided to tough out the pain of a broken vertibrae without any pain meds because I was fearful of giving birth to another ostrich egg.",

Had to poop the next day at work and I could feel it right there at the exit, but it would not come out. I spent an hour straining. My supervisor came into the bathroom to check on me. I had to tell this middle aged woman I had a poop that wouldn't come out. I felt real fear.",
            "I had the same exact agony you speak of when you were talking about the grunting and hands on the wall.  \n\nAfter a dental procedure I had deadly combo of painkillers and KFC mashed potatoes and gravy for 4 days straight. The painkillers turned those potatoes into cement in my stomach. I had to teach myself how to do the enema. I drank canola oil too. I did everything to try to ease this shit out. Here\u2019s the kicker, my friend. Our endings are different- after going into poop labor for 30 painful minutes (felt like 4 hours) I finally launched this demon seed out of my butt with insane velocity. The relief was like no other I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. Painful but assuring. I immediately looked into the toilet, I wanted to see this bastard that caused me so much pain. I see nothing.

            "During my career as an opiate addict, I went without shitting for up to and sometimes beyond a month many a time.

            "Ask anyone who has been through basic military training and they will tell you that the stress, busy schedule, and the amount of exercise you do leads to people not pooping for the first two weeks.  I lost 14 pounds in my first 2 weeks and didn\u2019t poop once that whole time.",
            "Anybody who has a history with opiates will have a lot of sympathy for this. Since opiates paralyze the muscles that are responsible for peristalsis, constipation is a constant thing that has to be dealt with. \n\nFor those who dont know, pariastalsis is the way that your muscles transport your shit through your intestines. The muscles squeeze the walls of the intestines in a wave like motion, which forces things to move from one end to the other.\n\nWith the muscles not working, your shit spends more time in the colon than normal, which means your intestines suck all the water out, when you also add the fact that everything backs up and gets compacted, you literally feel like you're shitting a brick. Hard and dry are not words that should be describing your bowel movement. When it gets bad its not uncommon for there to be more blood than shit on the t.p after you wipe. Not good. \n\nSo, to anybody who might think that 'heroin chic' is a thing, to anybody who thinks heroin is glamorous or romantic, before you go out and try it just remember that there is nothing romantic or glamorous about taking massive rectum tearing dumps all the time.",
            "I have this problem pretty often. I only take probably 25 BM\u2019s a year on average and the things that have really helped me are\n\n1. Vaseline, before I start lubricate the ring and it also helped with tearing\n\n2. A silicone spoon/ small spatula. When I was young I would just use my fingers but sometimes the best thing you can do your yourself is try to get something in between the wall of your ass and the BM it\u2019s self so you can try to pull a bit out. Also my ass is kind of... bulimic? So whenever I\u2019m sitting on the toilet and stuck something up there it causes like a gag reflex of my anus and stuff normally comes out immediately. I don\u2019t know if that is normal but that\u2019s why I would never do anal.\n\n3. Wet wipes. Wiping 30+ times and tearing your ass to shreds and getting everything all bloody is uncomfortable. And you do not want to dry out your sphincter while having a marathon shit. Keeping things kind of wet is the best course of action since the BM itself is most likely very dry. \n\nThank you for listening to my TED talk.",

I didn't take proper care of my IBS-A in my early thirties and at one point I couldn't sit down without pain and (bright red, not dark) blood for so many months that I finally told my doctor and then saw a specialist. This was a big deal because NO ONE in my family growing up talked openly about bathroom habits because it wasn't \"proper.\" Also why I didn't figure out I had IBS for a decade or get formally diagnosed for another... \n\nIt ended up that I had an unhealing anal fissure and I had to have a colonoscopy and botox injected to the sphincter at the same time. Thank God I was knocked out completely for all of it. My surgeon was horrified that I had self diagnosed IBS at 20 but I had been having issues since my tenth birthday and figured if it was cancer I'd already be dead. All this to say the longest I ever went between bowel movements was about three or four days, and I still dealt with the hemorrhoids and fissures.

The only substantial thing I ate eat day was a solid of a flapjack forced down by my friends which reacted terribly with my stomach; other than that it was just soy yoghurt, spinach and tea. \n\nI went three weeks without a shit and my muscles were weak af so i couldn't push anything but I wasn't losing weight as fast as I could which panicked me because that was the goal. Now, anorexics are no strangers to fucking with their bodies, but for some reason I was adverse to taking laxatives because my anorexic brain thought that was unhealthy and I'd become addicted or never take a normal poop again. \n\nI was living in a student dorm over summer working for the uni. On week three I should have been 47kg but was 48.5kg and really bloated and backed up. Anorexic brain decided that at 3am the BEST thing to do was drink about 6 cups of strong black coffee, stolen from other people (because I don't like coffee) and await my fate. Thankfully, nobody else was awake at 3am so I had the loo for as long as I wanted. I pushed as hard as my overdosed, underweight body could and finally felt the tip or what I assumed was a block of solid copper emerging from the wormhole of the abyss. \n\nI couldn't push anymore, I was on the brink of passing out from so much pushing but I HAD to lose weight. And so, we went butt fishing. My eating disorder made me do shameful, shameful things - vomiting, stealing food, ruining friendships, chewing and spitting, getting drunk to be able to binge and purge - but fingering my own asshole at 3am and squelching around the dried out marsh for an hour is probably the worst. But, by god, did it work. Blackened, bloody shit evacuated my body and threw itself into the shitter below. \n\nThe vortex of misery ached for days after. It ached until a few weeks later when the process had to be repeated. This went on for months and months. I did eventually reach my goal of 46kg, but was is worth it? Fuck no.",

        "selftext": "Hi there. (22M)\n\nI'll try to keep it short.\n\nI met a girl through a mutual friend. We've known eachother for roughly a year, but haven't spend time alone yet, always in a group. She's very sweet and pretty.\n\nShe's not completly deaf , she can still hear a bit, with the help of hearing aids.\n\nI guess  mild deafness, not sure tho?.\n\nYesterday we met up with our mutual friends, we were having a barbecue. Later on, we ran out of snacks, so the other two went to the grocery store\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were alone in the yard, chatting etc.\n\nNow I noticed that she kept staring at my lips, so I thought to myself does she want to kiss me?.\n\nSince she didn't stop staring I thought, that it's obvious. This time I'm not going to miss a hint.\n\nI leaned in to give her a kiss, I mean she did kinda kiss me back, but afterwards it was like dead silence.  Thank God the other two arrived a few minutes later.\n\nThe rest of the evening was super akward between us. Later as she left, I told the other two friends that I had kissed her because she kept staring at my lips.\n\nThey started laughing saying Of course she's staring at your lips , she's lipreading.!\n\nMan, I totally forgot that deaf people also use lipreading to communicate, and since she's never actually done that before I didn't take that into consideration\n\nThis will definitly be one of the moments that'll make me stay up at night and cringe, plus I probably ruined the friendship.\n\nTL;DR by thinking my friend wanted to kiss me, she probably didn't.\n\n\nUPDATE:  Okay, Guys I sent her a message, asking if she wants to come over.\n\nShe said she'll be here in an hour.\n\nI'm nervous lol, I'm trying to convince my roomate to go on a long walk.\n\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nSorry that you guys had to wait that long. \nShe just left 5 minutes ago.\n\nI didn't tell her beforehand, that I wanted to talk to her about the kiss, so it was a bit akward approaching the topic.\n I can't go into full detail now, but I told her that I didn't mean to make her feel uncomftable and that I had misread the signs. \nWe had a good laugh. \nAfterwards I asked her If she'd be down to maybe try things out if she's interested.\n\nThe thing is, she's going to move to Munich, Germany in a few months (end of march) (I live in France) and she told me that, while she does like me, she didn't plan on making any romantic interest, because she doesn't want to get too attached, due to her moving away anyways. \n\n She admitted to liking me alot and would like to give it a shot despite the circumstances ,  but only under the condition that I am being serious about it, since she doesn't want something that's only casual.\n\nWe're going on a date on Tuesday, and we'll just see if it works out between us.",

            "Bruh, my wife and I... Our first kiss was cringe. We would hang out and watch movies with no intentions of more than that. But it was happening often. So one night I go to leave her apartment and I swear to all that is unholy I thought I saw the signs (I never read the signs correctly) and I go for a kiss. She kisses me back but the look on her face was not a good one. To this day we both view that kiss different. I say she was horrified, she says it was nice. But now we kiss all the time and no horror (except movies) involved. Been together almost 10yrs now. \n\nGood luck OP.",
            "I like the fact that you care about what you did and care about her. If you really like her dude just talk to her about that moment. I know it\u2019s hard and embarrassing but hey, I\u2019ve had women try to kiss me and I\u2019d pull away if I didn\u2019t want to. I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve done the same. Talk to her and let us know man. I think she\u2019s into you. Have some confidence dude and good luck!",
            "A HUGE tip - she will probably be wearing aids. KEEP YOU HANDS AWAY FROM HER EARS!. You can cause feedback, and believe me a squeeeeel in the ears is a definite mood killer. Anther tip - if you have sex, let her get on top. Same thing applies - you don't want the bedding to cause feedback",
            "\u201cAnd that, kids, is how I met your mother.\u201d",
            "Oh bless your heart. I\u2019m only mildly hard of hearing (do not qualify for hearing aids) and I still have to lipread if there is ANY competing noise. I have a feeling she\u2019s lipread around you for a while and you just haven\u2019t noticed.\n\nI recommend apologizing to her directly as soon as you can and as clearly as you can. Write her an apology on a card or something so that she has a recap. You don\u2019t have to read off the card like it\u2019s a speech, but it should help avoid confusion. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t swerve around the fact that you find her attractive and that motivated the decision. You don\u2019t have to make some kind of massive confession of undying love, but it will help your case to be honest with her about everything. \n\nAlso, in the future, it probably wouldn\u2019t be rude to ask if there\u2019s anything you could do to communicate more clearly. You shouldn\u2019t ask \u201cHow Deaf are you?\u201d So much as, \u201cHey, do I do anything that makes me hard to hear or understand?\u201d Especially do this if you two become physically or romantically involved. There is nothing more frustrating than being unable to hear your significant other and asking them to repeat themselves constantly.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, a tip from me to you: if you\u2019re walking together someplace while trying to have a conversation, make sure you are matching her walking pace and LOOKING AT HER every time you speak. Otherwise you are projecting your voice off somewhere in the distance AND she can\u2019t read your lips. \n\nMy boyfriend still gets mad at me because I have to make him repeat himself constantly when we shop.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nGood god folks. He doesn't abuse me. He gets a little irritated that we have to stop in the middle of shopping so that we can communicate properly. *I* get irritated at it, often to the point of gently, physically moving him so that I can see his face properly. We're both frustrated in these situations at the CIRCUMSTANCES not at EACH OTHER. Target is a hellscape for my auditory processing, and it's where this shit always happens. Also, the man has Tourette's and isn't always in control of where he is looking... so jot that down.\n\nNot everyone can constantly be mindful of someone else's needs while in the middle of performing a task. Sometimes he actually needs to look away while he is speaking. This is normal. It's just important to *try* to be mindful. \n\nHe supports me in my disability. He picks up my meds when I'm too ill to do it, buys me food when I can't afford to feed myself, helps me study and stay productive while I'm in school, helps me stay on track of my to-do list so my life doesn't spiral out of control, and has NEVER complained about the fact that I have permanent control of all volume knobs in the house and car. He's also just... a nice person who cares about other people. \n\nI'm honestly *really mad* that someone took my mini pet peeve rant and turned it into abuse. My goal was to give a tip to the OP so that he can do his best and be considerate. My boyfriend's best is enough for me.",

            "> I guess mild deafness\n\nThe term you're looking for is Hard of Hearing. I studied to become an interpreter for the deaf and staring at lips is very common. Im Not dead and I still do it because it helps with additional comprehension of what they're saying. I've been doing it for a while though because I have hearing issues that may likely turn into deafness or being hard of hearing later in life, so might as well get it down now. I actually really love American sign language and sign language in general. It's a more logical language system in my mind.\n\nEvery spoke language is just a set of arbitrary noises that we've come to associate those specific sounds with specific meanings. Whereas a lot of sign language is representation. For instance, you sign \"cup\" and you literally make a cup shape with your hand (one hand open, flat, with palm up, other hand in a \"C-shape\" on the palm of the hand and raised to show a cup shape). To say \"drink\" you seriously make the \"cup\" sign and raise it to your lips like you're drinking. And a lot of signs are like that. So you're just using. Your hands to represent objects and then move them like they would in the story you're telling. So even someone who doesn't know sign would be able to pick up on maybe 40% without any previous exposure to sign language, just by using a little critical thinking.\n\nI just love sign language. And fun fact: American Sign Language was based on French sign language, because France was one of the first places to have an official sign language. You can see the remnants of the french influence in ASL to this day. For instance, in ASL, to sign \"hi/hello\", you do a simple hi gesture or a salute, but it's still typically signed with the initialisation of \"B\" (meaning your hand makes the \"B\" shape while saluting) because it's the initial for \"bonjour\". There are other parts the bled in and are still there, but that's the easiest example.\n\nI very much suggest and support everyone learning sign language. It's a beautiful language and any and all of the deaf community would be ecstatic with you learning it. Often if someone doesn't speak someone else's language well, the native speaker can sometimes (not uncommon) get irritated that you don't speak it perfectly, and usually they themselves don't speak if correctly anyway. But pretty much and deaf person would be beyond happy to find out you were studying their language. Even if you only know a little, they take it as you taking the time out of your day in order to be able to communicate with them, and they take it as a huge compliment. Which, really, it what we all should do. Anyone taking the time from their day to learn your language should be respected for the effort they're putting in.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Be nice to deaf people.",

Love him to death, he's an amazingly playful dog (Jack Russell).\n\nA few years ago, he started developing really itchy red skin on his toes, and the poor pup would constantly lick his toes to the point where he was making them almost hairless. Took him to the vet, they said it was allergies, and prescribed him medication ($60 a month!). We've been buying this medication for him ever since, occasionally skipping a few weeks and using a mini-dose of Benadryl until we purchased more allergy pills. The pills helped, as in he wasn't constantly licking his toes all the time, but he would still lick them so it wasn't a surefire solution. Let's say 80% cure.\n\nNow, on to the fuckup. We tried giving him the pills with nothing, and he just puts them in his mouth and spits them out. So, we started putting them in a little bit of peanut butter, which he licks off a spoon (and the pill gets swallowed along with the PB).\n\nA few weeks ago we ran out of peanut butter, so we used jello instead. It worked just as well because he swallowed it right up. Over the next few days we did the same thing, and he wasn't licking his toes AT ALL. Lightbulb...we took our dog to the vet to get an allergy test (which we should have done FROM THE START).\n\n**Test Result:** Dog is allergic to peanut butter. We've been giving him his allergy pills dipped in the substance he's allergic to.\n\nHe's a happy dog now with no more itchy toes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**Spent around $2k on allergy pills over 3 years to battle dog's allergiesDipped his pills in peanut butter to get him to swallow themHe's allergic to peanut butter\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Pills are Apoquel 5.4mg\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Vet here. Since I\u2019m seeing a lot of this in the comments, I thought I should mention this: Blood testing (e.g. Heska) is NOT at all accurate for diagnosing food allergies.

Most dogs are allergic to some sort of meat, although soy and other allergies do occur (NOT grains though please for the love of god stop feeding grain free diets).\n\nBonus: veterinary dermatologists sometimes recommend using mini marshmallows to give pills to dogs with allergies!\n\nGlad your dog is less itchy now :)",

PB, cheese, meat, some fruit, and all the pill pop brands/flavors. \n\nNow she is excited every time I grab the fig newtons and I can customize the size easily (can be slightly messy like some of the pill hiding treats tho). 14 years, and I don't know why I had never heard or read about it before. Just a suggestion for OP or anyone else has my Doxie's level of fondess for human food but spits out pills in everything else!",

            "Life pro tip, most pharmacies in the US can fill your pet prescriptions, including Sam's Club and Costco pharmacies, and the cost is usually MUCH lower than getting them at your vet.  Years ago, I had a dog that was allergic to the grass in our yard.  Similar to OP's dog, her feet, her belly and armpit (places that came in contact with the grass) would get red and irritated.  The vet prescribed some daily allergy meds that they sold us for $30 for a 30 day supply.  We paid it for a few years until one day when my BIL was visiting.  He's a pharmacist, saw the meds and said they carry them at his pharmacy and they cost about $5 for a 500 count bottle. The next time she ran out, he was able to fill her prescription for a fraction of the cost.",

It was only after a week of constant irritation, redness and swelling that they figured I was allergic.  My problems were solved once the drops were dropped.",
            "To be fair your dog is probably allergic to more foods than just peanut butter. I have a dog who has allergies. They also react to the the pesticides they spray on grass or the grass itself. There are pill pockets that do not have peanuts in them. I would continue the medicine regardless so your dog is more comfortable. Allergies are rarely is towards just one thing. Watch out most food is exposed to peanuts due to being produced in the same facilities so even if you aren\u2019t giving your dog peanuts anymore one of the ingredients of his other food might be cross contaminated with peanuts. His reactions to those won\u2019t be as noticeable but your dog will experience the discomfort, which is why I recommend continuing his meds. \n\nI deal with allergies myself, my children and my dog a lot. Really don\u2019t feel bad. Sometimes it is right in front of you and you can\u2019t see it. My daughter is allergic to beef. We didn\u2019t know that. She would get \u201csore throat\u201d and \u201cear infections\u201d all the time.  Even though I\u2019m an allergy mom I didn\u2019t put two and two together. For two years we dealt with her reactions. It was crazy. I felt so guilty but to be honest allergy is a weird thing. One day out of nowhere your body decides it does not like a certain food item and you somehow supposed to know that. The opposite is true too. One day out of nowhere you stop being allergic. \n\nGood luck.",

I noticed the guy was talking the girl\u2019s ear off and she didn\u2019t seem very interested in the conversation. Next thing I notice, she\u2019s approaching me saying \u201cBrian?\u201d \n\nMy name isn\u2019t Brian, but before I could correct her I remembered reading something online that said \u201cif a girl ever pretends to know you, play along, she might be in trouble\u201d. So I played along and started having a friendly chat with her as if I knew her. Well, not long into the conversation she looks at me and goes \u201cwait, you\u2019re not Brian\u201d. To which I respond, \u201cI know, I thought we were doing a thing\u201d. Then a bit louder and annoyed she says \u201cwhy would you pretend to be someone I know?!\u201d Now the guy she was with before comes over and asks if everything is alright.\n\nKnowing I had fucked up, I just told them honestly what I was doing. Turns out he was her boyfriend and he was talking about fantasy baseball, that\u2019s why she was so disinterested. She found it funny and thanked me even though I read the situation wrong. He was kinda offended but understood. I have never been more embarrassed.\n\nTLDR Some girl mistook me for her friend, so I pretended to be him because I thought she was trying to use me to get out of a conversation with a creepy guy who turned out to be her boyfriend and she just actually thought I was a different person.\n\nEDIT: hey, thanks for the awards!

There was a guy that came in and started talking to me, calling me by a name that wasnt mine and referencing things that happened in this class he was in and asking how I was doing in it. I wasnt in the class and never took it but I knew the teacher that taught the class and what it was generally about. He thought he knew me as I looked very similar to this person (Oddly enough I had several people tell me I looked just like this guy). I thought he was venting/making small talk, i wasnt listening too intently to key details as I was preparing his food and just nodding. Until he asked me what I was liking about the class and that was the point I messed up. Instead of telling him he had the wrong guy because I felt a level of second hand embarrassment at this point, I came up with some random stuff that I liked about the class and what I hoped I would learn. The biggest mistake of my life because he came in multiple times a week while I was working and I had to live a double life as this other person for 10 minutes at a time.

        "selftext": "Ever since he was a kitten, my cat and I had come to an understanding.  Let me explain. My cat generally doesn't like being picked up. However, one time, six years ago, a moth flew into my house. My cat wanted to kill it, but he couldn't reach it. I don't know how I got the idea, but I picked him up to help him reach it. At first, he squirmed, then when he realized he could reach the moth, he forgot about me and proceeded to murder the moth.  Afterwards, I'd put him down, give him a treat and a couple pets. And from then on, we had pact. When a moth, spider, or some other bug was out of reach, I'd pick him up and my cat would kill it. Truly a win-win situation.\n\nFast forward six years to today. A moth flew into my bedroom. Just as I get up to kill it, I see my cat staring intensely at it. He's got this determined, adorable, murderous look on his face. As I'm looking at him, he turns to me and I can almost see the pleading in his eyes, \"Please, I got this.\" \n\n\"Okay,\" I respond. I pick him up and he starts waving his paws in what are several failed attempts at catching the moth (wtf boy? Maybe a little rusty at this). Then, in what can only be described a 400 IQ move, the moth flies directly at my cat. My cat panics and flails everywhere. I scream and drop him from about 7 ft up (he's fine). Pain.  There is only pain.  I look at my [arm](https://i.imgur.com/3fDLYDo.jpg).  In the moment, I have no idea how bad it is, so I just rush to the bathroom to disinfect my arm. Fortunately, it's not that bad. It just stings whenever I move left arm or hand.\n\nI walk back to my room and see the fucker just [laying there](https://i.imgur.com/jM1Ht43.jpg). \"You see [this](https://i.imgur.com/44Eyq8v.jpg) shit?\" I asked him. He sniffed it a bit and just kind of looked unconcerned. \"Meh, just a minor flesh wound. Didn't even rupture an artery. My claws must be dull. I mean, that looks bad.\" \n\nI go back into my room and see the moth there. I go to kill it and my cat makes this weird trilling sound. He's staring intensely at the moth eyes filled with murder lust. He looks at me for permission.  This time, I killed the moth. \n\ntl;dr: cat broke our murder pact. probably should never have formed one with a cat anyway.",

            "Yeah, I've learned to stay far away from cats when they go in hunt-mode. \n\nOnce my cat was looking through our sliding glass door out into the backyard. He was probably after one of the beetles that like to slam themselves into the door until they die. Anyway, I approach him to see what's up, because the sounds of both beetles committing suicide and a cat going nuts and slamming himself against the door is too much to deal with at 11 PM. \n\nI get within three feet of the cat and say \"Hey, Bart. What's going on honey?\" And he whirls around. Tunnel vision is now on my ankles. I know something's up, but I'm still under the impression I can talk him down.\n\nAsshole runs up to me, and goes full kill-mode on my fucking ankles. He hooks my right, and I jerk back, knocking him loose. He goes for my left, and wraps himself around it. His claws are now fully inserted into my left ankle. His back paws, thankfully, get caught in my baggy sweatpants rather than my poor leg. I see him dart his head in for a \"killing\" bite, and that's when I knock myself out of it and start shaking him around like a ragdoll. He lets go of me pretty quickly, and then runs off. \n\nI go into the bathroom, tend to my wounds, and take in what the hell just happened. I come out about 15 minutes later. Cat's in the middle of the living room, laying down on his side. I approach him and sit down next to him. At this point he apologizes in the form of a few head-butts, but I'm sure he just wanted to avoid me trying to get back at him.\n\nI still have some faint scars from the whole ordeal. I no longer interfere with the cat's hunting fustrations.",

            "Did the same thing with my cat, one time he managed to get one claw through one of my eyelids and another one in my lip. Good times,and even now he still struts around like he owns the place. Still love him. ^^",
            "Cats, man. A long time ago, when my cat was still a cute but dumb kitten, I went to the toilet after a night of drinking. My GF was already asleep, so I saw a chance to take a dump with the bathroom open, because drunk. Cat came around, sniffing places which she then learned should not be sniffed, and walked out into the hallway, where she decided the hinges of the toilet door make for some seriously fun playthings.\n\nSeeing her tiny paws sneak through between door and doorpost was hella cute at first, but then this idiot got her paw stuck. She started with a slightly annoyed meow and trying to pull her paw back, but to no avail. She them advanced to louder grunts of not having fun _at all_, followed by a wild swishing of murder claws in a vain effort to kill the door.\n\nAt this point, drunk me came to the conclusion Cat was no longer enjoying herself, and quite possibly needed to be rescued from this ungodly monster that was holding her prisoner. I squeeled through the door, trying to not open it any further since it would probably be rather unpleasant for the cat if I were to open the door fully with her paw still stuck between the hinges. I got behind her, as a valiant knight aiding a damsel in distress, and grabbed her paw and her side to free her. In her mind, I was now an accomplice of the door, and must therefore be destroyed in order to ever break free.\n\nI got one glimpse of the most pissed off look I ever saw before she starting fucking my shit up. All her free paws were just flying around, claws out, grabbing whatever was within range. She took a short break from hissing to bite me right on the skin between your fingers. Her whole body was just like the girl from The Exorcist trying to free herself. Somehow I got her paw unstuck and with my other hand grabbed her by the neck and just flung her across the hallway. Her Majesty landed with the grace of a decomposing whale and ran of before anything would happen again.\n\nWith the situation now handled, I turned on the lights and saw blood everywhere. On the door, the walls, the floor, the washing machine, some of it even made it to the ceiling. Being the worried catparent I was at the time, I tried to find Cat to check if she was alright. A small trace of blood led me to her hiding spot, where she was just licking herself clean, but there was no pool of blood around her, so she seemed fine. Which meant, it was my blood. Looked down, some nasty wound on my feet and leg, and a few bigger ones on my arms.\n\nI got myself cleaned and then went on to clean up what can only be described as a murder scene. I flushed the toilet and went upstairs to go to bed, where my gf was sort-of awake and asked me what happened. I told her the tale of Catzilla, how she was panicked and what I had to do to get her free.\n\nHer: 'Is she OK?'\n\nMe: 'Yeah, she's just a bit shaken.'\n\nHer: 'Oh, good.'\n\nMe: 'She cut me up pretty bad, though'\n\nHer: _zzzzzzzz_\n\nCat still plays with doors.",

Your agreement included you picking him up and him killing it. You didn't specify anything about it being first try or about not clawing you to bits in the process. YOU killed the moth this time though and thus YOU broke the pact.\n\nAlso as much as I know it sucks getting clawed by a flailing cat, as a long time cat owner, THAT scratch is the worst you got in all this time? It feels like every week (probably more like monthly maybe) I get some big scratch from one of my cats because something made a loud noise and startled them while I was holding one...or one is sitting on my lap...or just happens to be nearby and uses me as a springboard.\n\nIf your cat is a strictly indoor cat you could also consider clipping his claws. NOT declawing, just using nail clippers (they make ones for cats or pets in general) to clip the shard ends off. Make sure you look up a video online or have someone show you how to do this though as you need to be careful not to cut off too much. You end up having to do this about every 2 weeks or sooner to maintain them in a non-deadly condition but if your cat tolerates letting you do it the results are actually great. Granted between my two cats the nice calm one will go batshit crazy if you try to cut her nails and the crazy one will sit totally calm and let me cut his...so results may vary.",

I've been invited to the second round of interviews! \n\nObligatory; this happened yesterday. The memory still makes me cringe. And cry. I had a job interview with a CEO, in person, despite COVID. I was super nervous, as per usual. Maybe even more than usual, because I really wanted this job. I tried to calm myself down but by the time the interviewer showed up I could literally feel my heartbeat in my throat. He (50ish/M) walked down the stairs towards me, in his nice suit, but stopped halfway down. I figured the interview would take place upstairs, so I got up to meet him. And as I was walking up the stairs towards him, he put his arm up.. and his elbow out. And my brain just sort of went \u2018ERRORRR!\u2019.\n\nI suppose it could have only meant two things. It could have meant (A) \u2018Please take my arm, milady, so I can escort you to the room as if we\u2019re strolling down the promenade together\u2019, or (B) \u2018Please give me an *elbow bump*, since we can\u2019t shake hands\u2019, which is *really* not an uncommon gesture at all in the Netherlands.\nSo what did I do? Yes, I went with option A and I eagerly locked arms with this strange man that I\u2019d never met before in my life, as if saying \u2018yes, good sir, let\u2019s go for that stroll\u2019.\n\nAnd then we just stood there! Arm in arm, halfway up the stairs, sheepishly staring at each other. I wanted the earth to swallow me whole. I just didn\u2019t know what to do next and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d fully understood what\u2019d happened, so neither of us moved.\n\nWhen he\u2019d finally gathered his senses, he said \u2018I eh.. meant to give you an elbow-bump?\u2019, after which I quickly put as much distance between us as I could and mumbled \u2018Right! Right, yes, that makes much more sense\u2019. Because it did, let's face it.\n\nAnd then we had the interview.\n\nTL;DR I got so nervous that I misjudged the CEO's arm gesture during a job interview, and locked arms with him as if we were Best Friends 4Ever.\n\nWhy am I like this?\n\nEDIT (1): Typo's\nEDIT (2): I don't know if I got the job - I'm not hopeful, but I'll keep you guys updated.",

I had requested for a new drink but he brought it really quickly, before I had fully finished my other one. \n\nAs he moved to place the drink on the table from the other side (I was sitting on the bench so he couldn't come round to my side), I looked up and all I saw was a glass moving towards me. \n\nSo instinctively said cheers and clinked glasses with him! This time he was the awkward one though, I burst out laughing while he just continued standing there with the new glass until I took it out of his hand.",
            "Don\u2019t feel too bad, I think we\u2019ve all done stuff like that. \n\nI went to a restaurant by myself one night while traveling for work (before COVID) and the waitress reached her hand out across the table after I\u2019d ordered. She meant it as a subtle \u201cCan you please hand me the menu?\u201d, but because I was tired and had been traveling all day on business, I misread it as \u201cSo it\u2019s settled! A cheeseburger with fries! Time for a formal handshake!\u201d, so I reached out and shook her hand. \n\nI felt really fuckin\u2019 weird about it and apologized when she came back and said I had a weird brain fart. She was cool about it. Just a weird feeling.",

            "Something very similar happened to me at the OBGYN. After the exam was over and I was still laying down with feet in stirrups, the doctor put his forearm/elbow out towards me. I thought he was going for an elbow bump, I guess as a \"good job, exam's over!\" gesture. \n\nNoooope, he was just trying to give me a hand (arm) up from the awkward laying down with feet up position. Mentally face-palmed so hard after that.",

            "This reminded me of a similar situation I had during an exam. So for our English class, we had to do an oral presentation where we'd get a text, some time to annotate it, and then we could go in and give our analysis to the teacher. The test was extremely important to our final grade, and externally moderated, so teachers were required to collect our annotations at the end. On the day of my presentation, I was really really nervous, but I managed to keep my cool as I went in, greeted my teacher, and gave a flawless presentation (full marks!!). At the end, my teacher held her hand out for the annotated texts and I think by then I was buzzed on the relief of the test being over. U just looked this strict Irish woman dead in the eye and SHOOK HER HAND. It was so awkward. She didn't seem to process what I was doing and then when she did she was barely holding back her laughs. She was super strict in class and here she was freakin VIBRATING with the effort to hold her laughter in and not sure wether she should let go of my hand. Eventually she managed to say \"I meant your notes\" and my soul left my body, but the mortification didn't.",

Thanks to the rona\ud83d\ude44\n\nI was waiting for the interview to begin while the CEO was out and about so he was introduced to me. He held out his elbow and I locked arms!!! What else was that supposed to mean anyway? I get that we can\u2019t shake hands but still! I didn\u2019t know that this was the new norm. \nAnyway, I finished the interview and never got a call back. \n\nStill makes me cringe and die on the inside!",
            "My experience with this haunts me every day, even though it was years ago.\n\nI\u2019d just secured a job and was meeting my new boss for a tour. She was very friendly, and as I walked into the room she held her arm out, which I now see as clearly a gesture for a handshake.\n\nMy brain malfunctioned beyond belief, and I leaned in and kissed her on the fucking cheek. I realised halfway through that I\u2019d made a fatal error, but it was too late to back out of it, so I just let out a strangled \u2018hello\u2019 that literally sounded like a parrot mimicking human speech.\n\nHAUNTED.",

I appreciate Covid has been around for-bloody-ever but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve yet graduated from the stage of needing to accompany an invitation to elbow-bump with some awkward and overused statement like \u201cI guess this is how we shake hands now\u201d.\n\nFingers crossed you get the job, OP. Keep us posted!",
            "Your misinterpreting his gesture  is completely understandable.  Consider the following two questions.\n\n1.  How many years has it been common in western culture for an older gentleman to offer his arm to a younger lady when she has arrived in an unfamiliar place?  Centuries, at least.  (Also, consider that this tradition is present in almost every period drama made over the last 100 years of cinema history, which further reinforces that custom in our minds for formal meetings, even if it is not common in everyday life.)\n2.  How many years has it been customary for us to elbow bump, outside a small minority in the medical community?  One year?  Maybe ten, in some circles?\n\nIn my view, a true gentleman would have just gone with it to put you at ease -- unless of course his HR hire is a little overzealous and might have chewed him out later.\n\nWhen we're nervous, we fall back on what we know.    Just yesterday, a woman offered to shake my hand.  I felt like the idiot when I changed it to a fist bump, even in our \"Covid\" culture that's changing our interactions.",
            "Hahaha, don\u2019t worry! Someone I used to know had an interview, and when the interviewer held out his hand for a handshake, she just held his hand... and he gave her a tour of the building... holding hands...",

Once again he does the arm gesture, but more aggressively as if to say \u201cget the fuck over here.\u201d \n\nI let go of the door and start walking towards him, AND THEN I notice him make eye contact with me, likely for the first time, and as aggressively as the second beckoning, I get a \u201cshoo-away\u201d gesture.\n\nI quickly turned around to head in to the office, and as I turned, notice he was beckoning the vice-president of the company, my direct boss. Who was clearly watching this unfold.\n\nIt was never addressed and I still cringe thinking about this..",
            "This reminds me of the time I was going to do one of those tandem bungee jump things at an amusement park with my then girlfriend. To get in to the harness, we had to lock arms, and then the guy getting us strapped in instructed us \"Now grab your own wrist\", obviously meaning to use your right hand to grab your left wrist, but with all the adrenaline flowing I had gotten Poo Brain and tried to like, fold my right hand back on itself to grab my right wrist. The guy just started at me for a second, incredulous, then shouted over to his coworker \"Hey! I just told this guy to grab his own wrist and he did this!\" Then made a weird T-Rex gesture in the air with one hand.",

The commander took it for me going in for a hug and grabbed me and hugged me to her.    I had to then figure out how to awkwardly get myself out of the hug and then get the kleenex.",

Now, my brother and I are of age and old enough to understand the santa process. However, we have a younger sister who still fully believes. She did the list, put out the cookies, yadayada.\n\nThe main thing she wanted this Christmas (and last year) was a Nintendo switch. I don\u2019t know much about it other than it\u2019s expensive and could make a child\u2019s Christmas wish come true. \n\nSo it comes midnight and My mother and I are wrapping up the presents for everyone and checking off the list to make sure nothing was forgotten.

Everyone in my family, no.fucking.clue.\n\nWe all begin scrounging the house, top to fucking bottom. Every corner, every drawer, every hiding spot. Even the fucking vents????? \n\nTime passes, we\u2019re still looking, it\u2019s 2 in the morning. We should\u2019ve been asleep an hour ago.  My mother has to wake up in 4 hours to get ready for a full day of work and be with us for presents. She\u2019s crying, my dads pissed, I\u2019m nervous. \n\nI send my parents up to bed and tell them to leave it up to me. (Still don\u2019t know why the fuck I said this). So I stay up, still looking. It\u2019s now 4am. I\u2019m ready to pass out. \n\nI decide to write the letter from santa myself. Stating the following. \u201cDear ______, ...... I hit a major storm in the middle of the night and lost Dasher and 60% of my presents!! Expect a delivery from the elves within the next few days!\u201d \n\nSo I\u2019m looking up what stores I can buy this fucking Nintendo switch again, of course they\u2019re all closed at 4am but they\u2019re closed all day for Christmas too. Now I\u2019m fucking buggin\n\nI decide to let the note do it\u2019s magic, and pray I can find a Nintendo switch to buy AGAIN. \n\nChristmas morning comes along, she reads the note, she\u2019s freaking out that santa even made it in such a bad storm. But she\u2019s also freaking out that Dasher is on the loose. I try to calm her down and she keeps screaming that santa can\u2019t fly without all his reindeer and is probably \u201cmissing\u201d. (If you\u2019ve ever seen Christmas chronicles, she hit it spot on) \n\nFinally we open the fucking rest of the presents. \nWE LEFT THE FUCKING SWITCH GAME WRAPPED AND SHE OPENED IT. Gave it the fuck away instantly. Now I\u2019m frustrated as fuck that we were so unprepared. This is supposed to be \u201chuge\u201d.\n\nWe finish up presents, my mom goes to work, my sister is playing with her stuff and I\u2019m checking out my new bling. \n\nI then remember that my polish for jewelry was in the trunk of the car. (I don\u2019t know why, don\u2019t ask) \n\nI open up the fucking trunk, and there it is. THE NINTENDO FUCKING SWITCH. SITTING RIGHT THERE. STARING AT ME. I start crying tears of joy. I don\u2019t have to spend another 300 on a fucking console and games. \n\nI wrap it instantly and leave it on the front bench. \nI go upstairs, play a hoofing sounds of a horse from my speaker, and make a loud bang. \n\n\u201cWHAT WAS THAT\u201d -my sister \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it sounded like it came from outside. Want me to check?\u201d -me \n\n\u201cSIS. ITS DASHER. IT HAS TO BE. HE HAS IT.\u201d \n\nShe runs as fast as I\u2019ve ever seen her run down the stairs and whips the door open. Before even seeing the present on the bench, she goes to look at the roof to see if dasher is there. Lol. Finally, she falls upon the gift wrapped up on the bench.  \n\nShe grabs it, runs inside, opens it, cries.\n\n\u201cSanta really does listen.\u201d -my sister \n\nAnd then I cried. Again. Because I was so relieved it was over. \n\nAll in all, She was happy, I was happy, my parents pissed they left it somewhere so stupid, and Christmas was even more fun for my sister.\n\nI am never fucking touching a Nintendo switch ever again. \n\nEdit: I understand people are commenting that they believe this is a made up story. I wish it was. I did not plan nor enjoy going through the stress at first but at the end it was all worth it. I\u2019m the oldest sister of this family and believe it\u2019s important to keep her belief going. It brings our family joy to see her so excited for Santa. \n\nThis is literally my first time posting on Reddit, and I had no clue it would blow up like this. I read them with my boyfriend all the time (specifically this community) and decided this story was worth a share. Thanks to everyone who has sent Christmas wishes. God bless you all and Merry Christmas. \n\nTL:DR we lost my sisters most wanted Xmas present, lost our fucking minds looking for it, and it ended up being in the fucking car trunk.",

So now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I'm in Canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but I'm planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)\n\nSecond update from my dad: Mom's surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.\n\nFP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I'm headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.\n\nUPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.\n\nCheck out my adorable mom\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/0bmG2Ii](http://imgur.com/gallery/0bmG2Ii)",

            "Doesn\u2019t matter if she had a bad time or if she\u2019s against it. You and that sweet kite flying experience saved her life and I wish she has a fast recovery. Maybe next Christmas you can laugh about it together. Be sure to bring her some normal chocolates that she likes as a gift and a get well soon wish! That is - if she can have them now due to her health issues. ",
            "Holy shit! I did the same with my dad about 8 years ago but with an 8th of shrooms...\n\nMy room was above the garage door and it was a winter day which had just laid about 6 inches of fresh snow. I had a holiday tin of round molded chocolate cookie looking things done up all nicely in holiday wrapping. Well, I didn't want them to get melted while I went to work so I figured I'd toss them between the screen and my window to keep cool....\n\n4 hours later I am at work and get a call from my mom telling me that an ambulance just picked my dad up from the house and was taking him to the hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack (he had already had 2 at that point and knew the symptoms). At this point I'm thinking my dad is nearing the end and I'm freaking out. I rush to the hospital.\n\nWhen I get there I arrive to my dad laying on a hospital bed with his vitals being taken (everything looked perfect) and hes just laying there dying laughing at every little thing and telling everyone how great he feels and asking what they gave him. At this point they're getting concerned because they haven't given him anything. Now I'm starting to put things together... I volunteer to go home and grab some stuff for my dads expected hospital stay.\n\n\nPull into the driveway and look above the garage into my window... nothing. Fuck.. look down below my window.. obviously landing spot in the snow bank... fuck... walk into garage and find tin on work bench and open it.. one missing and wrapper in the trash... my dad is tripping balls! \n\nSo, I rushed back to the hospital and am terrified because my dad, while not super conservative, has never experienced any psycadelic drugs and I'm terrified he'll kill me when he finds out. Now, my whole extended family is now at the hospital awaiting testing results and this included my aunt who happens to be a nurse. So I drum up some quick thinking and decide to go with the lesser of two evils and tell her he found a weed chocolate of mine. Thankfully it worked because she told the doctor privately and then from there they told my dad he was fine and I'm honestly not sure if they ever even told him about the \"pot\". \n\nTo this day, my dad has no idea he tripped balls on an eighth of shrooms in the hospital thinking he had a heart attack. Turns out he had a revelation of sorts after the experience and he changed his diet to completely vegan and reversed his heart disease and has been extremely healthy since. Not to mention a great reduction in anger..\n\nTDLR: I left a tin of mushroom chocolate bars in my window to stay cool. They fell through the screen into the snow my dad was shoveling and he decided to have a treat which caused him to trip so hard he thought he was having a heart attack and called an ambulance. \n\nEdit: and since people seem to have a hard time fathoming this chocolate bar, here ya go!\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/HIMP9Nn\n\nMy first gold ever! Just got way too excited about this and my fiance is making fun of me.. maybe I'll move this over to a TIFU later today..",

            "My sister had gifted me 10 edible sour patch deady bears one year for my birthday. I had never actually had commercially made edibles, and used to actually make my own edibles. I ate one and didn't taste any weed whatsoever, and with how small they were I figured I'd just eat them all and have a good time. Luckily I have a tolerance and I'm pretty experienced with mind altering substances in general. I began hallucinating and I literally drooled on myself while staring at a wall. I had plans to go out that night with friends and I was too high to find my phone or even get off my couch. My sister came home(we lived together at the time) and said something along the lines of, holy shit did you eat all of those, and the only word I could get myself to utter was, yup. Apparently they we're 10mg a piece and I ate 100mg, and I had smoked weed on top of that. I do not recommend getting that high, but honestly if I ever we're to get that high again I'd probably prefer it to be edibles since it's much more mellow.\n\nAnyway, I hope your mom bounces back from this quickly.",

It really freaked him out and he's 50+ and been smoking pot since high school. 1 5 hour shot and he was better - not as high.",

My wife realized what happened and called the kids for advice \"let him sleep it off\" was their advice, but her comment was \"he keeps giggling like a little kid and wants Taco Bell!\"  \"He'll be fine Mom, go to bed!\"\n\nWay to go saving your Mom's life!  Everyone please look into \"Heart Saver CT Scans\" for anyone over 50.\n\ntl;dr: Ate 16 doses of TCH chocolate not realizing it was meant to be used over a week, not one night.",

Well before I had marked the container she had gotten into it. She goes to take a nap. When she got up she told my dad that she wasn\u2019t feeling right. She was so concerned that she thought she should go to the hospital. So they\u2019re getting into the car and almost leaving when I see that I\u2019m missing at least 1 cookie and a half of another. I run outside and tell them not to worry mom is just high af. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. She was so upset with me. Some time later she tells me that she hadn\u2019t slept that good in a long time and that she might want to try another cookie again. LOL.",

Many people walk around with blockages like these and if they\u2019re not super active may not ever have symptoms.  If you\u2019re not having symptoms, you might not need surgery/ treatment.  In general these treatments are done to treat symptoms, not prevent future heart attacks, because it\u2019s not clear that they can. The treatments themselves are risky. What happened here (from the limited information provided) seems to be that op\u2019s mom got a dose of thc big enough to stress her heart (increased heart rate and blood pressure) more than she\u2019s used to which led to cardiac ischemia. Basically the pot almost gave her a heart attack and because of that she\u2019s getting a dangerous, expensive treatment she might not otherwise have needed.

We were there so he wouldn't have to be alone.  Natives were restless so there was some tensions.  By the final night, I was over it.  But, my SO had gotten up at 2 am to be at work.  By the time he made it to the hotel, he'd worked 13 hours.  We spent the day at an arcade type place (bowling, pizza, rides, games, etc...)  I have chronic pain. Plus, screaming kids everywhere.  I was wiped.  I didn't feel like I was allowed to be tired because I was at an arcade all day and he worked.  We ended up talking it out because I was irrational.  I said it wasn't fair that I'm not allowed to be tired.  His response was that he never told me that.  It was a self-imposed regulation. \nThe point is that maybe once she's not upset that you had the audacity to say you were tired (/s) you can talk about what's really bothering her.  Maybe she thinks that she's not appreciated enough.  Not just from you but the kids, too.  Maybe she's jealous that you get to interact with adults all day.

            "I\u2019m surprised this post got under my skin but I have to admit to you it did.  \n\nI took a break from my career and was a stay at home dad for several years until my kids were old enough to go to school.  Then I went out of my way to find a job with hours that allowed me to be home every day so I could pick them up from school.  It\u2019s a full time job 40-55 hours a week, I get up early.  \n\nMy wife and I discussed the plan about which of us would stay home with the kids and take an absence from our work life.  We decided I would do it primarily because I was confident my position would be recovered.  Here\u2019s the dig.  Being a stay at home dad was the best years of my life by far!  Not even college life of freedom and parties compared to my years of raising our kids.  The best part was loving up the kids all day long, watching them grow, holding them while they napped, so many things...   but the life was easy.  In my experience as a stay at home dad I found it to be considerably less difficult on the mind and body than doing my normal work life routine.  So unfortunately I don\u2019t appreciate the generalization and stereotypes that are so quickly thrown about when it comes to stay at home parents.  Some might work hard and have stressful days but that is not universally true.  Let\u2019s not grant a person unquestionably good graces just because they have a title that is currently being praised by an audience of peers.  \n\nIt\u2019s more important that parents be parents because they want to, than doing it for kudos or sympathy rights at the end of the day.  Understandably this thought will be worthy of down votes, that\u2019s okay.  I know I could convey my message better in person but at the very least I wanted to pose a dissenting opinion to the OP\u2019s general theme.",

One part got me in a fit and naturally my girlfriend asked me what made me laugh, so i started explaining the story in short.\n\nAs soon as I told her the kid had to cry because she had just been told Bob was dead, all colour left her face. With tears in her eyes and a pouting lip she asked me if I was serious - I explained to her that Bob Ross had in fact died in 1995, showing her the Wikipedia page to corroborate it.\n\nMy girlfriend is up there on the cries-because-swans-can-be-gay spectrum, so surprising here with this fact was not a smart move. The weeping waned away, but the sad and defeated mood stayed and now I'm on my way to pick up a bottle of wine and a tub of ice cream,so we can enjoy that during a Bob Ross paint-along.\n\nI guess it'll be a watercolour made with tears.

I don\u2019t know what part of my brain thought this was a good idea, but I just said, \u201cok, do you want pizza for dinner?\u201d \n\nIt took a few minutes for me to realize what I said and that I did not react properly. I went back to him and apologized and gave him the whole \u201cI love you just the same\u201d spiel and we laughed about my reaction, but I\u2019m still SO embarrassed and mad at myself. Definitely wasn\u2019t the way I had always planned to respond!\n\nTl;dr was tired after work and said \u201cok\u201d and offered my son pizza after he came out to me",

            "The first person to ever come out to me was my best friend in high school. It was not a surprise.\n\n\nBut his \"confession\" started out so seriously that it scared me. I was thinking we had to bury a body or something; I was in full crisis mode halfway through his speech. At the end, when he said \"Insouciantelle, I'm gay.\" I said \"Yeah, whatever. What's the problem?\"\n\nI felt like a douche. We both laughed about it eventually at least :)\n\n\nWhen he came out to his parents, they sent him to a pray away the gay camp. He came back broken inside and killed himself soon after. That was why, I guess, he was so scared about coming out. I wish I'd been able to kidnap him and wrap him up in love and tell him how perfect he was, whoever he was attracted towards. He was a sweet and wonderful boy, and if he'd had a momma like you he'd probably be around today.",
            "When my brother came out to me I first said \"I swear if you're joking...\" And he insisted he wasn't (he's a snarky little shit, it wouldn't have surprised me at the time of he was)\n\nAnd I just said \"well that's cool.\" When that answer seemed lack luster to him I just answered back with \"Idk. You're still a giant pain in the ass so I'm not sure what's different. Love you the same as I did 10 minutes ago.\"\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) Thanks for all the \"pain in the ass\" jokes. It's very much something my brother would respond with. \n\n2) Just want to add that I was the 1st to be told. The rest of his coming out was more funny but also lacking any dramatic responce from my family. Mostly accidental texts and just assuming everyone knew already. Pretty sure he left gay porn up on my dad's computer. And my dad was more concerned about if the site gave his computer a virus.",
            "I remember my Dad taking me on a fishing trip and being really weird the whole time. Finally he goes, \"I need to ask you something. How would you feel if your brother was gay?\" and my initial response was to laugh because I had never considered my brother anything but gay since we were pretty young, even though he'd never officially come out. Like, I know you weren't around Dad but you are talking about my little brother who played with Jem dolls while I played with GI Joe's? I think my Dad felt a combination of relief and embarrassment at the fact that I had been on board for way longer than he had.",
            "My daughter came out twice.  She asked to stay over and we had drinks and she got so drunk and came out in a glorious manner.  Anyway next morning we had breakfast and she goes \u201cmum i gotta let you know.......\u201d And i had ample chance to give a proper reaction but i just said similar \u201c yeah cool\u201d because we had talked a huge length the night before. I think she was surprised my reaction was so chill",

            "My parents figured out I was into guys when I asked my mom to buy me Tiger Beat when I was around 10.  Probably around the same time I told them I wanted to marry Donny Osmond.  My best friend flamed equally as bright.  Turns out almost 1/2 the guys in my catholic school class ended up being gay or bi.  When I told them I was going to take him to the movies on a date, they gave me money for tickets and food.  The best response is when it\u2019s treated as totally normal.  Your response was excellent.",
            "If memory serves, my reaction to my daughter was \"ok cool, figured\" . She'd built herself up to tell me and just kind of blurted it out, it was sweet.  Honestly I wouldn't care if she identified as a potato and was attracted to mashers just as long as she's living a happy life",
            "You might not have fucked up as much as you think you did. My mum replied \u201ccool\u201d, and nothing more, and I\u2019m so grateful that that\u2019s what happened.",

            "I reacted similarly to a colleague of mine. In the middle of a conversation he was like \"I am, you know, gay\" and I was like 'Yes\" and just waited for him to keep telling the story he was previously telling.\nEveryone around, that he had already come out to before, were looking at me expecting my reaction and it made me a little bit sad thinking that a lot of people still react badly to other people coming out.",
            "My mother grounded me when I came out to her. This was followed by being thrown out of the house and left to fend for myself at 16. Honestly I would have taken your response over mine. Good on you.",

            "Our daughter never \u2018came out\u2019.\n\n\nShe\u2019s 19, on the spectrum.\n\nI can\u2019t remember the details but when she was about 12 or so during some random conversation our kids and a couple of friends were having about who they like at school, she spoke about \u2018Emma\u2019 because she likes girls like me...\u201d\n\nThe chat continued around the group as though nothing out of the ordinary was said. I genuinely think that because, in her own eyes, she was just joining in the conversation and saw and made no significance to the gender of who she liked, it was completely normalised by everyone else.\n\n\nI say, I don\u2019t remember the details and I really don\u2019t. I can remember conversations like the one I just mentioned but not specifically \u2018a\u2019 conversation.\n\n\nI also remember doing a quick mental double take when, at 17 she casually mentioned her boyfriend.\n\n\nI should add that, throughout school, in a rough area in a deprived town in the UK, she never once faced any negativity from peers. She would hold hands with and make out and whatever without any reaction or comment from other pupils and remained a well known and relatively popular kid.\n\n\nEven during typical teenage dramas and fallouts, including some bullying, her sexuality was never mentioned or used against her.\n\n\nI truly believe that to her and to the kids in her school it is simply irrelevant.",
            "Don\u2019t leave us hanging! Did he want pizza??",
            "When my dad came out to me  when I was 16 my response was similar, it went\n\n\"Son I have something to tell you\" (through tears)\n\nI replied\n\n\"If it's that your gay can it wait till half time\"\n\nCue his spluttering and the \"how did you know\" speak.\n\nIt still makes me smile now.",

I didn\u2019t intend to be mean, but some of our friends thought it was. He said it was a great response, since some of the people acting so thrilled about it seemed disingenuous. Me literally not caring or making a big deal about it was a perfectly acceptable reaction I guess.",

            "That's probably one of the best reactions you could've given to calm your son. One of my friends came out as gay to his parents a few months ago. His dad was a shook but tried to still go \"Love you either way you are, you are our son.\" while his mother just cried and begged him to say it was a joke. Luckily they've all accepted it now and there's no problem with him and his parents if anyone were curious.",
            "It's perfect, you treated him like normal. Being gay doesn't change that your his mother, that yoire going to care for him, or that he gets pizza. We gays meed pizza",
            "Love this reaction. I don\u2019t want to think for him but I\u2019m sure it reassured him and make him feel so relieved that you took it so casually. Yes it\u2019s important news but in the same time you showed how much it didn\u2019t matter to you because you love him no matter what.",
            "Reminds me of when I came out and my mum\u2019s response was \u201ccool, can you keep an eye on the pine nuts for me so they don\u2019t burn?\u201d",
            "Both those reactions combined make it great Imo. Your lack of reaction shows you're truly okay with it and it l isn't a big deal. You're second reaction shows that you want your son to feel heard and that you're also really there for him. It seems it ended well, I guess that's the only thing that matters.

            "I think that's great! He was probably worrying that you'd freak out and  then it was just \"No biggie, do you want pizza?\"  I'll bet it was a huge relief.",

            "Probably wasn't the response he expected...\n\n\n\n\nAt least you both laughed about it...",
            "That's just the best, he comes out to his family without a problem and gets pizza too? I would consider that a success!\n\nI actually think it's better to react this way too, like it's just a really minor thing to you because that doesn't change anything about him and you love him for who he is.\n\nDefinitely using this one if my future kids tell me that.",
            "You did react properly (unbeknownst at the time). And than re-reactly awesomely!  \n\nIf you need any support, check out pflag.org.\n\nGive yourself a break.  It's not like he said, \"mom,  I need to tell you something\" to warm you up to a heavy disclosure. \n\nI'm gay.   My family, who I came out to, had very different reactions (all supportive, some plain funny). Initial reaction:\n\n* Brother: Can you pass the salt?\n* Dad: I never thought we both be looking at women. (My parents are divorced)\n* Mom: Just be safe. \n* Sister: I know.\n\nGranted, there were followup conversations of acceptance.   But, that's what stuck with me.",
            "Even though you thought your reaction was not appropriate, as someone who has come out to people before, I would've loved nothing more than a nonchalant \"Okay, do you want pizza for dinner?\" lol\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community, we often put a lot of pressure on the \"coming out\" process, and sometimes rightfully so...Depending on family members or friends, coming out can be a very stressful and difficult process. But at the end of the day, your sexuality is trivial in the grand scheme of things. There shouldn't need to be a \"coming out\" because people should just inherently be respectful of your sexuality or gender identity; however, that clearly isn't the case.\n\nBeing nonchalant about it is actually pretty relieving because it puts things into perspective.",
            "Why do I feel like I've read the sons POV on this before? Did he post this too?",
            "That's like so the opposite of a fuck up. That's like the ultimate outcome.\n\n\"Mom... I... I'm gay.\"\n\n\"Ok... So extra sausage on the pizza?\"\n\nI expected way worse when I came out.",
            "Nonono that was a _great_ response.",
            "My parents reacted just the same \u201cok\u201d. Then few months later I realized they hadn\u2019t figured what it was about (I didn\u2019t say I was gay i said I was with a guy) so I had to come out again. This time they understood but reacted just the same \u201cok\u201d. Then later when I told them I was going to marry my bf they also said \u201cok, great\u201d. Not many words but I never felt it was something that bother them.",
            "Sounds like a fine reaction to me. He wouldn't have wanted a big deal made, because to him it's just normal. He's lucky to have you.",
            "I did something similar once. I was sat outside at a house party with two friends smoking. I don't know what we were talking about but I thought of this great point I had to make and was waiting for a gap. In the conversation to say it (I know now this is probably due to ADD as I've heard others say similar). Apparently I was so concentrated on saying whatever it was I thought of I missed my friend say 'I'm gay' and so responded with 'So anyways'. He came out to me again later that night and when I heard that I did I felt awful. Luckily he saw the funny side.",
            "Mom and I had been watching Letterman, the episode (or one of the episodes) where he joked that he was a lesbian because he liked girls. \n\nMy brother came in and said, very seriously, \"Mom, I have something to tell you.\" \n\nMy mom, smiling and goofily, replied \"Let me guess, you're a lesbian!\"\n\nBrother: \"Uh, no...the other thing.\"\n\nAt which point my mom knew she'd screwed up. I forget how the rest of the conversation went, or maybe he ran off for a bit. I don't know what he thinks about that story, and I will support my brother always. As a sibling I will laugh, though. :P",
            "Actually I think your reply here was damn near perfect. A kid's huge fear about coming out is disappointing the parents, and you showed zero disappointment at all. In fact I would have thought it was sweet.",
            "Guaranteed this is a story you will laugh about together as a family in the future",
            "That is the best reaction tbf. I had the same reaction when I came to my dad, I was sat on the sofa with the laptop and I said \"oh dad btw I like girls\", he said \"ok\" and carried on watching TV. Whereas when I came out to my birth mother, she went quiet for a few days and then said \"I've gone and kissed my friend, I'm a bigger lezzie than you\" which to me felt like she had to do something more drastic to be better than me, but then again shes a toxic person who leeches happiness.",
            "Honestly, that's the sort of reaction I hope for when I come out to someone. No special treatment, no walking on eggshells, no freakouts, just \"yeah, okay, whatever, now as I was saying....\"",
            "Haha. It\u2019s a great reaction and a long term classic story... also, that it\u2019s so easily normalised and not a big deal could be a win. \n\nAnd he gets to tell that story all the time :) and be accepted, etc. Win-win.",
            "You just gave him a great story for the rest of his life",
            "On a certain level it\u2019s actually kind of cool that it didn\u2019t phase you. I initially read it as you being like \u201cyou be you\u201d and that\u2019s okay. But I get that for your kid it was a big deal, and it was good that you went back and gave him the support he deserves. But you still deserve some kudos for not being phased by it.",

            "Honestly, come out should be normalised and it is sad that the whole \"I still love you\" shpiel is required. What you did was perfectly fine but honestly, any reaction but \"Ew burn I hate you\" is fine.",

Now I can finally go to my first gay wedding, you\u2019ll both wear dresses, right? I want to help pick them out, it will be gorgeous!\u2019 \n\nI love her so much <3",
            "I have always told my boys since they have been old enough to understand,  that no matter what, they dont have to hide or worry that I will always love them no matter what.

            "That's how it should be I think.  I think in this day and age when someone's sexuality is a nonissue then their coming out should be more or less \"good for you! now what you want for dinner?\" sort of thing.",

NO ONE. \n\nTbh that was probably the best case scenario for him. \n\nYou're a great mom, and you didn't fuck up. In fact, that you didn't even register as momentous news strikes me as meaning that his sexuality didn't matter to you as long as hes your son.",

But who cares; she certainly doesn\u2019t.\n\nMy lifelong best friend is gay - probably bi yet lives, in the closet with his mum and his Grindr App. He is too frightened to \u2018come out\u2019 for fear of the reaction, despite being a 53 year old single man who lives with his mum.\n\nI promise you, he\u2019s not afraid of not getting a hug from his mum and worried she might not \u2018celebrate\u2019 if he comes out; he\u2019s afraid his family will no longer see him as \u2018normal\u2019 or that he\u2019ll be *different*. He wants \u2018normal\u2019 but worries he won\u2019t be seen as such.\n\nOn the other side of the coin:\n\nThere are some people, however, who view their sexuality as their defining feature. I noticed one respondent to OP who thought it was awful she didn\u2019t make a fuss over her son at this \u2018life changing event\u2019. I also noticed that their username identified them as \u2018The most gay person Ever\u2019 or something like that, maybe coincidence, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\nI can see why being gay, or lesbian or trans or xxx or .... etc. Can become a symbol of pride for some people in a society that is only really beginning to open its eyes and sadly, we do need people to make the statement; \u201cI\u2019m gay and I\u2019m proud...\u201d. But whenever I meet people who are introduced to me as [gender/sexuality] I generally respond with something along the lines of, \u201cand I\u2019m sure there is much more to you/him/her than that and I\u2019m looking forward to finding out.\u201d\n\nFor example, On Friday a staff member came and said, \u201cI thought you\u2019d be interested to know, the new male midday supervisor has a husband.\u201d My response was, \u201cWhy would I care? What\u2019s he like with the kids?\u201d\nFor the very few who have been offended, there generally isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s a shame. That\u2019s not just a \u2018non-binary\u2019 issue. I know men who are so determined to be seen as \u2018macho\u2019 that there\u2019s nothing else to them.\n\n\nFolks, if you are gay, that\u2019s great... or not... most of us now just don\u2019t care.

Consider: You've accepted your kid for who they are, and what they're experiencing. Also consider that your kid felt close enough to you, and confident enough, as an individual, to be free. I've explored my sexuality and it's harrowing to be honest. There's still a lot of stigmas today for a guy even considering another guy. I know I couldn't have because so well rounded, brave, and accomplished without the love, and understanding, of my parents. I've fought like hell with them many a time, especially my dad, but we've formed (and still are forming) a great bond that I will carry forever.",
            "Honestly the best reaction you could have given.\n\nLiterally shows that no matter what you still are his mother, and it didn't even phase you that he came out to you.\n\nalso what pizza did you get",

            "It's different for a lot of people. The fact is it shouldn't be a big deal to come out, but that doesn't mean that it isn't. Even if your parents were gay and you find out you are too there's a ton of things that can go through their head. Some people it takes a lot out of to come out and therefor dismissing it altogether as if it wasn't something that still took courage from the person but you didn't do it on purpose and you did well in any case coming back later",
            "You are an awesome mother :)",
            "You did not f* up at all, you f*ing nailed it. Yeah, being gay is absolutely normal and doesn't always require a big reaction. You clearly love and accept your son. That is what matter the most.",
            "Best reaction possible IMO. Gay? Yeah sure. You\u2019re normal. Do you want pizza? Depends on the person but a celebratory fuss may also not have gone down well.",
            "That would be the kind of reaction I wanna get from my parents. Like it's not a big deal and maybe even expected, just like \"ok, you want pizza for dinner?\"l",
            "Hi, gay! I\u2019m mom\n\nedit: someone already made this joke",
            "Oh do I wish my mom had reacted just like you.",
            "OK, you're gay, that's nice son...I guess that means you want pineapple on your pizza?",
            "tf its normal idk why its made such a big deal out of. he said he gay not an angel.",
            "This is actually a pretty funny story. You seem like a good mom! If I had to guess, this meant the world to your son. You didn\u2019t fuck up at all",
            "PIZZA PARTY TIME",
            "Thought you would say I always knew. I think he knew you kinda knew already.",
            "I did the same thing when my best friend admitted to me hes gay. I had a feeling for a long time. We still best friends",
            "You didn't fuck up. This was easily the best reaction you could give to your kid",
            "Honestly I\u2019d say it\u2019s better than making a big deal, don\u2019t beat yourself up.  You love your son unconditionally, you let him know you don\u2019t love him any less for coming out.  You did good parenting today x",
            "Not a FU. I know this was major to him but I think it\u2019s a good thing that it is becoming normalised in this way.\n\nPeople should never feel anxiety over who they are.",
            "Better if not best reaction than most \ud83d\ude42",
            "No, that was the right response, now you have to follow up with the homosexual birds and the bees talk. If it\u2019s not been had yet bring it up when you have the talk. Otherwise, it\u2019s probably good to tell your son about these things and maybe educate yourself in the process.",
            "Honestly, some people really want that emotionally validating speech but I would have adored it if my parents reacted this way. \u201cOk, when you stop crying let me know what pizza you want.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, it was kinda how my brothers reacted which was excellent.",
            "When I came out to my sister, she didn\u2019t really say anything. I told her later and she said \u201cI know, it\u2019s no big deal\u201d and I would honestly prefer that over the spiel. I think what you said was hilarious!",
            "I actually think that reaction was AWESOME! It showed your son you were completely unphased. It was so insignificant (in a good way) that it didn't stop you in your tracks. I would want my mom to react exactly that way... \"OK.... moving on... this is a non-event\" which is great, because people are afraid of anger, hate, and judgement. You acted just completely normal, like his news was normal, because it's normal. Bravo.",
            "Could be worse. You could have been planning to make sausage or tacos for dinner.",
            "This actually happened to a friend of mine except it was Chinese food lol",
            "You didn't fu at all? I wish that had been my moms reaction rather than her screaming that she loved me because inwas her child but still thought gay marriage was a blasphemy against God. If my kid comes out my reaction would be the same. You dodnt fuck up at all",
            "Honestly as a gay I love those kinda reactions the best.",
            "You\u2019re an awesome mum! This is literally gave your son one of the best coming out reaction stories for him to tell everyone!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",
            "I'm, I think it is the best response, just treating it as something normal and not making a big deal of it.",
            "Honestly I never had a \"come out\" moment it just came up in conversation occasionally that I was pan.  I didn't make a big deal out of it because it wasnt a big deal, and if its a big deal to someone else then they can deal with that on their own.",
            "Honestly, when I came out to my parents as bi they had much the same reaction and it was awesome",
            "That was the right reaction, like, it's no big deal, do you still want pizza for dinner.",
            "You gave home love that is all that really matters.\n\nI think it is more funny then anything . \n\nYou did good",
            "Im happy you were not like my step mothers parents. when They (my step mom is pre transistion mtf on the LGBTQ spectrum) as trans they got molested. By said parents. Thank you for not going that far.",
            "Mom I want extra mushroom",
            "\"so you want a sausage Pizza?\"",
            "I Think That it was the Best reaction. Marking that you love him the same is unnececary if you acctualy do.",
            "This is honestly a beautiful coming out tale. Brava to you for being such a casually accepting parent!",
            "I always figure my response will either be \"Duh.\" or \"Who gives a shit?\"\n\nThen a kiss on the head and back to life.",

            "[removed]",
            "I don't think this counts as a tifu. You have him the most normal reaction And acted like it doesn't change anything and that's exactly what they want.",
            "ok, did you have pizza for dinner?",
            "To be honest I think that should be the normal reaction.  \nA reaction like \"I love you just the same\" just enforces that being gay is strange/different.",
            "I hope one day the stigma will be gone and widely accepted that way nonone has to  come out to anyone.",
            "I absolutely love this!! Totally not a fuck up!! This is an awesome parent moment.",
            "It\u2019s like when you already know what your Christmas presents are. Most of us have a hard time acting surprised.",
            "In a way, that is the perfect reaction.",
            "I've never understood why it's such a big deal anymore. I had a friend over one day, and he paused the game we were playing, and said 'Okay. I have to tell you something, and I hope you're okay with it......... I'm gay.\" Then he just stared at me, like I was supposed to say something back. Honestly, it was a little creepy. I had no idea what I was supposed to say, so I just mumbled \"... makes sense.\" \n\nApparently he was expecting me to react badly because I am a \"gruff, manly man\" (as he put it). I teased him for judging me for a bit, then went on like before. I mean, he didn't know that one of my roommates was a lesbian, and the other one was bi. I, personally, don't care who you prefer the company of, and unless it's me, it's none of my business. Why is this such a hard concept to grasp?",
            "I had a similar reaction to my sister coming out, very much \"Huh, doesn't really change anything\" then continued on as normal.",
            "I think you\u2019ll be on the top contenders list for \u201cparents of the year\u201d honestly, this put a big smile on my face!",
            "\"I'm gay\"\n\n\"Pizza Time\"",
            "Honestly if I ever came out to my mom I'd want it to be like this",
            "Honestly,this is one of the best reactions you can get when coming out. To him,it was just like \"Perfectly normal,and?\"",
            "That is what the reaction should be. It is only a big deal cuz of those that are homophobic, it makes those that are accepting feel the need to shower then with extra love to make up for the hate they will experience, which is wonderful,. Especially because those same jerks are the reason it is so hard for people to come out. In an ideal world where everyone is accepting, it wouldn't be a big deal.",
            "That\u2019s probably a good reaction. I guess it means that you don\u2019t care about his sexual orientation and pizza is a very tasty substance.",
            "To be fair, if you work your ass off and then make the dude pizza afterwards, \"ok\" is a perfectly fine reaction.",
            "I don't think you screwed up. I mean the end goal is to act like it's no different than if your son was straight, so I think you did fine.",
            "I had the same reaction with one of my friends years ago.  He liked it because I made it no big deal.",
            "Fuck it's 2am and now I want pizza",
            "A close friend came out to me years ago.  My response was literally: \"no shit.\"  This huge \"secret\" that was weighing on his mind from the time he decided to tell me until he did just... evaporated.",
            "You didn't mention him actually being upset, though?",
            "I read that as \"after my son came out of me\" and thought OP had just given birth and was very confused while reading this.",
            "Don't feel bad, I'm sure your son was relieved at a non negative reaction. Plus not making a huge deal about it can actually reinforce that the idea that it's normal and ok for him to be gay",
            "Honestly not a bad reaction. My brother came into my room about 8 years ago to tell me he was gay and I burst out laughing, he was really worried about telling people and he said it helped",
            "\"Mom, I'm gay.\"\n\n\"So sausage pizza then?\"",
            "You're  a wonderful mom.",
            "That's the perfect response though. If we want to normalize it and show that we're okay with it we need to say exactly that. Okay. Instead we continue making a huge scene and keep on assuring them that we still love them and Yada Yada Yada which makes it seem like it's special or needs extra attention. Wanna fuck dudes? Fuck dudes. Wanna fuck chicks? Go fuck chicks then. Who cares.",
            "tbh. best reaction possible. it was probably a wave of relief for him to hear you literally not give a single fuck. it's a big confidence booster when you are very worried about something that turns out to be comically trivial.",
            "I read your title and my mind anticipated a story about birth. We both should have taken that extra second to think.",
            "My dad did exactly this when I came out as trans :)",

            "I love it. You'll be laughing about this together for years. Top Mom.",
            "Among reactions that your son could have been fearing, I imagine this was not one of them.  You did great.",
            "Reminds me when i was 13 and had my first period. I am the only girl and have two older brothers. I was at home when it happend and we didn\u2019t have any pads. My mom worked near a supermarket at the time so I gave her a call and asked her if she could take some home with her as I had my first period. She said \u201csure honey\u201d and hung up. 5 minutes later she called me back all happy and gushing \u201cyou have your first period!!!\u201d",
            "\"HI GAY, I'M DAD!\"",

            "that is honestly a great reaction. i wish my parents\ndid the same...i would have loved some pizza",
            "You are a fantastic mumma bear.  It probably took him by Suprise but let's face it,  it's a dam sight better then how some \"parents\" react and hell,  you offered pizza and pizza is yummy.  It will definitely be something you can both laugh about and a inside joke. \n\nWhen my stepdaughter came out to me and her dad my response was \"I already knew my sweet, probably knew before you did lol\" but followed it up with doing a silly happy dance.",
            "I love this reaction. Its a perfectly normal thing so shouldnt be a big deal.\n\nWhat kind of pizza did you ahve is the real question",
            "A good follow up might be, \"I'm proud of you for having the courage to say it out loud, but a parent can sometimes tell with these things, I already knew and I love you for who you are.\" Your reaction was perfect. The \"F'd Up\" reaction would have been to flip out, or act shocked and say nothing.",

Ten goddamn minutes ago, I found out that a worldview I've held my entire life is, in fact, not true, and apparently I'm just a weirdo.\n\nYou see, whenever I exercise, something goes haywire in my brain that spikes my libido to something ridiculous. Think Jekyll and Hyde. That's weird for me to type, because my entire life I thought that was *everyone.* I legitimately thought that was just a common thing: people exercise, and as a result get turned on.\n\nAnd you know what, in my defense how could I not. What are workout ads if not \"grr sweat lookat this sweaty sexy body grr,\" and like 30% of all porn involving women in their 30's (which is like 90% of my porn) can be summed up with \"hey you know what goes great with pilates? penis.\" I thought you people were like me, who legitimately got turned on through exercise, because why else would you advertise it like that and have so many euphemisms? Dafuq is wrong with you? But apparently I was just dropped on my head too many times as a child or something.\n\nFuck. Now this is a FUCK UP because as I'm typing this in real time, I'm remembering all the times in my life I've tried to incorporate cardio into foreplay. No, you idiot, not like \"hur dur lets do planks in bed before we blast our triceps,\" but christ, ugh this hurts so damn much to type now that I know it's *all a lie* but shit like getting bootycalls and responding with shit like \"mhm lemme do a quick workout first\" OH GOD I'm realizing how fucking stupid that is if there's no context WHY DIDNT ANY OF YOU TELL ME THIS. I THOUGHT SHE UNDERSTOOD AND WAS ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH BUT INSTEAD I WAS THE FUCKING FOOL WHO WAS DOING SQUATS IN THE GYM BEFORE SEX. DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I DID THAT SHIT THINKING THEY WORKED THE SAME WAY AND EXERCISE ALSO GOT THE BLOOD FLOWING AND WAS THE MOTHER OF APHRODISIACS AND\n\nOh god. Oh god oh FUCK. ink;efwerioj'ewij'oderwo'ijerfij'eruhotrijepr I'VE TOLD THEM TO WORK OUT BEFORE TOO. Oh my good Jesus Christ I\n\nI can't believe I did that. Oh my god save me I didn't know. I LITERALLY TOLD GIRLS I WAS WITH, thinking in my STUPID BRAIN, my STUPID STUPID BRAIN, that it would be hot if they worked out beforehand. *I told them they should work out more.*\n\nWhat the fuck was I doing I'm literally melting in horror here right now. I'm remembering it all; I literally thought it would do the same thing to them as it did to me, make the sex better, make everything better, but instead, INFUCKINGSTEAD I'm the goddamn JACKASS who probably came across as 'HUR DUR TONE UR ABS BEFORE HAVING SEX WITH ME' or some nightmarish nonsense. Like some hellish dudebro straight from the bowels of the foulest yacht club fraternity. FUCK. How the FUCK did they put up with that. How the FUCK do I apologize for that, because what the fuck am I going to do just call them up and be like \"hehe hey yeah Angie I know it's been five years since we've talked and I know you're in a lovely relationship but I wanted to tell you those times I tried to get us to go on a jog before sex wasn't because I thought you were fat but because apparently something's wrong with my brain.\"\n\nNo. No, I can't do that, I have to live with that. For the rest of my life, my goddamn life I have to live with that. Why didn't you tell me. Why didn't any of you tell me. All the 'workout euphemisms' I've used with girlfriends. Oh god their blank stares make sense now. Fifteen years of dating, fifteen years of blank stares. It all makes sense now. It all makes sense.\n\nOh god. oh fuck.\n\nTL;DR\n\nChrist. Something is odd with my brain in that exercise of any form spikes my libido, and from workout ads, euphemisms, etc, I believed everyone on earth worked the same way. So I've incorporated that into my relationships and flings, like a goddamn idiot, my entire life, much to their confusion. No one corrected me. Found out just now that no, it doesn't work like that.\n\n*Edit: I\u2019ll respond to these comments later, I\u2019ve got some... apologies to make first. Not sure how I\u2019m going to go about \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I made us jog before sex\u201d sound sincere, but I\u2019ll think of something.*  \n\n\n*Update: Apologized to an ex I'm still close with about this, she thought it was the funniest thing ever. Apparently she just thought I was 'super into my body,' like an egomaniac. Which is...... better? I dunno, glad I closed that up but don't think I'll message the exes I'm not on good terms with; that would be too dumb to just casually bring up after five years of not talking.* ",

This was my first-ever boyfriend and he turned out to be a piece of crap, so I was obviously a bit hesitant. But some old friends from high school were visiting my town and asked if I wanted to go on a bar crawl with them and I figured fuck it, it's not like anything will happen (other than getting drunk with some pals), so why not? \n\nAt the first bar we run into a group of guys from my University. I had seen some of them around but never spoke to them before. One of my friends decides she's going to force me to \"get out of my shell\" and drags our group over to talk with them. I'm EXTREMELY quiet (like... weirdly quiet to most people) so I end up sitting in the corner of our booth and not saying anything, just drinking and feeling awkward. Well, one of the guys in the other group (let's call him Adam) is also being weirdly quiet. So my friends and his friends, who are already tipsy, decide to make things as awkward as possible by making us play truth or dare--except we have to drink when we don't want to answer something. \n\nThere are a lot of personal/sexual questions neither of us want to answer, so we end up drinking quite a bit. And by the time we're done the first bar, Adam and I are on a whole different plane of existence from everyone else. And it turned out we had a lot in common, and he was pretty cute, and we're goofing around and laughing the whole time. I started to get butterflies in my stomach, and not just from the alcohol. Adam has my exact sense of humour and is really sweet and kind. We wander off and start having deep drunk conversations about feeling left out of things and how annoying it is when people say shit like \"Can they speak?\" I tell him I'm walking home and he offers to walk with me. I know where this is going but I'm drunk enough that I don't feel nervous, plus I feel like I have a genuine connection with this guy. Our friends are wolf-whistling as we leave and instead of being embarassed, I feel weirdly proud. \n\nSo we get to my place, talk and smoke for a bit, and do the deed. I wake up earlier than him and decide I'm going to make a nice breakfast. I want to impress him and show him I like him, and everyone likes a good breakfast when they have a hangover, right? So I sneak out of bed and make scrambled eggs, french toast, and sausage. I prefer almond milk so I use that for the eggs and french toast. He wakes up and tells me I look just as cute sober. At this point I'm convinced he's the love of my life. He sees the breakfast and gets excited and I'm like yes! My plan worked! I'm going to get to his heart through his stomach! \n\nWe eat and everything's going great for a few bites. Then he makes a weird face and clears his throat. His eyes start to widen and he asks me what if there were nuts in the bread or something. I say no, but I used almond milk. He jumps out of his chair and says \"CALL AN AMBULANCE RIGHT. NOW.\" I'm freaking the fuck out. He's wheezing and stuff and looks absolutely panicked. I ask if he has an epipen and he shakes his head no. So I call an ambulance and tell them he's having an allergic reaction and paramedics come and haul him off. \n\nThis happened last weekend. I have not heard back from him since. I found his buddy and confirmed he is not dead. I guess accidentally triggering a severe allergic reaction does not lead to romance. \n\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my romantic interest by cooking for him. He went into anaphylaxis and no longer wants to speak to me.",

The fact that he woke up and complimented you instead of trying to sneak out the back door in the middle of the night shows that he is into you, as well.  \n\nOkay, you almost killed the dude.  That's a fair point.  \nAs a person who once had this experience while going through allergy shots, I can tell you it's not fun.  I personally don't have the panic gene, so I just kinda raised my hand at the clinic, and got help.  I was on my feet in about 30 minutes, and even though I had to skip out on work for the day, I was otherwise back to normal the next day.  \n\nMost dudes get over stuff pretty quickly.  If my wife accidentally did something like this to me(I am only allergic to Penicillin, that I know of), I absolutely would not blame her.  I would just roll with the punches, get through it, and get back to being happy.  No harm, no foul. \n\nTake the fact that you did not know he had an allergy into consideration.  How could you have known?  Also consider that you already established that he was super shy, like yourself.  He's probably at home, wondering how to even broach this subject to you, and has no clue where to start.  \n\nIf you want this to happen, you may have to be the initiator.  \n\nDon't let a silly thing like almost killing a man stop you from living a possible happy life with a man you clearly had some sort of connection with. /s \nI'm saying it in a joking manner, but I'm actually very serious.  Hell, offer to pay some of the ambulance fees.  Tell him you want to try again, and this time, breakfast will turn out better!  Joke about it if you can, it will ease the tension.\n\n\nGood luck!",

        "selftext": "I have grapheme-color synesthesia. Basically I see letters and numbers in colors. The letter 'E' being green for example. A couple months ago I was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. He asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. Since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what I said a few months ago. Always being the sameish as course. He still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe I just memeroized them really really well.\n\nTonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head. I asked him what colour are the letters in his head. He looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in \"my head, that's not a thing\" \n\nMy boyfriend didnt understand what I meant by visualizing the letters. He didn't believe me that I can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. \n\nTurns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. When he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. He can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. He thought it was just an expression to say \"picture this\" or etc... Its crazy to him the fact that I can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.\n\nNow I have a boyfriend that is really upset. He feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. He's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing I wasnt pulling his chain. Hes pretty upset and I feel really bad. \n\nTldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (Cant visualize anything at all)\n\nEdit; Oh wow this blew up. I just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. He never thought I was lying. I think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",

            "I can't wrap my mind around having aphantasia. I really want to, but like, what happens when you think of something? Literally anything! I always \"see\" what I'm thinking of, in almost every situation. It's how I solve problems and use critical thinking. How do you \"think\" without \"seeing?\" Like if I tell you to think of your house or your apartment, do you not see it in your head? Could you not walk through your entire house in your head, as if you were actually doing so?  If not, what are you thinking of? The idea of your house or apartment?\" Just like \"Hmm yes, I do have a house/apartment.\" Is that what it's limited to? If I tell you to think of \"blue,\" do you not see blue? What happens when you daydream? Do you daydream? Are your thoughts limited to abstraction? Could you see even your significant other's face? I really wish I could understand how thought processes work with aphasntasia. It sounds fascinating, but also terrible. I just can't understand even being able to think about something without seeing it in my head.",

            "Is there a surefire way to know if you have aphantasia? I'll try to put my question in the simplest terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do not have aphantasia, are you able to imagine an apple right in front of you? Like, it has all qualities of an apple, excluding touch and smell, of course(similar to a hologram or vr, or maybe a construction game like the sims or bridge connector)? or is it just a thought, in a way? Similar to that of the voice you use in your head? Is it like, a think you think of and can describe, but can't see? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just asking this cause I *think* I might have aphantasia. I'm just confused, to be honest, cause all I think of when I try to imagine an apple is what defines an apple, and how it acts. I can think of how fast it would slide down a slope and how many pieces it can explode into, but not how it rolls or the specific fissures that appear when it hits the ground. I'm just confused tbh. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I've been rambling, and just being young and dumb. Any description and definition of \"imagine\" would be greatly appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nIs imagining something similar to that of seeing in a VR headset? Or is it just a thought, similar to that of speaking in your mind?",

Seriously pissed.  \n\n\nI've read that it's something like 1/3 of people who don't see anything at all and the other 2/3 see to varying degrees.  Your boyfriend might be interested to know that there are exercises you can do to help.  I've been at it for a few weeks off and on and can now see eyes.   So that's weird.
